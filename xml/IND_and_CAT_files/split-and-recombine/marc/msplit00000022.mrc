One method to achieve this is through specific and temporally regulated modification of proteins in order to alter structure and function. Post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins is known to have wide-ranging and substantial effects on cellular function, both as part of signalling network modulation and more directly by modifying the function of key proteins. In this study, we show that PTM regulation is differentially targeted at different areas of the proteome, and that cytoskeletal proteins involved in neuronal process extension and maintenance are both more heavily modified and more frequently regulated at a PTM level. This suggests a clear role not only for PTMs in these processes, but possibly also for heavy protein modification in general.This study provides one of the most comprehensive sets of individual PTM site regulation data for mammalian brain tissue. This will provide a valuable resource for those wishing to perform comparisons or meta-analyses of large scale PTMomic data, as are becoming increasingly common. Furthermore, being focussed on protein-level events, this study also provides significant insight into detailed roles for individual modified proteins in the developing brain, helping to advance the understanding of the complex protein-driven processes that underlie development. Finally, the use of a novel bioinformatic analytical tool provides information regarding aspects of the PTMome which are not normally examined, and illuminates the role of PTMs on a more detailed, protein-centric and site-specific level in a biological context. The widespread yet uneven distributions observed will be relevant to those readers with an interest in the mechanisms of distribution of PTMS and their functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3abrain 3acytoskeletal proteins 3amammals 3ameta-analysis 3aneurons 3apost-translational modification 3aproteome 0aHMP 0aMARCKS 0aMAP 0aNCAM 0aNFH 0aNP 0aPTM 0aPost-translational modification 0aBrain 0aProtein 0aDevelopment1 aSchwämmle, Veit1 aLarsen, Martin R.0 tJournal of proteomics.g2014 Apr. 14, v. 101 p.77-87dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2014.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245017400207300001600381520101700397592002801414596006701442650001801509650001401527650001001541650002101551650001501572650001701587650001401604650001601618650001901634650002001653650001301673700006101686700006001747700006001807700001901867700002001886700005701906700006201963700005902025700002002084700002202104700006102126773012902187856008202316852000902398655001202407IND60744275620221119020306.0210712e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074427562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-021-01885-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNespoli, Davide1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5718-537110aDisentangling the taxonomic status and phylogeographic structure of Marmora’s (Curruca sarda) and Balearic Warbler (Curruca balearica): a genetic multi-marker approach  ap. 909-918.  aMarmora’s Warbler (Curruca sarda) and Balearic Warbler (C. balearica) are allopatric sibling species and were recently split mostly based on morphological and ethological characteristics. Here we provide the first phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses of this species complex to support the taxonomic status of C. sarda and C. balearica in light of integrative taxonomy. We sampled the two taxa in most of their breeding ranges and we sequenced three mitochondrial and one nuclear gene region. All C. balearica individuals had private haplotypes for the four markers and formed monophyletic clades. Genetic distances between the two taxa were comparable with those found between other species belonging to the Curruca genus. Furthermore, most of the genetic variance was expressed at the interspecific level, rather than between different populations within taxa or between individuals within populations. Our results strongly support the current taxonomic status of these two warblers as distinct species.  aPublisher supplied data  aRicerca localecUniversità degli Studi del Piemonte Orientale 3aPasseriformes 3aallopatry 3agenes 3agenetic variance 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondria 3amonophyly 3aornithology 3aphylogeography 3asibling species 3ataxonomy1 aPellegrino, Irene1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5683-35761 aGalaverni, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2648-15061 aCaniglia, Romolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3641-94901 aSunyer, Joseph1 aMengoni, Chiara1 aRandi, Ettore1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4882-65951 aGalimberti, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6883-73551 aRubolini, Diego1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2703-57831 aSpina, Fernando1 aGargallo, Gabriel1 aBrambilla, Mattia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7643-46520 tJournal of ornithology.g2021 July, v. 162, no. 3 p.909-918dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-021-01885-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245013600187300001800323520123600341592002801577650002201605650002101627650001301648650001901661650001101680650001001691650001001701650002801711650001201739650002201751650000701773650001601780650002901796650003401825650003401859650002301893650002001916650003101936650003401967650002202001700001602023700002002039700001402059700001702073700001502090700001802105700001602123700001902139773011602158856008102274852000902355655001202364IND50073480620221120201522.0150213e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007348062DNAL7 a242181832pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-013-0614-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Zheng-Bing10aMolecular Cloning, Characterization, and Dye-Decolorizing Ability of a Temperature- and pH-Stable Laccase from Bacillus subtilis X1  ap. 1147-1157.  aLaccases from fungal origin are typically unstable at high temperatures and alkaline conditions. This characteristic limits their practical applications. In this study, a new bacterial strain exhibiting laccase activity was isolated from raw fennel honey samples and identified as Bacillus subtilis X1. The CotA-laccase gene was cloned from strain X1 and efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli in a biologically active form. The purified recombinant laccase demonstrated an extensive pH range for catalyzing substrates and high stability toward alkaline pH and high temperatures. No loss of laccase activity was observed at pH 9.0 after 10 days of incubation, and approximately 21 % of the initial activity was detected after 10 h at 80 °C. Two anthraquinonic dyes (reactive blue 4 and reactive yellow brown) and two azo dyes (reactive red 11 and reactive brilliant orange) could be partially decolorized by purified laccase in the absence of a mediator. The decolorization process was efficiently promoted when methylsyringate was present, with more than 90 % of color removal occurring in 3 h at pH 7.0 or 9.0. These unusual properties indicated a high potential of the novel CotA-laccase for industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aazo dyes 3adecolorization 3afennel 3agenes 3ahoney 3aindustrial applications 3alaccase 3amolecular cloning 3apH 3atemperature 2aAzo Compoundsxchemistry 2aBacillus subtilisxenzymology 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCloning, Molecular 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLaccasexchemistryxgenetics. 2aProtein Stability1 aZhang, Ning1 aSong, Chen-Meng1 aZhou, Wen1 aZhou, Lin-Xi1 aZhao, Hong1 aXu, Cheng-Wen1 aCai, Yu-Jie1 aLiao, Xiang-Ru0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2014 Feb., v. 172, no. 3 p.1147-1157dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-013-0614-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245007200177300001600249520115300265592002801418650002001446650001701466650002101483650002101504650002701525650001501552650001401567650000901581650004301590650001001633650001901643650001601662650001101678653001401689653001601703653001701719653001301736653002101749653000801770700001901778700002201797700002301819700002001842773010201862856008701964852000902051655001202060IND60539214920221123034430.0190214e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053921492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertoldo, Michael J.10aEffect of metformin on the fertilizing ability of mouse spermatozoa  ap. 262-268.  aNumerous antioxidants have been added to cryopreservation media with varied success. The biguanide, metformin, commonly used for the treatment of type II diabetes, possesses properties impacting metabolism control that have not been yet assessed in cryopreservation protocols. The aim of this experiment was to; (i) determine the effect of metformin on fresh spermatozoa properties; and (ii) to assess positive or negative effects of metformin in post-thaw function and fertilizing capacity of mouse spermatozoa when used in cryopreservation media. The experiments have shown that the presence of metformin in fresh semen did not induce negative effects on spermatozoa quality, except a slight reduction in sperm motility at 5000μM metformin. However, when metformin was included in a cryopreservation protocol, an improvement in the fertilization rate and a reduction in the percentage of abnormal zygotes after in vitro fertilization was observed. In conclusion, metformin did not affect sperm quality at low concentrations (50μM), but its presence in the cryopreservation media could represent a benefit to improve the quality of frozen semen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidants 3acryopreservation 3afertilizer rates 3ain vitro fertilization 3ametabolism 3ametformin 3amice 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3asemen 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3azygote 0aMetformin 0aMouse sperm 0aAnti-oxidant 0aMotility 0aCryopreservation 0aIVF1 aGuibert, Edith1 aTartarin, Pauline1 aGuillory, Vanaique1 aFroment, Pascal0 tCryobiology.g2014 Apr., v. 68, no. 2 p.262-268dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245013100174300001600305500001500321520190400336592002802240650001002268650001802278650002202296650001002318650001202328650003102340650001102371650002402382650001702406650000902423650002202432650001502454650002402469650001402493653002202507653001802529653002302547653002602570653001902596653001302615700001802628700002002646700001902666700002602685700005802711773009102769856008302860852000902943655001202952IND60554664020221119004847.0161024e20140414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055466402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2014.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñoz-Antoli, Carla10aDifferential expression and glycosylation of proteins in the rat ileal epithelium in response to Echinostoma caproni infection  ap. 169-178.  a2019-12-06  aEchinostoma caproni (Trematoda: Echinostomatidae) is an intestinal trematode that has been used as experimental model to investigate the factors determining the expulsion of intestinal helminths. We analyze the changes in the protein expression and glycosylation induced by E. caproni in Wistar rat, a host of low compatibility in which the parasites are rapidly rejected. To determine the changes in protein expression, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis was employed using protein extracts from the intestine of naïve and infected rats. The patterns of glycosylation were analyzed by lectin blotting. Those spots showing differential expression or glycosylation were analyzed by mass spectrometry. A total of 33 protein spots differentially expressed were identified (26 were found to be over-expressed and 7 down-regulated). Moreover, E. caproni induced changes in the glycosylation status of 8 proteins that were successfully identified. Most of these proteins were related to the cytoskeleton and the maintenance of the functional integrity of the ileal epithelium. This suggests that the regeneration of the intestinal tissue is a major effector mechanism responsible for the early expulsion of this helminth. Furthermore, several proteins involved in the energy metabolism were also altered in the ileum of rats as a consequence of the E. caproni infection.Our analysis provides essential new insights in the factors determining the natural expulsion of intestinal parasitic helminths from their hosts. The results obtained contribute to a better understanding of the effective mechanisms involved in the defense against the intestinal helminths. The identification of proteins in the intestine that become modified in their expression or glycosylation in hosts in which the parasite is rapidly rejected may serve for the development of tools for the control of these infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aileum 3aglycosylation 3aenergy metabolism 3ahosts 3alectins 3agene expression regulation 3amodels 3aEchinostoma caproni 3acytoskeleton 3arats 3amass spectrometry 3aepithelium 3agel electrophoresis 3ahelminths 0aprotein synthesis 0aRat intestine 0aProtein expression 0aProtein glycosylation 0aWorm expulsion 0aHelminth1 aCortés, Alba1 aSotillo, Javier1 aFried, Bernard1 aEsteban, J.

Thus, the object of this study was to produce nano-encapsulated fish oil in nano-liposomes to investigate the effect of the addition of 0.0 (control), and 5% (w/w) nano-encapsulated fish oil on the technological and sensory quality of fortified bread. Physical properties and oxidative stability of fish oil nano-liposomes at 25 days in refrigerated condition were determined. The nano-capsules were characterized by their encapsulation efficiency and particle size distributions. Our results revealed a particle size of about 339.2 nm and a Polydispersity Index of 0.426. The nano-encapsulation efficiency of fish oil incorporated in nano-liposomes was measured as 90.12 ± 0.27%. Nano-encapsulated fish oil showed a better oxidative stability against lipid oxidation in comparison with free (unencapsulated) fish oil. The technological and sensory evaluation indicated that enriched bread with nano-liposomal fish oil had a higher loaf volume of bread than other samples. The addition of nano-liposomal fish oil had no negative effect on bread textural quality and sensory acceptability. So, using of nano-liposomal fish oil as an effective additive for improvement of the nutritional value of bread and its application is suggested for production of other bakery products.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreads 3aencapsulation 3afish oils 3afortified foods 3alipid peroxidation 3aloaves 3along chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 3anutritive value 3aodors 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3asensory evaluation1 aHasani, Shirin0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2018 June, v. 12, no. 2 p.1084-1092dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-018-9724-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01883naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009100171300001600262520084000278592002801118650001501146650001301161650001201174650001101186650001701197653001701214653002101231653001501252653002101267700002201288700002901310773009801339856008701437852000901524655001201533IND60623679220221119174728.0190203e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062367922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshley, Thomas10aHeliostat field cleaning scheduling for Solar Power Tower plants: A heuristic approach  ap. 653-660.  aSoiling of heliostat surfaces due to local climate has a direct impact on their optical efficiency and therefore a direct impact on the productivity of the Solar Power Tower plant. Cleaning techniques applied are dependent on plant construction and current schedules are normally developed considering heliostat layout patterns, providing sub-optimal results. In this paper, a method to optimise cleaning schedules is developed, with the objective of maximising energy generated by the plant. First, an algorithm finds a cleaning schedule by solving an integer program, which is then used as a starting solution in an exchange heuristic. Since the optimisation problems are of large size, a p-median type heuristic is performed to reduce the problem dimensionality by clustering heliostats into groups to be cleaned in the same period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acleaning 3aclimate 3aenergy 3asolar energy 0aSolar energy 0aRouting problems 0aScheduling 0aCluster analysis1 aCarrizosa, Emilio1 aFernández-Cara, Enrique0 tApplied energy.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 235 p.653-660dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245010700173300001600280520128700296592002801583650002201611650001001633650002101643650002001664650002001684650001301704650000901717650001301726650001001739650002101749650002301770650002001793650002001813650001001833650002001843650001301863650001601876650001401892653001901906653001801925653002101943700001901964700001801983700002002001700002002021773010202041856008702143852000902230655001202239IND60539215120221121211306.0190214e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053921512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalmani, Hossein10aIn vitro assessment of soybean lecithin and egg yolk based diluents for cryopreservation of goat semen  ap. 276-280.  aSoybean lecithin is a suitable plant-based cryoprotectant for freezing ruminant sperm. Optimum level of lecithin was not clear for goat semen cryopreservation. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different levels of soybean lecithin in semen extender on post-thaw sperm quality including CASA-motion parameters, viability, plasma membrane integrity and lipid peroxidation. Semen samples were collected from 4 Mahabadi bucks using an artificial vagina. Different concentrations of soy lecithin (SL, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2% and 2.5% w/v) were compared to 15% (v/v) egg yolk-based extender (TR-EY). No significant difference was observed for sperm progressive motility, viability or plasma membrane integrity in 1.5% SL media (33.8%, 66%, and 62.7%, respectively) and TR-EY medium (35.4%, 67.2%, and 64.9%, respectively). Sperm motion characteristics (VAP, VSL, VCL, ALH and LIN) and rapid spermatozoa were improved with extender containing 1% and 1.5% SL, compared to TR-EY extender. Furthermore, egg yolk produced significantly higher malondialdehyde (4.02±0.21) than other groups. Results suggest that the optimal lecithin concentration in the semen extender was 1.5% and also soy lecithin can substitute for egg yolk during cryopreservation for caprine sperm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial vagina 3abucks 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3aegg substitutes 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3afreezing 3agoats 3ain vitro studies 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3aplasma membrane 3asemen 3asemen extenders 3asoybeans 3aspermatozoa 3aviability 0aCryoprotectant 0aCaprine sperm 0aSoybean lecithin1 aTowhidi, Armin1 aZhandi, Mahdi1 aBahreini, Majid1 aSharafi, Mohsen0 tCryobiology.g2014 Apr., v. 68, no. 2 p.276-280dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245015300163300001400316520180100330592002802131650002002159650001902179650001102198650001702209650001002226650001402236650001302250650002402263650000902287650001502296650001302311650002702324650001302351650001502364650001202379653001902391653002102410653003302431653003002464700002602494700002902520700002102549700002002570700002602590700002102616700002902637773008902666856008302755852000902838655001202847IND60554664120221119004928.0161024e20140613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055466412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2014.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButs, Kim10aImproving the identification rate of data independent label-free quantitative proteomics experiments on non-model crops: A case study on apple fruit  ap. 31-45.  aComplex peptide extracts from non-model crops are troublesome for proper identification and quantification. To increase the identification rate of label free DIA experiments of Braeburn apple a new workflow was developed where a DDA database was constructed and linked to the DIA data. At a first level, parent masses found in DIA were searched in the DDA database based on their mass to charge ratio and retention time; at a second level, masses of fragmentation ions were compared for each of the linked spectrum. Following this workflow, a tenfold increase of peptides was identified from a single DIA run. As proof of principle, the designed workflow was applied to determine the changes during a storage experiment, achieving a two-fold identification increase in the number of significant peptides. The corresponding protein families were divided into nine clusters, representing different time profiles of changes in abundances during storage. Up-regulated protein families already show a glimpse of important pathways affecting aging during long-term storage, such as ethylene synthesis, and responses to abiotic stresses and their influence on the central metabolism.Proteomics research on non-model crops causes additional difficulties in identifying the peptides present in, often complex, samples. This work proposes a new workflow to retrieve more identifications from a set of quantitative data, based on linking DIA and DDA data at two consecutive levels. As proof of principle, a storage experiment on Braeburn apple resulted in twice as much identified storage related peptides. Important proteins involved in central metabolism and stress are significantly up-regulated after long term storage.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteomics of non-model organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aabiotic stress 3aapples 3acase studies 3acrops 3adatabases 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3aions 3ametabolism 3apeptides 3apostharvest physiology 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3astorage 0aNon-model crop 0aPlant proteomics 0aData independent acquisition 0aLabel free quantification1 aMichielssens, Servaas1 aHertog, Maarten L.A.T.M.1 aHayakawa, Eisuke1 aCordewener, Jan1 aAmerica, Antoine H.P.1 aNicolai, Bart M.1 aCarpentier, Sebastien C.0 tJournal of proteomics.g2014 June 13, v. 105 p.31-45dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2014.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245016400208300001800372500002000390506007600410520164900486592002802135506003702163650002002200650001802220650002202238650002002260650001102280650001702291650001702308650002202325650001102347650001902358650003502377700002602412773011102438856007902549852000902628655001202637IND60586817420221207142702.0171214e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058681742DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.126862doi7 aPMC57244832pmcid7 a284492632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Alexander T.10amulti‐dice: r package for comparative population genomic inference under hierarchical co‐demographic models of independent single‐population size changes  ap. e212-e224.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPopulation genetic data from multiple taxa can address comparative phylogeographic questions about community‐scale response to environmental shifts, and a useful strategy to this end is to employ hierarchical co‐demographic models that directly test multi‐taxa hypotheses within a single, unified analysis. This approach has been applied to classical phylogeographic data sets such as mitochondrial barcodes as well as reduced‐genome polymorphism data sets that can yield 10,000s of SNPs, produced by emergent technologies such as RAD‐seq and GBS. A strategy for the latter had been accomplished by adapting the site frequency spectrum to a novel summarization of population genomic data across multiple taxa called the aggregate site frequency spectrum (aSFS), which potentially can be deployed under various inferential frameworks including approximate Bayesian computation, random forest and composite likelihood optimization. Here, we introduce the r package multi‐dice, a wrapper program that exploits existing simulation software for flexible execution of hierarchical model‐based inference using the aSFS, which is derived from reduced genome data, as well as mitochondrial data. We validate several novel software features such as applying alternative inferential frameworks, enforcing a minimal threshold of time surrounding co‐demographic pulses and specifying flexible hyperprior distributions. In sum, multi‐dice provides comparative analysis within the familiar R environment while allowing a high degree of user customization, and will thus serve as a tool for comparative phylogeography and population genomics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3aDNA barcoding 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3agenome 3ametagenomics 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amodels 3aphylogeography 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aHickerson, Michael J.0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2017 Nov., v. 17, no. 6 p.e212-e224dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.126863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245009100168300001800259500002000277520163500297592002801932650000801960650002401968650001201992650001902004650002002023650001402043650002002057650001302077650001902090650002102109650002202130650002902152650001902181650001502200650002702215650002502242650003502267650002502302650001402327700001902341773011102360856007902471852000902550655001202559IND60586817520221118182253.0171214e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058681752DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.126572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGompert, Zachariah10aDetection of individual ploidy levels with genotyping‐by‐sequencing (GBS) analysis  ap. 1156-1167.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPloidy levels sometimes vary among individuals or populations, particularly in plants. When such variation exists, accurate determination of cytotype can inform studies of ecology or trait variation and is required for population genetic analyses. Here, we propose and evaluate a statistical approach for distinguishing low‐level ploidy variants (e.g. diploids, triploids and tetraploids) based on genotyping‐by‐sequencing (GBS) data. The method infers cytotypes based on observed heterozygosity and the ratio of DNA sequences containing different alleles at thousands of heterozygous SNPs (i.e. allelic ratios). Whereas the method does not require prior information on ploidy, a reference set of samples with known ploidy can be included in the analysis if it is available. We explore the power and limitations of this method using simulated data sets and GBS data from natural populations of aspen (Populus tremuloides) known to include both diploid and triploid individuals. The proposed method was able to reliably discriminate among diploids, triploids and tetraploids in simulated data sets, and this was true for different levels of genetic diversity, inbreeding and population structure. Power and accuracy were minimally affected by low coverage (i.e. 2×), but did sometimes suffer when simulated mixtures of diploids, autotetraploids and allotetraploids were analysed. Cytotype assignments based on the proposed method closely matched those from previous microsatellite and flow cytometry data when applied to GBS data from aspen. An R package (gbs2ploidy) implementing the proposed method is available from CRAN.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aalleles 3aallopolyploidy 3aautotetraploidy 3acytotypes 3adata collection 3adiploidy 3aflow cytometry 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping by sequencing 3aheterozygosity 3ainbreeding 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astatistical analysis 3atriploidy1 aMock, Karen E.0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2017 Nov., v. 17, no. 6 p.1156-1167dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.126573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01156naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001400138245009600152300001800248520019900266592002800465650001400493650002300507650001300530650000900543650000900552650001600561700001800577700001300595700001200608773012900620856007200749852000900821655001200830IND60657750720221121233730.0190816e20051129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065775072DNAL7 a10.1039/b512184a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Rui10aCollagen fiber immobilized Fe(iii): a novel catalyst for photo-assisted degradation of dyes  ap. 5882-5884.  aA novel catalyst for the Fenton reaction was prepared by immobilizing Fe(iii) onto collagen fiber and its high activity as a catalyst for degradation of dyes under irradiation of UVC was proved.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3achemical reactions 3acollagen 3adyes 3airon 3airradiation1 aLiao, Xue-Pin1 aLiu, Xin1 aShi, Bi0 tChemical communications.g2005 Nov. 29, , no. 47 p.5882-5884dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b512184a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002600158245009300184300001800277520153400295592002801829650002601857650001901883650002001902650001101922650001301933650001801946650002501964650002501989650001802014650002402032650003702056650001902093650003302112650003402145650001302179650001802192650002002210650003602230700001902266700001802285700002302303700002402326773009602350856004002446852000902486655001202495IND50075019720221122111205.0140410e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007501972DNAL7 a246119682pmid7 a10.1111/mec.127052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a Villemereuil, Pierre10aGenome scan methods against more complex models: when and how much should we trust them?  ap. 2006-2019.  aThe recent availability of next‐generation sequencing (NGS) has made possible the use of dense genetic markers to identify regions of the genome that may be under the influence of selection. Several statistical methods have been developed recently for this purpose. Here, we present the results of an individual‐based simulation study investigating the power and error rate of popular or recent genome scan methods: linear regression, Bayescan, BayEnv and LFMM. Contrary to previous studies, we focus on complex, hierarchical population structure and on polygenic selection. Additionally, we use a false discovery rate (FDR)‐based framework, which provides an unified testing framework across frequentist and Bayesian methods. Finally, we investigate the influence of population allele frequencies versus individual genotype data specification for LFMM and the linear regression. The relative ranking between the methods is impacted by the consideration of polygenic selection, compared to a monogenic scenario. For strongly hierarchical scenarios with confounding effects between demography and environmental variables, the power of the methods can be very low. Except for one scenario, Bayescan exhibited moderate power and error rate. BayEnv performance was good under nonhierarchical scenarios, while LFMM provided the best compromise between power and error rate across scenarios. We found that it is possible to greatly reduce error rates by considering the results of all three methods when identifying outlier loci.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental factors 3agene frequency 3agenetic markers 3agenome 3agenotype 3alinear models 3apopulation structure 3astatistical analysis 2aBayes Theorem 2aComputer Simulation 2aData Interpretation, Statistical 2aGene Frequency 2aGene-Environment Interaction 2aGenetics, Populationxmethods 2aGenotype 2aLinear Models 2aModels, Genetic 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide1 aFrichot, Éric1 aBazin, Éric,1 aFrançois, Olivier1 aGaggiotti, Oscar E.0 tMolecular ecology.g2014 Apr., v. 23, no. 8 p.2006-2019dBlackwell Sciencex0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.12705  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013600164300001800300520146300318592002801781650001201809650001101821650001301832650001401845650001301859650001201872650001101884650002601895650001701921650001201938650001601950650001401966700002101980773013402001856008202135852000902217655001202226IND60593572720221118204630.0210207e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059357272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-018-9723-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevent, Okan10aEffect of processing parameters on some physicochemical properties, sugar profile and rheological characterization of apricot sauce  ap. 1072-1083.  aIn this study, effects of processing parameters including blanching temperature, time and sieve diameter on some physicochemical and rheological properties and sugar profile of apricot sauce were investigated. Eight apricot sauce samples were manufactured at different blanching temperatures (85 and 95 °C), blanching times (5 and 10 min) and sieve diameters (1 and 3 mm). The sauce samples were stored at + 4 °C for 60 days and analyses were performed at intervals of 15 days. It was observed that the processing variables and storage period affected the properties of samples significantly (p < 0.05). Acidity decreased significantly at the end of the storage and soluble and total dry matters did not show a significant change by the change of processing variables. The L* and b* values of the apple sauce decreased while the a* value increased during the storage. Sucrose was determined to be major sugar component in the samples. Blanching temperature and time affected the levels of glucose, sucrose and fructose negatively. Apricot sauce samples showed non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior having lower flow behavior index than unity. Apparent viscosity, viscous modulus and elastic modulus values of the samples decreased with the increase of blanching temperature and time while these values increased with the increase of sieve diameter. Herschel–Bulkley model described the flow behavior of the samples very well (R² > 0.97).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aapples 3aapricots 3ablanching 3afructose 3aglucose 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3astorage time 3asucrose 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aAlpaslan, Mehmet0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2018 June, v. 12, no. 2 p.1072-1083dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-018-9723-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003100145245009900176300002000275520166800295592002801963650001701991650002002008650001202028650001702040650002002057650001902077650002902096650003502125650001402160650002502174650001602199650001702215650001402232650000902246650002002255650001002275650002102285700001802306700002202324700002202346700001802368700002302386700002102409700002002430700002002450700002502470700002302495700002302518700002002541700002002561700002102581700001602602773012702618856008102745852000902826655001202835IND60580834720171102000000.0171003e20171003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058083472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.7b035322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesforges, Jean-Pierre W.,10aEffects of Polar Bear and Killer Whale Derived Contaminant Cocktails on Marine Mammal Immunity  ap. 11431-11439.  aMost controlled toxicity studies use single chemical exposures that do not represent the real world situation of complex mixtures of known and unknown natural and anthropogenic substances. In the present study, complex contaminant cocktails derived from the blubber of polar bears (PB; Ursus maritimus) and killer whales (KW; Orcinus orca) were used for in vitro concentration–response experiments with PB, cetacean and seal spp. immune cells to evaluate the effect of realistic contaminant mixtures on various immune functions. Cytotoxic effects of the PB cocktail occurred at lower concentrations than the KW cocktail (1 vs 16 μg/mL), likely due to differences in contaminant profiles in the mixtures derived from the adipose of each species. Similarly, significant reduction of lymphocyte proliferation occurred at much lower exposures in the PB cocktail (EC₅₀: 0.94 vs 6.06 μg/mL; P < 0.01), whereas the KW cocktail caused a much faster decline in proliferation (slope: 2.9 vs 1.7; P = 0.04). Only the KW cocktail modulated natural killer (NK) cell activity and neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis in a concentration- and species-dependent manner. No clear sensitivity differences emerged when comparing cetaceans, seals and PB. Our results showing lower effect levels for complex mixtures relative to single compounds suggest that previous risk assessments underestimate the effects of real world contaminant exposure on immunity. Our results using blubber-derived contaminant cocktails add realism to in vitro exposure experiments and confirm the immunotoxic risk marine mammals face from exposure to complex mixtures of environmental contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrcinus orca 3aUrsus maritimus 3ablubber 3acytotoxicity 3aimmune response 3aimmunotoxicity 3alymphocyte proliferation 3amedian effective concentration 3amonocytes 3anatural killer cells 3aneutrophils 3aphagocytosis 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aseals 3atoxicity testing1 aLevin, Milton1 aJasperse, Lindsay1 aDe Guise, Sylvain1 aEulaers, Igor1 aLetcher, Robert J.1 aAcquarone, Mario1 aNordøy, Erling1 aFolkow, Lars P.1 aHammer Jensen, Trine1 aGrøndahl, Carsten1 aBertelsen, Mads F.1 aSt. Leger, Judy1 aAlmunia, Javier1 aSonne, Christian1 aDietz, Rune0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2017 Oct. 03, v. 51, no. 19 p.11431-11439dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.7b035323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245012600173300001600299520135200315592002801667650001201695650001401707650002401721650002301745650002001768653002301788653001601811653002101827653000901848653001401857700001901871700002101890773010801911856008802019852000902107655001202116IND60587018420221123014117.0190628e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058701842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŌta, Kazuyuki,10aQuantification of spatial lag effect on sediment transport around a hydraulic structure using Eulerian–Lagrangian model  ap. 281-296.  aThe spatial lag effect on sediment transport around a hydraulic structure is quantified through numerical simulation using a Eulerian–Lagrangian model. The Eulerian–Lagrangian model uses a deterministic approach of bed load motion and stochastic approach of Einstein's concept, which allows for a reasonable quantification of both non-equilibrium and equilibrium bed load transport rates. Numerical simulations are conducted for local scour around a spur dyke and a weir-type structure. As pointed out in previous experimental studies on the one-dimensional problem, Eulerian–Lagrangian simulation reveals an unsaturated bed load in a scour hole around a hydraulic structure. Furthermore, an oversaturated bed load is also found in the deposition region, particularly behind the structure. The validity of the linear adaptation equation is discussed using numerical results, revealing the possibility that the linear adaptation equation does not appropriately represent the existence of the strong spatial lag effect. The present study finds there are two modes in the response of the adaptation length to the unsaturated bed load, which depend on the clear-water scour condition or the live-bed scour condition. Findings of this study will contribute to multi-dimensional sediment transport simulations that consider the spatial lag effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedload 3aequations 3amathematical models 3asediment transport 3awater resources 0aSpatial lag effect 0aLocal scour 0aEuler–Lagrange 0aWeir 0aSpur dyke1 aSato, Takahiro1 aNakagawa, Hajime0 tAdvances in water resources.g2019 July, v. 129 p.281-296dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245012800178300001800306520169200324592002802016650002102044650002702065650002102092650001202113650001402125650001902139650001802158650001002176650002402186650001502210650001902225650003402244650002002278650003702298650003702335650002502372650002402397650002602421650001402447650002602461653002202487653003102509653001502540653001302555653001602568700002002584773009202604856008402696852000902780655001202789IND60112008320221119163939.0161020e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011200832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2013.05.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScodelaro Bilbao, Paola10aExtracellular ATP regulates FoxO family of transcription factors and cell cycle progression through PI3K/Akt in MCF-7 cells  ap. 4456-4469.  aForkhead Box-O (FoxO) transcription factors regulate the expression of many genes involved in suppression. Released nucleotides can regulate intracellular signaling pathways through membrane-bound purinergic receptors, to promote or prevent malignant cell transformation. We studied the role of extracellular ATP in the modulation of Forkhead Box O (FoxO) transcription factors and of cell cycle progression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.Western blot analysis, cell transfections with siRNA against Akt, immunocytochemistry, subcellular fractionation studies and flow cytometry analysis were performed.ATP induced the phosphorylation of FoxO1/3a at threonine 24/32, whereas reduced the expression of FoxO1. In addition, ATP increased the expression of the cyclins D1 and D3 and down-regulated the cell cycle inhibitory proteins p21Cip1 and p27Kip1. The use of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, Ly294002, and/or of siRNA to reduce the expression of the serine/threonine kinase Akt showed that these effects are mediated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. ATP induced the translocation of FoxO3a from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Also, ATP increased the number of cells in the S phase of cell cycle; this effect was reverted by the use of Ly294002 and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib.Extracellular ATP induces the inactivation of FoxO transcription factors and cell cycle progression through the PI3K/Akt pathway in MCF-7 cells.These findings provide new molecular basis for further understanding the mechanisms involved in ATP signal transduction in breast cancer cells, and should be considered for the development of effective breast cancer therapeutic strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abreast neoplasms 3acyclins 3acytoplasm 3aflow cytometry 3afractionation 3agenes 3aimmunocytochemistry 3ainterphase 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aprotein-serine-threonine kinases 3apurinergic receptors 3asignal transduction 3asmall interfering RNA 3athreonine 3atranscription factors 0aExtracellular ATP 0aFoxO transcription factors 0aCell cycle 0aPI3K/Akt 0aMCF-7 cells1 aBoland, Ricardo0 tBBA - General Subjects.g2013 Oct., v. 1830 p.4456-4469dElsevier B.V.x0304-41657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2013.05.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01542naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100026700138245009900405300001600504520026600520592002800786650002300814650002100837650001500858650000900873650002100882650001500903700001800918700002200936700002100958700001700979773012600996856007301122852000901195655001201204IND60657750920221120155416.0190816e20060124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065775092DNAL7 a10.1039/b512238d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshimotoPresent Address.

MBCHs generally contain one or more chiral centers and so two or more stereoisomeric forms are possible for each structure. However, it is not known whether insects biosynthesize these molecules in high stereoisomeric purity, nor is it known whether insects can distinguish the different stereoisomeric forms of MBCHs. This knowledge gap is due in part to the lack of methods for isolating individual MBCHs from the complex cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) blends of insects, as well as the difficulty in determining the absolute configurations of the isolated MBCHs. To address these deficiencies, we report a straightforward method for the isolation of individual cuticular hydrocarbons from the complex CHC blend. The method was used to isolate 36 pure MBCHs from 20 species in nine insect orders. The absolute stereochemistries of the purified MBCHs then were determined by digital polarimetry. The absolute configurations of all of the isolated MBCHs were determined to be ( R ) by comparison with a library of synthesized, enantiomerically pure standards, suggesting that the biosynthetic pathways used to construct MBCHs are highly conserved within the Insecta. The development of a straightforward method for isolation of specific CHCs will enable determination of their functional roles by providing pure compounds for bioassays.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInsecta 3ahydrocarbons 3ainsect communication 3ainsects 3aisolation techniques 3alipids 3apolarimetry 3astereochemistry 3astereoisomers 0acuticular hydrocarbons 0amethyl-branched hydrocarbons 0aabsolute configuration 0aisolation 0acontact pheromone1 aMcElfresh, J.

Changes in germination rate, weight loss, starch, reducing sugar, gibberellins (GA3), and α-solanine were measured. The results showed that CEO fumigation could control sprouting and improve the quality of potato tubers during storage compared to the non-treated tubers. CEO treatments inhibited the degradation of starch and the increase of reducing sugar content. The production of gibberellins (GA3) was suppressed, and the levels of α-solanine in the skin and flesh of potato tubers were decreased by CEO fumigation. Dual-phase CEO fumigation had a better effect on sprout suppression than single-phase fumigation, and possesses potential for postharvest application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aessential oils 3afumigation 3agermination 3agibberellins 3apostharvest treatment 3apotatoes 3areducing sugars 3asolanine 3asprouting 3astarch 3asugar content 3atubers 3aweight loss 0aPotato 0aCitronella essential oil 0aSprout suppression 0aStorage 0aα-Solanine1 aXu, Lixing1 aGuan, Wenqiang1 aLin, Qiong1 aBrennan, Charles1 aYan, Ruixiang1 aZhao, Hui0 tFood chemistry.g2019 June 30, v. 284 p.254-258dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.1193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03559naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245012500180300001600305520224200321592002802563650001302591650001202604650001502616650001202631650000902643650001602652650001102668650002502679650001902704653002402723653000902747653000802756653001702764653002702781653001602808653002902824700001802853700006002871773009802931856008703029852000903116655001203125IND60623679720221119174642.0190203e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062367972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahimi Boldaji, Mozhgan10aThermally stratified compression ignition enabled by wet ethanol with a split injection strategy: A CFD simulation study  ap. 813-826.  aThe potential application of partially distilled alcohol biofuels in a new, advanced, low temperature combustion (LTC) concept called Thermally Stratified Compression Ignition (TSCI) was studied in this work. TSCI, which was recently conceived, attempts to intentionally stratify the temperature distribution in the cylinder prior to ignition in a lean, premixed, compression-ignited combustion mode. Preliminary experiments used the latent heat of vaporization from the direct injection of water to stratify the temperatures prior to ignition and therefore provide control over the start and rate of combustion in LTC and expand the operating range. While these preliminary results are very encouraging, the requirement of a separate direct injector for water somewhat limits the commercial applications of this variant of TSCI (i.e. employing direct water injection). Instead, this work investigates using the latent heat of vaporization of wet ethanol to introduce the forced thermal stratification of TSCI to control the combustion process.A 3D CFD model was implemented and validated in CONVERGE with the SAGE detailed chemistry solver. This model was then used to simulate TSCI with wet ethanol employing a split injection strategy. The results indicate that TSCI with split direct injection of wet ethanol has an overall lower heat release rate and longer burn duration compared to HCCI due to the higher level of thermal stratification prior to ignition achieved through the evaporative cooling effect of the wet ethanol and its high latent heat of vaporization. Additionally, the ethanol/water blend ratio was varied to observe its effect on TSCI combustion. The results show that a higher percentage of water reduces the peak heat release rate and elongates combustion. Finally, different split injection mass fractions were simulated and the results indicated that injecting a higher mass fraction of wet ethanol in the second injection reduces the peak heat release rates and can increase the burn duration up to 68.8%. This way, TSCI with wet ethanol provides cycle-cycle control over the combustion process through adjusting the mass fraction of the first and second injection without requiring any engine hardware changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3aburning 3acombustion 3aethanol 3aheat 3alatent heat 3amodels 3atemperature profiles 3avolatilization 0aAdvanced combustion 0aTSCI 0aLTC 0aHeat release 0aThermal stratification 0aWet ethanol 0aSplit injection strategy1 aGainey, Brian1 aLawler, Benjamin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5906-56720 tApplied energy.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 235 p.813-826dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245009600167300001600263520170800279592002801987650001302015650001602028650001102044650001702055650002002072650001302092650002302105653001602128653002002144653001702164653003602181700001902217700001302236700001702249700002202266773010802288856008802396852000902484655001202493IND60587018720221122234839.0201125e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058701872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jie10aImpact of hydrogeological factors on groundwater salinization due to ocean-surge inundation  ap. 423-434.  aOcean surges cause seawater inundation of coastal inland areas. Subsequently, seawater infiltrates into coastal aquifers and threatens the fresh groundwater resource. The severity of resulting salinization can be affected by hydrogeological factors including aquifer properties and hydrologic conditions, however, little research has been done to assess these effects. To understand the impacts of hydrogeological factors on groundwater salinization, we numerically simulated an ocean-surge inundation event on a two-dimensional conceptual coastal aquifer using a coupled surface-subsurface approach. We varied model permeability (including anisotropy), inland hydraulic gradient, and recharge rate. Three salinization-assessment indicators were developed, based on flushing time, depth of salt penetration, and a combination of the two, weighted flushing time, with which the impact of hydrogeological factors on groundwater vulnerability to salinization were quantitatively assessed. The vulnerability of coastal aquifers increases with increasing isotropic permeability. Low horizontal permeability (kₓ) and high vertical permeability (kz) lead to high aquifer vulnerability, and high kₓ and low kz lead to low aquifer vulnerability. Vulnerability decreases with increasing groundwater hydraulic gradient and increasing recharge rate. Additionally, coastal aquifers with a low recharge rate (R ≤ 300 mm yr−1) may be highly vulnerable to ocean-surge inundation. This study shows how the newly introduced indicators can be used to quantitatively assess coastal aquifer vulnerability. The results are important for global vulnerability assessment of coastal aquifers to ocean-surge inundation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3amodels 3apermeability 3arisk assessment 3aseawater 3awater salinization 0aOcean surge 0aCoastal aquifer 0aSalinization 0aHydrogeological characteristics1 aZhang, Huichen1 aYu, Xuan1 aGraf, Thomas1 aMichael, Holly A.0 tAdvances in water resources.g2018 Jan., v. 111 p.423-434dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011400168300001600282520141200298592002801710650001401738650001701752650001001769650001901779650002601798650001301824650002701837650001401864650001401878650001301892653000901905653001301914653001701927700001801944700001801962700001701980700001901997700001902016700002402035700002002059700006102079700002102140700002302161700002202184700002102206773012102227856008202348852000902430655001202439IND60533099920221120205117.0160728e20141212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053309992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatanuki, Zenta10aSynergistic cytotoxicity of afatinib and cetuximab against EGFR T790M involves Rab11-dependent EGFR recycling  ap. 269-276.  aEGFR is an important therapeutic target for non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib, are effective in cases with EGFR-activating mutations. However, most such cases become resistant through a secondary EGFR mutation, T790M. While the second-generation TKI afatinib has a higher affinity for double-mutant EGFRs, better efficacy is needed. Combining afatinib with the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab improves clinical outcomes, but the mechanism is unclear. Here we examined this effect using erythroleukemic K562 cells. The activating EGFR mutation L858R is sensitive to first-generation TKIs, and adding T790M confers resistance to these drugs. This double-mutant EGFR was moderately sensitive to afatinib, but responded weakly to cetuximab. Combined afatinib and cetuximab synergistically increased their cytotoxicity for K562 cells expressing the double-mutant EGFR. Apoptosis in these cells followed induction of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM. Unexpectedly, afatinib caused redistribution of EGFR to the cell surface through Rab11a-dependent recycling. Cetuximab reduced cell-surface EGFR, and total EGFR decreased synergistically when cetuximab was combined with afatinib. Our results suggest that the synergistic effect exerted by afatinib and cetuximab on NSCLCs is associated with BIM induction and alterations in EGFR status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3alung neoplasms 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amutation 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3arecycling 3asynergism 3atyrosine 0aEGFR 0aEGFR-TKI 0aCytotoxicity1 aKosai, Hitomi1 aOsanai, Nanae1 aOgama, Naoko1 aMochizuki, Mai1 aTamai, Keiichi1 aYamaguchi, Kazunori1 aSatoh, Kennichi1 aFukuhara, Tatsuro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0440-470X1 aMaemondo, Makoto1 aIchinose, Masakazu1 aNukiwa, Toshihiro1 aTanaka, Nobuyuki0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Dec. 12, v. 455 p.269-276dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245018100177300001600358520159400374592002801968650002701996650001702023650001202040650000902052650001002061650001702071650002202088650001502110650002502125650001302150650001502163650005202178650001002230650001102240650002002251650001802271650001502289650001102304650002902315650004002344700001702384700002602401700002402427773011702451856005502568852000902623655001202632IND50069477720221121051032.0130926e19991215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006947772DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00941.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuadroni, Manfredo10aProteome mapping, mass spectrometric sequencing and reverse transcription‐PCR for characterization of the sulfate starvation‐induced response in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1  ap. 986-996.  aA set of proteins induced in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 during growth in the absence of sulfate was characterized by differential two‐dimensional electrophoresis and MS. Thirteen proteins were found to be induced de novo or upregulated in P. aeruginosa grown in a succinate/salts medium with sodium cyclohexylsulfamate as the sole sulfur source. Protein spots excised from the two‐dimensional gels were analysed by N‐terminal Edman sequencing and MS sequencing (MS/MS) of internal protein fragments. The coding sequences for 11 of these proteins were unambiguously identified in the P. aeruginosa genome sequence. Expression of these genes was investigated by reverse transcription‐PCR, which confirmed that repression in the presence of sulfate was acting at a transcriptional level. Three classes of sulfur‐regulated proteins were found. The first class (five proteins) were high‐affinity periplasmic solute‐binding proteins with apparent specificity for sulfate and sulfonates. A second class included enzymes involved in sulfonate and sulfate ester metabolism (three proteins). The remaining three proteins appeared to be part of a more general stress response, and included two antioxidant proteins and a putative lipoprotein. This study demonstrates the power of the proteomics approach for direct correlation of the responses of an organism to an environmental stimulus with the genetic structures responsible for that response, and the application of reverse transcription‐PCR significantly increases the conclusions that can be drawn from the proteomic study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aantioxidants 3aenzymes 3agels 3agenes 3alipoproteins 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3anucleotide sequences 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalts 3asodium 3astress response 3asuccinic acid 3asulfonates 3asulfur 3atranscription (genetics) 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis1 aJames, Peter1 aDainese‐Hatt, Paola1 aKertesz, Michael A.0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g1999 Dec. 15, v. 266, no. 3 p.986-996dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00941.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03455naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245007600184300001800260520185000278592002802128650002702156650001302183650002102196650001802217650001902235650001802254650001802272650001402290650001202304650001302316650002802329650001202357650001102369650001702380650001602397650001402413650000902427650001602436650001602452650001802468650002002486650001302506650001802519650004502537650006202582700002002644700002502664700002102689773012202710856004802832852000902880655001202889IND4474560520221116155430.0121003e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447456052DNAL7 a228062022pmid7 a10.1007/s11274-012-1087-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSavvides, A.

Our aim was to estimate the ability of Xanthomonas campestris ATCC 13951 for the production of xanthan gum by using whey as a growth medium, a by-product of dairy industry. X. campestris ATCC 13951 has been studied in batch cultures using a complex medium for the determination of the optimal concentration of glucose, galactose and lactose. In addition, whey was used under various treatment procedures (de-proteinated, partially hydrolyzed by β-lactamase and partially hydrolyzed and de-proteinated) as culture medium, to study the production of xanthan in a 2 l bioreactor with constant stirring and aeration. A production of 28 g/l was obtained when partially hydrolysed β-lactamase was used, which proved to be one of the highest xanthan gum production reported so far. At the same time, an effort has been made for the control and selection of the most appropriate procedure for the preservation of the strain and its use as inoculant in batch cultures, without loss of its viability and its capability of xanthan gum production. The pre-treatment of whey (whey permeate medium hydrolyzed, WPH) was very important for the production of xanthan by the strain X. campestris ATCC 13951 during batch culture conditions in a 2 l bioreactor. Preservation methods such as lyophilization, cryopreservation at various glycerol solution and temperatures have been examined. The results indicated that the best preservation method for the producing strain X. campestris ATCC 13951 was the lyophilization.

Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae are important pathogenic bacteria responsible for different infectious diseases in several animal species. In the present study, a whole blood culture with S. aureus, E. coli, or S. agalactiae and flow cytometry were used to investigate, whether stimulation with different bacterial species induces different immunomodulation patterns in camel leukocytes. The expression of different cell surface myeloid markers and cell adhesion molecules on monocytes and neutrophils was investigated. In addition, the capacity of monocytes and neutrophils to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) was analyzed. RESULTS: Stimulation with either of the bacterial species resulted in the expansion of the camel CD14ʰⁱᵍʰMHCIIʰⁱᵍʰ monocyte subset with a reduced fraction of CD14ʰⁱᵍʰMHCIIˡᵒʷ monocytes. For the CD14ˡᵒʷMHCIIʰⁱᵍʰ monocytes, however, only stimulation with S. aureus or S. agalactiae increased their fractions in blood. Although all bacterial species elicited the upregulation of cell surface MHC class II molecules on granulocytes, the increase was, however, highest on cells stimulated with S. aureus. The expression levels of the two adhesion molecules, CD11a and CD18, on neutrophils and monocytes were differently affected by bacterial stimulation. Functionally, E. coli failed to stimulate ROS production in monocytes, while induced a strong ROS production response in granulocytes. S. agalactiae elicited a week ROS production in granulocytes when compared to the other two pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: The different responsiveness of monocytes and granulocytes toward different bacterial species indicates different host-pathogen interaction mechanisms for the two cell populations. In addition, the phenotypic and functional differences between cells stimulated with E. coli, S. aureus, or S. agalactiae suggests pathogen-species-specific modulating effects of the bacterial pathogens on the camel innate myeloid cells.  aPublisher supplied data  a206118cDeanship of Scientific Research, King Faisal University 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aadhesion 3acamels 3aflow cytometry 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aimmunomodulation 3ainnate immunity 3amonocytes 3aneutrophils 3aphenotype 3areactive oxygen species 3aveterinary medicine0 tBMC veterinary research.g2021 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.241-241dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-021-02939-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01980naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245010100164300001800265520082500283592002801108650001201136650001601148650002101164650001501185650001801200650001401218650001301232650001701245650001601262650002101278700001701299700001701316700001701333700002001350773014101370856007401511852000901585655001201594IND60641934320221122031006.0190506e20170131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064193432DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta10179h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Nhat Truong10aSpaced TiO₂ nanotube arrays allow for a high performance hierarchical supercapacitor structure  ap. 1895-1901.  aIn this work, we describe the synthesis and electrochemical properties of nitridated hierarchical TiO₂ nanotubes as an electrode for supercapacitors. The hierarchical TiO₂ nanostructures are formed by a controlled layer-by-layer TiO₂ nanoparticle decoration on self-organized spaced TiO₂ nanotubes. These structures are then annealed in a NH₃ atmosphere at elevated temperature to convert the material to a nitride structure – this drastically enhances their electron-transport properties. The areal capacitance of hierarchical structures can be tuned by changing the number of decorated TiO₂ nanoparticle layers. The capacitance enhancement of the hierarchical structures reaches a maximum when the surface area through nanoparticle deposition is highest and the conductivity via nitridation is optimized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3anitrides 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide1 aOzkan, Selda1 aHwang, Imgon1 aZhou, Xuemei1 aSchmuki, Patrik0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Jan. 31, v. 5, no. 5 p.1895-1901dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta10179h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245010200206300001600308520113000324592002801454650001801482650001701500650003801517650001501555650001601570650001601586650001901602650002001621650002501641650001401666650001401680650001701694650000901711650002801720650004301748650001101791650001101802653002701813653003301840653002001873653003101893653003601924653001401960653000901974653000901983653000701992653000801999653000802007653000802015653000802023700002302031700001702054700002202071773009902093856008502192852000902277655001202286IND60729060220221119232757.0220103e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072906022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2021.01.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Tonghuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6743-292X10aRecycling salmon meat by decontamination under mild conditions using high-pressure carbon dioxide  ap. 102-109.  aThe 2011–2016 reports from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has stated that annual food loss and waste occurs on a massive scale in fisheries and aquaculture. This study aimed to explore advanced technologies to recycle wasted salmon as an industrial resource with high commercial value by applying enzymatic hydrolysis under HPCD. Our results showed that HPCD treatment at 50 °C and 1 MPa for 16 h effectively prevents salmon from microbial contamination. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that HPCD was also able to inhibit an increase in bacteria at moderate temperatures. Based on NGS analysis, there was a very low abundance of Bacillus and some histamine producers, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella, detected in samples treated using HPCD at 50 °C and 1 MPa for 16 h. Hydrolysate analysis showed that HPCD treatment at 1 MPa did not affect the hydrolysates from salmon. It is anticipated that the results from this study will support the application of HPCD in industrial enzymatic hydrolysis and increase the sustainability of bio-based materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aEnterobacter 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aKlebsiella 3aPseudomonas 3aaquaculture 3acarbon dioxide 3adecontamination 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afood loss 3ahistamine 3ahydrolysates 3ameat 3amicrobial contamination 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asalmon 3awastes 0aWaste salmon recycling 0aHigh-pressure carbon dioxide 0aDecontamination 0aNext-generation sequencing 0aIndustrial enzymatic hydrolysis 0aPathogens 0aHPCD 0aSDGs 0aDE 0aNGS 0aPCR 0aBSA 0aCPM1 aKuwahara, Shinichi1 aOhno, Tomoki1 aIwahashi, Hitoshi0 tWaste management.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 124 p.102-109dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.01.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009800174300001200272520104300284592002801327650001901355650001901374650001601393650001401409650000901423650001401432650001101446650001201457650002301469650001501492650003201507650002401539650002401563650003201587650002001619650001001639650001801649653000901667653001201676653001601688653001201704653001501716700006201731700002001793773009101813856008601904852000901990655001201999IND60587019020221122003533.0190403e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058701902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2017.11.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Tonnac, Auriane10aFatty acid composition of several muscles and adipose tissues of pigs fed n-3 PUFA rich diets  ap. 1-8.  aDuring two months, sixty Pietrain×(Landrace×Large White) finishing pigs (50.7 to 115.2kg live weight) received diets containing various levels of C18:3n-3 from linseed and C22:6n-3 from Schizochytrium microalgae to increase the content of these fatty acids (FA) in their lean and fat tissues.

At older ages, the role of sedentary behaviour (SB) and light intensity physical activity (LIPA) remains unclear. Evidence so far is based on studies examining movement behaviours as independent entities ignoring their co-dependency. This study examines the association between daily composition of objectively-assessed movement behaviours (MVPA, LIPA, SB) and incident CVD in older adults. METHODS: Whitehall II accelerometer sub-study participants free of CVD at baseline (N = 3319, 26.7% women, mean age = 68.9 years in 2012–2013) wore a wrist-accelerometer from which times in SB, LIPA, and MVPA during waking period were extracted over 7 days. Compositional Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for incident CVD for daily compositions of movement behaviours characterized by 10 (20 or 30) minutes greater duration in one movement behaviour accompanied by decrease in another behaviour, while keeping the third behaviour constant, compared to reference composition. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle, cardiometabolic risk factors and multimorbidity index. RESULTS: Of the 3319 participants, 299 had an incident CVD over a mean (SD) follow-up of 6.2 (1.3) years. Compared to daily movement behaviour composition with MVPA at recommended 21 min per day (150 min/week), composition with additional 10 min of MVPA and 10 min less SB was associated with smaller risk reduction – 8% (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87–0.99) – than the 14% increase in risk associated with a composition of similarly reduced time in MVPA and more time in SB (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02–1.27). For a given MVPA duration, the CVD risk did not differ as a function of LIPA and SB durations. CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults, an increase in MVPA duration at the expense of time in either SB or LIPA was found associated with lower incidence of CVD. This study lends support to public health guidelines encouraging increase in MVPA or at least maintain MVPA at current duration.  aPublisher supplied data  aR01AG056477cNational Institute on Aging  aRF1AG062553cNational Institute on Aging  aR024227cMedical Research Council  aS011676cMedical Research Council  aRG/16/11/32334cBritish Heart Foundation  aANR-19-CE36-0004-01cAgence Nationale de la Recherche 3aaccelerometers 3acardiovascular diseases 3ahazard ratio 3alight intensity 3anutrition 3aphysical activity 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3arisk reduction 3asedentary lifestyle1 aMcGregor, Duncan E.1 avan Hees, Vincent T.1 aFayosse, Aurore1 aDugravot, Aline1 aTabak, Adam G.1 aChen, Mathilde1 aChastin, Sebastien F.

With the growing Asian population in the U.S., there is potential to grow the goat meat market to meet the new demand. The high demand for skin-on goat meat is currently not met domestically because of the absence of cultural knowledge of the niche market and the technological knowledge to produce a high-quality skin-on goat meat product. The objective of this study was to develop a standard procedure for the alternative skin-on goat harvest and fabrication process, along with comparing the processing yields and time efficiency between the alternative skin-on and traditional skin-off harvest and fabrication processes. Materials and MethodsA total of 17 Boer/dairy crossbred goats averaging 26.28 kg and 4 mo of age were harvested in 2 different harvesting techniques: 9 with skin left on the carcasses (skin-on) and 8 with skin removed (skin-off). In skin-on harvest group, carcasses were scalded and dehaired at 61°C for 3 min to remove most of the hair after stunning and exsanguination. The skin-off harvest group was harvested the same as the traditional lamb harvest, using the fisting technique. All carcasses were fabricated using a bandsaw and cut into 2 in. × 2 in. cubes after 24 h of postmortem chilling at 2°C. Cubes from each carcass were placed in individual lug and assessed for consistent quality. Any cube with excessive fat or bones was removed from the batch. Live weight, hot carcass weight, dressing %, chilled carcass weight, and final retail product weight were recorded throughout the harvest and fabrication processes. The harvest time (time spent from stunning to entering the cooler) and the fabrication time (time spent on the bandsaw and removal of inedible products) were also recorded. ResultsThe skin-on treatment group had greater dressing % (61.00 vs. 48.38%; P < 0.01), % chilling loss (6.53 vs. 3.15%; P = 0.01) and % total yield (50.16 vs. 41.36%; P < 0.01) compared to the skin-off treatment group. It is interesting to note that the skin-off treatment tended to have greater % retail product yield (P = 0.07). This is likely due to the skin-on retail product tended to have more cubes with just skin and fat, which were removed from the batch during the quality check. There were no differences between treatments for harvest time (P = 0.79), fabrication time (P = 0.27), and total processing time (P = 0.55). ConclusionThe results are encouraging to goat producers and processors who are interested in this ethnic niche of the goat market as the skin-on process requires similar inputs, but generates additional outputs in comparison to the traditional skin-off harvesting. Additional research on consumers’ willingness-to-pay and economic analysis for domestic skin-on goat meat product is needed to confirm the sustainability of this product.  aPublisher supplied data 3abandsaws 3abody weight 3abones 3acarcass weight 3acold treatment 3acrossbreds 3aeconomic analysis 3agoat meat 3agoats 3aharvest date 3aniche markets 3aprocessing time 3atexture 3awillingness to pay 3aUnited States1 aChao, M.0 tMeat and muscle biology.g2017 Jan., v. 1, no. 3 p.37-37dAmerican Meat Science AssociationwJournal:27149x2575-985X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.221751/rmc2017.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013600166300001600302520064300318592002800961650002000989650001801009650002801027650002601055650001401081650001601095650002301111650002501134650001301159650002001172653001301192653000801205653000901213653000701222653002701229653003001256653001601286653002001302653001401322653001501336700001901351700002001370700001901390700002401409700001601433700002201449700002001471700002101491700005601512773012101568856008201689852000901771655001201780IND60533100220221118174320.0160728e20141212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053310022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGotoh, Kumiko14aThe antitumor effects of methyl-β-cyclodextrin against primary effusion lymphoma via the depletion of cholesterol from lipid rafts  ap. 285-289.  aPrimary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a subtype of aggressive and chemotherapy-resistant non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs predominantly in patients with advanced AIDS. In this study, we examined the antitumor activity of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (M-β-CyD) in vitro and in vivo. M-β-CyD quickly induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in PEL cells via cholesterol depletion from the plasma membrane. In a PEL xenograft mouse model, M-β-CyD significantly inhibited the growth and invasion of PEL cells without apparent adverse effects. These results strongly suggest that M-β-CyD has the potential to be an effective antitumor agent against PEL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanimal models 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3acholesterol 3agrowth retardation 3anon-Hodgkin lymphoma 3apatients 3aplasma membrane 0aM-β-CyD 0aPEL 0aPI3K 0aPI 0aMethyl-β-cyclodextrin 0aPrimary effusion lymphoma 0aCholesterol 0aPlasma membrane 0aApoptosis 0aMice model1 aKariya, Ryusho1 aAlam, Md.

On the one hand, along with the prominent contradiction between regional ecological protection and economic development, as well as between the growing ecological demands of urban residents and the destruction of natural ecosystems, the construction of urban ecological corridors is very challenging. On the other hand, with contemporary urbanization and ecological civilization development, the standards and requirements for the construction of urban ecological corridors are set higher and higher. Constructing an urban ecological corridor is therefore particularly important, and must adopt a spatial approach that balances the relationship between ecological protection and economic development. In this study, the classification of urban ecological corridors was firstly conducted according to the structural or functional differences. Secondly, research progress on the construction of urban ecological corridors was systematically summarized and the main inadequacies were indicated. Following the analysis of the main methods employed in the construction of urban ecological corridors, existing methods were classified into three kinds, i.e. qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis, and spatial analysis. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of the methods of subjective judgment, suitability and sensitivity analysis, network analysis, and minimum cost path analysis were compared. To provide theoretical support for the construction and management of urban ecological corridors, four key research directions were also pointed out, i.e. the identification of key nodes of urban ecological corridor, the determination of the width of urban ecological corridor, the measurement of integrated effect of urban ecological corridor, and the multi-scale integration of urban ecological corridor. The present study will aid in accelerating and improving the process of ecological corridors construction in China's new-type urbanization.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological corridors 3aecosystems 3alandscape ecology 3aplanning 3aqualitative analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3ataxonomic keys 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aUrban ecological corridor 0aConstruction method 0aCorridor node 0aCorridor width 0aResearch progress and prospects1 aZhao, Huijuan1 aLiu, Yanxu0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2017 Feb., v. 37, no. 1 p.23-30dElsevier B.V.aEcological Society of ChinawJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2016.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01162naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245008200154300001800236520018200254592002800436650002300464650001600487650001700503650001300520650001900533650002100552700001700573700001500590700002000605773012800625856007400753852000900827655001200836IND60638417920221121233945.0190429e20160811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063841792DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ay01949h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ya12aA graphene oxide-based fluorescent aptasensor for alpha-fetoprotein detection  ap. 6131-6134.  aA simple, rapid and sensitive method for the detection of alpha-fetoprotein was developed based on FAM-labeled aptamers and the fluorescence quenching ability of graphene oxide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aaptasensors 3afluorescence 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aoligonucleotides1 aBai, Yunfeng1 aFeng, Feng1 aShuang, Shaomin0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 Aug. 11, v. 8, no. 32 p.6131-6134dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ay01949h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011700168300001600285520141700301592002801718650002301746650002601769650002001795650002301815650002001838650001501858650001201873650001301885650001601898650001901914650002101933650002001954650001401974650002001988650001102008650001002019653001602029653002602045653002302071653002102094653001202115653001302127653002002140653001802160700001602178700001802194700001502212700001602227700001702243773009502260856005102355852000902406655001202415IND50087769420221118110611.0140412e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008776942DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2011.6273862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhijun10aEffect of salinity on seed germination, seedling growth, and physiological characteristics of Perilla frutescens  ap. 245-251.  aSalt stress is one of the major environmental factors limiting crop growth and yield. To understand the effect of salt stress on plant growth, we investigated the response of three perilla varieties (Suyin 1, Ziye 7, and Ziye 10) to NaC1 exposure at concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mM in terms of seed germination, seedling growth, root activity, contents of soluble sugar, proline, and malondialdehyde (MDA), and peroxidase (POD) enzyme activity. Germination characteristics, such as the percentage of seed germination, tended to decrease with increasing NaC1 concentrations. After three weeks of salt stress, the three varieties exhibited different salt tolerance in terms of seed germination, seedling growth, and physiological changes: seedling growth was inhibited to various degrees, seedling vigor and root activities decreased, and MDA, proline, and soluble sugar contents increased with increasing NaCl concentrations. POD enzyme activity, a protective mechanism against salt stress, increased at low NaC1 concentrations in Suyin1 (0–150 mM) and Ziye 7 (0–100 mM), and then decreased at higher NaCl concentrations. In Ziye 10, on the other hand, POD activity dropped significantly with increasing NaCl concentrations. These results suggest that among the three varieties Suyin 1 is more salt tolerant than Ziye 7 and Ziye 10, and that Ziye 10 is the most sensitive to salt stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerilla frutescens 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzyme activity 3agrowth retardation 3amalondialdehyde 3aperoxidase 3aproline 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3asodium chloride 3asugars 3avigor 0aGermination 0amalondialdehyde (MDA) 0aPerilla frutescens 0aperoxidase (POD) 0aproline 0asalinity 0aseedling growth 0asoluble sugar1 aLi, Huizhen1 aQiao, Shaojun1 aZhang, Xin1 aLiu, Peipei1 aLiu, Xiliang0 tPlant biosystems.g2012 June 1, v. 146, no. 2 p.245-251dTaylor & Francisx1724-55757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2011.627386  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245019500161300001600356520102900372592002801401650003001429650002501459650001201484650001701496650001001513650001101523650001901534700001901553700001601572700001901588700002401607773011501631856007501746852000901821655001201830IND60439085220221122061117.0190314e200210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043908522DNAL7 a10.1007/BF007707052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSonoki, Tomonori10aSpecific degradation ofβ-aryl ether linkage in synthetic lignin (dehydrogenative polymerizate) by bacterial enzymes ofSphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6 produced in recombinantEscherichia coli  ap. 429-433.  aSphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6 produces unique and specific enzymes, such asβ-etherases,O-demethylases, and ring fission dioxygenases, for lignin degradation. Cleavage of arylglycerol-β-aryl ether linkage is the most important process in the lignin metabolic pathway ofS. paucimobilis SYK-6. We reported the genes (ligD, ligE, ligF) for enzymes that cleavedβ-aryl ether linkage of dimeric compounds in previous studies. In this study we synthesized the fluorescent high-molecular-weight lignin (UBE-DHP) by dehydrogenative polymerization. We investigated theβ-aryl ether cleavage ability of these enzymes produced in recombinantEscherichia coli. When UBE-DHP was incubated with LigF, 4-methylumbeliferone was released as a result ofβ-aryl ether cleavage of αO-methylumbelliferyl-β-hydroxypropiovanillone (compound III) incorporated in UBE-DHP. Here, we report thatβ-etherase ofS. paucimobilis SYK-6 can be expressed inE. coli and is able to cleave theβ-aryl ether linkage in synthetic high-molecular-weight lignin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphingomonas paucimobilis 3abiochemical pathways 3aenzymes 3afluorescence 3agenes 3alignin 3apolymerization1 aIimura, Yosuke1 aMasai, Eiji1 aKajita, Shinya1 aKatayama, Yoshihiro0 tJournal of wood science.g2002 Oct., v. 48, no. 5 p.429-433dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF007707053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05249naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010300168300001400271500001500285520323600300592002803536650002103564650001103585650002003596650001503616650001403631650002103645650002703666650002103693650001503714650002403729650001903753650001203772650001703784650002703801650001103828650002403839650002603863650002903889650002403918650001703942650003303959650001803992650001804010650002004028650001304048650001304061650001204074650001604086650002004102650001004122651001004132653001904142653002804161653002604189653003404215653002304249653001404272700001304286700001704299773014104316856008504457852000904542655001204551IND60559946420221116150916.0190415e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055994642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chnaes.2016.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Junhua10aEffect of stand age on soil microbial community structure in wolfberry (Lycium barbarum L.) fields  ap. 10-17.  a2019-12-06  aSoil physicochemical properties and microbes are essential in terrestrial ecosystems through their role in cycling mineral compounds and decomposing organic matter. This study examined the effect of stand age on soil physicochemical properties and microbial community structure in wolfberry (Lycium barbarum L.) fields, in order to reveal the mechanism of soil degradation due to long-term stand of L. barbarum. The objective of the study was achieved by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarker analysis of soil samples from L. barbarum fields in Zhongning County, Ningxia Province—the origin of L. barbarum. Five stand ages of L. barbarum were selected, <1, 3, 6, 9, and 12years (three plots each). The results showed that soil bulk density increased slightly with increasing stand age, while no clear trend was observed in soil pH or total salinity. As the stand age increased, soil organic matter and nutrients first increased before decreasing, with the highest levels being found in year 9. There was an amazing variety of PLFA biomarkers in soil samples at different stand ages. The average concentrations of total, bacterial, fungal, and actinomycete PLFAs in the surface soil initially decreased and then increased, before decreasing with the stand age in summer. The PLFA concentrations of major microbial groups were highest in year 9, with the total PLFA concentrations being 32.97% and 10.67% higher than those in years <1 and 12, respectively. Higher microbial PLFA concentrations were detected in summer relative to autumn and in the surface relative to the subsurface soil. The highest ratios of Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacterial (G−/G+) and fungal to bacterial (F/B) PLFAs were obtained in year 6, on average 76.09% higher than those at the other four stand ages. The soil environment was most stable in year 6, with no differences between other stand ages. Therefore, soil microbial community structure was strongly influenced by the stand age in year 6 only. The effect of stand age on soil G−/G+ and microbial community structure varied with season and depth; there was little effect for F/B in the 20–40cm soil layer. Principal component analysis revealed no correlations between microbial PLFA concentrations and total salinity in the soil; negative correlations were noted between soil pH and F/B in summer (P<0.01), as well as between soil pH and fungal PLFA in autumn (P<0.05). Moreover, microbial PLFA concentrations were correlated with soil organic matter (mean R=0.7725), total nitrogen (mean R=0.8296), total phosphorus (mean R=0.8175), available nitrogen (mean R=0.7458), and available phosphorus (mean R=0.7795) (P<0.01). On the whole, the soil ecosystem was most stable in year 6, while soil organic matter, nutrients, and microbial PLFA concentrations were maximal in year 9; thereafter, soil fertility indices and microbial concentrations decreased and soil quality declined gradually as the stand age increased. Therefore, farmers should reduce the application rate of fertilizers, especially compound or mixed fertilizers, in L. barbarum fields; organic or bacterial manure can be applied increasingly to improve the soil environment and prolong the economic life of L. barbarum.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil degradation 3asummer 3asoil ecosystems 3aphosphorus 3anutrients 3aapplication rate 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3anitrogen content 3abiomarkers 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3asoil density 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aautumn 3acommunity structure 3amicrobial communities 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3asoil organic matter 3asoil quality 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoil salinity 3asoil sampling 3aLycium barbarum 3asalinity 3anitrogen 3afarmers 3afertilizers 3aedaphic factors 3afungi 3aChina 0aorganic matter 0aPhospholipid fatty acid 0aSoil physicochemistry 0aMicrobial community structure 0aLycium barbarum L. 0aStand age1 aLi, Ming1 aZheng, Guoqi0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2017 Feb., v. 37, no. 1 p.10-17dElsevier B.V.aEcological Society of ChinawJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2016.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245006900159300002000228520096500248592002801213650001901241650001201260650001401272650002301286650001601309650001001325650001601335650001901351650001501370700001601385700002101401700002101422700002101443700002401464700001901488773013601507856007501643852000901718655001201727IND60538195720221118144640.0160815e20141112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053819572DNAL7 a10.1021/ie503411a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtsumi, Ryosuke10aEffects of Steam on Ni/Al2O3 Catalysts for Ammonia Decomposition  ap. 17849-17853.  aDecomposition of gaseous NH₃ from ammonia (NH₃)-containing wastewater was explored using Ni-loading Al₂O₃ catalysts. The thermochemical decomposition of an NH₃/steam mixture (wet-NH₃) with different steam contents at 873, 923, and 973 K using a fixed-bed reactor under ambient pressure. The present results indicated that the catalysts can be deactivated by the formation of NiAl₂O₄, which can be thermodynamically generated, and confirmed that the extent of deactivation was greatly affected by the partial pressure of the steam (PH₂O). The catalytic activities at 873 K decreased with increasing PH₂O, whereas the activity was constant above PH₂O of 25 kPa. However, the NH₃ conversion was almost independent of the NH₃ flow rate and temperature, and ∼30% of the NH₃ was decomposed at each temperature. This study indicated that, even in the presence of steam, this catalyst could decompose NH₃ from NH₄⁺-containing water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aengineering 3asteam 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3awastewater1 aNoda, Reiji1 aTakagi, Hideyuki1 aVecchione, Luigi1 aDi Carlo, Andrea1 aDel Prete, Zaccaria1 aKuramoto, Koji0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Nov. 12, v. 53, no. 45 p.17849-17853dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie503411a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03812naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245017200188300001600360520191900376592002802295650002402323650002602347650001502373650001702388650001802405650002502423650001902448650002302467650001602490650001702506650001202523650001202535650003002547650001202577650001202589650001802601653001902619653002202638653002302660653003402683653001102717700001502728700001802743700001402761700001802775700002002793700001702813700002302830700001902853700002202872700002002894700002402914700001902938700002102957773010602978856008103084852000903165655001203174IND60655488320221118161227.0190801e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065548832DNAL7 a224755272pmid7 a10.1017/S09671994120000192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamochi, Takayuki10aDevelopment of interspecies cloned embryos reconstructed with rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) oocytes and cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) fibroblast cell nuclei  ap. 358-366.  aInterspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (ISCNT) has been proposed as a technique to produce cloned offspring of endangered species as well as to investigate nucleus–cytoplasm interactions in mammalian embryo. However, it is still not known which embryo culture medium is optimal for ISCNT embryos for the nuclear donor or the oocyte recipient. We assessed the effects of the culture medium on the developmental competence of the ISCNT embryos by introducing cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) fibroblast nuclei into enucleated rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) oocytes (monkey–rabbit embryo). The monkey–rabbit ISCNT embryos that were cultured in mCMRL-1066 developed to the blastocyst stage, although all monkey–rabbit ISCNT embryos cultured in M199 were arrested by the 4-cell stage. When monkey–rabbit ISCNT and rabbit–rabbit somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos were cultured in mCMRL-1066, the blastocyst cell numbers of the monkey–rabbit ISCNT embryos corresponded to the cell numbers of the control rabbit–rabbit SCNT embryos, which were produced from a rabbit fibroblast nucleus and an enucleated rabbit oocyte. In addition, the presence of mitochondria, which were introduced with monkey fibroblasts into rabbit recipient cytoplasm, was confirmed up to the blastocyst stage by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This study demonstrated that: (1) rabbit oocytes can reprogramme cynomolgus monkey somatic cell nuclei, and support preimplantation development; (2) monkey–rabbit ISCNT embryos developed well in monkey culture medium at early embryonic developmental stages; (3) the cell number of monkey–rabbit ISCNT embryos is similar to that of rabbit–rabbit SCNT embryos; and (4) the mitochondrial fate of monkey–rabbit ISCNT embryos is heteroplasmic from the time just after injection to the blastocyst stage that has roots in both rabbit oocytes and monkey fibroblasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacaca fascicularis 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3ablastocyst 3acell nucleus 3aculture media 3adevelopmental stages 3aembryo culture 3aendangered species 3afibroblasts 3amitochondria 3amonkeys 3aoocytes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprogeny 3arabbits 3asomatic cells 0aCulture medium 0aCynomolgus monkey 0aEmbryo development 0aInterspecies nuclear transfer 0aRabbit1 aKida, Yuta1 aOh, Noriyoshi1 aOhta, Sei1 aAmano, Tomoko1 aAnzai, Masayuki1 aKato, Hiromi1 aKishigami, Satoshi1 aMitani, Tasuku1 aMatsumoto, Kazuya1 aSaeki, Kazuhiro1 aTakenoshita, Makoto1 aIritani, Akira1 aHosoi, Yoshihiko0 tZygote.g2013 Nov., v. 21, no. 4 p.358-366dCambridge University PresswJournal:6292x1469-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09671994120000193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013400169300001800303520137700321592002801698650002201726650004401748650001701792650001701809650001801826650001401844650001901858650002401877650003301901650002001934650002101954650001101975650002201986650002102008653001302029653001102042653002602053653001502079700001902094700001802113700001902131700002102150700002702171700002102198773013402219856008702353852000902440655001202449IND60584733920221119220737.0181010e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058473392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.10.1252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshri, Airul10aModified Dioscorea hispida starch-based hydrogels and their in-vitro cytotoxicity study on small intestine cell line (FHS-74 Int)  ap. 2412-2421.  aStarch-based hydrogels are promising smart materials for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications, which offer exciting perspectives in biophysical research at molecular level. This work was intended to develop, characterize and explore the properties of hydrogel from starch extracted from new source, Dioscorea hispida Dennst. Starch-mediated hydrogels were successfully synthesized via free radical polymerization method with varying concentrations of acrylic acid (AA),N,N’-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in aqueous system. The grafting reaction between starch and AA was examined by observing the decline in intensity peak of hydrogel FTIR spectrum at 3291cm⁻¹ and peak around 1600–1680cm⁻¹, indicating the stretching of hydroxyl group (OH) and stretching of carbon–carbon double bond (CC) respectively. The effects of cross-linker, monomer and NaOH concentration on swelling ratio and gel content in different medium and conditions were also evaluated. The thermal stability and structural morphology of as-synthesized hydrogels were studied by thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In-vitro cytotoxicity study using small intestine cell line (FHS-74 Int) revealed that the as-formulated eco-friendly-hydrogel was free from any harmful material and safe to use for future product development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea hispida 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacrylic acid 3acytotoxicity 3afree radicals 3ahydrogels 3apolymerization 3aproduct development 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asmall intestine 3asodium hydroxide 3astarch 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 0aHydrogel 0aStarch 0aIn-vitro cytotoxicity 0aBiomedical1 aAmalina, Nurul1 aKamil, Akhsan1 aFazry, Shazrul1 aSairi, M.

Two weathered bottom ashes were combined with various aggregates in multiple replacement percentages of up to 85% traditional aggregate, with the goal of mitigating leaching and direct human exposure risk. Al leaching was found to decrease proportionally to the mass of bottom ash included in the blended products, with over 90% reduction in blends with 85% recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). Release of Sb from the bottom ashes was predominantly controlled by solubility. Sb concentrations were reduced from 0.043 and 0.037 mg/L to 0.006 and 0.007 mg/L for facility A and B respectively blended with the highest tested proportion of RCA, near compliance drinking water standards of 0.006 mg/L. The high pH and presence of calcium-bearing minerals in recycled concrete appeared to facilitate significant immobilization of Sb in comparison to other aggregates. Similar results were observed for several other elements and material blends. Results indicate that blending MSWI BA with conventional aggregates is a feasible recycling application. Blending effectively mitigates environmental risk associated with the un-encapsulated use of MSWI BA in road construction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aantimony 3abottom ash 3aconcrete 3aconstruction materials 3adrinking water 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental fate 3aincinerators 3aleaching 3aminerals 3amixing 3amunicipal solid waste 3apH 3arecycling 3aroad construction 3asolubility 0aMunicipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI) 0aAsh 0aAggregate 0aRoad base1 aClavier, Kyle1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2840-53361 aTownsend, Timothy G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1222-09541 aKari, Ramana1 aWorobel, Robert F.0 tWaste management.g2019 Aug. 09, dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2019.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01341naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006900169300001600238520028700254592002800541650001200569650001200581650001300593650001600606650001000622651001000632651001000642653001700652653001200669653001300681653001900694653001700713653001900730700001900749700002000768773009500788856005100883852000900934655001200943IND50087769520221118110537.0140412e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008776952DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2011.6290102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenturella, G.10aFirst record of Tamarix meyeri (Tamaricaceae) for western Europe  ap. 484-489.  aField investigations and herbaria reference work carried out in Italy and Spain allowed us to identify wild and cultivated plants of Tamarix meyeri, a new species from western Europe.

Athletic fields are also unique among turfgrass systems, as their distinct pattern of foot traffic can result in compaction and other soil properties varying across different areas of the field, potentially causing variability in EPN performance even within a single field, as many abiotic and biotic soil properties are known to influence EPN efficacy. We tested the efficacy of the EPNs Steinernema feltiae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora against third-instar grubs of the Japanese beetle Popillia japonica in high-traffic and low-traffic areas of two soccer fields in New York State, one grown atop loam soil and the other atop loamy sand. Efficacy was low in the loam soil but modest for both species in the loamy sand, though the only significant increase over controls occurred in S. feltiae-inoculated plots within low traffic areas in 2016. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed positive associations between efficacy of both EPN species and soil sand content, suggesting that sandy soils are most optimal for curative applications against turfgrass pests. Soil biotic factors, such as microarthropod abundance, were not found to have an effect on EPNs. These results will aid turfgrass managers by improving knowledge of the conditions required for effective use of EPNs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeterorhabditis bacteriophora 3aPopillia japonica 3aSteinernema feltiae 3aathletic fields 3abiological control 3abiotic factors 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3ainsect larvae 3alawns and turf 3aloam soils 3aloamy sand soils 3amanagers 3amultidimensional scaling 3apesticides 3apests 3asand fraction 3asandy soils 3asports 3atraffic 3aturf grasses 3aNew York 0aIntegrated pest management 0aAugmentative biological control 0aSteinernema feltiae 0aHeterorhabditis bacteriophora 0aWhite grubs1 aThaler, J.S.1 aShields, E.J.1 aWickings, K.G.0 tBiological control.g2018 Nov., v. 126 p.177-184dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2018.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03665naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011600165300001400281520211600295592002802411650001902439650001102458650002802469650002302497650001502520650003502535650001902570650001002589650001202599650001102611650002502622650001902647650001102666650001202677650001102689650001502700651001002715653003102725653003002756653003002786653002302816700001902839700001802858700001802876700001602894700001902910773011202929856008503041852000903126655001203135IND60559946620221116150822.0190415e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055994662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chnaes.2016.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Tao10aDynamic assessment of the value of vegetation carbon fixation and oxygen release services in Qinghai Lake basin  ap. 79-84.  aStudies on ecosystem service function have an important significance for analyzing and understanding global warming. With the introduction of geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) technologies for the evaluation of ecosystem service function, the scope for analysis has been widening. Increasing number of researchers use these technologies to quantify the value of ecosystem service functions and reveal their spatial-temporal variability. By using the data for the interpretation of five RS images and net primary productivity (NPP) in Qinghai Lake basin, we assessed the value of vegetation carbon fixation and oxygen release services and revealed their dynamic variation in this basin. The result suggested that the average values of vegetation carbon fixation and oxygen release services in Qinghai Lake basin between 1987 and 2010 were spatially distributed in a ring shape around the Qinghai Lake and decreased from southeastern to the north and northwestern regions; the northwestern areas had the lowest value. The vegetation carbon fixation value between 1987 and 2010 was on an average 28.87×108yuan/a in Qinghai Lake basin, whereas the oxygen release value was 64.41×108yuan/a. Alpine meadow ecosystem showed the highest value of vegetation carbon fixation and oxygen release services function in Qinghai Lake basin, with average values of 18.28×108yuan/a and 40.79×108yuan/a, respectively, followed by those of temperate steppe and sparse vegetation. The vegetation carbon fixation and oxygen release values in Qinghai Lake basin gradually increased from 1987 to 2010, with the maximum value in 2010. By the end of 2010, the values increased by 7.19×108 yuan and 16.04×108 yuan, respectively. The values slightly decreased in barren land, lakeside marsh, river valley swamp, and sandy areas, but increased to different degrees in other ecosystems. Among them, the largest increase was noted in alpine meadow (4.38×108 yuan and 9.78×108 yuan, respectively), followed by those in temperate steppe with increased values of 1.12×108 yuan and 2.49×108 yuan, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine meadows 3abasins 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3ageographic information systems 3aglobal warming 3alakes 3amarshes 3aoxygen 3aprimary productivity 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asteppes 3aswamps 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aVegetation carbon fixation 0aVegetation oxygen release 0aSpatial-temporal dynamics 0aQinghai Lake Basin1 aCao, Guangchao1 aCao, Shengkui1 aZhang, Xiaoge1 aZhang, Jing1 aHan, Guangzhao0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2017 Apr., v. 37, no. 2 p.79-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2016.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01965naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245007400163300001600237520069700253592002800950650003400978650001401012650002501026650001701051650001701068650001701085650001801102650001601120650001401136650001801150650002301168650001301191650002401204650001201228650001201240650000901252651002101261700002101282700001701303773011501320856007501435852000901510655001201519IND60439085520221120075748.0190314e200210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043908552DNAL7 a10.1007/BF007707082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimizu, Kuniyoshi10aAntioxidant activity of heartwood extracts of Papua New Guinean woods  ap. 446-450.  aAntioxidant effects of methanol extracts from the heartwood of 23 Papua New Guinea (PNG) wood species were examined.

Each month, a case scenario is presented, followed by discussion of some of the issues involved. In addition, a possible way forward is suggested; however, there is rarely a cut‐and‐dried answer in such cases, and readers may wish to suggest an alternative approach. This month's dilemma, ‘Advice requested via social media’, was submitted and is discussed by Andrew Knight. Readers with comments to contribute are invited to send them as soon as possible, so that they can be considered for publication in the next issue. The series is being coordinated by Steven McCulloch, a practising vet with a PhD in the ethics of veterinary policy. It aims to provide a framework that will help practitioners find solutions when facing similar dilemmas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethics 3aissues and policy 3aveterinary clinics0 tIn practice.g2017 Nov., v. 39, no. 10 p.478-479dBMJ Publishing Group LimitedwJournal:jnl42967x0263-841X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/inp.j50053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010500168300001600273520174100289592002802030650001502058650001302073650001402086650001102100650002302111651001302134653001402147653002502161653004402186653001302230653003002243700005402273700001502327773010402342856008602446852000902532655001202541IND60605324220221116163716.0180721e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060532422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2017.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrera, J.10aCloud-to-ground lightning activity in Colombia: A 14-year study using lightning location system data  ap. 164-174.  aThis paper presents the analysis of 14years of cloud-to-ground lightning activity observation in Colombia using lightning location systems (LLS) data. The first Colombian LLS operated from 1997 to 2001. After a few years, this system was upgraded and a new LLS has been operating since 2007. Data obtained from these two systems was analyzed in order to obtain lightning parameters used in designing lightning protection systems. The flash detection efficiency was estimated using average peak current maps and some theoretical results previously published. Lightning flash multiplicity was evaluated using a stroke grouping algorithm resulting in average values of about 1.0 and 1.6 for positive and negative flashes respectively and for both LLS. The time variation of this parameter changes slightly for the years considered in this study. The first stroke peak current for negative and positive flashes shows median values close to 29kA and 17kA respectively for both networks showing a great dependence on the flash detection efficiency. The average percentage of negative and positive flashes shows a 74.04% and 25.95% of occurrence respectively. The daily variation shows a peak between 23 and 02h. The monthly variation of this parameter exhibits a bimodal behavior typical of the regions located near The Equator. The lightning flash density was obtained dividing the study area in 3×3km cells and resulting in maximum average values of 25 and 35flasheskm⁻²year⁻¹ for each network respectively. A comparison of these results with global lightning activity hotspots was performed showing good correlation. Besides, the lightning flash density variation with altitude shows an inverse relation between these two variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aaltitude 3alightning 3astroke 3atemporal variation 3aColombia 0aLightning 0aLightning parameters 0aCloud-to-ground lightning flash density 0aColombia 0aLightning location system1 aYounes, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9685-81961 aPorras, L.0 tAtmospheric research.g2018 May 01, v. 203 p.164-174dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2017.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245010600206300001800312506007600330520126800406592002801674506003701702650001401739650001301753650002401766650001701790650001801807653003401825653002601859653003001885700002001915700002301935700002101958700001701979773017301996856007902169852000902248655001202257IND60178539220221207102706.0150604e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017853922DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13180121112doi7 aPMC39772352pmcid7 a246395452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJenkins, Ian C.10aHydrodynamics selects the pathway for displacive transformations in DNA-linked colloidal crystallites  ap. 4803-4808.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe degree to which DNA-linked particle crystals, particularly those composed of micrometer-scale colloids, are able to dynamically evolve or whether they are kinetically arrested after formation remains poorly understood. Here, we study a recently observed displacive transformation in colloidal binary superlattice crystals, whereby a body-centered cubic to face-centered cubic transformation is found to proceed spontaneously under some annealing conditions. Using a comprehensive suite of computer simulation tools, we develop a framework for analyzing the many displacive transformation pathways corresponding to distinct, but energetically degenerate, random hexagonal close-packed end states. Due to the short-ranged, spherically symmetric nature of the particle interactions the pathways are all barrierless, suggesting that all end states should be equally likely. Instead, we find that hydrodynamic correlations between particles result in anisotropic mobility along the various possible displacive pathways, strongly selecting for pathways that lead to the fcc-CuAu-I configuration, explaining recent experimental observations. This finding may provide clues for discovering new approaches for controlling structure in this emerging class of materials.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aannealing 3acolloids 3acomputer simulation 3acrystallites 3ahydrodynamics 0adiffusionless transformations 0aDNA-mediated assembly 0avibrational mode analysis1 aCasey, Marie T.1 aMcGinley, James T.1 aCrocker, John C.1 aSinno, Talid0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Apr. 1, v. 111, no. 13 p.4803-4808dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13180121113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245019900165300001600364520157100380592002801951650002601979650002002005650000902025650002002034650002702054650002302081650001002104650001502114650001202129650001202141650002202153650001302175650002102188650001902209650002002228650001102248653002802259653002302287653002902310653002302339700002302362700001402385700001602399700005202415773013602467856008202603852000902685655001202694IND60764135720221119001318.0220125e20220228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076413572DNAL7 a10.1017/S000711452100194X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiao-Jian10aDietary selenium sources differentially regulate selenium concentration, mRNA and protein expression of representative selenoproteins in various tissues of yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco  ap. 490-502.  aThe study was conducted to determine the effects of three dietary Se sources, such as sodium-selenite (S-S), seleno-yeast (S-Y) and seleno-methionine (S-M), on Se concentration, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and TXNRD activities, and mRNA expression of fifteen representative selenoproteins, and protein expression of four endoplasmic reticulum-resided selenoproteins in a wide range of tissues of yellow catfish. Compared with S-S and S-M groups, dietary S-Y significantly decreased growth performance and feed utilisation of yellow catfish. Dietary Se sources significantly influenced Se contents in the spleen, dorsal muscle and the kidney, GPX activities in spleen, kidney, intestine, muscle and mesenteric fat, and TXNRD activities in the heart, intestine and mesenteric fat. Among ten tested tissues, dietary Se sources influenced mRNA expression of GPX4 and SELENOK in three tissues; GPX3, SELENOS and TXNRD2 in four tissues; SELENOF, SELENON and DIO2 in five tissues; SELENOM, GPX1/2 and TXNRD3 in six tissues; SELENOW in seven tissue and SELENOP and SELENOT in eight tissues. Based on these observations above, S-S and S-M seem to be suitable Se sources for improving growth performance and feed utilisation of yellow catfish. Dietary Se sources differentially influence the expression of selenoproteins in various tissues of yellow catfish. For the first time, we determined the expression of selenoproteins in fish in responses to dietary Se sources, which contributes to a better understanding of the functions and regulatory mechanisms of selenoporteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTachysurus fulvidraco 3afeed conversion 3afish 3agene expression 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrowth performance 3aheart 3aintestines 3akidneys 3amuscles 3aprotein synthesis 3aselenium 3aselenomethionine 3aselenoproteins 3asodium selenite 3aspleen 0aPelteobagrus fulvidraco 0aSelenium nutrition 0aSelenoprotein expression 0aDietary Se sources1 aZhang, Dian'guang,1 aZhao, Tao1 aXu, Yi-Huan1 aLuo, Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3219-16090 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2022 Feb. 28, v. 127, no. 4 p.490-502dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000711452100194X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03925naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013400172300001600306520209800322592002802420596006102448650002102509650002002530650001202550650001202562650001602574650002102590650001602611650002402627650001502651650002202666650001302688650002102701650001502722650001402737650001602751650001402767650001202781650001302793650001602806650001202822650001102834650002102845650002502866650002802891650001402919650001302933650001802946700001802964700002202982700006003004700006003064773010703124856008303231852000903314655001203323IND60764327820221118222952.0220130e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076432782DNAL7 a10.1007/s13199-021-00814-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Moukhtari, Ahmed10aSilicon improves physiological, biochemical, and morphological adaptations of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) during salinity stress  ap. 305-324.  aSilicon (Si) application to crops is a promising way for the deployment of sustainable agriculture. Here, the effects of Si on salt stress tolerance were investigated in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-rhizobia symbioses. Two Moroccan, Ouad-Lmaleh (OL) and Demnate-201 (Dm), and one European, NS-Mediana-ZMS-V (NS-Med), alfalfa varieties were associated to Ensifer meliloti Rm41 rhizobial strain. One-month-old alfalfa plants were exposed to 120 mM NaCl for five weeks with or without 3 mM of Si. The plants subjected to salt stress showed reduced biomass, chlorophyll (Chl) contents and relative water content (RWC) in comparison to the controls. The alfalfa-rhizobia symbiosis was also impaired under stress as reflected by less root nodulation and lower nitrogen (N) content and nitrogen content index (NCI). Added Si significantly increased plant biomass, nodules number, N content, NCI, Chl contents and RWC under salt stress. Results showed that salt-stressed alfalfa increased malonyldialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and electrolyte leakage (EL). However, Si incorporation in the cultured media reduced oxidative damages under salt-stress particularly in NS-Med variety by 26%, 70% and 70% for MDA, H₂O₂ and EL respectively. The lower amount of MDA, H₂O₂ and EL in the Si-treated plants seems to be related to its capacity to modulate superoxide dismutase and polyphenol oxidase activities and increase total polyphenol, flavonoid and carotenoid contents. Besides, compatible osmolytes, such as proline, glycine betaine and soluble sugars were found increased particularly in Si-treated OL plants by 46%, 33% and 26% respectively in comparison to Si-untreated plants. Alfalfa varieties reacted differently to Si treatment. Sodium concentration in alfalfa plants increased under salinity and reduced by Si treatment with an increase in the potassium content. Our findings showed that exogenous Si application could be a promising way to mitigate the toxic effect of salt and could improve alfalfa growth and its rhizobial symbiosis when grown in salt-affected soils.  aPublisher supplied data  a19MAG41chubert curien maghreb partnership - phc maghreb 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3abetaine 3acarotenoids 3acatechol oxidase 3achlorophyll 3aelectrolyte leakage 3aflavonoids 3ahydrogen peroxide 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anodulation 3aphytomass 3apolyphenols 3apotassium 3aproline 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asilicon 3asodium 3astress tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asustainable agriculture 3asymbiosis 3atoxicity 3awater content1 aCarol, Pierre1 aMouradi, Mohammed1 aSavoure, Arnould1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5002-78561 aFarissi, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2853-91150 tSymbiosis.g2021 Dec., v. 85, no. 3 p.305-324dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl39183x0334-51147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-021-00814-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02211naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010400159300001800263500001500281520094200296592002801238650001601266650001601282650001101298650001601309650001701325650001201342650003501354650000901389650001301398650001201411650001501423650001101438650001801449650002301467650001501490653000901505700001901514700001901533700001801552773009901570856007501669852000901744655001201753IND60576801920221119135531.0170806e20130716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057680192DNAL7 a10.1021/la401408f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSung, Hwa Kyung10aColorimetric Detection of Co2+ Ion Using Silver Nanoparticles with Spherical, Plate, and Rod Shapes  ap. 8978-8982.  a2019-12-06  aA highly sensitive colorimetric sensing platform for the selective trace analysis for Co²⁺ ions is reported, based on glutathione (GSH)-modified silver nanoparticles (AgNP). The shape of metallic nanoparticles used in colorimetric detection, using the unique optical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles, is almost spherical. Therefore, in this work we attempted to investigate the selective detection of heavy metal ion (Co²⁺), with the shape of AgNPs (nanosphere, nanoplate, and nanorod). GSH-AgNP with spherical shape shows a high sensitivity for all of the metal ions (Ni²⁺, Co²⁺, Cd²⁺, Pb²⁺, and As³⁺) but poor selective recognition for target metal ions. Whereas, AgNPs solution containing rod-type GSH-AgNP has a special response to Co²⁺, and its selective detection might be based on the cooperative effect of CTAB and GSH. Therefore, Co²⁺ ion could be selectively recognized using rod-type GSH-AgNPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglutathione 3acolorimetry 3acobalt 3ananospheres 3aheavy metals 3aarsenic 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3alead 3ananorods 3acadmium 3ananosilver 3anickel 3ananoparticles 3aoptical properties 3ametal ions 0aions1 aOh, Seung Yeon1 aPark, Chulhwan1 aKim, Younghun0 tLangmuir.g2013 July 16, v. 29, no. 28 p.8978-8982dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla401408f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010600164300001400270520102700284592002801311650002201339650001401361650002501375650001201400650002101412650001301433651001001446653001201456653001501468653001401483653002001497700001701517700001401534700001801548700002101566773014101587856008501728852000901813655001201822IND60559946920221116150820.0190415e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055994692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chnaes.2016.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ji10aMorphological variability and allometric relationships of the herb Panax notoginseng in Yunnan, China  ap. 65-69.  aA plant's morphology changes throughout its ontogeny. Investigating the allometric relationships between different morphological traits could provide useful information for cultivation of medicinal plants. Here we collected 698 individuals of Panax notoginseng for allometric analysis from seven populations cultivated in Yunnan, Southwest China. The slopes and intercepts of the allometric relationships were estimated by Standardized Major Axis regression. Significant differences (p<0.05) were found in each morphological variable considered among populations. Allometric analysis showed that all of the log-log relationships had different slopes or shared a common slope but differed in intercept (p<0.001). The morphological traits showed flexible allometric relationships. However, the root biomass that considered as a target trait showed the least allometric variability (slope=1.068–1.378) when compared to other variables. This could be because of the hundreds of years of cultivation and artificial selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax notoginseng 3aallometry 3aartificial selection 3abiomass 3amedicinal plants 3aontogeny 3aChina 0aBiomass 0aMorphology 0aAllometry 0aMedicinal plant1 aZhao, Yan-Li1 aJin, Hang1 aZhang, Jin-Yu1 aWang, Yuan-Zhong0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2017 Apr., v. 37, no. 2 p.65-69dElsevier B.V.aEcological Society of ChinawJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2016.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245012200175300001800297520131800315592002801633650001401661650002801675650001501703650002001718650001901738650001701757650001701774650001201791650001501803650001501818650001201833650002001845650001401865650001101879650001201890651001101902700003901913700003501952700003101987700002802018773009802046856008102144852000902225655001202234IND60124355320221123023152.0150427e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012435532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-015-4454-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManrique, Wilson Gómez10aFirst report of Myxobolus sp. infection in the skeletal muscle of Neotropical freshwater fish Piaractus mesopotamicus  ap. 2041-2044.  aAlthough there are several reports of Myxobolus species infecting the somatic muscle of teleost fish, species of this genus have not been described parasitizing the muscle tissue of pacus, Piaractus mesopotamicus. This study presented the first report of natural infection by Myxobolus sp. in the skeletal muscle of pacus reared in intensive system. Twenty-one fish (±142.2 g; ±23.1 cm) were captured (April 2013) from an intensive fish farm in São Paulo State, southeast Brazil. Spores of Myxobolus sp. were contained within plasmodia and showed oval morphology with the apical portion slightly pyriform and two polar capsules pyriform retaining the same ratio to each other. In the histopathological study, the skeletal muscle do not present signs of inflammation. The integrity of myofibrils within the infected fibers showed some degree of degeneration, with partial loss of myofibrillar details and striations. Spores were found infecting the skeletal muscle of 18 fish (85.7 %). Finally, the high prevalence of Myxobolus sp. infection in the skeletal muscle of P. mesopotamicus and the absence of macroscopic lesions in the muscle tissue indicate the necessity of more meticulous examinations during the health management in the rearing system and at slaughter of pacus to ensure best quality of meat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyxobolus 3aPiaractus mesopotamicus 3afish farms 3afreshwater fish 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3ameat quality 3amuscles 3amyofibrils 3aparasitism 3arearing 3askeletal muscle 3aslaughter 3aspores 3atropics 3aBrazil1 aFigueiredo, Mayra Araguaia Pereira1 ade Andrade Belo, Marco Antonio1 aMartins, Mauricio Laterça1 ade Moraes, Flávio Ruas0 tParasitology research.g2015 May, v. 114, no. 5 p.2041-2044dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4454-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245008500174300001600259520101500275592002801290650001501318650001601333650000901349650001201358650001001370651001301380653000901393653001001402653001301412653001701425700001701442773010401459856008601563852000901649655001201658IND60605324420221116163839.0180721e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060532442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2018.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStržinar, Gregor10aComparison and optimization of radar-based hail detection algorithms in Slovenia  ap. 275-285.  aFour commonly used radar-based hail detection algorithms are evaluated and optimized in Slovenia. The algorithms are verified against ground observations of hail at manned stations in the period between May and August, from 2002 to 2010. The algorithms are optimized by determining the optimal values of all possible algorithm parameters. A number of different contingency-table-based scores are evaluated with a combination of Critical Success Index and frequency bias proving to be the best choice for optimization. The best performance indexes are given by Waldvogel and the severe hail index, followed by vertically integrated liquid and maximum radar reflectivity. Using the optimal parameter values, a hail frequency climatology map for the whole of Slovenia is produced. The analysis shows that there is a considerable variability of hail occurrence within the Republic of Slovenia. The hail frequency ranges from almost 0 to 1.7 hail days per year with an average value of about 0.7 hail days per year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aclimatology 3ahail 3aliquids 3aradar 3aSlovenia 0aHail 0aRadar 0aSlovenia 0aOptimization1 aSkok, Gregor0 tAtmospheric research.g2018 May 01, v. 203 p.275-285dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2018.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03116naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002600154245013600180300001600316506002800332520148500360592002801845506003701873650001901910650002001929650001301949650001501962650002201977650001101999650001402010650001002024650001402034650001602048650001802064650001502082650001002097651001102107653001402118653001302132653003002145653002202175700002102197700002802218700002902246700002202275700002402297700003802321773012902359856008902488852000902577655001202586IND60739778120221207102251.0180530e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073977812DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.2010.44.3.14702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalcão, Leila Denise10aVineyard altitude and mesoclimate influences on the phenology and maturation of Cabernet-Sauvignon grapes from Santa Catarina State  ap. 135-150.  aResource is Open Access  aSanta Catarina State (SC) is a new grape growing region in Southern Brazil where 300 ha have been planted with Vitis vinifera L. since 2000. The annual production of this region is 3,944 tons of grapes and 1,549,000 liters of wine. Aims: To evaluate the influence of climate and vineyard altitude on the phenology and ripening as well as the suitability of five new grape growing regions of SC for Cabernet-Sauvignon variety for two vintages (2005 and 2006). Methods and results: Physicochemical analyses were performed on grape berries at 10-day intervals from véraison to harvest. Classification of the bioclimate according to the Winkler and Fregoni indices was also carried out for a long time period for these areas. Climate was strongly correlated with phenological precocity indices. Four Winkler Regions were established and the Fregoni index ranged from 402 to 1,466 for these regions. Conclusions: A positive relationship was observed between altitude, air temperature and the annual vine cycle duration. In general, these Cabernet-Sauvignon grapes showed a good potential for winemaking mainly in Regions II and III of the Winkler scale. Significance and impact of the study: Given the present and possible future changes in the global climate, the wine industry may be required to find new locations for viticulture. In this context, this research presents new grape growing regions which are promising for the cultivation of Vitis vinifera grape varieties in Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVitis vinifera 3aair temperature 3aaltitude 3abioclimate 3aearly development 3agrapes 3aphenology 3avines 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3awine industry 3awinemaking 3awines 3aBrazil 0aphenology 0aripening 0aCabernet-Sauvignon grapes 0avineyard altitude1 aBurin, Vivian M.1 aChaves, Eduardo Sidinei1 aVieira, Hamilton Justino1 aBrighenti, Emilio1 aRosier, Jean-Pierre1 aBordignon-Luiz, Marilde Terezinha0 tOENO One.g2010 Sept., v. 44, no. 3 p.135-150dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2010.44.3.14703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012800164520118600292592002801478650001701506650002201523650002401545650001501569650001501584650001401599650000901613650002701622650001001649650001201659650001201671650001301683650001401696653002101710653002801731653002001759653002401779653000601803653000701809653000701816653000701823653000701830653000701837653000701844653000701851653000701858653000701865653000701872653000601879653000801885653000801893653000601901653000701907653000601914653000801920653000701928653000701935653000701942700001801949700001701967700001201984700001301996700001702009700001202026773008802038856008302126852000902209655001202218IND60772468620221118215932.0220509e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077246862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2022.1464442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiaojie10aNew insights on folliculogenesis and follicular placentation in marine viviparous fish black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii)  aIn viviparous fish, a considerable degree of variation in placental structures have been described. However, no distinct structures are reported in Scorpaenidae. In this study, we demonstrate a new type of folliculogenesis and follicular placentation in Sebastes schlegelii. Before copulation, the germinal epithelium gradually surrounds the oocytes and develops into individually follicles with a stalk-like structure hanging on the ovigerous lamella, which ensures each follicle have access to spermatozoa after copulation. From V to early gestation stage, the cyp17-I highly expressesaccompanied by cyp19a1a signals disappearance, and 11-ketotestosterone level keeps rising and peaks at blastula stage, while 17β-estradiol declines to the bottom. Meanwhile, the theca cells rapidly proliferate and invade outwards forming a highly hypertrophied and folded microvillous placenta. This unbalance of hormone might be an important factor driving the theca cells proliferation and invasion. Additionally, some conserved genes related to mammalian placentation are significantly high expression in follicular placenta suggesting the high convergence in vertebrate placenta evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScorpaenidae 3aSebastes melanops 3aSebastes schlegelii 3acopulation 3aepithelium 3aevolution 3afish 3afollicular development 3agenes 3amammals 3aoocytes 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 0aFolliculogenesis 0aFollicular placentation 0aViviparous fish 0aSebastes schlegelii 0aL 0aOL 0aIT 0aPG 0aGE 0aTC 0aGC 0aBM 0aYG 0aBV 0aZP 0aS 0aSGf 0aSge 0aF 0aFP 0aE 0aSGl 0aPE 0aSF 0aGF1 aWang, Xueying1 aLiu, Qinghua1 aQi, Xin1 aZhou, Li1 aLiu, Haoming1 aLi, Jun0 tGene.g2022 June 15, v. 827 p.146444-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2022.1464443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245007400159300001400233500002000247520141600267592002801683596005501711596004801766650001501814650001101829650001801840650001201858650001801870650001401888650001101902650001201913650004301925650002001968700002101988700002002009700001602029700002302045700002102068773012402089856007302213852000902286655001202295IND60627895020221122032101.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062789502DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.131262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkizawa, Hiroki10aSignificance of CCN2 expression in bovine preimplantation development  ap. 49-54.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn mammalian preimplantation development, the first cell lineage segregation occurs during the blastocyst stage, when the inner cell mass and trophectoderm (TE) differentiate. Species‐specific analyses are essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie this process, since they differ between various species. We previously showed that the reciprocal regulation of CCN2 and TEAD4 is required for proper TE differentiation in bovine blastocysts; however, the function of CCN2 during early embryogenesis has remained otherwise elusive. The present study assessed the spatiotemporal expression dynamics of CCN2 in bovine embryos, and evaluated how changes to CCN2 expression (using a CCN2 knockdown (KD) blastocyst model) regulate the expression of pluripotency‐related genes such as OCT4 and NANOG. The conducted quantitative PCR analysis revealed that CCN2 mRNA was expressed in bovine oocytes (at the metaphase stage of their second meiosis) and embryos. Similarly, immunostaining detected both cytoplasmic and nuclear CCN2 at all analyzed oocyte and embryonic stages. Finally, both OCT4 and NANOG expression levels were shown to be significantly reduced in CCN2 KD blastocysts. Together, these results demonstrate that bovine CCN2 exhibits unique expression patterns during preimplantation development, and is required for the proper expression of key regulatory genes in bovine blastocysts.  aPublisher supplied data  a18H02321cGrant‐in‐Aid for Scientific Research  a17J01122cGrant‐in‐Aid for JSPS Fellows 3ablastocyst 3acattle 3aembryogenesis 3ameiosis 3amessenger RNA 3ametaphase 3amodels 3aoocytes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aregulator genes1 aYanagawa, Yojiro1 aNagano, Masashi1 aBai, Hanako1 aTakahashi, Masashi1 aKawahara, Manabu0 tAnimal science journal =.g2019 Jan., v. 90, no. 1 p.49-54dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867063x1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.131263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245007700154300002000231520085600251592002801107650002201135650001101157650000901168650001501177650001501192650001301207650001901220650001201239650001701251650001001268650001301278650001001291650001801301650001301319650001101332650001901343700001501362700002601377700001401403700002301417700002401440773013601464856007501600852000901675655001201684IND60538196420221118145410.0160815e20141119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053819642DNAL7 a10.1021/ie502711r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Cheng10aReEngineered Feedstocks for Pulverized Coal Combustion Emissions Control  ap. 17919-17928.  aNew coal reaction technology called ReEngineered Feedstock (ReEF), consisting of post-recycled paper and plastics, was evaluated for combustion emissions control when cofiring with pulverized coal. Experiments were conducted with four types of ReEF in a 2 in. diameter laboratory-scale fluidized bed combustor system heated to 1200, 1400, and 1600 °C. Flue gas emission was continuously monitored with an online infrared multigas analyzer and mass spectrometer. The results indicate that co-firing ReEF with coal provides SO₂ emission reduction in flue gas up to 85% and moderate decrease in NO emissions, as well as higher carbon conversion than pure coal combustion.

Here we have examined the anti-amyloidogenic potency of an ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide, using lysozyme as a model system. Thioflavin T fluorescence assay demonstrated that the ionic liquid suppressed the formation of lysozyme fibrils significantly. This observation was further confirmed by the Congo red assay. Fluorescence microscopy, intrinsic fluorescence studies, nile red fluorescence assay, ANS binding assay and circular dichroism studies also testified diminishing of the fibrillogenesis in the presence of ionic liquid. Formation of amyloid fibrils was also characterized by α to β conformational transition. From far-UV circular dichroism studies it was observed that the β-sheet content of the lysozyme samples decreased in the presence of the ionic liquid which in turn implied that fibrillogenesis was supressed by the ionic liquid. Atomic force microscopy imaging unequivocally established that the ionic liquid attenuated fibrillogenesis in lysozyme. These results may be useful for the development of more effective therapeutics for amyloidosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3aamyloidosis 3aatomic force microscopy 3abromides 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3aimage analysis 3aionic liquids 3alysozyme 3amodels 3atherapeutics 0aIonic liquid 0aLysozyme 0aFibrillogenesis1 aBhattacharya, Subhash Chandra1 aKumar, Gopinatha Suresh0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Feb., v. 107 p.2643-2649dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.10.1523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100006200180245007500242300001400317500002000331506007600351520119400427592002801621596001901649596001901668596001101687506003701698650002201735650001301757650002501770650001801795650001301813650001101826650001101837700002201848700002201870773012401892856007302016852000902089655001202098IND60627895220221207122307.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062789522DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.131192doi7 aPMC65875302pmcid7 a303706832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Yoshiaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6711-242410aDevelopmental stages of the blue‐breasted quail (Coturnix chinensis)  ap. 35-48.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChickens and Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) have traditionally been the primary avian models in developmental biology research. Recently, the blue‐breasted quail (Coturnix chinesis), the smallest species in the order Galliformes, has been proposed as an excellent candidate model in avian developmental studies owing to its precocious and prolific properties. However, data on the embryonic development of blue‐breasted quail are scarce. Here, we developed a normal developmental series for the blue‐breasted quail based on developmental features. The blue‐breasted quail embryos take 17 days to reach the hatching period at 37.7°C. We documented specific periods of incubation in which significant development occurred, and created a 39‐stage developmental series. The developmental series for the blue‐breasted quail was almost identical to that for chickens and Japanese quail in the earlier stages of development (stages 1–16). Our staging series is especially useful at later stages of development (stages 34–39) of blue‐breasted quail embryos as a major criterion of staging in this phase of development was the weight of embryos and the length of third toes.  aPublisher supplied data  a18K14570cJSPS  a08558088cJSPS  cHIRAKU0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCoturnix japonica 3achickens 3adevelopmental stages 3aembryogenesis 3ahatching 3amodels 3aquails1 aNakane, Yoshifumi1 aTsudzuki, Masaoki0 tAnimal science journal =.g2019 Jan., v. 90, no. 1 p.35-48dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867063x1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.131193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01782naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245006100169300001400230500002000244520074200264592002801006650001501034650002601049650000901075650001901084650001601103650002001119700003601139700001801175700001701193700002401210773011501234856007401349852000901423655001201432IND60788282320221121044343.0220812e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078828232DNAL7 a10.1136/inp.i60542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Souza, Mírley Barbosa10aUltrasonography of the prostate gland and testes in dogs  ap. 21-32.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUltrasonographic imaging is an important diagnostic tool because it allows assessment of the shape, size, position, margination and internal architecture of organs, as well as facilitating the study of vascular supply and vascularisation.

In the current study, the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), DNA-pooled sequencing and KAspar assay were performed to detect the expression features of FTO and the polymorphisms of FTO associated with the tail fat weight related-traits of Hu sheep. The results indicated that the expression of FTO gene is widely expressed in the tissues tested, and the expression level of FTO in tail fat tissue was evidently higher compared with that in the other tissues. In addition, FTO showed the highest expression level in tail fat tissue at three months. The expression of FTO mRNA was lower in the large-tail fat group compared with that in the small-tail fat group in 6 months old. Subsequently, the polymorphism loci g. 23704451C > A detected in the FTO gene was confirmed to be significantly related to the tail length and the weight of tail fat. These results suggested that the polymorphism might be regarded as novel molecular marker for the breeding of small tail sheep.  aPublisher supplied data 3afatty acids 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3alipid metabolism 3aobesity 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asheep 3atail 0aSNPs 0aFTO 0aRT-qPCR 0aFTO gene 0aExpression features 0aSNP 0aTail fat traits 0aHu sheep1 aZhang, Deyin1 aZhang, Xiaoxue1 aLi, Fadi1 aXu, Dan1 aZhao, Liming1 aLi, Xiaolong1 aZhang, Yukun1 aWang, Jianghui1 aYang, Shelby X.q(Shelby Xiaobing),1 aWang, Weiming0 tGene.g2022 June 05, v. 826 p.146451-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2022.1464513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014600166300001600312500001500328520160500343592002801948650002601976650002402002650001102026650002202037650001002059650001802069650001402087650005202101650001002153650002902163650001602192650001002208650001702218650001002235650001102245650001102256653001302267653002902280653001302309653001602322653002302338700001502361700001302376700001802389700001402407700001702421700001602438700001402454773009502468856005102563852000902614655001202623IND50087770320221118110547.0140412e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008777032DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2012.6577132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, X.-L.10aCharacterization of the FaVRT-2 gene encoding a MADS-box transcription factor responsive to vernalization in tall fescue (Festucaarundinacea)  ap. 419-427.  a2019-12-05  aDelay of floral transition is a valuable trait in commercially important turfgrass species. It has been reported that short vegetative phase (SVP)-like proteins, potential repressors of the floral inductive pathway, control the transition from vegetative to reproductive phase. A homolog of SVP-like genes was isolated from tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and 3′-RACE and designated as F. arundinacea VEGETATIVE TO REPRODUCTIVE TRANSITION gene-2 (FaVRT-2). It encodes a putative protein of 226 amino acids with a conserved MADS (M) domain, a Keratin-like (K) domain, and a C-terminal (C) domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that FaVRT-2 is most closely related to VRT-2 proteins from ryegrass, barley, and wheat and belongs to the StMADS11 subfamily of MADS-box transcription factors. Subcellular localization showed that the FaVRT-2 protein accumulates in the nucleus suggesting a role as trans acting factor. FaVRT-2 transcripts accumulate abundantly in roots and stems and is moderately present in leaves under normal conditions (without non-vernalization treatment). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed similar transcriptional patterns of FaVRT-2 under both vernalization and non-vernalization conditions. However, the peak of FaVRT-2 transcripts under vernalization condition occurred 14 days earlier than that found under non-vernalization condition. These results support the hypothesis that FaVRT-2, a putative repressor of floral transition, is regulated by vernalization in tall fescue.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3aFestuca arundinacea 3abarley 3acomplementary DNA 3astems 3avernalization 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3awheat 3atranscription (genetics) 3aamino acids 3agenes 3aturf grasses 3aroots 3aleaves 3aLolium 0aMADS-box 0asubcellular localization 0aproteins 0atall fescue 0ainduction kinetics1 aLiu, X.-X.1 aChen, W.1 aLi, Wai Chin,1 aWu, J.

For athermal polymer-graft modification of particles (corresponding to equal chemical composition of graft and matrix polymer), compatibility is found to be a sensitive function of the degree of polymerization of graft and host polymer chains as well as the particle radius. In agreement with theoretical predictions, uniform particle dispersion is observed if the degree of polymerization of grafted chains is comparable to (or exceeds) the corresponding value of the polymer matrix. The resulting restriction to high degree of polymerization limits the accessible inorganic fraction that is attainable in athermal particle/polymer blends. In contrast, favorable interaction between grafted polymer chains and the polymeric host (as realized in the case of poly(styrene-r-acrylonitrile)-grafted particles embedded within PMMA matrix) is shown to facilitate thermodynamically stable and uniform particle dispersion across the entire compositional range even in the limit of large particle size, short grafted chains, and high molecular matrix chains. The synthesis of thermoplastic composite materials with inorganic fraction exceeding 50 vol % combining quantitative optical limiting within the UV frequency range and polymer-like mechanical properties is demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3achemical composition 3amechanical properties 3aparticle size 3apolymer nanocomposites 3apolymerization 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3aprediction 3asilica 3athermodynamics 3athermoplastics1 aDang, Alei1 aHui, Chin Ming1 aMahoney, Clare1 aMatyjaszewski, K.q(Krzysztof),1 aBockstaller, M.q(Michael),0 tLangmuir.g2013 July 16, v. 29, no. 28 p.8989-8996dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla401522v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245008600186300001600272520191100288592002802199650001402227650001402241650002802255650001402283650002002297650001802317650001202335650000902347650001202356650004902368650002802417650001202445650001502457650001402472653001502486653001702501653001602518653000802534700001802542700001702560773010602577856008102683852000902764655001202773IND60655489320221118160912.0190801e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065548932DNAL7 a236597822pmid7 a10.1017/S09671994130001782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaran, Vladimir10aAkt/PKB plays role of apoptosis relay on entry into first mitosis of mouse embryo  ap. 406-416.  aThe cell-cycle regulators that control meiotic divisions also regulate the events that accompany the oocyte-to-zygote transition. Thus, the meiotic machinery functions as an internal pacemaker that propels the oocyte toward embryogenesis. The preimplantation embryo expresses a number of receptors that are important for initial activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–protein kinase B (PI3K-Akt/PKB) pathway. The complete PI3K-Akt/PKB-CDK1 cascade is implicated as a key regulator of a number of cellular functions. Selective inhibition of protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) with inhibitor SH6 and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) with inhibitor roscovitine arrest development of the 1-cell preimplantation mouse embryo before entry into the first mitosis. The pronuclei of these inhibited embryos migrate to one another, but do not progress to pronuclei envelope breakdown and pronuclear fusion running immediately before the onset of mitosis. SH6-treated 1-cell mouse embryos showed a high occurrence of apoptosis features (nuclear fragmentation, positive terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL), active caspase-3 in both cytoplasm and nucleoplasm). In the Akt/PKB-inhibited embryos, the active phosphorylated form Ser⁴⁷³Akt/PKB was not detected in pronuclear areas when compared with inhibitor-free controls. Although CDK1-inhibited 1-cell embryos also failed to enter into the first mitosis, the presence of apoptotic cell death features was not observed. In the roscovitine-treated embryos, Ser⁴⁷³Akt/PKB was detected in the pronuclei independently of CDK1 activity. We conclude that Akt/PKB plays an important role during entry of the 1-cell mouse embryo into the first mitosis, and probably functions as a relay in the cell-cycle stage. We assume that Akt/PKB is the primary target responsible for mediating anti-apoptotic signals in the 1-cell mouse embryo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acytoplasm 3aembryo (animal) 3aembryogenesis 3ameiosis 3amice 3amitosis 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3anucleotidyltransferases 3aoocytes 3apronucleus 3areceptors 0aAkt kinase 0aMouse zygote 0aRoscovitine 0aSH61 aFabian, Dusan1 aRehak, Pavol0 tZygote.g2013 Nov., v. 21, no. 4 p.406-416dCambridge University PresswJournal:6292x1469-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09671994130001783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01956naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010500161300001600266520085700282592002801139650001401167650001901181650000901200650002301209650001201232650001301244650001501257650001201272650002501284650002101309650001501330700002001345700001801365773011501383856007501498852000901573655001201582IND60439086320221122144712.0190314e200210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043908632DNAL7 a10.1007/BF007707002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShintani, Noboru10aDecolorization of kraft pulp bleaching effluent by a newly isolated fungus,Geotrichum candidum Dec 1  ap. 402-408.  aKraft pulp bleaching effluent supplemented with glucose was decolorized by a newly isolated fungusGeotrichum candidum Dec 1 (Dec 1) that showed a wide decolorizing spectrum to synthetic dyes. When the glucose concentration in the effluent was 30 g/l, the color removal and the reduction of absorbable organic halogens were 78% and 43% after 7 days culture, respectively. The average molecular weight of colored substances measured by gel filtration chromatography was lowered to less than 3000 from 5600 after 7 days culture. As the contribution of extracellular enzymes such as peroxidase (DyP), manganese peroxidase, and laccase to the decolorization of the kraft pulp bleaching effluent was small, Dec 1 appears to have a different mechanism of decolorizing kraft pulp bleaching effluent when compared with enzymes used to decolorize synthetic dyes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ableaching 3adecolorization 3adyes 3agel chromatography 3aglucose 3ahalogens 3akraft pulp 3alaccase 3amanganese peroxidase 3amolecular weight 3aperoxidase1 aSugano, Yasushi1 aShoda, Makoto0 tJournal of wood science.g2002 Oct., v. 48, no. 5 p.402-408dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF007707003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245010800203300002000311506007600331520107400407592002801481506003701509650002201546650002201568650001501590650002101605650001701626650002401643650002601667650002501693650001301718650001101731650002001742650002101762650001301783650001201796653002301808653003001831653001101861653001501872653000901887700001701896700001901913700001801932700001601950700001601966700001301982700001501995700001502010700001802025700001202043700001502055700001602070700001402086700001602100700001502116700001702131773017502148856007902323852000902402655001202411IND60178539820221207102635.0150604e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017853982DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13200711112doi7 aPMC39772902pmcid7 a246165132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Darong10aComplete replication of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus in a newly developed hepatoma cell line  ap.

We have established a hepatoma cell line, HLCZ01, the first cell line, to the authors’ knowledge, supporting the entire lifecycle of both HBV and HCV. HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive particles can be observed in the supernatant and the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum of the cells via electron microscopy. Interestingly, HBV and HCV clinical isolates propagate in HLCZ01 cells. Both viruses replicate in the cells without evidence of overt interference. HBV and HCV entry are blocked by antibodies against HBsAg and human CD81, respectively, and the replication of HBV and HCV is inhibited by antivirals. HLCZ01 cells mount an innate immune response to virus infection. The cell line provides a powerful tool for exploring the mechanisms of virus entry and replication and the interaction between host and virus, facilitating the development of novel antiviral agents and vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHepatitis B virus 3aHepatitis C virus 3aantibodies 3aantiviral agents 3acell culture 3aelectron microscopy 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3ahepatitis B antigens 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3ainnate immunity 3asurface antigens 3avaccines 3aviruses 0acell culture model 0aprimary human hepatocytes 0acccDNA 0ainterferon 0aISGs1 aZuo, Chaohui1 aWang, Xiaohong1 aMeng, Xianghe1 aXue, Binbin1 aLiu, Nianli1 aYu, Rong1 aQin, Yuwen1 aGao, Yimin1 aWang, Qiuping1 aHu, Jun1 aWang, Ling1 aZhou, Zebin1 aLiu, Bing1 aTan, Deming1 aGuan, Yang1 aZhu, Haizhen0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Apr. 1, v. 111, no. 13 p.E1264-E1273dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13200711113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245008900158300001800247520138800265592002801653650001001681650001401691650001401705650001901719650001801738650000701756650001201763650001601775650001601791700001501807700001701822700001901839700001501858700001701873700001601890773009901906856007502005852000902080655001202089IND60576802420221119135306.0170806e20130716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057680242DNAL7 a10.1021/la401540s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jianying10aMultiresponsive Hydrogel Photonic Crystal Microparticles with Inverse-Opal Structure  ap. 8825-8834.  aHydrogel photonic crystal microparticles (HPCMs) with inverse-opal structure are generated through a combination of microfluidic and templating technique. Temperature and pH responsive HPCMs have firstly been prepared by copolymerizing functional monomers, for example, N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) and methacrylic acid (MAA). HPCMs not only show tunable color variation almost covering the entire wavelength of visible light (above 150 nm of stop-band shift) by simply tailoring temperature or pH value of the solution, but also display rapid response (less than 1 min) due to the small volume and well-ordered porous structure. Importantly, the temperature sensing window of the HPCMs can be enlarged by controlling the transition temperature of the hydrogel matrix, and the HPCMs also exhibit good reversibility and reproducibility for pH response. Moreover, functional species or particles (such as azobenzene derivative or magnetic nanoparticles) can be further introduced into the hydrogel matrix by using post-treatment process. These functionalized HPCMs can respond to the UV/visible light without significantly influencing the temperature and pH response, and thus, multiresponsive capability within one single particle can be realized. The presence of magnetic nanoparticles may facilitate secondary assembly, which has potential applications in advanced optical devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3ahydrogels 3amagnetism 3amicroparticles 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aphotons 3atemperature 3awavelengths1 aHu, Yuandu1 aDeng, Renhua1 aLiang, Ruijing1 aLi, Weikun1 aLiu, Shanqin1 aZhu, Jintao0 tLangmuir.g2013 July 16, v. 29, no. 28 p.8825-8834dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla401540s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03431naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011200167520184200279592002802121650002002149650001602169650002302185650002902208650002102237650002002258650003802278650002202316650001802338650004002356650001302396650001602409650001102425650001402436650001502450653001202465653001002477653004702487653001902534653001402553700001502567700001202582700001502594700001602609700001602625700001402641700001702655700001302672773011202685856008302797852000902880655001202889IND60657077720221118154718.0200103e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065707772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2019.1115752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chengli12aA novel light-electricity sensing method for PCSK9 detection based on s-PdNFs with multifunctional property  aAmounts of studies show that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) can increase the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ((LDL-C), leading to the progression and development of atherosclerosis. Hence, design an effective method to detect serum PCSK9 is meaningful for the prevention, monitor and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Here, we reported a dual-signal method for detecting PCSK9 using a signal label, sulphur-doped palladium nanoflowers (s-PdNFs), inspired by its multifunctional properties of quenching and catalysis, which would simultaneously achieve electrochemiluminescence (ECL) analysis and electrochemical detection. For the ECL analysis, s-PdNFs could effectively quench the ECL intensity of peroxydisulfate/oxygen (S₂O₈²⁻/O₂) system via ECL resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET). Importantly, the donor-acceptor pair (s-PdNFs-S₂O₈²⁻ pair) was firstly reported in the ECL-RET field. For the electrochemical detection, s-PdNFs with peroxidase-like activity, produce electric signals by catalyzing H₂O₂. Herein, a novel light-electricity dual signal immunosensor based on s-PdNFs was developed, and with a broad linear range of 5 fg mL⁻¹ to 50 ng mL⁻¹ (ECL channel) and 500 fg mL⁻¹ to 50 ng mL⁻¹ (electrochemical channel). Furthermore, the ECL channel and electrochemical channel can achieve the detection respectively which can meet different testing instruments. The two channels can also be combined to improve the accuracy of the detection. More importantly, the immunosensor realized the detection of PCSK9 in real serum samples demonstrated by good correlations with ELISA method. Our findings can promote the application of multifunctional materials in sensor and biomedicine field and provide a novel strategy for the detection of serum molecular.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood serum 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy transfer 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmunosensors 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amedicine 3ananoflowers 3aoxygen 3apalladium 3asubtilisin 0as-PdNFs 0aPCSK9 0aLight-electricity dual signal immunosensor 0aECL-RET system 0aCatalysis1 aHe, Junlin1 aLi, Jia1 aZhou, Yuan1 aFu, Xiaoxue1 aZhao, Yilin1 aChen, Jun1 aMao, Weiran,1 aYu, Chao0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 144 p.111575-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2019.1115753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245010800167300001600275520133800291592002801629650001501657650001501672650001001687650000901697650001601706650002201722650001101744650002301755651001001778653001801788653004801806653002701854653003401881653002001915653002001935700001701955700005601972700001502028773010402043856008602147852000902233655001202242IND60605325020221116163804.0180721e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060532502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2017.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGou, Yabin10aRadar-derived quantitative precipitation estimation in complex terrain over the eastern Tibetan Plateau  ap. 286-297.  aQuantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) is one of the important applications of weather radars. However, in complex terrain such as Tibetan Plateau, it is a challenging task to obtain an optimal Z–R relation due to the complex spatial and temporal variability in precipitation microphysics. This paper develops two radar QPE schemes respectively based on Reflectivity Threshold (RT) and Storm Cell Identification and Tracking (SCIT) algorithms using observations from 11 Doppler weather radars and 3264 rain gauges over the Eastern Tibetan Plateau (ETP). These two QPE methodologies are evaluated extensively using four precipitation events that are characterized by different meteorological features. Precipitation characteristics of independent storm cells associated with these four events, as well as the storm-scale differences, are investigated using short-term vertical profile of reflectivity (VPR) clusters. Evaluation results show that the SCIT-based rainfall approach performs better than the simple RT-based method for all precipitation events in terms of score comparison using validation gauge measurements as references. It is also found that the SCIT-based approach can effectively mitigate the local error of radar QPE and represent the precipitation spatiotemporal variability better than the RT-based scheme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3alandscapes 3aradar 3arain 3arain gauges 3aspatial variation 3astorms 3atemporal variation 3aChina 0aWeather radar 0aQuantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) 0aReflectivity threshold 0aStorm tracking/identification 0aComplex terrain 0aTibetan Plateau1 aMa, Yingzhao1 aChen, Haonan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9795-30641 aWen, Yixin0 tAtmospheric research.g2018 May 01, v. 203 p.286-297dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2017.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03441naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015500168300001600323520163700339592002801976650003402004650002602038650002502064650001102089650002102100650001202121650002302133650001502156650001902171650001502190650002102205650001202226650001102238650003502249650001902284650002202303650002202325650001702347650001602364650002302380653002902403653001102432653002502443653002502468653002302493700002502516700001902541700002102560700002302581700002502604773014002629856008502769852000902854655001202863IND60559947520221116151152.0190415e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055994752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2016.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichel, Piotr10aVariation in polyphenolic profile and in vitro antioxidant activity of eastern teaberry (Gaultheria procumbens L.) leaves following foliar development  ap. 356-364.  aSeasonal dynamics in the polyphenolic composition, antioxidant activity, and their relationships during plant development were evaluated for eastern teaberry (Gaultheria procumbens L.) leaves, a traditional herbal medicine of North American natives. With the complementary UHPLC-PDA-ESI-MS3, HPLC-PDA-fingerprint, Folin-Ciocalteau, and n-butanol/HCl assays of methanol-water (75:25, v/v) extracts, the dried leaf samples harvested monthly across the growing season under Polish climate conditions were found rich in structurally diverse polyphenols (149.2–210.7mg/g DW) including the dominating salicylates (64.6–107.5mg/g DW), proanthocyanidins (53.0–66.8mg/g DW), and flavonoids (17.3–25.3mg/g DW), and the accompanying chlorogenic acid isomers (2.4–4.4mg/g DW) and simple phenolic acids (0.9–1.1mg/g DW). Among 28 detected analytes, gaultherin (64.6–107.5mg/g DW), miquelianin (14.6–21.1mg/g DW), procyanidin A-type trimer (5.5–9.5mg/g DW), and (–)-epicatechin (5.8–7.8mg/g DW) were the most abundant. The phenolic levels and antioxidant activity parameters in the DPPH (EC50, 15.0–18.2μg DW/mL; 0.95–1.16mmol Trolox equivalents/g DW) and FRAP (2.3–3.4mmolFe 2+/g DW; 0.86–1.26mmol Trolox equivalents/g DW) assays showed parallel seasonal trends with maxima in September and October. As the subsequent correlation studies confirmed the determinative impact of polyphenols on the leaf antioxidant activity and its seasonal fluctuations, the Fall season could be recommended as optimal for harvesting the plant material for medicinal purposes and cost-effective production of natural health products.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aGaultheria procumbens 3aantioxidant activity 3aautumn 3achlorogenic acid 3aclimate 3acost effectiveness 3aflavonoids 3agrowing season 3aharvesting 3aherbal medicines 3aisomers 3aleaves 3amedian effective concentration 3aphenolic acids 3aplant development 3aproanthocyanidins 3aprocyanidins 3asalicylates 3aseasonal variation 0aGaultheria procumbens L. 0aLeaves 0aAntioxidant activity 0aPhenolic composition 0aSeasonal variation1 aOwczarek, Aleksandra1 aKosno, Martyna1 aGontarek, Daniel1 aMatczak, Magdalena1 aOlszewska, Monika A.0 tPhytochemistry letters.g2017 June, v. 20 p.356-364dElsevier LtdaPhytochemical Society of EuropewJournal:J000000131x1874-39007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytol.2016.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014300159300002000302520200300322592002802325650001502353650001902368650001502387650000902402650001102411650002102422650005002443650001302493650002402506650001302530700002002543700001902563700001902582773013602601856007502737852000902812655001202821IND60538196920180425000000.0160815e20141119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053819692DNAL7 a10.1021/ie502924h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStavrou, Marina10aContinuous Molecular Targeting–Computer-Aided Molecular Design (CoMT–CAMD) for Simultaneous Process and Solvent Design for CO2 Capture  ap. 18029-18041.  aSolvent-based separation systems have a substantial potential for improvement when the solvent and the process conditions are optimized simultaneously. The fully integrated design problem, however, leads to an optimization problem of prohibitive size and complexity owing to the many discrete degrees of freedom in selecting a solvent and the nonlinear nature of the process models. We here implement and extend the method of continuous molecular targeting–computer-aided molecular design (CoMT–CAMD) for the solvent and process optimization of a precombustion CO₂-capture system with physical absorption. CoMT–CAMD is a deterministic procedure that does not require a preselection of solvent molecules. The process topology considered in our study includes all major process operations of an existing CO₂-capture system: multistage absorption, desorption (two flash desorption stages with gas recycle) and CO₂ compression. We measure the process performance with a single economic objective function. The objective function captures the process trade-offs and evaluates the potential process-solvent on a common basis. The solvent is represented as the pure component parameters of the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT). The optimization problem is formulated with the pure component parameters of the solvent (PC-SAFT parameters) and with the process variables as degrees of freedom. Necessary auxiliary properties of the optimized solvent such as the ideal gas heat capacity and the molar mass are predicted with quantitative structure property relationship models, based on the pure component PC-SAFT parameters. As a result, one gets a unified thermodynamic framework for fluid properties based on the PC-SAFT model. With CoMT–CAMD we obtain a list of the best performing physical solvents for the considered CO₂-capture application. The resulting list of best performing solvents contains state-of-the-art solvents and new green solvent molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3adesorption 3aheat 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3asolvents 3asystem optimization 3atopology1 aLampe, Matthias1 aBardow, André1 aGross, Joachim0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Nov. 19, v. 53, no. 46 p.18029-18041dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie502924h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008500165300001800250520109800268592002801366650000801394650001101402650001501413650001601428650001301444650001901457650001101476650001601487650002501503651000901528700002001537700002301557773010801580856008101688852000901769655001201778IND60124356020221118201302.0150427e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012435602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-014-1164-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbedi, Rahele10aKaryological and flow cytometric studies of Tulipa (Liliaceae) species from Iran  ap. 1473-1484.  aChromosomal and karyotype parameters and genome size were examined in 22 Iranian populations of nine different Tulipa species, using squash technique and 1 % (w/v) aceto-orcein stain. Flow cytometric studies were performed using PI staining method and Vicia faba cv. Inovec (2C DNA = 26.9 pg) as a reference standard. Most species were diploid (2n = 2x = 24), having three chromosome types (“m”, “sm”, “st”). The chromosome length (TL) varied from 6.4 μm (S2) to 12.90 μm (S3). Total chromosome volume (TCV) ranged from 32.9 μm³(S2) to 66.0 μm³(S8). Statistical analyses confirmed more intraspecific chromosomal and genome size variations than interspecific. S1E2, S2E1 and S5E2, with the highest intrachromosomal (MCA) and relatively high interchromosomal asymmetry (CVCL), indicated higher asymmetry in the karyotype. The genome size in Tulipa species of Iran is being reported for the fist time. The mean 2C DNA was 54.52 pg, and ranged from 77.40 in S6E2 to 31.51 pg in S9E2.

These have largely arisen due to an increased understanding of the science behind cancer development and treatment, such as the underlying role of mutations/dysregulation of the c‐kit gene in mast cell tumours. There have also been some alterations in the way traditional medications are administered to exploit certain biological processes such as tumour blood vessel formation and growth (eg, metronomic chemotherapy).

This is because commercially available portable (single quadrupole) mass spectrometers lack the mass resolution to confidently differentiate between analyte and background signals. Additionally, current surface analysis methods provide no facility for chromatographic separation and therefore are vulnerable to ion suppression. Here we present a new analytical method where analytes are extracted from a sample using a solvent flushed across the surface under high pressure, separated using a chromatography column and then analysed using a portable mass spectrometer. The use of chromatography reduces ion suppression effects and this, used in combination with in-source fragmentation, increases selectivity, thereby allowing high sensitivity to be achieved with a portable and affordable quadrupole mass spectrometer. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method for the quantitative detection of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in urine and oral fluid. The method gives relative standard deviations below 15% (with one exception), and R² values above 0.998. The limits of detection for these analytes in oral fluid and urine are <30 ng ml⁻¹, which are comparable to the cut-offs currently used in drug testing, making the technique a possible candidate for roadside or clinic-based drug testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical species 3achromatography 3acocaine 3adetection limit 3adrug evaluation 3amass spectrometry 3aroadsides 3asolvents 3aspectrometers 3astandard deviation 3aurine1 aBaumert, Mark1 aStevenson, Derek1 aWatts, John1 aWebb, Roger1 aCosta, Catia1 aRobinson, Fiona1 aBailey, Melanie0 tAnalytical methods.g2017 Mar. 22, v. 9, no. 12 p.1839-1847dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ay02006b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010900171506002800280520205000308592002802358506003702386650001302423650001402436650002202450650001402472650001202486700002002498773009602518856008302614852000902697655001202706IND60739779020221207102249.0210319s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073977902DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202129010082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAleksey, Rogachev10aNeural Network Algorithms and Methods for Monitoring the Psychological State of Society During Epidemics  aResource is Open Access  aThe article presents the issue of monitoring the sociopsychological state of society in the period of epidemics by means of neural network algorithms and methods. Publications of sociologists, psychologists, and philologists, who have created a number of methods for in-depth analysis of emotions and tonality of texts in the Internet media, including cognitive and interpretive decoding, are devoted to substantiating approaches and methods for studying the content of Internet content. The purpose of the study is to substantiate the methods and computer tools for studying the socio-psychological state of society in crisis situations, in particular epidemics, based on neural network technologies based on Internet resources. The article considers methodological approaches and particular methods of their computer implementation. It is shown that for the computer analysis of the psychological state of society in the context of the epidemic, it is necessary to adapt the methodology for designing neural network technologies, as well as systems for collecting and textual analysis of the content of electronic and Internet resources. An effective approach to creating such systems is embedding, which uses a dense vector representation of tokens in a multidimensional space, the dimension of which should be selected experimentally in the process of training and testing the developed artificial neural networks (ANN). For contextual neural network analysis, a multiclass-oriented ANN with regularization layers of the form “SpatialDropout1D”can be used. The neural network architecture can be built on fully connected layers with an activation function of the “ReLU” type. The scientific and applied significance of the results of neural network analysis based on Internet resources is the possibility of obtaining classified assessments and segmentation of target information about the psychological state of society during periods of epidemics. This information can be used to effectively counter information threats to society.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3acognition 3acomputer analysis 3acomputers 3asociety1 aTamara, Mazaeva0 tBIO web of conferences.g2021, v. 29 p.01008-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202129010083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001800190245009000208300001400298506007600312520193400388592002802322506003702350650001402387650001002401650003302411650001302444650001502457650001102472653003402483653001802517653000902535653001802544653001302562653002302575700001802598700005802616773008902674856008302763852000902846655001202855IND60554661520221207064311.0161024e20140404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055466152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2014.01.0202doi7 aPMC39722682pmcid7 a244802842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGillis, Jesse10aBias tradeoffs in the creation and analysis of protein–protein interaction networks  ap. 44-54.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNetworks constructed from aggregated protein–protein interaction data are commonplace in biology. But the studies these data are derived from were conducted with their own hypotheses and foci. Focusing on data from budding yeast present in BioGRID, we determine that many of the downstream signals present in network data are significantly impacted by biases in the original data. We determine the degree to which selection bias in favor of biologically interesting bait proteins goes down with study size, while we also find that promiscuity in prey contributes more substantially in larger studies. We analyze interaction studies over time with respect to data in the Gene Ontology and find that reproducibly observed interactions are less likely to favor multifunctional proteins. We find that strong alignment between co-expression and protein–protein interaction data occurs only for extreme co-expression values, and use this data to suggest candidates for targets likely to reveal novel biology in follow-up studies.Protein–protein interaction data finds particularly heavy use in the interpretation of disease-causal variants. In principle, network data allows researchers to find novel commonalities among candidate genes. In this study, we detail several of the most salient biases contributing to aggregated protein–protein interaction databases. We find strong evidence for the role of selection and laboratory biases. Many of these effects contribute to the commonalities researchers find for disease genes. In order for characterization of disease genes and their interactions to not simply be an artifact of researcher preference, it is imperative to identify data biases explicitly. Based on this, we also suggest ways to move forward in producing candidates less influenced by prior knowledge.

The inability to consistently develop such bioreactors affects the way growth approaches for Dehalococcoides mccartyi bioaugmentation cultures are envisioned. It also affects interpretation of results from in situ continuous treatment processes. We report bioreactor performance and dehalogenation kinetics of a D. mccartyi-containing consortium in an upflow bioreactor. When fed synthetic groundwater at 11–3.6 h HRT, the upflow bioreactor removed >99.7% of the influent trichloroethene (1.5–2.8 mM) and produced ethene as the main product. A trichloroethene removal rate of 98.51 ± 0.05 me– equiv L–¹ d–¹ was achieved at 3.6 h HRT. D. mccartyi cell densities were 10¹³ and 10¹² 16S rRNA gene copies L–¹ in the bioflocs and planktonic culture, respectively. When challenged with a feed of natural groundwater containing various competing electron acceptors and 0.3–0.4 mM trichloroethene, trichloroethene removal was sustained at >99.6%. Electron micrographs revealed that D. mccartyi were abundant within the bioflocs, not only in multispecies structures, but also as self-aggregated microcolonies. This study provides fundamental evidence toward the feasibility of upflow bioreactors containing D. mccartyi as high-density culture production tools or as a high-rate, real-time remediation biotechnology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDehalococcoides mccartyi 3abioaugmentation 3abiofloc technology 3abioreactors 3adehalogenation 3aethylene 3agenes 3agroundwater 3aplankton 3aribosomal RNA1 aFajardo-Williams, Devyn1 aBondank, Emily1 aEsquivel-Elizondo, Sofia1 aKrajmalnik-Brown, Rosa0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2017 Oct. 03, v. 51, no. 19 p.11297-11307dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.7b030973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04830naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245009000160300001100250500000900261520345100270592002803721650001203749650000903761650001703770650002803787650002203815650002103837650001203858650001203870650002503882650001803907650002003925650001203945650001803957650000903975650001003984650001703994650001104011651001304022700001604035700001504051700001404066700001604080700001304096773012904109856007704238852000904315655001204324IND60677209420221121014822.0191123e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067720942DNAL7 a10.221751/rmc2016.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMancilha, T.10aCharacterizing Products from the Beef Rib Resulting From an Alternative Carcass Break  ap. 53.  aepub  aObjectivesThis study was aimed at investigating the impacts of separating the beef rib from the chuck between the 4th and 5th rib versus the 5th and 6th ribs on beef tenderness, connective tissue content, steak composition, and product yield. Materials and MethodsThirty USDA Choice carcasses were selected at random for inclusion in the study. Alternating sides of each carcass was fabricated into either an 8-rib rib separated from the chuck between the 4th and 5th rib or a traditional 7-rib rib separated from the chuck between the 5th and 6th rib. All comparisons between 8-rib and 7-rib ribs were made within animal. All ribs were collected and transported under refrigeration to the Colorado State University for fabrication. Comprehensive cutout data was collected from conversion of each individual NAMP 107 oven-prepared rib to a NAMP 112 boneless ribeye roll. Within 7 d of product collection, the boneless ribeye rolls were transported to a steak portioning facility, and all pieces were cut into equally portioned ribeye steaks. At the time of portioning, steak measurements were collected and recorded. All weight and steak yield comparisons were made between 7-rib and 8-rib ribs. Following steak portioning, an image of each steak was obtained on a gridded background. Individual images were analyzed using image software capable of making measurements by quantifying pixel size (Image J). From each steak image, all meaningful dimensional measurements were obtained. Following image capture, steaks were individually identified, packaged, frozen and stored for shear force evaluations. Steaks were thawed and cooked to a peak internal temperature of 71°C using a combination convection oven. Following cooking, the peak internal temperature was recorded for each steak. Warner-Bratzler Shear Force (WBSF) values were obtained for the primary muscles in every steak (longissimus, complexus, and spinalis). A single mean WBSF value was obtained and averaged for each muscle individually. Comparisons of least squares means for product yield and steak cutting yield were made between 8-rib and 7-rib ribs. Means for WBSF and steak measurements were compared by steak location within the portioned 8-rib ribs only. ResultsThe 112 ribeye rolls resulting from 8-rib ribs were 5.26 cm longer, which resulted in 2.8 more steaks per carcass, on average. Additionally, 112 ribeye rolls resulting from 8-rib ribs were 558 g heavier than 7-rib ribeye rolls. Steak location did not affect WBSF values of the complexus, or spinalis, but steak location did affect (P = 0.0077) the WBSF values of the longissimus. Even though the WBSF of the longissimus was affected by steak location, there were no meaningful trends by steak location and the values were not affected by alternating the fabrication style. The data indicated that tenderness and eating quality was not affected by fabrication style. As expected, the size of the longissimus decreased toward the anterior end of the ribeye rolls, and the size of the complexus increased inversely with the size of the longissimus. Most notably, the amount of intermuscular fat (kernel or star fat) was less in the most anterior steaks than in steaks that would normally appear on the ends of traditionally cut, 7-rib ribeye rolls. ConclusionChanging the fabrication style would not detrimentally impact the eating qualities of ribeye steaks but would add significant weight and value to the rib.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abeef 3abeef quality 3acarcass characteristics 3acomputer software 3aconvection ovens 3acooking 3acutting 3ainternal temperature 3aleast squares 3ameat tenderness 3amuscles 3arefrigeration 3aribs 3aseeds 3ashear stress 3asteaks 3aColorado1 aWoerner, D.1 aMartin, J.1 aTatum, D.1 aDelmore, R.1 aBelk, K.0 tMeat and muscle biology.g2017 Sept., v. 1, no. 2 p.53-53dAmerican Meat Science AssociationwJournal:27149x2575-985X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.221751/rmc2016.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245012200165300001600287520109500303592002801398650001101426650004101437650001801478650001901496650001001515653004501525653004901570653004201619653004101661653004601702653004101748653004301789653005101832653005001883653005101933653001101984653003801995653002202033653003602055653002502091653002402116700001302140700001502153700001602168700001702184700002002201700001702221700001802238773010002256856008702356852000902443655001202452IND60628518320221117222805.0190402e20190630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062851832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hehe10aCharacterization of key aroma compounds in Chinese Guojing sesame-flavor Baijiu by means of molecular sensory science  ap. 100-107.  aKey odorants of Guojing sesame-flavor Baijiu were identified using the concept of molecular sensory science, including aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) based on gas chromatography–olfactometry (GC–O) combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS).

Given the speed at which technology advances and the need to keep pace with biological experiments, we designed a computational platform, CoreFlow, which provides programmers with a framework to manage data in real-time. It allows users to upload data into a relational database (MySQL), and to create custom scripts in high-level languages such as R, Python, or Perl for processing, correcting and modeling this data. CoreFlow organizes these scripts into project-specific pipelines, tracks interdependencies between related tasks, and enables the generation of summary reports as well as publication-quality images. As a result, the gap between experimental and computational components of a typical large-scale biology project is reduced, decreasing the time between data generation, analysis and manuscript writing. CoreFlow is being released to the scientific community as an open-sourced software package complete with proteomics-specific examples, which include corrections for incomplete isotopic labeling of peptides (SILAC) or arginine-to-proline conversion, and modeling of multiple/selected reaction monitoring (MRM/SRM) results.CoreFlow was purposely designed as an environment for programmers to rapidly perform data analysis. These analyses are assembled into project-specific workflows that are readily shared with biologists to guide the next stages of experimentation. Its simple yet powerful interface provides a structure where scripts can be written and tested virtually simultaneously to shorten the life cycle of code development for a particular task. The scripts are exposed at every step so that a user can quickly see the relationships between the data, the assumptions that have been made, and the manipulations that have been performed. Since the scripts use commonly available programming languages, they can easily be transferred to and from other computational environments for debugging or faster processing. This focus on ‘on the fly’ analysis sets CoreFlow apart from other workflow applications that require wrapping of scripts into particular formats and development of specific user interfaces. Importantly, current and future releases of data analysis scripts in CoreFlow format will be of widespread benefit to the proteomics community, not only for uptake and use in individual labs, but to enable full scrutiny of all analysis steps, thus increasing experimental reproducibility and decreasing errors.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Can Proteomics Fill the Gap Between Genomics and Phenotypes?  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3aisotope labeling 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apeptides 3aproteomics 0aComputational pipeline 0aMass spectrometry 0aData analysis 0aStatistical analysis 0aWorkflow1 aSchoof, Erwin M.1 aCreixell, Pau1 aZheng, Yong1 aOlhovsky, Marina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9494-26371 aTian, Ruijun1 aSo, Jonathan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9919-24761 aVanderlaan, Rachel D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9396-75841 aPawson, Tony1 aLinding, Rune1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0420-48391 aColwill, Karen0 tJournal of proteomics.g2014 Apr. 04, v. 100 p.167-173dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2014.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04750naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245008700191300001600278520247800294592002802772650002302800650001002823650001702833650001802850650001102868650002102879650001202900650002002912650001902932650001102951650001602962650000902978650001802987650001003005650002003015650001603035650001403051650001403065650001903079650002303098650001303121650000703134650001503141650002403156650001403180650001003194650001603204650001603220650004703236650001203283650003103295650003003326650003603356650004803392650003003440650002103470650002403491650001403515650001103529650003103540650003803571650000903609650002503618650003903643700001903682700001303701700001503714700001803729773013303747856005503880852000903935655001203944IND4477363320221120111431.0120921e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447736332DNAL7 a220930352pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2011.01225.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, K. M.

A total of 1720 Ross PM3 broiler chicks (days old) were randomly assigned to four groups (430 in each) and reared for a period of 35 days. The diets of groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 were supplemented with 0%, 0.25%, 0.75% or 1.25% CA by weight respectively. Feed and faeces samples were collected weekly and analysed for acid insoluble ash, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P) and magnesium (Mg). The pH was measured in feed and faeces. At the age of 28 days, 10 birds from each group were slaughtered; tibiae were collected from each bird for the determination of bone mineral density, total ash, Ca, P, Mg and bone‐breaking strength, and blood was collected for the measurement of osteocalcin, serum CrossLaps®, Ca, P, Mg and 1,25(OH)2Vit‐D in serum. After finishing the trial on day 37, all chicks were slaughtered by using the approved procedure. Birds that were fed CA diets were heavier (average body weights of 2030, 2079 and 2086 g in the 0.25%, 0.75% and 1.25% CA groups, respectively, relative to the control birds (1986 g). Feed conversion efficiency (weight gain in g per kg of feed intake) was also higher in birds of the CA‐fed groups (582, 595 and 587 g/kg feed intake for 0.25%, 0.75% and 1.25% CA respectively), relative to the control birds (565 g/kg feed intake). The digestibility of Ca, P and Mg increased in the CA‐fed groups, especially for the diets supplemented with 0.25% and 0.75% CA. Support for finding was also indicated in the results of the analysis of the tibia. At slaughter, the birds had higher carcass weights and higher graded carcasses in the groups that were fed the CA diets. The estimated profit margin was highest for birds fed the diet containing 0.25% CA. Birds of the 0.75% CA group were found to have the second highest estimated profit margin. Addition of CA up to a level of 1.25% of the diet increased performance, feed conversion efficiency, carcass weight and carcass quality, but only in numerical terms. The addition of CA up to 0.75% significantly increased the digestibility of macro minerals, bone ash content, bone mineral density and bone strength of the broiler chicks. It may, therefore, be concluded that the addition of 0.75% CA in a standard diet is suitable for growth, carcass traits, macromineral digestibility and bone mineral density of broiler chicks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid insoluble ash 3ablood 3abone density 3abone strength 3aboning 3abroiler chickens 3acalcium 3acarcass quality 3acarcass weight 3achicks 3acitric acid 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afeces 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afinishing 3amagnesium 3ameat carcasses 3amineral metabolism 3aminerals 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aprofits and margins 3aslaughter 3atibia 3aweight gain 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBone Densityxdrug effects 2aBone and Bonesxchemistry 2aCalciumxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCitric Acidxpharmacology 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Supplements 2aDigestion 2aFemale 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMagnesiumxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMineralsxmetabolism 2aPhosphorusxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aSchaeublin, H.1 aWenk, C.1 aWanner, M.1 aLiesegang, A.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2012 Oct., v. 96, no. 5 p.808-817dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2011.01225.x  aDNAL 7aarticle04015naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245012300181300001800304520185800322592002802180650001402208650000802222650001602230650002002246650003002266650002402296650001602320650001602336650001202352650001602364650001202380650002302392650001102415650002202426650001502448650001102463650002002474650001402494650000902508650001202517650001802529650002402547653002002571653001102591653001702602653001502619653002302634653003702657653002702694700003102721700003202752700003302784700003002817700002902847700003102876700002102907773034302928856008503271852000903356655001203365IND60729057320221119233455.0210527e20210409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072905732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2020.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamírez Vélez, Robinson,10aSerum leptin as a mediator of the influence of insulin resistance on hepatic steatosis in youths with excess adiposity  ap. 1308-1316.  aThe relationship between insulin resistance (IR) and hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) is well known; however, the extent to which the satiety hormone leptin acts as a confounder or mediator in this relationship is uncertain. We examined whether the association between IR and hepatic steatosis is mediated by leptin in Colombian adolescents with excess adiposity.A total of 122 adolescents (mean age: 13.4 years; 68% girls) participated in the study. We assessed body composition, hepatic steatosis (as defined by the controlled attenuation parameter [CAP]), cardiometabolic risk factors (body mass index, waist circumference, body composition), biochemical variables (leptin, insulin, glucose, lipid profile, cardiometabolic Z-score, transaminases, etc.), and physical fitness (cardiorespiratory fitness and grip strength). Partial correlation, regression, and mediation analyses were conducted using the Barron and Kenny framework.Ninety-two youths (75.4%) had IR. Mediation analysis revealed a positive relationship between Homeostasis Model Assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) and CAP (βdᵢᵣ = 3.414, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.012 to 5.816, p < 0.001), which was attenuated when leptin was included in the model, thus indicating that leptin mediates this relationship (βᵢₙd = 1.074, 95% CI: 0.349 to 2.686, p < 0.001). The percentage of the total effect mediated by leptin was 21%. Regarding sex, the mediation effect of leptin remains significant among boys (βᵢₙd = 0.962, 95% CI: 0.009 to 2.615, p < 0.001), but not in girls (βᵢₙd = 0.991, 95% CI: 1.263 to 5.483, p = 0.477).The findings are clinically relevant to consider leptin levels as a surrogate marker of insulin sensitivity when assessing youths with excess adiposity and/or suspected Nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3aage 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3acardiorespiratory fitness 3aconfidence interval 3acorrelation 3afatty liver 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3aleptin 3alipid composition 3ametabolism 3amodels 3amuscle strength 3anutrition 3arisk 3asatiety 3atransaminases 3awaist circumference 0aLiver steatosis 0aLeptin 0aRisk factors 0aOverweight 0aInsulin resistance 0aControlled attenuation parameter 0aTransient elastography1 aGonzález-Ruíz, Katherine1 aGonzález Jiménez, Emilio,1 aSchmidt-RioValle, Jacqueline1 aCorrea-Rodríguez, María1 aGarcía-Hermoso, Antonio1 aPalomino-Echeverría, Sara1 aIzquierdo, Mikel0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2021 Apr. 09, v. 31, no. 4 p.1308-1316dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245008700177300001500264520120400279592002801483650001101511650002101522650002001543650002301563650002001586650001301606650001301619650001201632650001401644653001001658653002701668653002101695653000901716653002901725700001901754700003401773700002101807700002801828700002301856773010101879856008701980852000902067655001202076IND60539213120221121174148.0190214e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053921312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeuillassier, Lionel10aTolerance of apexes of coral Pocillopora damicornis L. to cryoprotectant solutions  ap. 96-106.  aIn this study, we investigated the tolerance of Pocillopora damicornis apexes to treatments with solutions containing penetrating and non-penetrating cryoprotective agents (CPAs). CPAs were employed individually or in binary, tertiary or quaternary solutions. In some experiments apexes were treated successively with two CPA solutions with increasing total concentration. P. damicornis apexes withstood exposure for up to 30min to solutions containing 0.6–0.8M sucrose (Suc) or trehalose (Tre). When apexes were treated with binary cryoprotectant solutions containing Suc and ethylene glycol (EG), methanol (Meth), dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) or glycerol (Gly), the CPAs employed in combination with Suc could be ranked in the following order of decreasing tolerance: EG>Meth>Me2SO>Gly. P. damicornis apexes tolerated exposure to complex CPA solutions containing Suc, Me2SO, EG and/or Meth with a total molarity of 2.45M. In experiments where two successive CPA solutions were employed, apexes withstood treatment with the second, more concentrated solution at 0°C for up to 10min. These preliminary results pave the way to the development of a cryopreservation protocol for P. damicornis apexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorals 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aethylene glycol 3aglycerol 3amethanol 3asucrose 3atrehalose 0aCoral 0aPocillopora damicornis 0aCryopreservation 0aApex 0aCryoprotectant solutions1 aRomans, Pascal1 aEngelmann-Sylvestre, Isabelle1 aMasanet, Patrick1 aBarthélemy, Dominique,1 aEngelmann, Florent0 tCryobiology.g2014 Feb., v. 68, no. 1 p.96-106dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001100148245008500159300001600244520128800260592002801548650002101576650001401597650001901611650001701630650001101647650001901658650001601677650001101693650001701704650003701721650002001758650002201778650000901800650003601809650003201845653001101877653001101888653001401899653001901913700001601932700001701948700001901965700001401984700005601998773012102054856008202175852000902257655001202266IND60533097520221120195140.0160728e20141205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053309752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.10.1342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Lu10aLeptin confers protection against TNF-α-induced apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes  ap. 126-132.  aLeptin, an important adipose-derived hormone, is recognized as a crucial protein in energy homeostasis. Recent studies indicated that leptin is associated with cardiac pathophysiology, however, the role and mechanisms of leptin in cardiomyocytes apoptosis are poorly understood. Here we investigated whether leptin exerted protective effect on cardiomyocytes exposed to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and the possible mechanisms. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were subjected to TNF-α in the presence or absence of leptin. By FITC/Annexin V flow cytometry and Western blot, we noticed that TNF-α increased Annexin V binding and cleaved caspase-3/PARP, which were attenuated by leptin pretreatment. Moreover, leptin protected cardiomyocytes against mitochondrial apoptosis by inhibiting cytochrome C elevation and Bcl-2 decreasing. TNF-α-induced P38 MAPK and NF-κB activation were abolished by leptin addition, and the P38 and NF-κB inhibitor, SB203580 and Bay117082, also mitigated the apoptotic effect of TNF-α, indicating that their activation might be responsible for the apoptosis in TNF-α-treated cardiomyocytes. Therefore, leptin conferred anti-apoptotic effect in cardiomyocytes exposed to TNF-α possibly by inhibiting TNF-α-activated P38 MAPK and NF-κB pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3acardiomyocytes 3acytochrome c 3aenergy 3aflow cytometry 3ahomeostasis 3aleptin 3amitochondria 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3apathophysiology 3aprotective effect 3arats 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aLeptin 0aTNF-α 0aApoptosis 0aCardiomyocytes1 aZhao, Yanbo1 aXu, Shengjie1 aJin, Chongying1 aWang, Min1 aFu, Guosheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3718-92870 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Dec. 05, v. 455 p.126-132dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.10.1343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03643naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245017600167300001400343520131000357592002801667650004401695650001901739650002101758650001201779650001301791650001701804650002801821650002101849650002601870650001101896650001101907650000701918650001301925650001501938650001601953650003301969650001502002650001002017650001602027653004602043653003102089653003502120653004202155653003102197653003602228653004502264653004402309653004002353653005702393653001302450653002802463653003302491653002802524653003202552653003202584653001502616700001502631700001802646700001402664700001802678700001702696700001402713773009802727856008702825852000902912655001202921IND60628518420221117222757.0190402e20190630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062851842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.1032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Wenmin10aPreparation process optimization of pig bone collagen peptide-calcium chelate using response surface methodology and its structural characterization and stability analysis  ap. 80-89.  aIn this study, alcalase and neutrase were used in combination to prepare collagen peptides with high calcium binding ability. The optimal conditions for the preparation of peptide-calcium chelate (mass ratio of peptide/calcium of 4.5:1 for 40 min at 50 °C and pH 9) were determined by response surface methodology (RSM), under which a calcium chelating rate of 78.38% was obtained. The results of Ultraviolet–Visible (UV–Vis), fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra synthetically indicated that calcium could be chelated by carboxyl oxygen and amino nitrogen atoms of collagen peptides, thus forming peptide-calcium chelate. The chelate was stable at various temperatures and pH values, and exhibited excellent stability in the gastrointestinal environment, which could promote calcium absorption in human gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, Caco-2 cell monolayer model was used to investigate the effect of peptide-calcium chelate on promoting calcium absorption. Results showed that peptide-calcium chelate could significantly improve calcium transport in Caco-2 cell monolayer and reverse the inhibition of calcium absorption by phosphate and phytate. The findings provide a scientific basis for developing new calcium supplements and the high-value utilization of pig bone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aamino nitrogen 3abinding capacity 3acalcium 3acollagen 3afluorescence 3agastrointestinal system 3ahuman cell lines 3aintestinal absorption 3amodels 3aoxygen 3apH 3apeptides 3aphosphates 3aphytic acid 3aresponse surface methodology 3asubtilisin 3aswine 3atemperature 0aCalcium dichloride (PubChem CID: 5284359) 0aHexane (PubChem CID: 8058) 0aCitric acid (PubChem CID: 311) 0aSodium hydroxide (PubChem CID: 14798) 0aEthanol (PubChem CID: 702) 0aFormaldehyde (PubChem CID: 712) 0aTrichloroacetic acid (PubChem CID: 6421) 0aCholecalcifetrol (PubChem CID: 5280795) 0aSodium phytate (PubChem CID: 66391) 0aPotassium Phosphate, Monobasic (PubChem CID: 516951) 0aPig bone 0aCalcium-binding peptide 0aResponse surface methodology 0aPeptide-calcium chelate 0aStructural characterization 0aCaco-2 cell monolayer model 0aAbsorption1 aHe, Lichao1 aLiang, Yanhui1 aYue, Lili1 aPeng, Weiming1 aJin, Guofeng1 aMa, Meihu0 tFood chemistry.g2019 June 30, v. 284 p.80-89dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015000170300001800320520092200338592002801260650002101288650002001309650001401329650001101343650002201354650001501376650001101391650002001402650001701422650001701439650002101456650002401477650002301501650001301524650001101537653002401548653001601572653002501588653001901613700001801632700006701650700002701717700006501744773014401809856008501953852000902038655001202047IND60744273820221119020758.0210712e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074427382DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c035212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorabi, Hooman10aXylose-rich Horse Manure Hydrolysate as the Sole Carbon Source for Bacterial Production of Polyhydroxy Butyrate Using Engineered Escherichia coli  ap. 8946-8950.  aWe investigated the possibility of using horse manure hydrolysates (HMH) as the sole carbon source for bacterial production of polyhydroxy butyrate (PHB) by engineered Escherichia coli. HMH was prepared by acid hydrolysis of horse manure. Over 90% of toxic furan byproducts were removed to yield detoxified HMH (D-HMH). Chemical analysis of hydrolysates revealed the presence of xylose and arabinose at high concentrations. E. coli BL21 strain was genetically engineered to produce PHB when D-HMH or xylose (control) were used as the sole carbon feedstock. Cells were incubated for both 48 and 72 h followed by PHB extraction. Molecular weight measurements and thermal characterization of the PHB produced were similar whether the cells were fed D-HMH or xylose. Our results lead to a facile method for valorization of manure by introducing its hydrolysates as a sustainable feedstock for bacterial production of PHB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aacid hydrolysis 3aarabinose 3acarbon 3achemical analysis 3afeedstocks 3afurans 3agreen chemistry 3ahorse manure 3ahydrolysates 3amolecular weight 3apolyhydroxybutyrate 3athermal properties 3atoxicity 3axylose 0aManure hydrolysates 0aSustainable 0aPolyhydroxy Butyrate 0aWaste-to-Value1 aMosleh, Imann1 aDavachi, Seyed Mohammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7002-37081 aDavaritouchaee, Maryam1 aAbbaspourrad, Alireza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5617-92200 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 June 30, v. 9, no. 27 p.8946-8950dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c035213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04002naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111024002000143040001800163072000900181100001900190245013300209300001600342500002400358500002400382500001500406520143500421650002301856650002201879650001101901650002401912650001701936650002201953650001601975650001001991650001102001650001402012650002202026650002802048650000902076650001502085650002502100650002102125650001302146650002502159650001802184650001702202650004402219650001602263650001202279650001302291650005702304650001002361650001102371650000902382650008302391650000902474650009602483650005202579651000902631653005702640653001802697653002002715653002002735700001702755700001802772773011802790852000902908856008202917856011102999930003303110945002503143946001303168961001503181655001203196IND4388978420221122142038.0070315e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438897842DNAL7 a166180002pmid7 a10.1637/7397-062105R.12doi7 a10113/21272hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aAnderson, L.A.10aEpidemiological Investigation, Cleanup, and Eradication of Pullorum Disease in Adult Chickens and Ducks in Two Small-Farm Flocks  ap. 142-147.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-04  aPullorum disease causing acute septicemia and mortality in adult brown chickens was diagnosed in a small-farm chicken flock in Iowa. Also, Salmonella Pullorum was isolated from the intestine of one of four rats trapped on this index farm. Tracing movements of spent hens from the index farm resulted in identification of a second infected flock on a contact farm. Poultry on the contact farm were tested with the stained-antigen, rapid whole-blood test, and two ducks and one chicken gave positive reactions. Reactors were necropsied and cultures of appropriate tissues resulted in isolation of Salmonella Pullorum from one duck and the chicken. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis banding patterns of Salmonella Pullorum isolates from chickens on the index and contact farms, the duck, and the rat demonstrated that all isolates were genetically very similar. Both flocks were quarantined and depopulated and a detailed flock cleanup plan was created for both farms. After extensive cleaning and disinfection procedures were completed on the index farm, environmental monitoring and bioassays of trapped mice were conducted. Negative cultures of environmental swabs and trapped mice and negative blood tests of all birds conducted 4 mo after placement of a new flock on the index farm demonstrated that cleaning and disinfection methods used in this outbreak had successfully eliminated Salmonella Pullorum organisms from this farm. 3apoultry production 3aculling (animals) 3aadults 3aSalmonella Pullorum 3acase studies 3adisease detection 3asmall farms 3aducks 3aflocks 3abioassays 3adisease outbreaks 3apathogen identification 3arats 3aquarantine 3adisease surveillance 3apullorum disease 3achickens 3adisease transmission 3asalmonellosis 3adisinfection 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 2aAgriculture 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aDisease Outbreaksxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aDucks 2aFemale 2aMice 2aPoultry Diseasesxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aRats 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aSepsisxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 3aIowa 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Pullorum 0aadult animals 0adisease control 0acontrol methods1 aMiller, D.A.1 aTrampel, D.W.0 tAvian diseases.g2006 Mar., v.  50, no.  1 p.142-147dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/7397-062105R.13Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/21273Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070802b20070902c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/06/20  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle03142naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245017100177300001800348520163400366592002802000650001702028650003002045650002102075650001802096650001302114650003502127650001802162650001502180650000902195650001702204650001302221650002202234650001402256650002702270700003302297700002302330700002002353700001802373700002202391700002402413700002102437700001902458773011902477856005502596852000902651655001202660IND50069477420221121033036.0130926e19991215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006947742DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00939.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesbois, Christine14aThe CCKB/gastrin receptor is coupled to the regulation of enzyme secretion, protein synthesis and p70 S6 kinase activity in acinar cells from ElasCCKB transgenic mice  ap. 1003-1010.  aIn order to determine which physiological functions can be regulated by the pancreatic CCKB/gastrin receptor, studies were carried out on pancreatic acini from mice expressing transgenic CCKB/gastrin receptors in the exocrine pancreas (ElasCCKB mice). Acini were stimulated by sulfated gastrin in the presence of SR 27897 (1.8 µm), blocking endogenous CCKA receptors. After 30 min incubation with gastrin, the secretion of chymotrypsinogen and amylase showed superimposable monophasic dose–response curves. Enzyme secretion was detectable and maximal at 100 pm and 1 nm of gastrin, respectively. No increase in chymotrypsinogen and amylase mRNAs was detected for doses of gastrin which specifically occupy the CCKB/gastrin receptor. In contrast, gastrin stimulated total protein synthesis in isolated acini from ElasCCKB mice. [³⁵S]Methionine incorporation into total proteins was increased dose‐dependently to a maximum for 30 pm gastrin and inhibited with higher doses (> 300 pm). Gastrin stimulated p70 S6 kinase activity for concentrations ranging from 10 pm to 1 nm. Gastrin‐stimulated p70 S6 kinase activity and protein synthesis were blocked by rapamycin and wortmannin. Therefore, in ElasCCKB mice acinar cells, the CCKB/gastrin receptor mediates enzyme release and protein synthesis. However, a more efficient coupling of the CCKB/gastrin receptor to protein synthesis than to enzyme secretion was demonstrated. CCKB/gastrin receptor‐stimulated protein synthesis likely results from an enhancement of mRNA translation and involves phosphatidyl inositol 3‐kinase and p70 S6 kinase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacinar cells 3acholecystokinin receptors 3achymotrypsinogen 3adose response 3agastrins 3agenetically modified organisms 3amessenger RNA 3amethionine 3amice 3amyo-inositol 3apancreas 3aprotein synthesis 3asecretion 3atranslation (genetics)1 aLe Huërou‐Luron, Isabelle1 aDufresne, Marlène1 aEstival, Agnès1 aClerc, Pascal1 aRomé, Véronique1 aClemente, François1 aGuilloteau, Paul1 aFourmy, Daniel0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g1999 Dec. 15, v. 266, no. 3 p.1003-1010dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00939.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03767naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003500149245018500184300001400369500001500383520231900398592002802717650001302745650002702758650001002785650001802795650002802813650002002841650001502861650000802876650001402884650001502898650001702913653000902930653002102939653002702960653002202987653001803009653001203027653000803039700002103047700001903068700001703087773008903104856008303193852000903276655001203285IND60554662220221119053031.0161024e20140613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055466222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2014.01.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero-Rodríguez, M.

Characterization of Quercus ilex seed and Pinus radiata needle proteomes by using SEQUEST and custom databases  ap. 85-91.  a2019-12-06  aNowadays the most used pipeline for protein identification consists in the comparison of the MS/MS spectra to reference databases. Search algorithms compare obtained spectra to an in silico digestion of a sequence database to find exact matches. In this context, the database has a paramount importance and will determine in a great deal the number of identifications and its quality, being this especially relevant for non-model plant species. Using a single Viridiplantae database (NCBI, UniProt) and TAIR is not the best choice for non-model species since they are underrepresented in databases resulting in poor identification rates. We demonstrate how it is possible to improve the rate and quality of identifications in two orphan species, Quercus ilex and Pinus radiata, by using SEQUEST and a combination of public (Viridiplantae NCBI, UniProt) and a custom-built specific database which contained 593,294 and 455,096 peptide sequences (Quercus and Pinus, respectively). These databases were built after gathering and processing (trimming, contiging, 6-frame translation) publicly available RNA sequences, mostly ESTs and NGS reads. A total of 149 and 1533 proteins were identified from Quercus seeds and Pinus needles, representing a 3.1- or 1.5-fold increase in the number of protein identifications and scores compared to the use of a single database. Since this approach greatly improves the identification rate, and is not significantly more complicated or time consuming than other approaches, we recommend its routine use when working with non-model species.In this work we demonstrate how the construction of a custom database (DB) gathering all available RNA sequences and its use in combination with Viridiplantae public DBs (NCBI, UniProt) significantly improve protein identification when working with non-model species. Protein identification rate and quality is higher to those obtained in routine procedures based on using only one database (commonly Viridiplantae from NCBI), as we demonstrated analyzing Quercus seeds and Pine needles. The proposed approach based on the building of a custom database is not difficult or time consuming, so we recommend its routine use when working with non-model species.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteomics of non-model organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3atranslation (genetics) 3aseeds 3aPinus radiata 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aconifer needles 3aproteomics 3aRNA 3adatabases 3aalgorithms 3aQuercus ilex 0aESTs 0aCustom databases 0aProtein identification 0aNon-model species 0aViridiplantae 0aSEQUEST 0aNGS1 aPascual, Jesús,1 aValledor, Luis1 aJorrín, J.,0 tJournal of proteomics.g2014 June 13, v. 105 p.85-91dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2014.01.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03759naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245005400215300001600269520249000285592002802775596004102803650001002844650001402854650001902868650001302887650001102900650001402911650001202925650001602937650001602953650001102969650000902980651001702989651001703006700002003023700002003043700002303063700001903086773012903105856008203234852000903316655001203325IND60744274120221119020248.0210712e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074427412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-021-01874-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdekola, Oluwadunsin E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6936-679710aExtent and symmetry of tail moult in Amur Falcons  ap. 655-667.  aAmur Falcons Falco amurensis undergo one of the most extreme migrations of any raptor, crossing the Indian Ocean between their Asian breeding grounds and non-breeding areas in southern Africa. Adults are thought to replace all their flight feathers on the wintering grounds, but juveniles only replace some tail feathers before migrating. We compare the extent and symmetry of flight feather moult in a large sample of Amur Falcons killed at communal roosts during two hailstorms in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa in March 2019, shortly before their northward migration. Most adults had completed replacing their remiges, with only a few still growing 1–3 feathers (mainly secondaries), but most were still growing their tail feathers. Juveniles only replaced tail feathers. Moult typically was distal from the central rectrices, but 25% of adults and 1% of juveniles replaced the outer tail first, and a few individuals exhibited other moult patterns (simultaneous moult across the tail, or among the inner and outer feathers). These different moult strategies were independent of sex. Adults that replaced the outer tail first typically had replaced a greater proportion of the rectrices (mean ± SD; 0.81 ± 0.19) than adults starting from the central tail (0.17 ± 0.08). Proportionally fewer distal moulting adults were killed on 9 March than 21 March, resulting in the average proportion of rectrices replaced by adults decreasing between the two storm events from 0.52 ± 0.26 to 0.43 ± 0.23. By comparison, juvenile tail moult increased from 9 March (0.34 ± 0.18) to 21 March (0.40 ± 0.15). Overall, the probability of replacement for T1 was similar for adults (0.82) and juveniles (0.83), but adults were more likely to have replaced T2–6 (0.40–0.45) than juveniles (0.18 for T2 and 0.04–0.07 for T3–6). Asymmetry in tail moult was greater at T1 for adults (15%) than juveniles (10%), but asymmetry for T2 to T6 was greater in juveniles (3–10%) than adults (1–4%), especially given the greater probability of feather replacement in adults. Despite these differences, the degree of asymmetry was less than expected by random replacement across all rectrices in both age classes. Interestingly, moult tended to be more advanced on the left than right side of the tail. The extent of tail moult was correlated with body condition in adults and juveniles, suggesting that moult pattern might be used as an indicator of fitness in falcons.  aPublisher supplied data  a110950cNational Research Foundation 3aFalco 3aasymmetry 3abody condition 3afeathers 3aflight 3ajuveniles 3amolting 3aornithology 3aprobability 3astorms 3atail 3aIndian Ocean 3aSouth Africa1 aAllan, David G.1 aBernitz, Zephne1 aDlungwana, Wiseman1 aRyan, Peter G.0 tJournal of ornithology.g2021 July, v. 162, no. 3 p.655-667dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-021-01874-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03534naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245011300210300001800323506007600341520176900417592002802186506003702214650001502251650001002266650001102276650001402287650001402301650001702315650002802332650001502360653002902375653001702404653000802421700002302429700002002452700002302472700001802495700001902513700001202532700001902544700002302563700002102586700002402607700002402631700002602655700002002681773019102701856007902892852000902971655001202980IND60230496120221207082049.0150614e20150127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023049612DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14131651122doi7 aPMC43138442pmcid7 a255834812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartesaghi, Stefano10aInhibition of oxidative metabolism leads to p53 genetic inactivation and transformation in neural stem cells  ap. 1059-1064.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlterations of mitochondrial metabolism and genomic instability have been implicated in tumorigenesis in multiple tissues. High-grade glioma (HGG), one of the most lethal human neoplasms, displays genetic modifications of Krebs cycle components as well as electron transport chain (ETC) alterations. Furthermore, the p53 tumor suppressor, which has emerged as a key regulator of mitochondrial respiration at the expense of glycolysis, is genetically inactivated in a large proportion of HGG cases. Therefore, it is becoming evident that genetic modifications can affect cell metabolism in HGG; however, it is currently unclear whether mitochondrial metabolism alterations could vice versa promote genomic instability as a mechanism for neoplastic transformation. Here, we show that, in neural progenitor/stem cells (NPCs), which can act as HGG cell of origin, inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism leads to p53 genetic inactivation. Impairment of respiration via inhibition of complex I or decreased mitochondrial DNA copy number leads to p53 genetic loss and a glycolytic switch. p53 genetic inactivation in ETC-impaired neural stem cells is caused by increased reactive oxygen species and associated oxidative DNA damage. ETC-impaired cells display a marked growth advantage in the presence or absence of oncogenic RAS, and form undifferentiated tumors when transplanted into the mouse brain. Finally, p53 mutations correlated with alterations in ETC subunit composition and activity in primary glioma-initiating neural stem cells. Together, these findings provide previously unidentified insights into the relationship between mitochondria, genomic stability, and tumor suppressive control, with implications for our understanding of brain cancer pathogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaerobiosis 3abrain 3ahumans 3aneoplasms 3aoncogenes 3apathogenesis 3areactive oxygen species 3astem cells 0amitochondrial metabolism 0abrain cancer 0ap531 aGraziano, Vincenzo1 aGalavotti, Sara1 aHenriquez, Nick V.1 aBetts, Joanne1 aSaxena, Jayeta1 aA, Deli1 aKarlsson, Anna1 aMartins, L.

We aimed to verify whether TMI has better accuracy than BMI in discriminating central obesity and hypertension in adolescents with overweight.This monocentric and retrospective cross-sectional study included 3749 pupils, 1889 males and 1860 females, aged 12–13. BMI (kg/m²) was calculated and expressed as percentiles and as z-scores. TMI (kg/m³) was calculated, and we used pre-defined cut-off previously proposed by Peterson et al.. For central obesity we adopted the Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) discriminatory value of 0.5. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure ≥95th percentile of age- sex-, and height-specific references recommended by NHBPEP Working Group. The discriminant ability of TMI, BMI and BMI z-score, with respect to central obesity and hypertension, was investigated using non-parametric receiver operating characteristic analysis.The overall misclassification rate for central obesity was 8.88% for TMI vs 14.10% for BMI percentiles and vs 14.92% for BMI z-scores (P < 0.001). The overall misclassification rate for hypertension was 7.50% for TMI vs 22.03% for BMI percentiles and vs 25.19% for BMI z-scores (P < 0.001).TMI is a superior body fat index and it could discriminate body fat distribution more accurately than BMI. This supports the use of TMI, in association with WHtR, to characterize adolescents with overweight and high cardio-metabolic risk. Our analysis needs to be extended to other ethnic groups and replicated in a wider age range and in longitudinal studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3aage 3ablood pressure 3abody fat distribution 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3ahypertension 3ametabolism 3anutrition 3aobesity 3arisk 3awaist-to-height ratio 0aTri-ponderal mass index (TMI) 0aBody mass index (BMI) 0aWaist-to-height ratio (WHtR) 0aCentral obesity 0aHypertension 0aAdolescents1 aCapitanio, Gloria1 aMilani, Valentina1 aAmbrogi, Federico1 aMatelloni, Irene A.1 aBasilico, Sara1 aDubini, Carola1 aSironi, Francesca M.1 aStella, Elisabetta1 aCastaldi, Silvana1 aSecchi, Francesco1 aMenicanti, Lorenzo1 aIacobellis, Gianluca1 aCorsi Romanelli, Massimiliano M.1 aCarruba, Michele O.1 aMorricone, Lelio F.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2021 May 06, v. 31, no. 5 p.1613-1621dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2021.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01284naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245005500170300001600225520030300241592002800544650001000572650001500582650001800597650002800615650002300643653001700666653001900683653001400702653001500716653002800731773009700759856008100856852000900937655001200946IND60520518220221117182723.0160521e20120704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052051822DNAL7 a10.2478/v10200-012-0005-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffeins, Christel10aOn Baltic amber inclusions treated in an autoclave  ap. 165-183.  aInclusions from Baltic amber processed in an autoclave are described, illustrated, and the various degrees of artificial modifications are commented upon.

Food‐chain length is predicted to be shorter in ecosystems subjected to greater disturbance because longer chains are theoretically less resilient to perturbation. Moreover, food‐chain length is expected to be longer in larger ecosystems because increasing ecosystem size increases species richness and stabilizes predator–prey interactions, or increases total resource availability. Here we test the roles of disturbance and ecosystem size in determining the food‐chain length of terrestrial food webs on Bahamian islands. We found that disturbance affected the identity of top predators, but did not change food‐chain length because alternative top predators occupied similar trophic positions. On the other hand, a 10⁶‐fold increase in ecosystem size elevated food‐chain length by one trophic level. We suggest that the effect of disturbance on food‐chain length is weak when alternate top predators are trophic omnivores and have similar trophic positions. This and previous work in lakes suggest that ecosystem size may be a strong determinant of food‐chain length in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aspecies diversity 3apredation 3aanthropogenic activities 3aecosystems 3afood chain 3aomnivores 3apredator-prey relationships 3aBahamas 0afood webs 0atrophic relationships1 aSpiller, David A.1 aPost, David M.0 tEcology.g2008 Nov., v. 89, no. 11 p.3001-3007dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-1990.13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03051naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003300152245016400185300001600349500001500365520157400380592002801954650001501982650001501997650001302012650001602025650002102041650001402062650002202076650001902098650001602117650001102133653002302144653002302167653002402190653002302214653002302237700003202260700002102292700002302313700002702336700002402363773009802387856008702485852000902572655001202581IND60623677920221119174920.0190203e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062367792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva-Mosqueda, Dulce María10aIntermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell under internal reforming: Critical operating conditions, associated problems and their impact on the performance  ap. 625-640.  a2019-12-06  aTo simulate realistic operating conditions and analyze their effect on the performance of planar intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell systems, a large-area (11 × 11 cm2) anode-supported single cell was tested for ∼500 h, at 650 °C and 245 mA/cm2, corresponding to 43% of fuel utilization, running on a simulated pre-reformate natural gas composition. To correlate the evolution in the cell performance (i.e. voltage loss; total resistance) with specific thermo-fluid-physicochemical processes, localized gas analyses and temperature measurements through the anode surface, using a very particular spot-sampling set-up, as well as electrochemical impedance spectra and polarization curves, were frequently carried out. The impedance spectra have been analyzed through the distribution of relaxation times method and the cell study complemented with a post-mortem analysis. During its operation, the cell sequentially experienced several events to which thermal-cycling and intrinsic degradation have been correlated. Experimental results revealed that cathode humidification was the dominant contribution to the performance degradation, where strontium segregation has been observed and the formation of some insulating phases is suspected. This work is one of the first attempts to carry out an endurance test with real-time diagnosis by in-situ and in-operando gas and temperature analysis, thus monitoring in real conditions the electrochemical, chemical and thermal activity of the anode side in a commercial single solid oxide fuel cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3afuel cells 3amonitoring 3acathodes 3anatural gas 3aelectrochemistry 3astrontium 3aendurance testing 3ahumidification 3atemperature 3aanodes 0aInternal reforming 0aelectric potential 0aCathode degradation 0aLarge-area IT-SOFC 0aWater accumulation1 aElizalde-Blancas, Francisco1 aPumiglia, Davide1 aSantoni, Francesca1 aBoigues-Muñoz, Carlos1 aMcPhail, Stephen J.0 tApplied energy.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 235 p.625-640dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04340naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245015700162300001000319500000900329520305800338592002803396650001003424650001603434650001403450650001803464650001203482650002103494650001603515650001703531650001103548650002003559650001503579650001303594650002303607650001003630700001903640700001903659700001603678773012603694856007703820852000903897655001203906IND60677210320221120084001.0191123e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067721032DNAL7 a10.221751/rmc2017.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPohlman, F. W.10aEffects of Labeling and Consumer Health Trends on Preferred Ground Beef Color Characteristics, Fat Content, and Palatability in Simulated Retail Display  ap. 9.  aepub  aObjectivesNutritional concerns and attempts to limit fat in the diet over the past decades have impacted the protein market, decreasing red meat consumption as well as prompting the advent of lean and extra lean ground beef. Such lean blends of ground beef may suffer in palatability, however, resulting in less satisfied consumers turning to other protein sources. While consumers are demanding lean ground beef, fatter blends may be more palatable. This study seeks to bridge the gap between perceived health and palatability by evaluating preferred fat content and instrumental color characteristics between labeled and unlabeled packages of ground beef in simulated retail display and comparing this data to preferred palatability characteristics in taste sampling. Materials and MethodsParticipants were asked to identify the relative importance of characteristics commonly used in purchasing ground beef (color, label, fat content, company, and price) and select a preferred package of ground beef from labeled and unlabeled sections consisting of 4, 10, 20, and 27% fat content. Instrumental color data (CIE L*, a*, b*, hue, and chroma) and their main drivers (oxymyoglobin proportion) were also collected. Participants then completed a blind taste sampling of ground beef with variable fat contents as previously described and were asked to evaluate samples on juiciness, bind, beef flavor, off flavor, and overall impression. Data were evaluated through the Mixed Model procedure of SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC). ResultsColor, fat, and price were found to be significantly more important (P < 0.05) than label, which was significantly more important than company for package preference. No trend toward fatter or leaner blends was found between labeled and unlabeled selections, with 62.64% of participants selecting identical packages between the 2 sections. The 20% fat treatment was the most frequently selected product in both labeled and unlabeled sections, however the 2 leaner blends combined garnered more preferred selections than the 2 fatter blends (56.67 vs. 43.33%, respectively). Instrumental color data found significant trends toward a lighter product and increasing L* value with increasing fat content as well as decreasing oxymyoglobin proportion with increasing fat content. No significant differences were found between the blends for any trait in sensory taste evaluation. ConclusionThese results suggest that while consumers have specific preferences when purchasing ground beef that can be replicated without a label using visual inspection alone, they are less discerning between cooked ground beef of different fat contents. This may explain the continued demand for lean ground beef, as consumers in this study found no significant differences in palatability between ground beef differing in fat content from 4 to 27%.

Evidence supports that 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) rs72613567 plays a role in NAFLD development by affecting lipid homeostasis. Since lipid droplets may accumulate in the kidneys and contribute to renal injury, we investigated the association between the HSD17B13 rs72613567 variant and markers of renal function/injury in NAFLD.We measured estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary/serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (u-ACR) in individuals with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Multivariable regression analyses were undertaken to examine the associations between the HSD17B13 rs72613567 variant and markers of renal function/injury. Individuals were stratified by HSD17B13 rs72613567 genotypes into −/−, A/- and A/A groups. HSD17B13 rs72613567 genotypes were not significantly associated with eGFR and urinary/serum NGAL levels. Conversely, the prevalence of abnormal albuminuria in the A/- + A/A group was lower than in the −/− group (4.92% vs. 19.35%, p = 0.001). Additionally, the mean u-ACR levels were lower among carriers of the A/- or A/A genotypes with coexisting hypertension or diabetes, than among those with the −/− genotype. The risk of abnormal albuminuria (adjusted-odds ratio 0.16, p = 0.001) remained significantly lower in the A/- + A/A group after adjustment for established renal risk factors and histologic severity of NAFLD.HSD17B13 rs72613567: A allele is associated with a lower risk of having abnormal albuminuria, but not with lower eGFR or urinary/serum NGAL levels, in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbuminuria 3aalleles 3ablood serum 3adiabetes 3afatty liver 3agenotype 3aglomerular filtration rate 3ahistology 3ahomeostasis 3ahypertension 3akidney diseases 3alipids 3ametabolism 3aneutrophils 3anutrition 3aoxidoreductases 3aprevalence 3arisk 0a17-Beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 0aNonalcoholic fatty liver disease 0aAlbuminuria 0aChronic kidney disease 0aLiver biopsy 0aNAFLD 0aNASH 0aCKD 0aHSD17B13 0aBMI 0aAST 0aALT 0aGGT 0aHOMA-IR 0aeGFR 0aACR 0aNGAL 0aBUN 0aSCr 0aUA 0aALB 0aALP1 aWang, Ting-Yao1 aZheng, Kenneth I.1 aZhang, Hao-Yang1 aWang, Xiaodong,1 aTargher, Giovanni1 aByrne, Christopher D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6322-77531 aChen, Yong-Ping1 aYuan, Wei-Jie1 aJin, Yan1 aZheng, Ming-Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4984-26310 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2021 June 07, v. 31, no. 6 p.1822-1831dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2021.02.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245015600173300001800329520167500347592002802022650001702050650001702067650000902084650001302093650002002106650001102126650001702137650002202154650002202176650001302198650001102211650001302222650001702235650002202252650001702274651001502291653002102306653002402327653001502351653003202366653002302398653003702421700002402458700002202482773010002504856008702604852000902691655001202700IND60623678020221119174845.0190203e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062367802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShiraishi, Kenji10aGeospatial multi-criteria analysis for identifying high priority clean energy investment opportunities: A case study on land-use conflict in Bangladesh  ap. 1457-1467.  aBangladesh is a globally important emerging economy with rapidly increasing energy demand. The Bangladeshi government's primary capacity expansion plan is to install 13.3 GW of new coal by 2021, including the 1.3 GW Rampal coal power plant to be developed in the Sundarbans. Inadequate geospatial and economic information on clean energy investment opportunities are often a significant barrier for policy makers. Our study helps fill this gap by applying a new method to assess energy investment opportunities, with focus on understanding land-use conflicts, particularly important in this context as Bangladesh is constrained on land for agriculture, human settlements, and ecological preservation. By extending a geospatial multi-criteria analysis model (MapRE) we analyze the cost of various renewable energy generation technologies based on resource availability and key siting criteria such as proximity to transmission and exclusion from steep slopes, dense settlements or ecologically sensitive areas. We find there is more utility-scale solar potential than previously estimated, which can be developed at lower costs than coal power and with minimal cropland tradeoff. We also find significant potential for decentralized roof-top solar in commercial and residential areas. Even with a conservative land use program that reserves maximum land for agriculture and human settlement, there is more renewable energy capacity than needed to support Bangladeshi growth. This study provides critical and timely information for capacity expansion planning in South Asia and demonstrates the use of geospatial models to support decision-making in data-limited contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclean energy 3acoal 3acropland 3adecision making 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3ahuman settlements 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3amodels 3aplanning 3apower plants 3aresidential areas 3asolar energy 3aBangladesh 0aRenewable energy 0aGeospatial modeling 0aSouth Asia 0aCapacity expansion planning 0aSustainable energy 0aMulti-criteria decision analysis1 aShirley, Rebekah G.1 aKammen, Daniel M.0 tApplied energy.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 235 p.1457-1467dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002500179245010200204300001800306506007600324520125800400506003701658650000801695650001501703650001501718650002001733650002801753650001101781650003901792700002501831700001701856773008101873852000901954856007801963856007402041930003302115946001102148990002302159655001202182IND4391717320221207075008.0070523e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439171732DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm1152doi7 aPMC18888302pmcid7 a174399632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashiguchi, Kazunari10aRecruitment of DNA repair synthesis machinery to sites of DNA damage/repair in living human cells  ap. 2913-2923.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe eukaryotic sliding DNA clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), is essential for DNA replication and repair synthesis. In order to load the ring-shaped, homotrimeric PCNA onto the DNA double helix, the ATPase activity of the replication factor C (RFC) clamp loader complex is required. Although the recruitment of PCNA by RFC to DNA replication sites has well been documented, our understanding of its recruitment during DNA repair synthesis is limited. In this study, we analyzed the accumulation of endogenous and fluorescent-tagged proteins for DNA repair synthesis at the sites of DNA damage produced locally by UVA-laser micro-irradiation in HeLa cells. Accumulation kinetics and in vitro pull-down assays of the large subunit of RFC (RFC140) revealed that there are two distinct modes of recruitment of RFC to DNA damage, a simultaneous accumulation of RFC140 and PCNA caused by interaction between PCNA and the extreme N-terminus of RFC140 and a much faster accumulation of RFC140 than PCNA at the damaged site. Furthermore, RFC140 knock-down experiments showed that PCNA can accumulate at DNA damage independently of RFC. These results suggest that immediate accumulation of RFC and PCNA at DNA damage is only partly interdependent.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aDNA replication 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3ahumans 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen1 aMatsumoto, Yoshihiro1 aYasui, Akira0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 May, v. 35, no. 9 p.2913-2923x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1153Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070523b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02883naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002400179245012800203300001800331506007600349520127500425506003701700650002801737650002201765650001001787650001301797650002401810650001301834650001301847650001301860650001601873650002001889650002901909650001701938650002701955700001901982700002002001700002402021700002302045773008102068852000902149856007802158856007402236930003302310946001102343990002302354655001202377IND4391717920221207074949.0070523e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439171792DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm1912doi7 aPMC18888092pmcid7 a174399572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMihailovich, Marija10aComplex translational regulation of BACE1 involves upstream AUGs and stimulatory elements within the 5' untranslated region  ap. 2975-2985.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACE1 is the protease responsible for the production of amyloid-β peptides that accumulate in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. BACE1 expression is regulated at the transcriptional, as well as post-transcriptional level. Very high BACE1 mRNA levels have been observed in pancreas, but the protein and activity were found mainly in brain. An up-regulation of the protein has been described in some AD patients without a change in transcript levels. The features of BACE1 5' untranslated region (5' UTR), such as the length, GC content, evolutionary conservation and presence of upstream AUGs (uAUGs), indicate an important regulatory role of this 5' UTR in translational control. We demonstrate that, in brain and pancreas, almost all of the native BACE1 mRNA contains the full-length 5' UTR. RNA transfection and in vitro translation show that translation is mainly inhibited by the presence of the uAUGs. We provide a mutational analysis that highlight the second uAUG as the main inhibitory element while mutations of all four uAUGs fully de-repress translation. Furthermore, we have evidence that a sequence within the region 222-323 of the BACE1 5' UTR has a stimulatory effect on translation that might depend on the presence of trans-acting factors.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a5' untranslated regions 3aAlzheimer disease 3abrain 3amutation 3amutational analysis 3apancreas 3apatients 3apeptides 3aproteinases 3atransactivators 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransfection 3atranslation (genetics)1 aThermann, Rolf1 aGrohovaz, Fabio1 aHentze, Matthias W.1 aZacchetti, Daniele0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 May, v. 35, no. 9 p.2975-2985x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1913Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070523b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01797naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245010000171300001600271500002400287520090400311650001701215650001501232650001801247650002101265650001701286650001601303773009001319852000901409856008901418655001201507IND4463774820221122004041.0120802s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446377482DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00130-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiba, Lorraine L.10aEffect of storage period and temperature on resistant starch and β-glucan content in cornbread  ap. 493-498.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this study was to assess resistant starch development and β-glucan availability, as influenced by storage time and temperature. Cornbread was baked and freeze dried at −20 °C either whole or with the crust removed (crumb). Samples were stored in airtight containers at either 20 °C, 4 °C or −20 °C, for 2, 4 or 7 days, and analysed for resistant starch, β-glucans and starch damage. Resistant starch content in whole cornbread was 3.07 g/100 g [dry weight basis (dwb)] and 2.59 g/100 g (dwb) in the crumb. These levels increased with up to 4 days of storage, particularly at 4 °C. There was a decrease in resistant starch levels after 7 days of storage, with lowest levels at −20 °C. β-Glucan levels increased with storage. Starch damage percentage decreased with storage up to 4 days. These changes may be due to structural modification of components during storage. 3abeta-glucans 3acontainers 3afreeze drying 3aresistant starch 3astorage time 3atemperature0 tFood chemistry.g2003 Dec., v. 83, no. 4 p.493-498dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00130-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02212naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100003000149245011600179300001600295500002400311520088600335650002201221650001901243650002101262650002301283650002001306650001501326650002601341650001401367650001201381650003301393650001301426650002301439650001301462650002001475650002301495700002101518700003101539700002001570773009001590852000901680856008901689655001201778IND4463775220221122003904.0120802s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446377522DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00147-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMildner-Szkudlarz, Sylwia10aApplication of headspace—solid phase microextraction and multivariate analysis for plant oils differentiation  ap. 515-522.  aIncludes references  aApplication of multivariate analysis (MVA)—principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis—for the analysis of chromatographic and sensory data was investigated for volatiles of plant oils.

Multivariate analysis facilitates comparison of chromatographic profiles of volatile compounds characteristic for various plant oils and for monitoring oil quality in storage. 3aHelianthus annuus 3achromatography 3acluster analysis 3aheadspace analysis 3amicroextraction 3amonitoring 3amultivariate analysis 3aolive oil 3apeanuts 3aprincipal component analysis 3arapeseed 3asensory evaluation 3asoybeans 3astorage quality 3avolatile compounds1 aJelen, Henryk H.1 aZawirska-Wojtasiak, Renata1 aWasowicz, Erwin0 tFood chemistry.g2003 Dec., v. 83, no. 4 p.515-522dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00147-X3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02206naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245005000171300001600221500002400237520114300261650001801404650002101422650002501443650001801468650001701486650001801503650002101521650001401542650001101556650001901567650001401586650002101600700002301621773009001644852000901734856008901743655001201832IND4463775320221122004020.0120802s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446377532DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00148-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiokias, Sotirios10aAntioxidant properties of annatto carotenoids  ap. 523-529.  aIncludes references  aThe antioxidant effects of β-carotene, oil-soluble (bixin) and water-soluble (norbixin) annatto preparations and mixtures of these carotenoids with virgin olive oil polar extract were assessed in bulk olive oil and oil-in-water emulsions stored at 60 °C. Norbixin was the only carotenoid that inhibited the oxidative deterioration of lipids in both systems. Though bixin and β-carotene did not retard autoxidation, their mixtures with the polar extract from virgin olive oil enhanced the antioxidant effect of the olive oil extract. Norbixin (2 mM) was of similar activity to δ-tocopherol (0.1 mM) in stored oil. The combination of norbixin with ascorbic acid or ascorbyl palmitate in oil showed a reduction in formation of volatile oxidation products but not in peroxide value, compared with the analogous sample lacking norbixin. In olive oil-in-water emulsions, norbixin (2 mM) reduced hydroperoxide formation to a similar extent as δ-tocopherol (0.1 mM), which in turn was a better antioxidant than α-tocopherol. A synergistic effect between norbixin and ascorbic acid or ascorbyl palmitate was observed in the emulsion systems. 3aBixa orellana 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3aautoxidation 3abeta-carotene 3adelta-tocopherol 3aemulsions 3alipids 3aperoxide value 3asynergism 3avirgin olive oil1 aGordon, Michael H.0 tFood chemistry.g2003 Dec., v. 83, no. 4 p.523-529dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00148-13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02630naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002300179245008700202300001800289506007600307520118800383506003701571650002201608650001701630650002201647650001101669650000901680650002301689650002101712650002201733650002001755700002601775700001901801700001801820700002501838773008101863852000901944856007801953856007402031930003302105946001102138990002302149655001202172IND4391718320221207074942.0070523e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439171832DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm1992doi7 aPMC18888352pmcid7 a174399702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChillemi, Giovanni14aThe open state of human topoisomerase I as probed by molecular dynamics simulation  ap. 3032-3038.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe open state of human topoisomerase I has been probed by molecular dynamics simulation, starting from the coordinates of the closed structure of the protein complexed with DNA, after elimination of the 22-bp DNA duplex oligonucleotide. A repulsion force between the two lips of the protein has been introduced for a short time to induce destabilization of the local minimum, after which an unperturbed simulation has been carried out for 10 ns. The simulation shows that the protein undergoes a large conformational change due to rearrangements in the orientation of the protein domains, which however move as a coherent unit, fully maintaining their secondary and tertiary structures. Despite movements between the domains as large as 80-90 Å, the catalytic pentad remains preassembled, the largest deviation of the active site backbone atoms from the starting crystallographic structure being only 1.7 Å. Electrostatic calculation of the open protein structure shows that the protein displays a vast positive region with the active site residues located nearly at its center, in a conformation perfectly suited to interact with the negatively charged supercoiled DNA substrate.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA topoisomerase 3aactive sites 3achemical elements 3ahumans 3alips 3amolecular dynamics 3aoligonucleotides 3aprotein structure 3asupercoiled DNA1 aBruselles, Alessandro1 aFiorani, Paola1 aBueno, Susana1 aDesideri, Alessandro0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 May, v. 35, no. 9 p.3032-3038x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1993Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070523b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01987naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002300137245014900160300001800309500002400327520070900351650001601060650001801076650002801094650002801122650001201150650002201162650002201184650001101206650001201217650002601229650001501255650001601270650001501286700003401301700002101335773014701356852000901503856007701512655001201589IND4463773320221122003909.0120802s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446377332DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.12642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnston, Kelly L.10aPossible role for apple juice phenolic compounds in the acute modification of glucose tolerance and gastrointestinal hormone secretion in humans  ap. 1800-1805.  aIncludes references  aThe purpose of this study was to investigate whether naturally occurring phenolic compounds in apple juice had any physiological effects on plasma glucose concentrations and circulating gastrointestinal hormone profiles in volunteers. The results show that the consumption of a 25 g glucose load in commercial apple juice compared with that consumed in water has statistically significant effects on plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, GIP and GLP-1 in volunteers (N = 9) which appear to be consistent with delayed intestinal absorption of glucose. The exact mechanisms require further investigation but, tentatively, it is suggested that phloridzin and other polyphenols may be responsible. 3aapple juice 3ablood glucose 3agastrointestinal system 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ahormone secretion 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3aintestinal absorption 3aphloridzin 3apolyphenols 3avolunteers1 aClifford, M.

However, the spray drying process leads to changes in sensitive egg components, eg proteins, and affects the functional properties of whole egg after reconstitution. Knowledge of the influence of drying conditions on the resulting functionality is necessary to enable the production of dried egg with tailor-made properties for applications in different food products. Some of these relationships were determined using a pilot spray dryer for drying experiments and an appropriate statistical evaluation of the results. It could be demonstrated that higher temperatures during spray drying lead to a considerable decrease in the foaming properties of whole egg powder but increase the capability of emulsion stabilisation. Additionally, a simplified example demonstrates the use of these relationships for the selection of optimal drying conditions of whole egg with respect to its application in a cake with higher fat content. 3acakes 3adried eggs 3aeggs 3afoaming properties 3alipid content 3amanufacturing 3amicrobiological quality 3aproteins 3aspray drying 3atemperature1 aKiessling, Martina0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2002 Dec., v. 82, no. 15 p.1837-1841dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.12693Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03057naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002200137245012100159300001800280500002400298520176900322650002302091650001502114650002002129650001302149650001602162650001402178650001402192650001302206650001602219650000902235650001902244650000902263650001002272650001202282650001502294650000902309700002802318700001802346700001402364773014702378852000902525856007702534655001202611IND4463756620221121234055.0120731s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446375662DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.11462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHouse, William A.10aPotential for increasing the amounts of bioavailable zinc in dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L) through plant breeding  ap. 1452-1457.  aIncludes references  aA whole-body radioassay procedure was used to assess the bioavailability to rats of zinc (Zn) in seeds of 18 genotypes of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L) that were grown hydroponically. Dry beans that were labelled intrinsically with 65Zn were added to test meals fed to rats that were marginally Zn-deficient. The amount of Zn in the seeds varied between genotypes and ranged from 26.7 to 62.4 µg g−1 (from 0.41 to 0.95 µmol g−1) dry weight (DW). Similarly, the amount of iron (Fe) in the beans varied nearly twofold (from 52.3 to 96.3 µg g−1 DW), and Zn and Fe concentrations were positively correlated. Concentrations of myo-inositolhexaphosphate (IP6) plus myo-inositolpentaphosphate (IP5) varied from 18.1 to 27.3 µmol g−1 DW. Cultivars with white-coloured seeds contained relatively small amounts of tannins varying from 0.12 to 0.16 mg g−1 DW (determined as catechin equivalents) compared to those with coloured seed coats (up to 2.58 mg g−1 DW). All rats readily ate the test meals so that Zn intake varied directly with seed-Zn concentration. As indicated by 65Zn absorption, the bioavailability to rats of Zn in the seeds varied between genotypes and ranged from about 78 to 95% of the total Zn in the seeds. The bioavailability of Zn to marginally Zn-deficient rats was not affected markedly by either IP5 + IP6 or tannin in the dry beans. These results demonstrate that the concentration of Zn in dry beans can be increased through traditional plant-breeding techniques and that this may result in significant increases in the amount of bioavailable Zn in the beans. Increasing the amount of Zn in beans may contribute significantly to improving the Zn status of individuals dependent on beans as a staple food. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aabsorption 3abioavailability 3acatechin 3acorrelation 3acultivars 3adry beans 3agenotype 3ahydroponics 3airon 3aplant breeding 3arats 3aseeds 3atannins 3atest meals 3azinc1 aWelch, R.

A molecular sieve was used to shift the reaction towards the synthesis. The mono-, di- and higher esters of lauric acid with fructose were obtained and analysed qualitatively and quantitatively by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). At a 5:1 molar ratio of lauric acid to fructose the amounts of monoester, diester and higher esters produced were 37, 53 and 98 mg respectively after 96 h of reaction time. After purification of the products by column chromatography the hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB) values of fructose monolaurate and fructose dilaurate were found to be 8.95 and 5.3 respectively and their critical micelle concentration (CMC) values were calculated as 7.20 × 10−5 and 6.40 × 10−5 M respectively. The CMC values of esters obtained from the conductivity curve and the surface tension curve were significantly (P < 0.05) similar to each other. It was found that when the concentration of surfactant was increased from 0.25 to 0.50% (w/v), stabilisation of the emulsion also increased. Fructose dilaurate showed better stability than the other esters. Separation of the phases reached 70% within 30 h for the emulsion prepared with 0.50% (w/v) of this ester. 3adodecanoic acid 3aesters 3afructose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3asurface tension 3atriacylglycerol lipase1 aFadiloglu, Sibel1 aIbanoglu, Esra0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2002 Oct., v. 82, no. 13 p.1516-1522dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.12223Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01465naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245004400165300001600209500002400225520053400249650001500783650001500798650004400813650001600857650001400873650001000887650001800897700002300915700001800938773008500956852000901041856008901050655001201139IND4463770720221121234107.0120802s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446377072DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00185-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDini, Irene10aPhenolic constituents of Kancolla seeds  ap. 163-168.  aIncludes references  aChemical investigation of Kancolla seeds revealed the presence of an array of polyphenols which were dominated by kaempferol and quercetin glycosides.

Hydrophobic free amino acids (alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine and tyrosine) were predominantly produced in samples digested with both carboxypeptidase B and Y. The peptide patterns of samples digested with both carboxypeptidases were similar to that of the control. The concentration of 2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine in samples with carboxypeptidase B addition was significantly higher than those of 2,5-dimethyl- and 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine; the concentration of 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine was highest (1727.86 µg per 100 g) in the sample with carboxypeptidase B addition that had been incubated for 24 h. These findings indicate that carboxypeptidase B from porcine pancreas was more prominent in the formation of cocoa-specific aroma. 3aalanine 3abakers yeast 3acarboxypeptidase B 3acarboxypeptidase C 3acocoa beans 3adigestion 3afree amino acids 3aisoleucine 3aleucine 3aodors 3apancreas 3apeptides 3aphenylalanine 3aswine 3atyrosine 3avaline1 aJinap, S.1 aJamilah, B.1 aNazamid, S.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2002 Oct., v. 82, no. 13 p.1584-1592dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.12323Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02266naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002100137245008200158300001800240500002400258520104400282650002801326650001101354650001901365650001101384650001401395650000901409650001001418650001801428650001101446650002801457650001701485650001101502650002801513650001901541650001401560700001701574700002001591773014701611852000901758856007701767655001201844IND4463758620221121222550.0120731s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446375862DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.12152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyazawa, Mitsuo10aInsecticidal compounds from Evodia rutaecarpa against Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 1574-1578.  aIncludes references  aIn the course of screening for novel naturally occurring insecticides from Chinese crude drugs, the MeOH extract of the fruits of Evodia rutaecarpa Benth was found to give insecticidal activity against larvae of Drosophila melanogaster Meigen. Three alkaloids, evodiamine (1), rutaecarpine (2) and rhetsinine (3), were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation of the extract. Insecticidal activity against larvae of D melanogaster was demonstrated; compounds 1 and 2 gave LC50 values of 0.30 and 0.28 µmol ml−1 diet respectively. Acute toxicity against adults of D melanogaster was also found; compound 2 had the most potent activity, with an LD50 value of 3.58 µg per adult. However, compound 3 had only weak activity in this study. Therefore compounds 1 and 2 were identified as insecticidal compounds from the fruits of E rutaecarpa. Compound 3 was obtained by the photoxidation of evodiamine. Investigation of the structure–activity relationship indicated the importance of the indoloquinazoline unit at the C-14 position. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aEuodia 3aacute toxicity 3aadults 3aalkaloids 3adiet 3adrugs 3afractionation 3afruits 3ainsecticidal properties 3ainsecticides 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3alethal dose 50 3ascreening1 aFujioka, Jun1 aIshikawa, Yukio0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2002 Oct., v. 82, no. 13 p.1574-1578dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.12153Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02410naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002600179245012800205300001800333506007600351520107700427506003701504650003401541650000801575650001501583650002101598650002201619650002201641650001701663650001701680650001101697700002201708773008201730852000901812856007801821856005701899930003301956946001101989655001202000IND4390490720221207075253.0070416e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439049072DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm0212doi7 aPMC18650642pmcid7 a172897522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlaisdell, Jeffrey O.10aRapid determination of the active fraction of DNA repair glycosylases: a novel fluorescence assay for trapped intermediates  ap. 1601-1611.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCurrent methods to measure the fraction of active glycosylase molecules in a given enzyme preparation are slow and cumbersome. Here we report a novel assay for rapidly determining the active fraction based on molecular accessibility of a fluorescent DNA minor groove binder, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Several 5,6-dihydrouracil-containing (DHU) DNA substrates were designed with sequence-dependent DAPI-binding sites to which base excision repair glycosylases were covalently trapped by reduction. Trapped complexes impeded the association of DAPI in a manner dependent on the enzyme used and the location of the DAPI-binding site in relation to the lesion. Of the sequences tested, one was shown to give an accurate measure of the fraction of active molecules for each enzyme tested from both the Fpg/Nei family and HhH-GPD Nth superfamily of DNA glycosylases. The validity of the approach was demonstrated by direct comparison with current gel-based methods. Additionally, the results are supported by in silico modeling based on available crystal structures.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3achemical bonding 3achemical elements 3acrystal structure 3afluorescence 3aglycosylases 3amodels1 aWallace, Susan S.0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Mar., v. 35, no. 5 p.1601-1611x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm0213Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3electronic resource  a20070416b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02666naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002300179245009300202300001200295506007600307520118900383506003701572650001701609650001001626650001101636650001801647650002401665650001401689650004301703650003501746700001801781700001801799700001601817700001501833700001901848700002101867773008001888852000901968856007801977856007402055930003302129946001102162990002302173655001202196IND4391146120221207080416.0070506e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439114612DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm0782doi7 aPMC18746292pmcid7 a173176842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFredriksson, Simon10aMultiplex amplification of all coding sequences within 10 cancer genes by Gene-Collector  ap. e47.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHerein we present Gene-Collector, a method for multiplex amplification of nucleic acids. The procedure has been employed to successfully amplify the coding sequence of 10 human cancer genes in one assay with uniform abundance of the final products. Amplification is initiated by a multiplex PCR in this case with 170 primer pairs. Each PCR product is then specifically circularized by ligation on a Collector probe capable of juxtapositioning only the perfectly matched cognate primer pairs. Any amplification artifacts typically associated with multiplex PCR derived from the use of many primer pairs such as false amplicons, primer-dimers etc. are not circularized and degraded by exonuclease treatment. Circular DNA molecules are then further enriched by randomly primed rolling circle replication. Amplification was successful for 90% of the targeted amplicons as seen by hybridization to a custom resequencing DNA micro-array. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that 96% of the amplification products were all within 4-fold of the average abundance. Gene-Collector has utility for numerous applications such as high throughput resequencing, SNP analyses, and pathogen detection.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acircular DNA 3agenes 3ahumans 3ahybridization 3amicrobial detection 3aneoplasms 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aBanér, Johan1 aDahl, Fredrik1 aChu, Angela1 aJi, Hanlee1 aWelch, Katrina1 aDavis, Ronald W.0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Apr., v. 35, no. 7 p.e47-e47x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm0783Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02960naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001900179245007700198300001800275506007600293520140500369506003701774650002801811650002101839650001901860650001401879650002701893650001501920650001601935650001601951650001201967650001601979650001401995650002702009700002002036700002202056700001802078700002102096700002702117700002302144773008202167852000902249856007802258856007402336930003302410946001102443655001202454IND4391148220221207060428.0070506e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439114822DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm0962doi7 aPMC18856462pmcid7 a173956402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetz, Michaela14aThe leader region of Laminin B1 mRNA confers cap-independent translation  ap. 2473-2482.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTranslation initiation of eukaryotic mRNAs generally occurs by cap-dependent ribosome scanning. However, certain mRNAs contain internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) allowing cap-independent translation. Several of these IRES-competent transcripts and their corresponding proteins are involved in tumourigenesis. This study focused on IRES-driven translation control during the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of hepatocytes that reflects crucial aspects of carcinoma progression. Expression profiling of EMT revealed Laminin B1 (LamB1) to be translationally upregulated. The 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of LamB1 was potent to direct IRES-dependent mRNA utilization of a bicistronic reporter construct. Stringent assays for cryptic promoter and splice sites showed no aberrantly expressed transcripts, suggesting that the reporter activity provided by the leader region of LamB1 mRNA exclusively depends on IRES. In accordance, LamB1 expression increased upon negative interference with cap-dependent translation by expression of human rhinovirus 2A protease or heat shock of cells. Finally, the enhanced expression of LamB1 during EMT correlated with an elevated IRES activity. Together, these data provide first evidence that the 5'-UTR of LamB1 contains a bona fide IRES that directs translational upregulation of LamB1 during stress conditions and neoplastic progression of hepatocytes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a5' untranslated regions 3aHuman rhinovirus 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinoma 3acrossover interference 3aepithelium 3aheat stress 3ahepatocytes 3alaminin 3aproteinases 3aribosomes 3atranslation (genetics)1 aKozina, Daniela1 aHuber, Heidemarie1 aSiwiec, Tanja1 aSeipelt, Joachim1 aSommergruber, Wolfgang1 aMikulits, Wolfgang0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Apr., v. 35, no. 8 p.2473-2482x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm0963Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04386naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245009200167300001600259500002400275500001500299520293700314650001303251650001603264650001303280650002103293650002003314650002003334650000903354650001403363650003103377650000903408650003803417650002303455650001803478650001903496650001203515650002103527650001703548650001703565650001603582650001303598653003403611700002103645700002103666773009503687852000903782856008903791655001203880IND4463750520221121055145.0120731s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446375052DNAL7 a10.1016/S0268-005X(03)00036-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazaridou, A.10aMolecular size effects on rheological properties of oat β-glucans in solution and gels  ap. 693-712.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of molecular size on rheological properties of highly pure oat β-glucans in solution and gel state were studied. The fine structure of the β-glucan preparations was assessed by 13C-NMR spectroscopy and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) of the cellulosic oligomers released by the action of lichenase. The tri- and tetra-saccharides accounted for 90.8–96.4% of the total oligomers analyzed and the calculated molar ratios of trimers/tetramers varied between 1.95 and 2.30. Molecular size characterization was carried out with high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) combined with a refractive index detector; for samples with apparent molecular weight (M(w)) of the peak fraction of the main eluting peak ranging between 35 and 250×10(3), the values of limiting viscosity ([η]), critical concentration (c∗∗) and coil overlap parameter (c∗∗[η]) were within 0.67–3.83 dl/g, 0.70–2.10 g/dl and 1.41–2.67, respectively. The shear thinning and viscoelastic behavior of fresh β-glucan solutions were typical of a random coil type polysaccharide, and dependent on the molecular size and concentration of the polymer. On the other hand, time-dependent rheological behavior was revealed by thixotropic loop experiments for the lowest molecular size sample, implying the formation of intermolecular networks. All β-glucan samples, except the preparation with the highest M(w), were able to form gels, as revealed by dynamic rheometry; with increasing M(w) the gelation time increased and the gelation rate decreased. The gelation rate also increased with increasing concentration and gel curing temperatures reaching a maximum at ∼25–35 °C; for higher temperatures the I(E) values decreased. The dependence of storage modulus on β-glucan concentration (C) followed power law relationships; G′ varied as C(7.2–7.5). A two-step melting behavior was observed for gels cured under conditions favoring a quick gelation. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that gels exhibit rather broad endothermic gel→sol transitions at 55–75 °C. The DSC kinetic data showed similar responses to those from dynamic rheometry; the rate of endotherm development increased with decreasing molecular size of the polysaccharide. Also, the apparent melting enthalpy values (plateau ΔH) increased with decreasing molecular size. The melting temperature of the gel network, as determined by DSC and dynamic rheometry, was found to increase with the molecular size of β-glucans. Large deformation mechanical tests (compression mode) revealed an increase in strength and a decrease in brittleness of oat β-glucan gels with increasing M(w). The true stress (σTR) and strain (εTR) at failure of β-glucan gels increased with increasing polysaccharide concentration reaching a maximum at a certain concentration; at higher concentrations the σTR, and εTR values decreased. 3aplateaus 3adeformation 3aenthalpy 3arefractive index 3aviscoelasticity 3astorage modulus 3aoats 3aviscosity 3agelatinization temperature 3agels 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3agel chromatography 3amelting point 3aanion exchange 3amelting 3amolecular weight 3abeta-glucans 3aspectroscopy 3alicheninase 3agelation 0asize exclusion chromatography1 aBiliaderis, C.G.1 aIzydorczyk, M.S.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2003 Sept., v. 17, no. 5 p.693-712dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0268-005X(03)00036-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02079naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245008900168300001600257500002400273500001500297520081300312650001501125650002301140650001301163650001801176650001001194650001401204650002201218650001301240650002301253650002301276650002001299650001001319650001601329650001401345650001801359650001601377653003401393700001801427773009001445852000901535856008901544655001201633IND4463751220221121055217.0120731s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446375122DNAL7 a10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00092-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Sŭng-ho.10aEvaluation of taste compounds in water-soluble extract of a doenjang (soybean paste)  ap. 339-342.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aFractions isolated by gel filtration chromatography from the water-soluble extract of a doenjang (soybean paste) were subjected to sensory analysis and chemical analysis in order to elucidate the contribution of taste compounds to their sensory properties.

Saltiness, umami taste and sourness may be directly related to particular taste compounds (NaCl and KCl for saltiness; glutamic acid and aspartic acid for umami taste; lactic acid for sourness) at higher concentrations than their respective reported thresholds.

Maximum storage modulus (G′(max)), minimum loss tangent (tan(delta)min), rate of gelation (I(E)) and onset of gelation were the rheological parameters studied, whereas maximum acidification rate (V(m)), time at which maximum acidification rate was observed (T(m)) and time to reach the end of fermentation (T(e)) characterized the kinetics of acidification during milk fermentation. TS strongly affected G′(max) and tan(delta)min; high TS resulted in a large increase in G′(max) and decrease in tan(delta)min. Increasing fermentation temperature gave a decrease in the onset of gelation, in T(m) and T(e), and increase in the rate of gelation (I(E)). V(m) was mainly affected by the interaction TS×FT. Under conditions of relatively low FT (37–39 °C), high TS (around 14%) and high TI (3–3.5%), the gelation and acidification rates were at medium levels and fermentation took a longer time to finish, but the formed gels were firmer, showing higher G′(max) and lower tan(delta)min values. Under all conditions examined, a high number of viable lactic acid bacteria in the final product was detected during storage (21 days, 4 °C) for both microorganisms used in the starter culture. 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 3aacidification 3acultured milk starters 3afermentation 3afermented milk 3agelation 3alactic acid bacteria 3amilk 3amodels 3aresponse surface methodology 3astorage modulus 3atemperature1 aBiliaderis, C.G.1 aTzanetakis, N.0 tFood chemistry.g2003 Nov., v. 83, no. 3 p.437-446dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00126-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02912naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001900179245009400198300001800292506007600310520140700386506003701793650000801830650002401838650001601862650002301878650002301901650001101924650002101935650001101956650001501967650000901982650003001991650001302021650001202034700001902046700002702065700001602092773008202108852000902190856007802199856007402277930003302351946001102384990002302395655001202418IND4391152220221207084936.0070506e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439115222DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkm1512doi7 aPMC18856682pmcid7 a174261292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ming-Jiu10aBiochemical and cellular characteristics of the 3' [rightward arrow] 5' exonuclease TREX2  ap. 2682-2694.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTREX2 is an autonomous nonprocessive 3' [rightward arrow] 5' exonuclease, suggesting that it maintains genome integrity. To investigate TREX2's biochemical and cellular properties, we show that endogenous TREX2 is expressed widely in mouse tissues and human cell lines. Unexpectedly, endogenous human TREX2 is predominantly expressed as a 30-kDa protein (not 26 kDa, as previously believed), which is likely encoded by longer isoforms (TREX2L¹ and/or TREX2L²) that possess similar capacity for self-association, DNA binding and catalytic activity. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis shows that the three functional activities of TREX2 are distinct, yet integrated. Mutation of amino acids putatively important for homodimerization significantly impairs both DNA binding and exonuclease activity, while mutation of amino acids (except R163) in the DNA binding and exonuclease domains affects their corresponding activities. Interestingly, however, DNA-binding domain mutations do not impact catalytic activity, while exonuclease domain mutations diminish DNA binding. To understand TREX2 cellular properties, we find endogenous TREX2 is down regulated during G2/M and nuclear TREX2 displays a punctate staining pattern. Furthermore, TREX2 knockdown reduces cell proliferation. Taken together, our results suggest that TREX2 plays an important function during DNA metabolism and cellular proliferation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA-binding domains 3aamino acids 3acatalytic activity 3acell proliferation 3agenome 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ametabolism 3amice 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3astaining 3atissues1 aMa, Sheng-mei.1 aDumitrache, Lavinia C.1 aHasty, Paul0 tNucleic acids research.g2007 Apr., v. 35, no. 8 p.2682-2694x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm1513Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle04013naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010300129300001600232500027600248500001500524520227400539650002602813650002902839650001602868650001602884650001502900650002702915650002702942650001702969650001902986650002503005650001403030650002703044650002103071650002703092650001003119650002103129653002703150653002603177653001103203653001203214653001703226653001503243653002803258700002503286773010603311852000903417930003303426945001303459946001103472655001203483IND2268128620221121043213.0010403e20000925ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226812862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHelander, I.M.10aPermeability barrier of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane with special reference to nisin  ap. 153-161.  aIn the special issue: Selected topics from "Food Micro '99"/edited by S.

Typhimurium was investigated, using assays based on the uptake of a fluorescent dye 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) and on the bacterial susceptibility to detergent-induced bacteriolysis. The outer membrane of bacteria which had been pretreated with nisin was shown to be less stable against 1 mM EDTA, as indicated by their significantly higher NPN uptake levels as compared to untreated bacteria. Upon challenge with a tenfold lower concentration of EDTA (0.1 mM) some nisin-treated strains (Typhimurium, P. marginalis) exhibited, however, NPN uptake levels which were lower than those seen in control bacteria, suggesting that nisin had stabilized their outer membrane. Nisin pretreatment also decreased the NPN uptake induced by citric or lactic acid or both in E. coli, P. marginalis, and Typhimurium, whereas in P. aeruginosa the pretreatment resulted in increased NPN uptake in response to citric and lactic acid. These results suggest that, with the exception of P. aeruginosa, nisin could protect bacteria from the outer membrane-disrupting effect caused by the acids. P. aeruginosa was, however, shown to be protected against bacteriolysis induced by the detergents sodium dodecylsulfate and Triton X-100. With a pair of isogenic mutants of Typhimurium differing in their cell surface charge it was shown that the NPN uptake response to 1 mM EDTA of the abnormally cationic strain was not significantly affected by nisin, whereas in the normal anionic strain nisin strongly strengthened the uptake. Our hypothesis based on these findings is that the normally anionic cell surface of Gram-negative bacteria has a tendency to bind the cationic nisin. The binding of nisin to the surface does not proceed to the cytoplasmic membrane, but in the outer membrane the bound nisin actually stabilizes its structure through electrostatic interactions. With the exception of EDTA, the organic acids at pH 4 did not cause leakage of cell contents from Typhimurium, indicating that these acids do not permeabilize the outer membrane to an extent required for cytoplasmic pore formation by nisin. 3amembrane permeability 3aantibacterial properties 3alactic acid 3acitric acid 3adetergents 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3apretreatment 3acell membranes 3anonionic surfactants 3acytolysis 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3afluorescent dyes 3aPseudomonas marginalis 3anisin 3aEscherichia coli 0aSalmonella typhimurium 0asodium dodecylsulfate 0auptake 0aleakage 0atriton x-100 0aSalmonella 0a1-n-phenylnaphthylamine1 aMattila-Sandholm, T.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2000 Sept. 25, v. 60, no. 2/3 p.153-161x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02752naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010500127300001600232500027600248500001500524520107500539650001201614650002801626650002101654650002401675650001601699650000801715650003001723650002501753650002201778650001101800650002701811650001301838650002001851653001001871653001401881653003301895653001601928653001401944653001401958653003401972653002502006700001802031700001302049773010602062852000902168930003302177945001302210946001102223655001202234IND2268127320221121043227.0010403e20000925ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226812732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCotter, P.D.10aAnalysis of the role of the Listeria monocytogenes F0F1-ATPase operon in the acid tolerance response  ap. 137-146.  aIn the special issue: Selected topics from "Food Micro '99"/edited by S.

It was found that acid adapted cells treated with N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) exhibited greatly enhanced sensitivity to low pH stress. Degenerate primers were designed to amplify and sequence a portion of the atpD gene. Subsequently, a PCR product from atpA to atpD was identified. While we were unable to create a deletion in the atpA gene, the plasmid pORI19 was inserted in a region between atpA and atpG to reduce, rather than eliminate, expression of the downstream genes. As expected this mutant displayed enhanced resistance to neomycin and exhibited slower growth than the wild type strain. This mutant could still induce an acid tolerance response and remained susceptible to DCCD treatment, but its relative acid sensitivity was difficult to assess as a consequence of its slow growth. 3aacidity 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3apyrophosphatases 3aopen reading frames 3aDNA primers 3aDNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aoperon 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aneomycin 3adrug resistance 0agenes 0atolerance 0ah+-transporting atp synthase 0agrowth rate 0adeletions 0aatpd gene 0an,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide 0anucleotide sequences1 aGahan, C.G.M.1 aHill, C.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2000 Sept. 25, v. 60, no. 2/3 p.137-146x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01917naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009400165300001600259500002400275520067200299650001200971650001300983650002600996650001401022650002301036650001801059650002001077650002001097650002501117650001301142653002601155653002701181653003201208653002301240700002201263700001901285700003701304773009701341852000901438856004801447655001201495IND4413734220221121001524.0081212e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441373422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11540-008-9109-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRitter, Enrique10aExploitation of Exotic, Cultivated Solanum Germplasm for Breeding and Commercial Purposes  ap. 301-311.  aIncludes references  aNative potato species (NPS) are cultivated potatoes which do not belong to S. tuberosum ssp. tuberosum.

We present first evaluation results of a set of NPS for these characters and discuss prospects for exploiting this valuable germplasm for breeding and for developing novel products for niche markets. 3aSolanum 3abreeding 3aenvironmental factors 3agermplasm 3aindigenous species 3aniche markets 3anutritive value 3apest resistance 3aphenotypic variation 3apotatoes 0aNative potato species 0aNutritional properties 0aPest and disease resistance 0aProcessing quality1 aBarandalla, Leire1 aLopez, Raquel.1 ade Galarreta, José Ignacio Ruiz0 tPotato research.g2008 Dec., v. 51, no. 3-4 p.301-311dSpringer Netherlandsx0014-30657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11540-008-9109-y 7aarticle03733naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002200183245005900205300001600264500002400280506007600304520134900380506003701729650002101766650002501787650001401812650001301826650002401839650001601863650001401879650001101893650002601904650001501930650002201945650003101967650000901998650003102007650001102038650001002049650001002059650003802069650001202107650008202119650005502201650003802256650003302294650003002327650005102357650004002408650001102448650001102459650004102470650005702511650005502568650002802623650005302651650000902704650002402713650003702737650005602774700001602830773011102846852000902957856004502966655001203011IND4458693620221207075627.0110603e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445869362DNAL7 a215950182pmid7 aPMC42340422pmcid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2011000582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButler, Lesley M.10aGreen and black tea in relation to gynecologic cancers  ap. 931-940.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aScope: Observational studies have evaluated the relationship between green tea intake and cancers of the ovary and endometrium, but we are not aware of the published studies on green tea intake and risk of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers of the cervix, vagina, or vulva. Methods and results: A critical review of the published literature on tea intake and risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers was conducted. In meta-analyses, we report inverse associations for green tea intake and risk of ovarian cancer (odds ratio [OR]=0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54, 0.80), and for green tea and risk of endometrial cancer (OR=0.78, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.98). There was no association for black tea and ovarian cancer risk (OR=0.94, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.02) and a positive association with endometrial cancer risk (OR=1.20, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.38). We summarized the experimental evidence supporting the antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of green tea catechins, and results from randomized clinical trials that demonstrated green tea catechin efficacy on treatment of cervical lesions and external genital warts. Conclusion: Observational data support a protective role of green tea on risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers. Observational data are needed to evaluate whether green tea reduces risk of human papillomavirus-related cancers.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPapillomaviridae 3aantiviral properties 3ablack tea 3acatechin 3aconfidence interval 3aendometrium 3agreen tea 3ahumans 3aobservational studies 3aodds ratio 3aovarian neoplasms 3arandomized clinical trials 3arisk 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3avagina 3avulva 3awarts 2aAlphapapillomavirusxdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aAnticarcinogenic Agentsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxchemistry. 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxtherapeutic use 2aAntiviral Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aCamellia sinensisxchemistry 2aCatechinxtherapeutic use 2aCondylomata Acuminataxdrug therapyxvirology. 2aEndometrial Neoplasmsxepidemiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aImmunologic Factorsxtherapeutic use 2aOvarian Neoplasmsxchemically inducedxepidemiology. 2aPapillomavirus Infectionsxdrug therapyxvirology. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aPrecancerous Conditionsxdrug therapyxvirology. 2aRisk 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTeaxadverse effectsxchemistry. 2aUterine Cervical Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxvirology.1 aWu, Anna H.0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2011 June, v. 55, no. 6 p.931-940dWiley-VCH Verlagx1613-41257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.201100058 7aarticle02638naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245015400126300001600280500001500296520134200311650001301653650001601666650001401682650001301696650001601709650002301725650002801748650001901776650000701795650002001802650002001822653001601842653002001858700002001878700001701898700001601915700001801931700001501949700001901964700001401983773010501997852000902102930003302111945001302144946001102157655001202168IND2256385020221120230701.0010328e20010228ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND225638502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGardini, F.10aEffects of pH, temperature and NaCl concentration on the growth kinetics, proteolytic activity and biogenic amine production of Enterococcus faecalis  ap. 105-117.  a2019-12-05  aIn this work, the combined effects of temperature, pH and NaCl concentration on the growth dynamics of Enterococcus faecalis EF37, its proteolytic activity and its production of biogenic amines have been studied. The effects of the selected variables have been analysed using a Central Composite Design. The production of biogenic amines, under the adopted conditions, was found to be mainly dependent on the extent of growth of E. faecalis. Its proteolytic activity was not a limiting factor for the final amine production, because in the system studied (skim milk) an excess of precursors was guaranteed. Quantitatively, the most important biogenic amine produced was 2-phenylethylamine but substantial amounts of tyramine were detected in all the samples. This work confirms that the main biological feature influencing the biogenic amine formation is the extent of growth of microorganisms, like E. faecalis, characterised by decarboxylase activity. In the traditional and artisanal cheeses produced using raw milk, enterococci usually reach levels of 10(7) cells/g. With this perspective, it is important that the presence of biogenic amines due to the activities of these microorganisms is maintained within safe levels, without affecting the positive effects of enterococci on the final organoleptic characteristics of the cheese. 3asalinity 3aproteinases 3askim milk 3atyramine 3aproteolysis 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3aphenethylamine 3apH 3asodium chloride 3aenzyme activity 0agrowth rate 0abiogenic amines1 aMartuscelli, M.1 aCaruso, M.C.1 aGalgano, F.1 aCrudele, M.A.1 aFavati, F.1 aGuerzoni, M.E.1 aSuzzi, G.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2001 Feb. 28, v. 64, no. 1/2 p.105-117x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20010501b20010507c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02872naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245018100127300001500308500001500323520141300338650001801751650001801769650001001787650001401797650002001811650001601831650002501847650003001872650002501902650002101927650002901948650001601977650002201993650003502015651001002050653001902060653001602079653001902095700002102114700001402135700001602149700001402165700001702179773010402196852000902300930003302309945001302342946001102355655001202366IND2256384920221120230705.0010328e20010228ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND225638492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorsetti, A.10aPhenotypic and molecular identification and clustering of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts from wheat (species Triticum durum and Triticum aestivum) sourdoughs of Southern Italy  ap. 95-104.  a2019-12-05  aThe microflora of 25 wheat sourdoughs from the Apulia region, Southern Italy, was characterized. The sourdoughs were mainly produced from Triticum durum wheat. The number of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts ranged from ca. log 7.5 to log 9.3 colony forming units (cfu)/g and from log 5.5 to log 8.4 cfu/g, respectively. About 38% of the 317 isolates of lactic acid bacteria were identified by conventional physiological and biochemical tests. Phenotypic identification was confirmed by 16S rDNA and 16S/23S rRNA spacer region PCR. Overall, 30% of the isolates were identified as Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, 20% as Lb. alimentarius, 14% as Lb. brevis, 12% as Leuconostoc citreum, 7% as Lb. plantarum, 6% as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 4% as Lb. fermentum and Lb. acidophilus, 2% as Weissella confusa and 1% as Lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. Some of these species have not been previously isolated from sourdoughs. Since bakers yeast is widely used in sourdough production, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was largely found. The phenotypical relationships within the main lactic acid bacteria identified were established by using cluster analysis. A microbial map of the 25 sourdoughs was plotted showing characteristic associations among lactic acid bacteria and differences in the lactic acid bacteria species which were mainly due to the species of wheat flour, use of bakers yeast and type of bread. 3aLactobacillus 3aribosomal RNA 3adough 3aphenotype 3afermented foods 3awheat flour 3alactic acid bacteria 3apolymerase chain reaction 3amicrobial physiology 3acluster analysis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aplate count 3aTriticum aestivum 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3aItaly 0aidentification 0aenumeration 0amicroorganisms1 aLavermicocca, P.1 aMorea, M.1 aBaruzzi, F.1 aTosti, N.1 aGobbetti, M.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2001 Feb. 28, v. 64, no. 1/2 p.95-104x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20010501b20010507c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02692naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002100146245010600167300001600273520143800289650001101727650001101738650001401749650001501763650001401778650001701792650001501809650003001824650002301854650002101877650002501898651001201923653001901935653001901954700001601973700001501989700001702004773007102021852000902092856008602101930003302187945001302220946001302233655001202246IND2322007720221120215726.0010712e200106  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232200772DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.6.5972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlacharski, R.W.10aControl of postharvest botrytis fruit rot with preharvest fungicide applications in annual strawberry  ap. 597-602.  aThe control of postharvest Botrytis fruit rot was evaluated during 1997-98 and 1998-99. Weekly applications of captan and thiram were examined at two or three different rates, respectively. Iprodione applications were combined with the captan and thiram treatments and also applied alone for two peak bloom periods. Strawberry fruit were harvested and graded twice weekly for marketable yield and preharvest incidence of Botrytis fruit rot. For postharvest evaluations, fruit from four harvests were selected and stored at 4 degrees C, and Botrytis fruit rot incidence was recorded over 14 days of storage. Fungicide treatments reduced the incidence of preharvest Botrytis fruit rot and increased marketable yield. The incidence of postharvest Botrytis fruit rot was significantly affected by harvest date, length of time in storage, and fungicide treatment. The highest rate captan and thiram treatments had the least Botrytis fruit rot and the longest storage life. Reduced-rate captan and thiram treatments generally did not provide the same control as their respective high-rate treatments. Iprodione added to either the captan or thiram treatments did not consistently reduce the preharvest or postharvest incidence of Botrytis fruit rot or increase yield. Regular, full-rate fungicide treatments appear to be necessary to control Botrytis fruit rot in Florida and to provide the storage life necessary to reach distant markets. 3acaptan 3athiram 3aiprodione 3acrop yield 3aincidence 3aharvest date 3ashelf life 3afungal diseases of plants 3aapplication timing 3aapplication rate 3apostharvest diseases 3aFlorida 0aflowering date 0afungus control1 aBartz, J.A.1 aXiao, C.L.1 aLegard, D.E.0 tPlant disease.g2001 June, v. 85, no. 6 p.597-602x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.6.5973Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02360naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001400146245012300160300001600283520098200299650001701281650001401298650003301312650001501345650001801360650002501378650001201403650001501415650002501430651001001455653001301465653003201478653002801510700001601538700001601554700002201570700001801592700001501610700001401625700001501639773007001654852000901724856008601733930003301819945001301852946001301865655001201878IND2321814720221120215716.0010629e200105  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232181472DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.5.5472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLecoq, H.10aBiological and molecular characterization of Moroccan watermelon mosaic virus and potyvirus isolate from eastern Sudan  ap. 547-552.  aA potyvirus (Su-94-54) was isolated from a naturally infected snake cucumber (Cucumis melo var. flexuosus) plant with severe mosaic and leaf deformation symptoms collected in Eastern Sudan. This isolate has a host range limited to cucurbits and is serologically distantly related to Moroccan watermelon mosaic virus (MWMV) and to Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV). Coat protein sequence analysis of Su-94-54 and MWMV and comparison with other potyviruses indicate that Su-94-54 is more closely related to MWMV than to any other potyvirus. Based on the amino acid sequence identity in the core part of the coat protein with MWMV (86%), this isolate could be regarded as a distinct species. However, because of biological, cytological, and serological affinities with MWMV, we propose that this isolate be considered as a strain of MWMV, possibly an evolutionary intermediate between MWMV and PRSV, until more is known on the structure of the PRSV subgroup within the genus Potyvirus. 3aCucumis melo 3aPotyvirus 3aplant diseases and disorders 3ahost range 3acoat proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3astrains 3aimmunology 3anucleotide sequences 3aSudan 0asymptoms 0awatermelon mosaic potyvirus 0amolecular sequence data1 aDafalla, G.1 aDesbiez, C.1 aWipf-Scheibel, C.1 aDelecolle, B.1 aLanina, T.1 aUllah, Z.1 aGrumet, R.0 tPlant disease.g2001 May, v. 85, no. 5 p.547-552x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.5.5473Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02796naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001700146245006100163300001600224500001500240520147300255650002701728650001001755650001601765650001101781650001301792650002301805650002601828650002201854650001901876650002001895650002701915651001301942653001901955653001901974653001301993700001602006700001502022700001102037700001902048700001102067773007002078852000902148856008602157930003302243945001302276946001302289655001202302IND2321812820221120215556.0010629e200105  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232181282DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.5.5352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConway, K.E.10aBeneficial effects of solid matrix chemo-priming in Okra  ap. 535-537.  a2019-12-04  aTwo field trials at Stillwater and Bixby, OK, evaluated the efficacy of solid matrix priming techniques, alone or in combination with fungicide seed treatment on seedling emergence and reduction of damping-off of okra in field soil naturally infested with Pythium ultimum. The following treatments were evaluated: thiram + carboxin (chemo-primed) (commercially applied), biological seed treatment (bio-primed) (Trichoderma harzianum isolate OK-110, 1 g suspended in 1% carboxymethylcellulose [CMC]), untreated seed (control), and a 1% CMC control.

Mean emergence of chemo-primed seeds was lower (P less than or equal to 0.05) than the untreated control. Chemo-primed seeds had greater vigor (P less than or equal to 0.05) at both locations compared with either fungicide-treated or priming alone, at both locations. There were no differences (P less than or equal to 0.05) in yield among treatments at both locations. P. ultimum was consistently isolated from damped-off seedlings and surrounding soil at both locations. Isolates of P. ultimum were more pathogenic on okra in laboratory tests than isolates of Rhizoctonia spp., Fusarium spp., and other Pythium spp. also isolated from seed or soil. 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3avigor 3adamping off 3athiram 3acarboxin 3aseedling emergence 3afield experimentation 3aTrichoderma lixii 3aseed treatment 3aPythium ultimum 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3aOklahoma 0afungus control 0aHypocrea lixii 0aefficacy1 aMereddy, R.1 aKahn, B.A.1 aWu, Y.1 aHallgren, S.W.1 aWu, L.0 tPlant disease.g2001 May, v. 85, no. 5 p.535-537x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.5.5353Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03491naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245020600129300001400335520203800349650001702387650002302404650002802427650001802455650001202473650001402485650001602499650002202515650002002537650002102557650002002578650000902598650001302607650001902620650001802639650001702657650002202674650001402696653000902710653002202719700001302741700002402754700002002778700001802798773010302816852000902919930003302928945001302961946001102974655001202985IND2256382220221120215746.0010328e20010228ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND225638222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsmail, S.A.S.10aEffectiveness of immersion treatments with acids, trisodium phosphate, and herb decoctions in reducing populations of Yarrowia lipolytica and naturally occurring aerobic micropropagation on raw chicken  ap. 13-19.  aYarrowia lipolytica, one of the predominant yeasts in raw poultry, is believed to play a role in spoilage. This study was undertaken to investigate treatments to control the growth of Y. lipolytica on raw chicken stored at refrigeration temperature. Raw chicken wings inoculated with a mixture of five strains of Y. lipolytica isolated from raw poultry were dipped in solutions containing 2, 5, or 8% lactic acid, 2% lactic acid containing 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8% potassium sorbate or sodium benzoate, and 4, 8, or 12% trisodium phosphate solution. Populations of the yeast and total aerobic microorganisms were determined before and after treatment. Immersion of wings in 2% lactic acid (with or without 0.2% potassium sorbate or sodium benzoate) or 4% trisodium phosphate caused a significant (alpha = 0.05) reduction in numbers of Y. lipolytica and aerobic microorganisms. Treatment with 2% lactic acid containing 0.4 or 0.8% preservative did not result in additional significant reductions. Treatment of chicken wings with 2% lactic acid or 8% trisodium phosphate significantly reduced numbers of Y. lipolytica by 1.47 and 0.65 log10 cfu/g, respectively, and aerobic microorganisms by 2.60 and 1.21 log10 cfu/g, respectively, compared to controls. Growth of Y. lipolytica on wings stored at 5 degrees C for up to 9 days, however, was not affected by these treatments. Significant reductions in the population of Y. lipolytica occurred when the yeast was inoculated into 100% basil, marjoram, sage, and thyme decoctions, but not in 100% oregano or rosemary decoctions, held at 5 degrees C for 24 h. Treatment of chicken wings with 100% sage or thyme decoctions significantly reduced populations of Y. lipolytica but did not control its growth during storage at 5 degrees C for up to 9 days. The small, temporary decreases in numbers of Y. lipolytica and aerobic microorganisms resulting from immersion treatment of chicken wings with sage and thyme decoctions render these treatments of questionable value as preservation interventions. 3achicken meat 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3afood spoilage 3aaerobes 3asolutions 3alactic acid 3apotassium sorbate 3asodium benzoate 3asodium phosphate 3aThymus vulgaris 3asage 3arosemary 3aplant extracts 3arefrigeration 3acold storage 3afood preservation 3araw foods 0adips 0araw chicken wings1 aDeak, T.1 aAbd El-Rahman, H.A.1 aYassien, M.A.M.1 aBeuchat, L.R.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2001 Feb. 28, v. 64, no. 1/2 p.13-19x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20010501b20010507c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01947naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001800138245005800156300001600214500001500230520079100245650002401036650001301060650002701073650003001100650002301130650002001153650001501173650001801188651001001206653001901216653002701235700001501262700001601277700001501293773007101308852000901379856007801388930003301466945001301499946001301512655001201525IND2047032520221120165514.0950727e199506  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204703252DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-06342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Y.F.10aCausal agents of powdery mildew of cucurbits in Sudan  ap. 634-636.  a2019-12-04  aIn a survey of cucurbit crops in Sudan, 234 samples of melon, cucumber, and squash showing symptoms of powdery mildew were infected with Sphaerotheca fuliginea, while Erysiphe cichoracearum was only observed on two samples of watermelon showing mild symptoms. Leveillula taurica was not observed on any sample. Field trials with differential lines of melon revealed the presence of race I of S. fuliginea in Gezira (Central Sudan) in the summer of 1993, and race 2 in the following winter. Virulence tests in controlled conditions on a limited number of isolates suggest that a shift in prevalence of those races may have occurred on that site over time. The geographic scale of this shift was probably limited as race 0 was observed in late autumn in northeast Sudan in the Gash Delta. 3aPodosphaera xanthii 3aetiology 3aErysiphe cichoracearum 3afungal diseases of plants 3aLeveillula taurica 3adisease surveys 3apathotypes 3aCucurbitaceae 3aSudan 0aidentification 0aSphaerotheca fuliginea1 aBardin, M.1 aNicot, P.C.1 aPitrat, M.0 tPlant disease.g1995 June, v. 79, no. 6 p.634-636x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-06343Available from publisher's Web site  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle01901naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001900138245005200157300001600209500001500225520073100240650001900971650002100990650001401011650001201025650002001037650003001057650002201087650002101109650002301130650001701153650001301170653001701183653001301200700001801213700002001231773007001251852000901321856007801330930003301408945001301441946001301454655001201467IND2046922020221120154149.0950720e199505  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204692202DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-05242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoeman, M.H.10aEpidemiology of powder mildew on mango blossoms  ap. 524-528.  a2019-12-04  aConidia of Oidium mangiferae, the causal organism of powdery mildew on mango, were trapped in a mango orchard during the periods of flowering and fruit set from 1989-1991.

The soybean cultivars, selected on the basis of genetic resistance to Phytophthora root rot, were 29725-15G (susceptible), DSR-262 (tolerant), and Elgin 87 (resistant, Rps1-kappa allele). Soybeans were treated at planting with spore-based formulations of B. cereus or metalaxyl, applied in-furrow or to the seed. At Racine, Wisconsin, higher soybean yields were consistently associated with the genetically tolerant and resistant cultivars. Certain B. cereus treatments provided a significant yield benefit for the susceptible cultivar in all five growing seasons, and for all cultivars in 1990 when the disease pressure was especially high. At Whitewater, Wisconsin, higher yields were not associated with genetic resistance to Phytophthora root rot and there was evidence of pre-emergence damping-off. For the susceptible cultivar, yields for B. cereus treatments and metalaxyl did not differ significantly from the untreated control except in 1990, when yield and stand counts benefitted from those treatments. Yield of the resistant cultivar was improved significantly by treatment with either B. cereus or metalaxyl in 1990, 1991, and 1992. The formulation of B. cereus influenced efficacy: clay granule formulations of UW85 applied in-furrow were the most consistent, but no single formulation of either B. cereus or metalaxyl exhibited efficacy at both sites and in all years. These data suggest that B. cereus improved soybean yield under conditions in which Phytophthora root rot influenced yield as well as under conditions in which other factors influenced yield. 3ametalaxyl 3acultivars 3aGlycine max 3aPhytophthora sojae 3abiological control agents 3afungal diseases of plants 3adisease control 3aplant density 3acrop yield 3aseasonal variation 3aseedling emergence 3aBacillus cereus 3achemical control 3abiological control 3aWisconsin 0aplant diseases and disorders 0aformulations 0aPhytophthora1 aMilner, J.L.1 aOplinger, E.S.1 aSmith, R.S.1 aHandelsman, J.0 tPlant disease.g1995 June, v. 79, no. 6 p.551-556wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-05513Available from publisher's Web site  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02985naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001500138245014900153300001600302500001500318520159600333650002201929650003001951650001901981650000802000650002002008650002002028650001302048650001802061650002402079650001602103650001302119650001102132650001502143653003302158653002602191653001102217700001602228700001902244700002402263773007002287852000902357856007802366930003302444945001302477946001302490655001202503IND2046919820221120154321.0950720e199505  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204691982DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-05112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScherm, H.10aField evaluation of fungicide spray advisories against lettuce downy mildew (Bremia lactucae) based on measured or forecast morning leaf wetness  ap. 511-516.  a2019-12-04  aIn a previous field study in coastal California, infection of lettuce by downy mildew (Bremia lactucae) occurred primarily on days when leaves dried late in the morning (at 1000 h or later), suggesting that fungicide sprays against the disease could be scheduled according to a morning leaf wetness threshold. Seven field trials were carried out in 1993 to 1994 to test whether sprays of maneb or fosetyl Al, applied when measured or forecast morning leaf wetness ended at 1000 h or later, would lead to a reduction in the number of fungicide applications and/or improved downy mildew control compared with a calendar-based schedule with three sprays. Based on measurements of morning leaf wetness, the total number of sprays in the seven trials was reduced by 67% relative to the calendar-based schedule, with no difference in disease intensity. Based on forecasts of morning leaf wetness, which were generated using a physical dew simulation model with numerical weather forecasts from the National Meteorological Center as input, about 90% of the days were correctly classified as days with or without prolonged morning wet period. However, the occurrence of important wet periods due to fog drizzle was not predicted and the forecasts for the exact time of onset and end of leaf wetness were inaccurate. It is concluded that the number of fungicide applications against lettuce downy mildew can be reduced substantially with sprays scheduled according to a morning leaf wetness threshold of 1000 h and that fog drizzle should be included in leaf wetness forecasts for coastal California. 3asimulation models 3afungal diseases of plants 3aLactuca sativa 3adew 3adisease control 3aBremia lactucae 3aduration 3awater content 3aweather forecasting 3ameasurement 3aspraying 3aleaves 3aprediction 0aplant diseases and disorders 0adew simulation models 0atiming1 aKoike, S.T.1 aLaemmlen, F.F.1 aVan Bruggen, A.H.C.0 tPlant disease.g1995 May, v. 79, no. 5 p.511-516x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-05113Available from publisher's Web site  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02040naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002700138245006200165300001600227500001500243520098000258650001501238650002301253650001301276650003701289650002601326653001801352653001901370653001201389700001501401700001601416773008801432852000901520856007801529930003301607945001301640946001301653655001201666IND2046917720221120154206.0950720e199505  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204691772DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-04502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez-Alvarado, G.10aHeterogeneity in pepper isolates of cucumber mosaic virus  ap. 450-455.  a2019-12-04  aTwenty-four cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV) field isolates from pepper crops in California were characterized and compared by nucleic acid hybridization subgrouping, virion electrophoresis, and biological effects in several hosts. Isolates, belonging to subgroup I or subgroup II, were found that induced severe symptoms in mechanically inoculated bell peppers. Only two isolates, both from subgroup II were mild. A group of 19 isolates collected from a single field were all in subgroup II and appeared identical by virion electrophoresis, but they exhibited varying degrees of symptom severity in peppers. As a more detailed indicator of heterogeneity, these 19 isolates were examined by RNase protection assays to detect sequence variation in the coat protein gene region of their genomes. The patterns of bands observed were complex and a high degree of genomic heterogeneity was detected between isolates, with no apparent correlation to symptomatology in bell pepper. 3ahost range 3astrain differences 3aCapsicum 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aCucumber mosaic virus 0aheterogeneity 0asymptomatology 0astrains1 aKurath, G.1 aDodds, J.A.0 tPlant disease.g1995 May, v. 79, no. 5 p.450-455wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-04503Available from publisher's Web site  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02980naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001600138245011000154300001600264520188400280650002002164650001402184650002802198650002902226650001202255650002302267650001402290650003202304650002402336650001502360700001502375773007002390852000902460856007802469930003302547945001302580946001302593655001202606IND2046918320221120150947.0950720e199505  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204691832DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-04742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPratt, R.G.10aComparative pathogenicity of isolates of Sclerotinia trifoliorum and S. sclerotiorum on alfalfa cultivars  ap. 474-477.  aEight cultivars and one experimental population of alfalfa were artificially inoculated with five isolates each of Sclerotinia trifoliorum and S. sclerotiorum. Isolates of both species originated from different forage legume hosts and geographic areas in the United States. lnoculations were performed by dusting dried and comminuted mixtures of infested wheat and oat grain over foliage of 4-wk-old plants. Plants were maintained at 17-20 C with intermittent atmospheric saturation for 24 days after which plant survival was evaluated. Isolates of both Sclerotinia species differed significantly (P < 0.01) in virulence. Alfalfa cultivars differed significantly (P = 0.02) in susceptibility, and responses of cultivars to the two species were generally similar. Florida 77 was the most susceptible of the eight cultivars to both Sclerotinia species, and 5472 was the least susceptible. An experimental population (STR), previously selected from cultivar Delta for resistance to S. trifoliorum, expressed the least susceptibility to both Sclerotinia spp. Cultivar X isolate interactions were not significant for S. sclerotiorum but were significant (P < 0.01) for S. trifoliorum. These interactions appeared to be caused by differences in virulence of isolates and did not suggest the occurrence of pathogenic races. Significant (P < 0.01) experiment X cultivar and experiment X isolate interactions also occurred for both species; possible causes are discussed. Results indicate that responses of these alfalfa cultivars to S. trifoliorum and S. sclerotiorum are generally similar, that selection for resistance to S. trifoliorum in alfalfa may also confer resistance to S. sclerotiorum, that no evidence for different pathogenic races was detected among the isolates, and that host of origin is not an important determinant for the virulence of Sclerotinia isolates on alfalfa. 3aMedicago sativa 3acultivars 3aSclerotinia trifoliorum 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3astrains 3adisease resistance 3avirulence 3ahost-parasite relationships 3avarietal resistance 3apopulation1 aRowe, D.E.0 tPlant disease.g1995 May, v. 79, no. 5 p.474-477x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-04743Available from publisher's Web site  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02263naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001600138245012700154300001600281500001500297520104200312650003001354650001301384650001201397650002301409650002901432650001901461650002301480650001701503650002701520653001401547653002801561653001301589700001601602773008901618852000901707856007801716930003301794945001301827946001301840655001201853IND2046014820221120150943.0950511e199503  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204601482DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-02432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBar-Zur, A.10aPartial resistance of sugary enhancer sweet corn genotypes to two isolates of the sugarcane mosaic subgroup of potyviruses  ap. 243-246.  a2019-12-04  aSweet corn genotypes containing the sugary enhancer (se) allele expressed moderate levels of resistance to maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV), a member of the sugarcane mosaic subgroup, under natural infection in the field in Israel. Resistance was identified both in homozygous (sese) and heterozygous (Sese) genotypes. Most (sese) genotypes developed MDMV symptoms when they were mechanically inoculated in the greenhouse. The presence of the virus was verified by ELISA analysis. Plants containing known genes for resistance did not show MDMV symptoms under natural or mechanical inoculation. Two isolates of the sugarcane mosaic virus subgroup of potyviruses, differing in virulence on sweet corn genotypes, were identified. The results show that several se inbred lines contain factors contributing to moderate field resistance to maize potyviruses, but it is not clear whether these factors are pleiotropic or are associated with the se gene. The mechanism of the resistance exhibited in conjunction with the se is not yet understood. 3aJohnsongrass mosaic virus 3aZea mays 3aalleles 3agenetic resistance 3aMaize dwarf mosaic virus 3aheterozygosity 3adisease resistance 3ahomozygosity 3aSugarcane mosaic virus 0ase allele 0aexperimental infections 0agenotype1 aSalomon, R.0 tPlant disease.g1995 Mar., v. 79, no. 3 p.243-246wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-02433Available from publisher's Web site  a19950609b19950615c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02603naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155100001800172245010000190300001600290500001500306520137600321650002501697650001301722650001101735650003201746650003001778650001301808650002701821650001601848653002001864700001801884700001601902700001701918773008801935852000902023856007802032930003302110945002502143946001302168655001202181IND4380274620221120151130.0060518e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438027462DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-90-06372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDufault, N.S.10aRole of temperature and moisture in the production and maturation of Gibberella zeae perithecia  ap. 637-644.  a2019-12-04  aFusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae) is the most common pathogen of Fusarium head blight (FHB) in North America. Ascospores released from the perithecia of G. zeae are a major source of inoculum for FHB. The influence of temperature and moisture on perithecial production and development was evaluated by monitoring autoclaved inoculated cornstalk sections in controlled environments. Perithecial development was assessed at all combinations of five temperatures (12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 degrees C) and four moisture levels with means (range) -0.45 (-0.18, -1.16), -1.30 (-0.81, -1.68), -2.36 (-1.34, -3.53) and -4.02 (-2.39, -5.88) MPa. Moisture levels of -0.45 and -1.30 MPa and temperatures from 16 to 24 degrees C promoted perithecial production and development. Temperatures of 12 and 28 degrees C and moisture levels of -2.36 and -4.02 MPa either slowed or limited perithecial production and development. The water potential of -1.30 MPa had mature perithecia after 10 days at 20 degrees C, but not until after 15 days for 24 degrees C. In contrast, few perithecia achieved maturity and produced ascospores at lower moisture levels (-2.36 and -4.02 MPa) and low (12 degrees C) and high (28 degrees C) temperatures. In the future, it may be possible to use the information gathered in these experiments to improve the accuracy of FHB forecasting systems. 3aFusarium graminearum 3aZea mays 3ablight 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3afungal diseases of plants 3ahumidity 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3atemperature 0aGibberella zeae1 aDe Wolf, E.D.1 aLipps, P.E.1 aMadden, L.V.0 tPlant disease.g2006 May, v. 90, no. 5 p.637-644wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-90-06373Available from publisher's Web site  a20060731b20060804c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/07/31  aOther US 7aarticle03324naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138100001200155245013900167300001600306520192000322650003002242650003402272650002702306650001502333650001702348650000902365650001602374650001002390650002202400650001602422653002102438653002302459653002502482653002902507700001402536700001702550700001502567700001602582700001602598773007002614852000902684856007802693930003302771945002502804946001302829655001202842IND4380274120221120150940.0060518e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438027412DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-90-06152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGuo, Q.10aSurvival and subsequent dispersal of rice sclerotial disease fungi, Rhizoctonia oryzae and Rhizoctonia oryzae-sativae, in paddy fields  ap. 615-622.  aIn 1998 to 2001, a commercial rice (Oryza sativa) paddy field (area: ca. 0.14 ha) was surveyed for Rhizoctonia oryzae and R. oryzae-sativae, causal agents of bordered sheath spot and brown sclerotium disease of rice plants, respectively, to determine their survival in soil and stubble during the pretransplanting season, and the effect on disease development during the maturation season of rice. Then, infection by these fungi of weeds belonging to 17 families, which grew in the four neighboring fields, was examined during rice growing seasons. All field isolates of the fungi from soil, stubble, rice sclerotial disease lesions (diseased tissues), and weeds were assorted into mycelial compatibility groups (MCGs) based on the barrage zone reaction of paired isolates. In R. oryzae, 3 to 8 MCGs were annually found from soil/stubble, 2 to 4 MCGs from rice bordered sheath spot lesions, and 4 to 9 MCGs from 4 to 14 weeds. MCGs common to both soil/stubble and diseased tissues, soil/stubble and weeds, and diseased tissues and weeds numbered 1 to 2 in all cases. In R. oryzae-sativae, MCGs common to both soil/stubble and brown sclerotium disease lesions, and soil/stubble and weeds, numbered 1 to 4 and 0 to 5, respectively. In R. oryzae and R. oryzae-sativae, a few MCGs were common to soil/stubble, diseased tissues and weeds, and some were also common to diseased tissues in 1998 and soil/stubble in 1999, or weed in 1998 and diseased tissues in 1999. Members belonging to a single MCG from rice diseased tissues were detected from maximally five weeds growing in the neighboring fields. These results indicate that fungi that had caused sclerotial diseases at the maturation stage of rice plants survived on and in soil and stubble until the pretransplanting season of the next year, followed by wide dispersal in and out of fields and by infection and disease development on rice plants and various weeds. 3afungal diseases of plants 3aCeratobasidium oryzae-sativae 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3asoil fungi 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3ahost plants 3aweeds 3aalternative hosts 3apaddy soils 0aWaitea circinata 0aRhizoctonia oryzae 0abordered sheath spot 0abrown sclerotium disease1 aKamio, A.1 aSharma, B.S.1 aSagara, Y.1 aArakawa, M.1 aInagaki, K.0 tPlant disease.g2006 May, v. 90, no. 5 p.615-622x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-90-06153Available from publisher's Web site  a20060731b20060804c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/07/31  aOther US 7aarticle02254naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155072001700172100001800189245010900207300001600316520099300332650003001325650001801355650002301373650002201396650001001418650001601428650001901444650001501463650003201478700001701510700001701527700001401544700001601558773008801574852000901662856007801671930003301749945002501782946001301807655001201820IND4380274320221120151056.0060518e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438027432DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-90-06232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Host plant resistance to WSMV can reduce losses. This study was conducted to characterize a new source of temperature-sensitive resistance found in CO960293 wheat. The source of the temperature-sensitive resistance in CO960293 is unknown. Parental and other wheat lines were tested for WSMV resistance using 51 WSMV isolates under different temperatures to determine the stability of the resistance, and yield trials were conducted in the field for 3 years. All parental wheat lines became infected by WSMV at all temperatures and were infective in back assay to 'Tomahawk' wheat. No WSMV isolate defeated the resistance of CO960293 at 18 degrees C. Yield of CO960293 in field trials was reduced in only 1 of 3 years. Our data demonstrate that this wheat line can be a valuable source of resistance to WSMV in wheat programs, particularly in areas where temperatures are cool following planting in the fall. 3aWheat streak mosaic virus 3aplant viruses 3adisease resistance 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3ahost plants 3aplant genetics 3acrop yield 3ahost-pathogen relationships1 aMartin, T.J.1 aHarvey, T.L.1 aHaber, S.1 aHaley, S.D.0 tPlant disease.g2006 May, v. 90, no. 5 p.623-628wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-90-06233Available from publisher's Web site  a20060731b20060804c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/07/31  aOther US 7aarticle03141naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155072001700172072001700189100002200206245007700228300001600305520175700321650001602078650001302094650002002107650001502127650002702142650001602169650001302185650001602198650001402214650002202228650001702250650003202267650002302299650002302322651001302345700001902358700001502377700001502392773007002407852000902477856007802486930003302564945002502597946001302622655001202635IND4380273720221120151112.0060518e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438027372DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-90-05972doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKirkpatrick, M.T.14aThe effect of Pythium ultimum and soil flooding on two soybean cultivars  ap. 597-602.  aThe effect of flooding and Pythium ultimum on soybean, Glycine max, was determined in a series of greenhouse experiments using the cultivars Hutcheson and Archer. Seeds were planted into pasteurized soil either not infested or infested with sand-cornmeal inoculum of P. ultimum and either flooded at emergence for 2 days or at the four leaf node stage (V4) for 5 days. A nonflooded control was included in each experiment. Seeds placed directly into infested soil resulted in little or no stand for Hutcheson regardless of flood treatment, whereas stand was reduced for Archer only in the flooded infested soil treatment. Additional experiments were conducted by placing seed onto a 2- to 5-mm layer of pathogen-free soil on top of the infested soil. Flooding at emergence reduced plant height, growth stage, and top dry weight for Hutcheson and root fresh weight for both cultivars. Greater reductions for Hutcheson in root weight, and top dry weight in P. ultimum-infested soil in the soil layer experiments, also indicated that Hutcheson was more susceptible than Archer. Flooding alone decreased root weights, and infestation with P. ultimum reduced weights further resulting in an additive effect. This also was the case for plant height, growth stage, and top dry weight for Hutcheson for flooding at emergence. Root discoloration was greatly increased for both cultivars in infested soil flooded at emergence. Similar results were found when plants were flooded at V4; however, the effect was not as great as with flooding at emergence. These studies indicate that Pythium damping-off and root rot may account for a portion of the negative response of soybean to flooding. The results also indicate that Archer has some resistance to P. ultimum. 3adamping off 3aroot rot 3aPythium ultimum 3asoil fungi 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3ahost plants 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3aplant growth 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aflooded conditions 3asoil water content 3aArkansas1 aRothrock, C.S.1 aRupe, J.C.1 aGbur, E.E.0 tPlant disease.g2006 May, v. 90, no. 5 p.597-602x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-90-05973Available from publisher's Web site  a20060731b20060804c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/07/31  aOther US 7aarticle02014naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245010100155300001600256500001500272520090300287650002701190650001201217650001901229650001401248650001401262651001201276653001401288653001801302700001501320700001601335700001401351700001601365773008901381852000901470856007801479930003301557945001301590946001301603655001201616IND2046002920221120151139.0950511e199504  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204600292DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-03592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPernezny, K.13aAn outbreak of bacterial spot of lettuce in Florida caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. vitians  ap. 359-360.  a2019-12-04  aA widespread and damaging outbreak of a leaf spot disease of lettuce occurred in the 1992-93 winter vegetable season in southern Florida. Individual leaf lesions were dark brown to black, water-soaked, and greasy in appearance. A yellow-pigmented bacterium was consistently isolated. All 1992-93 lettuce strains and reference strains produced symptoms in greenhouse test plants that were identical to those seen in the field. Disease reactions generally were more severe in cos and butterhead lettuce than in crisphead. Strains were gram-negative rods, and negative for glucose fermentation, nitrate reduction, urease production, and utilization of asparagine as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen. Aesculin was hydrolyzed, gelatin was liquefied, and proteolysis occurred in litmus milk. Cellular fatty acid profiles matched well to library database strains of Xanthomonas campestris pv. vitians. 3aXanthomonas campestris 3atillage 3aLactuca sativa 3aleaf spot 3avirulence 3aFlorida 0aoutbreaks 0aleaf spotting1 aRaid, R.N.1 aStall, R.E.1 aHodge, N.1 aCollins, J.0 tPlant disease.g1995 Apr., v. 79, no. 4 p.359-360wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-03593Available from publisher's Web site  a19950609b19950615c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02449naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001900138245014200157300001800299500001500317520098700332650001301319650003301332650002201365650002001387650001201407650001501419650002001434650002001454650001801474650002301492650002001515650003001535650001201565651001301577653002701590653002101617653001301638653002301651653002501674700001801699773009201717852000901809856007801818930003301896945001301929946001301942655001201955IND2049328920221120124358.0951227e199512  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204932892DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-12252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHershman, D.E.10aEtiology of canola blackleg in Kentucky and seasonal discharge patterns of Leptosphaeria maculans ascospores from infested canola stubble  ap. 1225-1229.  a2019-12-04  aA limited survey was conducted to determine the pathogenicity groupings (PG) of Leptosphaeria maculans associated with canola (Brassica napus var. oleifera) blackleg in south central Kentucky. In addition, multiyear ascospore discharge patterns were determined for infested canola stubble from seven fields. Strains PG3 and PG4 of L. maculans were most commonly associated with blackleg in Kentucky (18.4 and 79% of the isolates tested, respectively). One weakly virulent PG1 isolate (2.6%) and no PG2 isolates were found. L. maculans-infested canola stubble discharged ascospores within 1 week of harvest in 1990 and 1991. Early discharge patterns were not determined in 1989. Stubble collected each year released significant quantities of ascospores in the fall and winter months following crop harvest. However, few ascospores were released from infested stubble after the first year following crop production. The implications of these data in blackleg management are discussed. 3aetiology 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aPlenodomus lingam 3aspore dispersal 3astubble 3aascospores 3adisease control 3acrop management 3apathogenicity 3aseasonal variation 3adisease surveys 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3astrains 3aKentucky 0aLeptosphaeria maculans 0acontrol programs 0apatterns 0astubble management 0apathogenicity groups1 aPerkins, D.M.0 tPlant disease.g1995 Dec., v. 79, no. 12 p.1225-1229wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-12253Available from publisher's Web site  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02496naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245014500155300001800300500001500318520125900333650001901592650001301611650001901624650002101643650002301664650001701687650003801704650002001742650002001762651001101782651001501793653001401808653001201822700002001834773007401854852000901928856007801937930003302015945001302048946001302061655001202074IND2049017920221120124445.0951130e199511  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204901792DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-11322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpotts, R.A.10aCopper, oxytetracycline, and streptomycin resistance of Pseudomonas syringae pv syringae strains from pear orchards in Oregon and Washington  ap. 1132-1135.  a2019-12-04  aA total of 323 strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae were collected from six pear orchards in the Mid-Columbia region of Oregon and Washington from 1989 through 1992. Of all strains of P. s. pv. syringae, 8, 25, 75, and 99% did not grow on modified casitone-yeast extract-glycerol medium amended with 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mM CuSO4, respectively. Strains of P. s. pv. syringae resistant to 50, 100, 250, and 500 micrograms of oxytetracycline per ml were recovered from six, three, two, and one of the six orchards, respectively. Nevertheless, over 70 and 90% of the strains in all six orchards were sensitive to 50 and 250 micrograms of oxytetracycline per ml, respectively. Strains of P. s. pv. syringae resistant to 50 and 500 micrograms of streptomycin per ml were found in six and four of six orchards, respectively. Twenty-five strains were resistant to both copper (1 mM) and streptomycin (100 micrograms/ml), and three of those were resistant to copper, streptomycin, and oxytetracycline (250 micrograms/ml). To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating resistance of strains of P. s. pv. syringae to copper, streptomycin, and oxytetracycline. Resistance correlated positively to the antibiotic spray programs in the orchards. 3acopper sulfate 3aorchards 3aPyrus communis 3aapplication rate 3astrain differences 3astreptomycin 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 3adisease surveys 3aoxytetracycline 3aOregon 0aWashington 0atolerance 0astrains1 aCervantes, L.A.0 tPlant disease.g1995 Nov., v. 79, no. 11 p.1132-1135x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-11323Available from publisher's Web site  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02185naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245012700155300001800282520094000300650001301240650003901253650002301292650001401315650001201329650003001341650001601371650002101387650002401408651001301432651001301445651001301458700001501471700001901486700002001505773009201525852000901617856007801626930003301704945001301737946001301750655001201763IND2049328120221120113248.0951227e199512  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204932812DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-12022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPataky, J.K.10aIncidence and severity of Stewart's bacterial wilt on sequential plantings of resistant and susceptible sweet corn hybrids  ap. 1202-1207.  aNaturally occurring Stewart's wilt, caused by Erwinia stewartii, was monitored in nine trials in Delaware, Illinois, and Missouri on sequential plantings of resistant, intermediate, and susceptible sweet corn (Zea mays) hybrids. Disease incidence and severity differed among trials, among early and late plantings, and among hybrids differing in resistance. Resistant hybrids were easily differentiated from susceptible hybrids by incidence or severity, but reactions of intermediate hybrids were not always distinguishable from those of resistant and susceptible hybrids. Development of Stewart's wilt differed among plantings within and between years. Incidence of Stewart's wilt on the early planting of the susceptible hybrids did not reliably indicate subsequent levels of disease. Nevertheless, it seems prudent to implement control measures for late plantings if Stewart's wilt is abundant at seedling stages of early plantings. 3aZea mays 3aPantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii 3adisease resistance 3aincidence 3ahybrids 3afungal diseases of plants 3asowing date 3adisease severity 3avarietal resistance 3aDelaware 3aIllinois 3aMissouri1 aHawk, J.A.1 aWeldekidan, T.1 aMoghaddam, P.F.0 tPlant disease.g1995 Dec., v. 79, no. 12 p.1202-1207wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-12023Available from publisher's Web site  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle01844naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245011700155300001800272500001500290520057100305650002700876650002000903650002800923650001400951650001200965650001800977653002400995653001201019653001301031653001201044653003001056653002601086653002801112700001701140700001501157773009201172852000901264856007801273930003301351945001301384946001301397655001201410IND2049018920221120113218.0951130e199511  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204901892DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-11612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatanabe, T.10aDecline of Phellodendron amurense in Tokyo: associated fungi and pathogenicity of associated Cylindrocladium spp  ap. 1161-1164.  a2019-12-04  aThree Cylindrocladium species were isolated from Phellodendron amurense seedlings together with fungi belonging to 24 genera, and 11 genera from the tree roots.

On leaves, circular spots with light brown centers and dark brown margins were produced. Pathogenicity was greatly affected by the conidial concentration and dew temperature, but not by the age of cultures from which conidia were used for inoculation. Conidia stored in sucrose solution at 4 degrees C were viable for more than 14 months. Myrothecium verrucaria did not spread from diseased plants to healthy plants, even when the healthy plants touched the diseased plants in the dew tent for 7 days. Four-week-old or younger seedlings of leafy spurge grown from seeds were killed with one inoculation, but repeated inoculations were required to kill older plants. Pathogenicity tests on 89 collections of nine species of Euphorbia and on reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea) showed that the pathogen severely infected all collections tested. The susceptibility of E. corollata, E. cyathophora, E. cyparissias, E. helioscopia, E. heterophylla, E. lathyrus, E. marginata Pursh varigata, E. virgata, and reed canarygrass to M. verrucaria is reported for the first time. 3aviability 3aweed control 3aEuphorbia esula 3aconidia 3aMyrothecium verrucaria 3ainoculum density 3adew 3aage 3adisease transmission 3atemperature 3amycoherbicides 3aPhalaris arundinacea 0acultures 0aspecies 0aefficacy 0aspread 0asymptomatology 0aEuphorbia1 aJong, S.C.0 tPlant disease.g1995 Oct., v. 79, no. 10 p.998-1002x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-09983Available from publisher's Web site  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02133naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245006400155300001600219520114200235650002201377650001001399650003001409650001401439650002301453650002001476651001801496700001501514700001801529773009001547852000901637856007801646930003301724945001301757946001301770655001201783IND2048052120221120113231.0950929e199509  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204805212DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-09692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoelfs, A.P.10aRaces of Puccinia graminis in the United States during 1993  ap. 969-972.  aWheat stem rust overwintered in southern Texas, southern Louisiana, and southern Georgia.

No virulence to Pg-9, -13, -16, or -a was found in the 1993 oat stem rust population. 3aPuccinia graminis 3araces 3ageographical distribution 3avirulence 3agenetic resistance 3adisease surveys 3aUnited States1 aLong, D.L.1 aRoberts, J.J.0 tPlant disease.g1995 Sept., v. 79, no. 9 p.969-972wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-09693Available from publisher's Web site  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02610naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001800138245010600156300001600262520118000278650002401458650002001482650004301502650002701545650001201572650001001584650001801594650001401612650001401626650002301640650002601663650001401689650002001703650003301723650002101756651001101777653001301788653001601801653001601817653002101833653001701854700001601871773007101887852000901958856007801967930003302045945001302078946001302091655001202104IND2047849420221120113216.0950920e199508  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204784942DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-08492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartman, G.L.10aCharacteristics of Phytophthora infestans isolates and development of late blight on tomato in Taiwan  ap. 849-852.  aThirteen isolates of Phytophthora infestans were grown on various solidified media. Growth of all isolates was best on rye A agar. Mean sporangia length and width ranged from 23.5 to 41.7 micrometer X 13.9 to 23.4 micrometer, respectively, with a length/width ratio of 1.69 to 1.92. All isolates were all mating type and all isolates, except one isolate from potato, were classified race T1 because blight developed on three tomato lines with the Ph1 resistance gene. Area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) differed significantly (P < 0.05) by isolate on both detached tomato leaflets and pot-cultured seedlings. Isolate Pi11 from potato had the lowest AUDPC values on detached leaves and seedlings. Late blight occurred on tomato seedlings transplanted monthly in the central highlands of Taiwan with greatest disease severity from March to June. Field-grown tomatoes sprayed with metalaxyl once and twice per week reduced late blight AUDPC values, decreased yield losses, and increased fruit numbers, compared with the results from fewer or no sprays. Disease, measured as AUDPC, correlated negatively (P < 0.05) to yield (r = -0.82) and number of fruit (r = -0.76). 3asexual reproduction 3amating behavior 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aPhytophthora infestans 3astrains 3araces 3aculture media 3asporangia 3avirulence 3adisease resistance 3aenvironmental factors 3ametalaxyl 3adisease control 3aplant diseases and disorders 3adisease severity 3aTaiwan 0aefficacy 0acomparisons 0agrowth rate 0acharacterization 0amating types1 aHuang, Y.H.0 tPlant disease.g1995 Aug., v. 79, no. 8 p.849-852x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-08493Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03196naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245013000155300001600285500001500301520194200316650001502258650002202273650002802295650002402323650002302347650001802370650001402388650001502402650001902417651001002436653001402446653001602460653001502476653001202491700001502503700001502518773007102533852000902604856007802613930003302691945001302724946001302737655001202750IND2047848820221120113204.0950920e199508  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204784882DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-08342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManici, L.M.10aTemperature responses of isolates of Macrophomina phaseolina from different climatic regions of sunflower production in Italy  ap. 834-838.  a2019-12-04  aSixty-four isolates of Macrophomina phaseolina from sunflower, collected in four different climatic areas of Italy (north, mideast, south, midwest), were subjected to growth rate (GR) tests at 15, 25, 30, 35, and 40 degrees C, and to chlorate resistance tests. The pathogenicity of 24 isolates was also tested on maize, sorghum, soybean. sunflower, safflower, sugar beet, kenaf, and melon seedlings. The optimum temperature for growth was 30 degrees C for 62 isolates and 35 degrees C for two isolates. Isolate GR varied considerably at all temperatures (P < 0.01) but the maximum variability between isolates occurred at 15 and 40 degrees C. Isolates from the north (colder area) grew better at lower temperatures than other isolates and also showed a good adaptability to 40 degrees C. Isolates from the midwest (Mediterranean climate) had the fastest GR at 40 degrees C but the worst GR at the lowest temperature tested. Isolates from the mideast and south, with Mediterranean climate, grew better at the optimum temperatures (30 and 35 degrees) and showed the poorest adaptability to the limit temperatures (15 and 40 degrees C). Among the isolates, 95% were chlorate tolerant, 2% were chlorate sensitive and 3% were chlorate resistant; among the chlorate tolerant isolates, 47% had feathery chlorate phenotype and 48% only showed less dense colonies than the control without potassium chlorate. The isolates were very pathogenic on soybean, moderately pathogenic on sunflower, safflower, sorghum, and melon, mildly pathogenic on sugar beet and kenaf, and not pathogenic on maize using an in vitro seedling inoculation assay. These results suggest that M. phaseolina isolates from sunflower can adapt to continental conditions such as those of northern Italy, and that the fungal population, which is chlorate tolerant and pathogenic to seedlings of various cultivated species, can be a potentially widespread pathogen on many crops. 3ahost range 3aHelianthus annuus 3aMacrophomina phaseolina 3aambient temperature 3astrain differences 3apathogenicity 3achlorates 3aprovenance 3aclimatic zones 3aItaly 0atolerance 0agrowth rate 0aadaptation 0astrains1 aCaputo, F.1 aCerato, C.0 tPlant disease.g1995 Aug., v. 79, no. 8 p.834-838x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-08343Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02892naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002000138245009800158300001600256500001500272520105100287650001401338650001901352650001401371650001901385650001101404650003101415650002301446650003001469650002201499650001101521650001101532650001401543650002601557650002001583650001101603650001801614650002301632650002601655650001901681650001701700650002401717650002101741651001101762653001501773653003301788653001001821653002201831653002501853653002101878653001301899653002701912700002001939700002001959700001501979773009001994852000902084856007802093930003302171945001302204946001302217655001202230IND2048049520221120113151.0950929e199509  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204804952DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-08932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillareal, R.L.10aYield loss to spot blotch in spring bread wheat in warm nontraditional wheat production areas  ap. 893-897.  a2019-12-04  aTwenty-five spring bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars were evaluated for 2 years at Poza Rica, Mexico, for grain yield, aboveground biomass at maturity, harvest index, yield components, and test weight under a natural epidemic of spot blotch (caused by Cochliobolus sativus) with and without fungicide protection. Diseased plot yields were 43.2% lower than fungicide-protected plot yields. Aboveground biomass yield at maturity and harvest index were reduced by 18 and 31.3%, respectively, on blotched plots. The average percent reduction on primary yield components due to the disease was highest for number of grains per m2 (32.8%), followed by l,OOO-grain weight (30.5%), number of grains per spike (24.6%), and number of spikes per m2 (12%). Test weight was reduced 8.4%. Resistance to Cochliobolus sativus present in cultivars with resistance from Thinopyrum curvifolium or materials derived from Chinese germ plasm increased grain yield. This germ plasm may be a valuable source of genes for snot blotch resistance in T. aestivum. 3aElytrigia 3afilling period 3aflowering 3ainflorescences 3aheight 3aintergeneric hybridization 3agenetic resistance 3afungal diseases of plants 3aTriticum aestivum 3alength 3aweight 3acultivars 3aplant characteristics 3adisease control 3agrains 3aharvest index 3abiomass production 3aBipolaris sorokiniana 3aplant breeding 3atebuconazole 3aaboveground biomass 3achemical control 3aMexico 0acrop yield 0aplant diseases and disorders 0alines 0adays to flowering 0aCochliobolus sativus 0ayield components 0amaturity 0aphysiological maturity1 aMujeeb-Kazi, A.1 aGilchrist, L.I.1 aToro, E.D.0 tPlant disease.g1995 Sept., v. 79, no. 9 p.893-897wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-08933Available from publisher's Web site  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02057naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001600138245012400154300001600278520087700294650001101171650001501182650003001197650002401227650001401251650001401265650002401279650001001303650001101313650002801324653001101352653001601363653001401379700001901393773008901412852000901501856007801510930003301588945001301621946001301634655001201647IND2047847920221120113232.0950920e199508  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204784792DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-08132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiles, R.K.10aUse of trifoliate orange as a comparative standard for assessing the resistance of citrus rootstocks to citrus nematode  ap. 813-818.  aTwenty-one citrus rootstocks were screened in a greenhouse for resistance to Tylenchulus semipenetrans.

Initial tests with an antiserum to TuMV Florida isolate (TuMV-FL) from another source did not detect TuMV-C2 in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-immunodiffusion and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In order to develop an antiserum with a broader spectrum of reaction, purified virus of TuMV-C1 was stored for 1 week, to ensure cleavage of the coat protein, before being used for immunization. Polyclonal antiserum produced to TuMV-C1 reacted with the four TuMV pathotypes and 15 other isolates in SDS-immunodiffusion and double antibody sandwich and indirect ELISA. In Western blot, this antiserum reacted mainly to breakdown products of 29K and 27K of the coat protein; in contrast, antiserum to TuMV-FL reacted primarily to the native coat protein (38K). Broader reactivity of the TuMV-C1 antiserum should make it useful for screening breeding lines and for general diagnosis of TuMV. 3acoat proteins 3acultivars 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aTurnip mosaic virus 3aantiserum 3apathotypes 3adetection 0aimmunodiffusion 0aidentification 0abrassica campestris subsp. pekinensis 0adouble antibody sandwich 0aBrassica rapa subsp. campestris 0aimmunologic techniques1 aProvvidenti, R.1 aGonsalves, D.0 tPlant disease.g1995 Aug., v. 79, no. 8 p.809-812x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-08093Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02161naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002200138245008100160300001600241520106500257650001401322650001801336650001401354650001101368650003001379650002601409650001401435650001401449650002501463653003601488700001801524700001601542773007101558852000901629856007801638930003301716945001301749946001301762655001201775IND2047846520221120113143.0950920e199508  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204784652DNAL7 a10.1094/PD-79-07922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraithwaite, K.S.10aDetection of sugarcane bacilliform virus using the polymerase chain reaction  ap. 792-796.  aA sensitive assay based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been developed to detect sugarcane bacilliform badnavirus (SCBV) in diseased sugarcane plants. Two sets of primer airs, which prime the synthesis of DNA from the putative aspartic protease and reverse transcriptase coding regions, were evaluated. Best results were obtained with the primer pair CBVF5 and SCBVR5, which primes the synthesis of a 221-bp virus-specific fragment from the nucleic acid extracts of diseased sugarcane plants. The viral origin of the PCR products was confirmed by Southern hybridization with a 1,602-bp fragment from the cloned SCBV genome. This diagnostic test was used to detect SCBV infection of noble canes (Saccharum officinarum), commercial hybrids, clones within the "Saccharum complex" including S. robustum, S. spontaneum, S. barberi, Erianthus arundinaceus, and E. ravennae, as well as banana infected with banana streak virus. This sensitive screening test has been used to show that SCBV is widely distributed throughout Saccharum and related germ plasm. 3aSaccharum 3aplant viruses 3adetection 3aassays 3apolymerase chain reaction 3adiagnostic techniques 3agermplasm 3ascreening 3anucleotide sequences 0asugarcane bacillform badnavirus1 aEgeskov, N.M.1 aSmith, G.R.0 tPlant disease.g1995 Aug., v. 79, no. 8 p.792-796x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-79-07923Available from publisher's Web site  a20060804b20060906c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02634naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002600146245010600172300001600278500001500294520128300309650001801592650003001610650002301640650001801663650002501681650001801706650001601724650002801740651001001768653001901778653001701797653001601814653002301830653001301853653001201866700002101878700001801899700002201917773007101939852000902010856008602019930003302105945001302138946001302151655001202164IND2322414520221120094630.0010807e200104  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232241452DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.4.4112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanchez-Hernandez, E.10aIdentity and pathogenicity of two Phytophthora taxa associated with a new root disease of olive trees  ap. 411-416.  a2019-12-04  aFifty-two Phytophthora isolates from necrotic roots of olives were characterized. Colony morphologies on carrot-agar medium led us to separate them into two groups: A (36 isolates) and B (16 isolates). The optimum growth temperature for Group A was about 21 degrees C, with slow growth at 30 degrees C. In contrast, Group B isolates had an optimum temperature for growth of 26 degrees C, and grew rapidly at 30 degrees C. Growth rates, sporangial and oogonial characteristics of the Group A isolates conformed to P. megasperma "BHR-type" sensu stricto. This designation was supported by a sequence analysis of their ITS rDNA regions. Colony patterns, sporangial characteristics and temperature-growth relationships of the Group B isolates conformed closely to those of the 'O-group' taxon of Phytophthora. They also conformed to this unusual taxon in their ITS sequence. In addition, Group B isolates were either entirely self-sterile, self-sterile Als or weakly self-fertile. Pathogenicity tests showed that both taxa were highly aggressive on roots of olive trees. The association of flooding with Phytophthora infection indicates that the previously reported high sensitivity of olive to root asphyxiation may be more properly regarded as root-rot caused by Phytophthora spp. 3aribosomal DNA 3afungal diseases of plants 3astrain differences 3apathogenicity 3anucleotide sequences 3aOlea europaea 3atemperature 3aPhytophthora megasperma 3aSpain 0aidentification 0aPhytophthora 0agrowth rate 0aself compatibility 0aflooding 0astrains1 aMunoz-Garcia, M.1 aBrasier, C.M.1 aTrapero-Casas, A.0 tPlant disease.g2001 Apr., v. 85, no. 4 p.411-416x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.4.4113Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02614naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001700146245010900163300001600272500001500288520133300303650002301636650001701659650001801676650001501694650002201709650001701731650002301748650002301771650002601794650001401820651001201834653002501846653001501871700001601886700002001902700002101922773007101943852000902014856008602023930003302109945001302142946001302155655001202168IND2322422520221120082933.0010807e200103  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232242252DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.3.2922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCsinos, A.S.10aManagement of Tomato spotted wilt virus in flue-cured tobacco with acibenzolar-S-methyl and imidacloprid  ap. 292-296.  a2019-12-04  aTomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) continues to be a major production constraint in flue-cured tobacco in Georgia. Pretransplant applications of acibenzolar-S-methyl (Actigard) and imidacloprid (Admire and Provado) were evaluated in field trials, singly and in combination, in four locations in 1999. Acibenzolar-S-methyl was also evaluated for its effect on growth and yield, potential phytotoxicity, and activity against tobacco blackshank incited by Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae. Acibenzolar-S-methyl alone and with imidacloprid significantly reduced TSWV incidence in all four locations, but the disease incidence in the imidacloprid-treated plots was lower in only one of the four sites. Applications of acibenzolar-S-methyl starting at 4 weeks posttransplant had no effect on TSWV incidence, size, or yield of tobacco compared with nontreated plots. Acibenzolar-S-methyl did not reduce blackshank in a field trial. In the greenhouse, rates of acibenzolar-S-methyl ranging from 0.25 to 8 g a.i. per 7,000 plants showed reductions in growth that did not seem to be related to rate. Pretransplant applications of acibenzolar-S-methyl were critical to the suppression of TSWV, while initial applications made posttransplant had no effect, suggesting that plants must be protected prior to introduction into the field. 3aapplication timing 3aPhytophthora 3aphytotoxicity 3acrop yield 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aimidacloprid 3adisease resistance 3ainduced resistance 3aanti-infective agents 3aincidence 3aGeorgia 0aantimicrobial agents 0aevaluation1 aPappu, H.R.1 aMcPherson, R.M.1 aStephenson, M.G.0 tPlant disease.g2001 Mar., v. 85, no. 3 p.292-296x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.3.2923Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03372naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001400146245011500160300001600275500001500291520215800306650001602464650002602480650001802506650001902524650001802543650002002561651001302581653001502594653001902609653002802628653001602656700001502672700001902687700001902706773007102725852000902796856008602805930003302891945001302924946001302937655001202950IND2322421420221120083044.0010807e200103  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232242142DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.3.2562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, J.H.10aIsolation and identification of Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines from soil on modified Nash and Snyder's medium  ap. 256-260.  a2019-12-04  aModified Nash and Snyder's medium (MNSM) has been used to study soil populations of the fungus Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines, the causal agent of sudden death syndrome (SDS) of soybean. However, no studies have been conducted to confirm the accuracy of this technique in enumerating the SDS pathogen. To determine what portion of the colonies enumerated on MNSM are the SDS pathogen, 282 isolates resembling F. solani f. sp. glycines were collected from soil of two fields with a history of SDS in Arkansas using a soil dilution method with MNSM. The colony morphology of these isolates was compared on MNSM and on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Of these isolates, 112 were tested for pathogenicity on soybean in the greenhouse. In addition to fungi that produced colonies typical of F. solani f. sp. glycines on MNSM, 5 isolates each of four common colony types on MNSM were collected from each field for a total of 40 isolates. These isolates were compared to F. solani f. sp. glycines for colony morphology on PDA and for pathogenicity. Isolates that had colonies on MNSM that resembled F. solani f. sp. glycines had colony morphologies on PDA similar to this pathogen and produced SDS-like foliar symptoms in greenhouse inoculations of soybean. There was a significant quadratic relationship between foliar symptom severity and plant fresh weight. None of the other isolates tested resembled F. solani f. sp. glycines on either MNSM or PDA or produced SDS-foliar symptoms in greenhouse inoculations. These non-SDS isolates were F. solani, F. merismoides, a Pythium sp., and a Paecilomyces sp. All of these isolates produced some root rot, but significantly less than the F. solani f. sp. glycines reference isolate. The results of this study established that soil populations of F. solani f. sp. glycines can be accurately enumerated using MNSM. It should be noted that, on both MNSM and PDA, F. solani f. sp. glycines can resemble some isolates of F. solani f. sp. phaseoli, so pathogenicity tests of random isolates may be required to confirm the forma specialis especially in fields that have a history of both Glycines max and Phaseolus vulgaris. 3aGlycine max 3aquantitative analysis 3apathogenicity 3afungal anatomy 3aculture media 3aFusarium solani 3aArkansas 0aevaluation 0aidentification 0aexperimental infections 0amethodology1 aRupe, J.C.1 aCummings, M.S.1 aGbur, E.E.

To determine the relationship between early-season powdery mildew and late-season leaf rust on flour yield, flour protein, alkaline water retention capacity, and kernel texture (softness equivalent), a study was conducted over 2 years at Kinston and Plymouth, NC. Different levels of powdery mildew and leaf rust developed on three winter wheat cultivars that varied in levels of disease resistance, the presence of seed treatment, and the presence and timing of foliar fungicide application. In Kinston and Plymouth in 1989-90, where leaf rust occurred early, the softness equivalent score was lower in wheat grown from seed treated with triadimenol. The following year, when the leaf rust epidemic increased later, foliar fungicide application reduced disease and resulted in lower softness equivalent scores in both Plymouth and Kinston for cv. Saluda and in Kinston for cv. Coker 983. A regression model was developed to describe the relationship between the log of the area under the disease progress curves and adjusted flour yield (AFY). The AFY of Saluda was reduced in the presence of powdery mildew such that %AFY = 103.96-0.92 (log AUMPC). 3acultivars 3atexture 3aprotein content 3aseeds 3afungal diseases of plants 3atriadimenol 3aBlumeria graminis f. sp. tritici 3awheat 3aPuccinia recondita 3amilling quality 3aTriticum aestivum 3awater holding capacity 3aincidence 3aNorth Carolina 0aErysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici1 aLeath, S.1 aFinney, P.L.0 tPlant disease.g2001 Apr., v. 85, no. 4 p.423-429x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.4.4233Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02395naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001600146245012000162300001600282520126200298650001901560650001801579650003001597650001401627650002601641650001401667650001501681650000901696650001101705651001201716653001301728653001501741700001601756773007101772852000901843856008601852930003301938945001301971946001301984655001201997IND2322008720221120082907.0010712e200106  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232200872DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.6.6172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStewart, S.10aRT-PCR based detection of Rupestris stem pitting associated virus within field-grown grapevines throughout the year  ap. 617-620.  aThe presence of Rupestris stem pitting associated virus (RSPaV) can go unnoticed since symptoms appear only if additional viruses are present. Detection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is possible; however, this assay could be unreliable if the tissue that is being tested has detection-interfering compounds, or if the virus has a low titer. This paper reports on (i) use of a recently developed extraction method and internal control to determine which tissues from field-grown grapevines yield extracts that are reliable for virus detection by RT-PCR, and (ii) a survey for RSPaV of different tissues from the Vitis vinifera varieties Riesling, Chardonnay, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Noir, and Gamay, as well as from the rootstocks 3309 and Riparia, which were harvested in Ontario, Canada, at different times of the year. Amplifiable extracts were obtained from virtually all bud, shoot tip, seed, and cane samples tested. Detectable amounts of RSPaV were generally found in all tissues of infected plants except young buds collected in the summer. A combination of three single buds from dormant canes, less time-consuming than the preparation of cane shavings, was a reliable source for RSPaV detection. 3aVitis vinifera 3aplant viruses 3apolymerase chain reaction 3adetection 3adiagnostic techniques 3acultivars 3arootstocks 3abuds 3ashoots 3aOntario 0asymptoms 0aevaluation1 aNassuth, A.0 tPlant disease.g2001 June, v. 85, no. 6 p.617-620x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.6.6173Available from publisher's Web site  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02222naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245009100168300001600259500002400275520111800299650002701417650002501444650002501469650001501494653002401509653002701533653002501560653002401585653001101609653001101620700002301631700001701654773012501671852000901796856005501805655001201860IND4392071620221120073507.0070603e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439207162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1470-6431.2007.00589.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Euehun10aStress, coping and consumer preferences: a two-way transitional event history analysis  ap. 428-435.  aIncludes references  aMore than 20 years ago, Andreasen suggested the importance of studying life status changes for understanding a consumer's likelihood of changing his or her preferences, attitudes and behaviours. The present study attempts to further advance this approach by providing a conceptual framework within which future research can be conducted. It also suggests the utilization of newly developed statistical techniques congenial to studying changes in behaviours and preferences over time. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data are used to fill gaps in previous research and demonstrate the value of this approach. While Andreasen's data revealed a significant negative relationship between stress due to life status changes and brand preference changes when subjected to conventional analysis, the two-way transitional event history analysis of our data yielded a significant positive relationship between the two variables. The results suggest that when a consumer experiences high levels of stress, he or she is likely to engage in subsequent consumption-coping behaviours which include changes in brand preferences. 3aattitudes and opinions 3aconsumer preferences 3apsychological stress 3astatistics 0aLife status changes 0aevent history analysis 0apreference switching 0atwo-way transitions 0astress 0acoping1 aMoschis, George P.1 aMathur, Anil0 tInternational journal of consumer studies.g2007 July, v. 31, no. 4 p.428-435dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1470-64237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1470-6431.2007.00589.x 7aarticle02806naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245002300126300001600149500016500165520171600330650000802046650002102054650001202075650001202087650001602099650001102115650001702126650000902143650001202152650001202164650001002176650001002186650001302196650001802209773014502227856005102372852000902423655001202432IND4502453420221123024842.0150511e20141030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450245342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGates, Mike10aMore cheese please  ap. 237-238.  aPaper presented Proceedings of the International Plant Propagatorâs Society â 2013 held on October 30, 2013, Bellefonte, PA (United States of America)  aAt Mckay Nursery we use a polycarbonate greenhouse to root some of our more difficult-to-root softwood cuttings. We root them in square flats in a peat and perlite medium. We were having problems keeping the cuttings turgid while maximizing our mist interval. Instead of increasing the frequency of misting, which could lead to increased disease, we are using cheesecloth. In the past cheesecloth has been used mostly for shading and moisture distribution. Our use of cheesecloth distributes moisture evenly and also brings the moisture to the surface of the leaves and stem. Our use of cheese cloth differs from the use in the past because we are laying the cloth directly on the cuttings not using a structure to support the cloth above the cuttings. The cheesecloth is used to create a moisture-rich microclimate around our softwood cuttings (Fig. 1). To reduce transpiration and decrease solar exposure we drape cheesecloth, which gets moistened by the mist, over the cuttings. Because we drape our flats in cheesecloth the moisture weighs down the cheesecloth and helps it form to the surface of the cutting. We leave it on until callus formation or roots start to show, depending on the plant. This allows us to extend the mist interval and allows for more air exchange in the greenhouse. We have seen an increase in rooting percentage in many plants using this method. Along with increased rooting success we are able to root softwoods in a structure while it is simultaneously growing other crop. This method is much more inexpensive then modifying or renovating our existing mist system. With this method we are able to use our entire bench space and reduce the amount of mist the plants are receiving. 3aair 3acallus formation 3acheeses 3acutting 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3amicroclimate 3apeat 3aperlite 3arooting 3aroots 3ashade 3asoftwood 3atranspiration0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 Oct. 30, , no. 1055 p.237-238dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1055/1055_52.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle01619naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009000128300001500218520068700233650002500920650001900945650001600964650001200980650001300992650002201005650001201027651001801039700001901057773016501076856006701241852000901308655001201317IND4507220720221123024752.0150706e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450722072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPearcy, Jason13aTheTangled Web of Agricultural Insurance: Evaluating the Impacts of Government Policy  ap. 80-111.  aThis paper examines how changes in major elements of the U.S. federal crop insurance program affect the structure of the agricultural insurance industry. We model interactions between farmers, insurance agents and insurance companies. Marginal changes in government policy (premium subsidy rate, A&O subsidy rate, and loading factor) affect the insurance premium rate, agent compensation rates, agent effort levels, and market demand for crop insurance. Farmers prefer a marginal increase in the premium subsidy rate, but the insurance companiesâ most preferred policy is a marginal increase in the A&O subsidy rate. We also evaluate the consequences of changes in crop prices. 3abusiness enterprises 3acrop insurance 3acrop prices 3afarmers 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3aUnited States1 aPowell, Vince,0 tJournal of agricultural and resource economics.g2015 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.80-111dWestern Agricultural Economics AssociationwJournal:jnl48977x1068-55027nnas40uhttp://www.waeaonline.org/publications/jare/search-past-issues  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008000127300001400207520098500221650003101206650001801237650001101255650002201266650002301288650001401311650002901325650002201354650002201376650001201398650001301410650001401423651001801437773016401455856006701619852000901686655001201695IND4507220520221123024949.0150706e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450722052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, Chris10aWelfare Estimates of Avoided Ocean Acidification in the U.S. Mollusk Market  ap. 50-62.  aOcean acidification has the potential to adversely affect a number of valuable marine ecosystem services by making it more difficult, and eventually impossible, for many marine organisms to form shells and skeletons. Reef-forming corals, commercially valuable shellfish, and primary producers that form the base of the marine food web are among the affected organisms. Despite the range and magnitude of likely impacts, very few economic analyses of ocean acidificationâs consequences have been conducted. This paper adds to the emerging body of literature by taking a distance function approach to estimating the benefits of avoided ocean acidification in the U.S. mollusk market. A nonlinear inverse almost ideal demand system estimates the utility parameters needed to calculate the exact consumer welfare measures compensating and equivalent surplus for two hypothetical policies that would reduce global greenhouse gas emissions relative to a business-as-usual scenario. 3aAlmost Ideal Demand System 3aacidification 3acorals 3aeconomic analysis 3aecosystem services 3afood webs 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3amarine ecosystems 3amarkets 3amolluscs 3ashellfish 3aUnited States0 tJournal of agricultural and resource economics.g2015 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.50-62dWestern Agricultural Economics AssociationwJournal:jnl48977x1068-55027nnas40uhttp://www.waeaonline.org/publications/jare/search-past-issues  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002100143245006300164300001600227500001500243520148100258650001201739650001201751650000901763650001301772650000901785650001601794650002801810650001901838650001601857650000901873650000901882650001401891650001201905650002501917650001801942650001401960650001901974653001301993700002402006773017002030856004602200852000902246655001202255IND4500553420221123024729.0150420e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450055342DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.246.5.5372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarneau, Mark S.10aMultiple magnetic gastrointestinal foreign bodies in a dog  ap. 537-539.  a2019-12-04  aCase Description-A 3-year-old castrated male Yorkshire Terrier was referred because of a 3-day history of vomiting, hyporexia, and lethargy after suspected ingestion of magnetic desk toys. Multiple metallic gastric foreign bodies were visible on radiographic views obtained 24 hours previously by the referring veterinarian. Clinical Findings-On physical examination of the dog, findings included moderate dyspnea, signs of pain in the cranial portion of the abdomen, hypothermia, and tachycardia. Repeated radiography revealed moderate pleural effusion and the presence of several round metallic foreign bodies in a linear ring formation in the distal aspect of the esophagus and gastric cardia. Treatment and Outcome-Endoscopy was performed, at which time the dog became increasingly dyspneic, tachycardic, and hypotensive. Thoracocentesis was performed, and a large volume of septic exudate was removed from the left hemithorax. Exploratory surgery of the thoracic and abdominal cavities was performed, during which the magnetic foreign bodies were removed and esophageal and gastric perforations were debrided and closed. The dog died following acute cardiac arrest 48 hours after surgery. Clinical Relevance-Ingestion of multiple magnetic foreign bodies carries a high risk of gastrointestinal tract perforation, volvulus, and obstruction. Immediate surgical intervention is recommended in such cases and would have likely improved the outcome for the dog of this report. 3aabdomen 3adyspnea 3arisk 3avomiting 3apain 3aradiography 3agastrointestinal system 3acardiac arrest 3ahypothermia 3atoys 3adogs 3aesophagus 3asurgery 3aclinical examination 3aveterinarians 3aingestion 3aforeign bodies 0avolvulus1 aMcCarthy, Robert J.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2015 Mar. 1, v. 246, no. 5 p.537-539dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1913x0003-14887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.246.5.537  aDNAL 7aarticle01592naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009800127300001400225520068600239650001300925650002200938650001600960650001100976650002100987700001801008700002001026700001601046773016401062856006701226852000901293655001201302IND4507220420221123024735.0150706e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450722042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovacs, Kent10aOn-Farm Reservoir Adoption in the Presence of Spatially Explicit Groundwater Use and Recharge  ap. 23-49.  aGroundwater management is conducted in spatial aquifers where well pumping results in localized cones of depression. This is in contrast to the single-cell aquifer used in most economic analyses that assumes groundwater depletion occurs uniformly over a study area. We address two aspects of the optimal management of groundwater: a spatially explicit representation of the aquifer and the potential of on-farm reservoirs to recharge the underlying aquifer. A spatial-dynamic model of the optimal control of groundwater use and on-farm reservoir adoption is developed. Results suggest that a single-cell aquifer overestimates groundwater use and farm net returns over thirty years. 3aaquifers 3aeconomic analysis 3agroundwater 3amodels 3awater management1 aPopp, Michael1 aBrye, Kristofor1 aWest, Grant0 tJournal of agricultural and resource economics.g2015 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.23-49dWestern Agricultural Economics AssociationwJournal:jnl48977x1068-55027nnas40uhttp://www.waeaonline.org/publications/jare/search-past-issues  aDNAL 7aarticle01529naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005700126300001800183500001500201520061100216650001600827650001100843650000900854650002700863653001900890653000900909653001700918653002800935653001400963700002100977700001900998700001501017773008001032852000901112939003301121946001301154655001201167IND9102191520221120184446.0910515e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910219152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRawls, W.J.10aDevelopment of a crust factor for a green ampt model  ap. 1224-1228.  a2019-12-04  aThe formation of a soil crust has been shown to cause a major decrease in infiltration and needs to be accounted for in infiltration models.

The coefficients of the four most commonly used equations, modified Henderson, Chung-Pfost, Halsey, and Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (G.A.B.) equations, were then determined and used to predict equilibrium moisture contents. For equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) in the range of 11 to 75%, there was little difference in the ability of the modified Henderson, Chung-Pfost and Halsey equations to describe the equilibrium moisture contents. At ERH greater than 75%, however, only the G.A.B. equation described the data with accuracy. The equilibrium moisture content at ERH up to 96% decreased as the temperature increased. Cultivar and method for determination of equilibrium moisture content had no significant effect on the sorption characteristics of flax seed. 3awater content 3aflax 3aseeds 3atemperature 3amathematics and statistics 0aequilibrium 0aequilibrium relative humidity1 aJayas, D.S.1 aWhite, N.D.G.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1990 , v. 33, no. 4 p.1313-1318x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01433naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245004300126300001800169520075100187650001700938650002200955650001900977700001800996700001801014773008001032852000901112939003301121946001301154655001201167IND9102193620221120180244.0910515e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910219362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngel, B.A.10aIntegrating multiple knowledge sources  ap. 1371-1376.  aA knowledge engineering tool, MKSMART (Multiple Knowledge Source Management And Reasoning Tool), was developed for building applications that use a blackboard architecture.

The advantages over traditional modeling techniques include use of the optimal knowledge representation and reasoning paradigm, integration of diverse types of knowledge, and modular program structure. 3asoil erosion 3asimulation models 3aexpert systems1 aBeasley, D.B.1 aBarrett, J.R.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1990 , v. 33, no. 4 p.1371-1376x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01574naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009600125300001800221520068800239650001300927653002400940653003000964653002000994653002301014653003201037700001901069700001901088700001801107773008001125852000901205939003301214946001301247655001201260IND9102190020221120164825.0910515e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910219002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsch, J.H.10aTractive performance comparisons between a rubber belt track and a four-wheel-drive tractor  ap. 1109-1115.  aField tests were conducted to evaluate and compare the tractive performance of a rubber belt track tractor and a four-wheel drive tractor.

Crop simulation can support INGER by increasing the efficiency of its germplasm evaluation program in multilocation trials. Reference levels of potential production of rice maturity groups can be established for different weather patterns. This permits a fast and cheap first approximation of the production of new varieties at new locations. Yields from 59 field trials were compared with such levels; half of them yielded below 65% of the simulated potential production.

Dillon.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-04  aThe spillover effects of agricultural research are ofinterest because research-induced supply shifts in non-target regions can reduce the benefits forproducers in the target regions. The introduction of semi-dwarfing genes in wheat into Australia provides anexample of spillover from the CIMMYT program. Australia's wheat-growing environments were notthose for which the CIMMYT material was specifically targeted. However, some of these lineswere introduced into Australia and used in breeding programs to produce important supply shiftsin Australia. An examination is made of the effects that the spillover had in Australia. Using an index of varietal improvement, with its attendant qualifications, an estimate of the extent of that shift resulting from the CIMMYT-based varietieswas obtained. While the extent varied widely between states, the shift was found to be between0.2 and 7.7%, with an overall average for Australia of 3.5% by 1983. On the basis of anassumption of perfectly elastic export demand for Australian wheat, the estimated total cost savings to Australian producers were US$747 million (in 1983-84 dollars) for the period 1974 to 1983, or anaverage of US$75 million per year. The annual contribution of Australia to CIMMYT has averagedapproximately US$340,000 in recent years, while the average annual expenditure on wheatbreeding in Australia has been US$4 to 5 million. On the basis of pedigrees, approximately two-thirdsof the cost savings of CIMMYT-based varieties could be attributed to CIMMYT per se, with theremaining one-third attributable to the inputs of the Australian wheat breeders. 3aestimation 3amathematical models 3aagricultural research 3acost analysis 3awheat 3amarket prices 3acrop yield 3adryland farming 3adwarf cultivars 3aAustralia 0acrop production 0aexternalities 0acimmyt 0aindex of varietal improvement 0aliterature reviews 0aindexes1 aAustralia.0 tAgricultural economics.g1989 Dec., v. 3, no. 4 p.323-332x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02063naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013800125300001600263520113200279650002401411650001101435650002501446650002301471650001001494650001101504650002701515650001401542653003001556700001701586773008101603852000901684939003301693946001101726655001201737IND9102143920221120133932.0910510s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910214392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, T.10aDepression of prothoracic gland activity of Heliothis virescens by venom and calyx fluids from the parasitoid, Cardiochiles nigriceps  ap. 139-144.  aThe braconid wasp, Cardiochiles nigriceps, successfully parasitizes the host larva, Heliothis virescens, by inhibiting host pupation. The parasitoid suppresses the function of the prothoracic gland and its competence to respond toprothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) after larval-pupal commitment caused by a small surge of ecdysteroid. Prothoracic gland from both unparasitized normal and parasitized larvae before the smallsurge responded to PTTH in vitro by releasing ecdysteroid, whereas after this surge only theprothoracic gland of the unparasitized larvae released the ecdysteroid in the presence of PTTH. Bothcalyx and venom fluid of female wasps, which are injected into the host with the eggsat the time of oviposition, were required to depress prothoracic gland function. Prothoracicglands pre-incubated in vitro for 6 h with both calyx and venom fluids resulted in inhibiting therelease of ecdysteroid by pupally committed prothoracic gland. The results suggest that the calyxand venom fluids are directly able to depress the function of the prothoracic gland and thecompetence of prothoracic gland to respond to PTTH. 3aHeliothis virescens 3alarvae 3ametabolic inhibitors 3aprothoracic glands 3apupae 3avenoms 3aCardiochiles nigriceps 3aparasites 0aparasites of insect pests1 aVinson, S.B.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1991, v. 37, no. 2 p.139-144x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03694naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010800127300001600235500011500251500002300366500001500389520218800404650002402592650002602616650001302642650002002655650002002675650002102695653001702716653003502733653002602768653002302794653002402817653002202841653002302863653002502886653002002911653001202931653004002943653002002983653003403003700001503037700001603052773007903068852000903147939003303156946001103189655001203200IND9102144720221120134133.0910510e198912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910214472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPardey, P.G.10aStructure of public support for national agricultural research systems: a political economy perspective  ap. 261-278.  aIn the series analytic: International agricultural research systems / edited by J.R.

Dillon.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-04  aThis paper initiates development of a set of stylized facts concerning the structure of public support for national agricultural research systems (NARS) withina neoclassical political economy framework. The aim is to place public funding of NARS in thebroader context of the overall level of direct government assistance to agriculture. Using anewly constructed data set on NARS expenditures over the 1970-85 period, we observe a growingdisparity in agricultural research intensity ratios, which measure the level of public support forNARS in relation to agricultural gross domestic production (AgGDP) between low and high-incomecountries. This growing disparity appears to be driven by much larger increases in support foragricultural research by high-income countries, coupled with a significantly slower growth in the sizeof their agricultural sector, despite the propensity of low and middle-income countries toincrease real support to agricultural research. As per-capita incomes rise the public agricultural expenditureratio, which measures public expenditures on agriculture relative to the size of theagricultural sector, AgGDP, increases substantially. Public expenditures on agriculture were indexed on agriculturaland non-agricultural populations to give a rough indication of the increasingincentives for rural 'distributional coalitions' to seek a redistribution of public expenditures in their favor. A relative research expenditure (RRE) ratio is developed, whichmeasures the proportion of total public expenditure on agriculture spent on agriculturalresearch. It provides an indication of the relative importance given to research on agriculture withinthe constraints imposed by overall public spending on agriculture. In contrast to the agriculturalresearch intensity ratios, the RRE ratios suggest that agricultural research appears to command aslarge a share of the public purse devoted to agriculture in low and middle-income countries as itdoes in high-income countries. Expectations derived from the neoclassical political economyliterature that research may have fared relatively better in high compared with low-incomecountries were not supported by the data. 3aresource allocation 3aagricultural research 3apolitics 3aeconomic theory 3aeconomic policy 3aresearch support 0aintervention 0aneoclassical political economy 0ahigh income countries 0aliterature reviews 0anational accounting 0apublic investment 0apublic expenditure 0alow income countries 0anational income 0asystems 0aagricultural gross domestic product 0aunderinvestment 0agovernment and administration1 aKang, M.S.1 aElliott, H.0 tAgricultural economics.g1989 Dec., v. 3, no. 4 p.261-278x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01809naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245014800128300001600276520069200292650002300984650001501007650001101022650002401033650001801057650002001075650001901095650002301114651001301137651001301150653001001163653003501173653002001208653002001228653001701248653001401265773007901279852000901358939003301367946001101400655001201411IND9102164220221120134019.0910514e199006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910216422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoodwin, B.K.10aEmpirically testing the law of one price in an international commodity market: a rational expectations application to the natural rubber market  ap. 165-177.  aThe Law of One Price (LOP) is an important ingredient in theories of international trade and exchange rate determination. An important shortcoming of the existing empirical literature is that parity is typically assumed to hold contemporaneously. This overlooks the fact that international commodity arbitrage takes place over time as well as across spatially separated markets. Recognizing this fact, we expect to see parity holding for expected prices. A model which incorporates the expectations of commodity arbitragers is constructed and used to test the LOP in the natural rubber market. Results indicate that the inclusion of expectations may be of value when considering the LOP. 3acommodity exchange 3aestimation 3arubber 3ainternational trade 3amarket prices 3aeconomic theory 3asupply balance 3aeconometric models 3aNew York 3aMalaysia 0aarima 0asimultaneous equation analysis 0atransport costs 0amonetary parity 0akuala lumpur 0aarbitrage0 tAgricultural economics.g1990 June, v. 4, no. 2 p.165-177x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01923naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006100127300001600188500001500204520064300219650002200862650000900884650002200893650001900915650003100934650001000965650001900975650001800994650002201012650000901034650001601043650002201059650001401081650003401095651001001129653002201139653002601161653001701187653001601204653001801220653002101238653001701259700002101276773007901297852000901376939003301385946001101418655001201429IND9102164320221120134008.0910514e199006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910216432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChetty, V.K.10aWelfare effects of selected food-grain policies in India  ap. 179-192.  a2019-12-04  aGovernment's policy interventions in the market for food-grains affect supply as well as demand. In this paper, the welfare effects of certain food-grain policies are analysed while taking into account the interdependence of the various sectors in the economy. Adequate structure is built into the model in order to study the effects of a dual price structure on farmers' supply response, and also the effects of public distribution schemes on the aggregate demand for food-grains. Policy implications are derived by computing the market clearing prices and their movement under alternative assumptions regarding the nature of the market. 3awelfare economics 3arice 3asimulation models 3afood marketing 3afood distribution programs 3awheat 3asupply balance 3amarket prices 3afood availability 3arain 3afood grains 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3asurpluses 3agovernment and administration 3aIndia 0asectoral analysis 0arural urban relations 0aintervention 0afood supply 0abuffer stocks 0amarketing policy 0aprice policy1 aSrinivasan, P.V.0 tAgricultural economics.g1990 June, v. 4, no. 2 p.179-192x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01943naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010000126300001600226500024000242520068500482650001601167650002501183650002601208650001501234650002001249650001101269650001801280650002601298653001801324653001001342653001501352653002301367653001901390700001601409773007901425852000901504939003301513946001101546655001201557IND9102145520221120133937.0910510e198912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910214552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLynam, J.K.10aSense and sustainability: sustainability as an objective in international agricultural research  ap. 381-398.  aIn the series analytic: International agricultural research systems / edited by J.R.

Several factors that may help explain the abnormalities associated with FAS include decreased maternal liver function, and maternal nutritional deficits that affect fetal development, such as the folic acid necessary for normal cell proliferation. Increased maternal consumption of alcohol seems to be related to severity of the abnormalities of FAS. Prevention of FAS is dependent on educating people about the potential dangers of alcohol use during pregnancy and even before conception.

Imparting knowledge is not sufficient to alter eating habits; a changed attitude is also needed. Much of what consumers know about nutrition comes from food advertising and labeling designed to promote products. Ads and labels are often the source of misinformation. The present day food supply includes manufactured foods which are well-liked but of poor nutritional quality. The public should therefore be taught to avoid eating the wrong foods; rather than emphasizing the right foods, nutrition education efforts should focus on what not to eat. Attractiveness of a diet plays a significant role in food choice, determining how much, as well as what, is eaten; obesity is common because of the range of very attractive foods that are available. The content of nutrition education must be changed to persuade people to eat less of these attractive foods, rather than placing so much attention on meeting RDAs.

Gene MlZec1 from the Triticum dicoccoides-derived wheat line Zecoi-1  ap. 161-167.  a2019-12-04  aThe Triticum dicoccoides-derived wheat line Zecoi-1 provides effective protection against powdery mildew. F₃ segregation analysis of Chinese Spring × Zecoi-1 hybrids showed that resistance in line Zecoi-1 is controlled by a single dominant gene. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of bulked segregants from F₃s showing the homozygous resistant and susceptible phenotypes identified eight markers, of which four were associated with the resistance allele in repulsion phase. Following the assignment of these four repulsion phase AFLP markers to wheat chromosome 2B with the aid of Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines, they were physically mapped in the terminal breakpoint interval 0.89 (2BL-6)–1.00 (telomere) of chromosome 2BL. Genetic and physical mapping of simple sequence repeat markers from the distal half of chromosome 2BL located the wild emmer-derived powdery mildew resistance gene distal of breakpoint 0.89 in deletion line 2BL-6. Based on disease response patterns, genomic origin and chromosomal location the resistance gene in Zecoi-1 is temporarily designated MlZec1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. dicoccoides 3aplant breeding 3ahybrids 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3awheat 3apowdery mildew 3aBlumeria graminis f. sp. tritici 3achromosome mapping 3aTriticum aestivum 3agenes 3adisease resistance 3ainterspecific hybridization 3agenetic markers 0aErysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici 0aMlZec1 gene1 aZeller, Friedrich J.1 aWenzel, Gerhard1 aHsam, Sai L.

The levels of resistance to pod borer in the cultivated chickpea germplasm are moderate, and therefore, we studied the reaction of 32 accessions of wild relatives of chickpea for resistance to H. armigera under greenhouse conditions. Accessions ICC 17257, IG 70002, IG 70003, IG 70012, (Cicer bijugum), IG 69948 (C. pinnatifidum), IG 69979 (C. cuneatum), IG 70032, IG 70033, IG 70038, and IG 72931 (C. judaicum) showed lower leaf feeding, a drastic reduction in larval weight, and poor host suitability index at the vegetative and/or flowering stages of crop growth as compared to the cultivated chickpeas. Based on percentage pods damaged by 5th day (< 52% pods damaged compared to 90% pods damaged in Annigeri), and percentage weight gain by the larvae (< 35% weight gain compared to 366% weight gain on ICCV 2); accessions IG 69979 (C. cuneatum), IG 70003, IG 70022, IG 70016, IG 70013, IG 70012, IG 70010, IG 70001, IG 70018, and IG 70002 (C. bijugum), and IG 72953 (C. reticulatum) showed high levels of resistance to H. armigera. Larvae of H. armigera weighed < 50 mg when reared on C. pinnatifidum (IG6 9948 and IG 70039), and C. judaicum (IG 72931) compared to 301.95 mg on C. arietinum (ICCC 37 – the cultivated chickpea). Larval weights on many accessions of the wild relatives of chickpea were much lower than those on the cultivated chickpeas, indicating the existence of different mechanisms of resistance to H. armigera. There was no pupation and adult emergence when the larvae were reared on accessions of C. pinnatifidum (IG 69948 and IG 70039), and C. judaicum (IG 69980, IG 70032, IG 70033 and IG 72931). The wild relatives of chickpea showing high levels of antibiosis to H. armigera can be used to introgress diverse resistance genes into cultivated chickpea to increase the levels and diversify the basis of resistance to this insect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer 3awild relatives 3aantibiosis 3apest resistance 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3ainsect pests 3aplant genetic resources 3aplant breeding 3avegetative growth 3aflowering 3acrop damage 0aCicer bijugum 0aCicer pinnatifidum 0aCicer cuneatum 0aCicer judiacum1 aPampapathy, G.1 aLanka, S.

Four alternative price levels of surface water are analyzed with the base level being 1975 surface water prices. The model minimizes costs of endogenous agricultural production relative to projected 1985 commodity demand and resource levels. Results indicate that national surface water demand is relatively price inelastic. 3aagriculture 3aproduction economics 3asurface water 3aprices 3airrigation 3amodels 3aUnited States 0asimulation 0ausage1 aChristensen, D.A.1 aHeady, E.O.0 tWestern journal of agricultural economics.g1981 July, v. 6, no. 1 p.113-127x2327-82777nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19811022c00000000  aAGE  aOther US 7aarticle02210naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009600125300001600221520117000237650001901407650002001426650002101446650002001467650001801487650001201505650001901517650002301536650000901559650001801568650002301586650002001609653001301629653001201642700001601654700001801670773006901688852000901757939003301766946001301799655001201812IND9102197920221120063800.0910515e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910219792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElls, J.E.10aToxic effects of manure, alfalfa, and ammonia on emergence and growth of cucumber seedlings  ap. 380-383.  aChopped alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), alfalfa hay extract, and ammonium hydroxide produced free ammonia in media and inhibited both germination and seedling growth of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.). Toxic levels of ammonia were not produced by the quantities of manure added to the media. Alfalfa extract enhanced cucumber seedling growth in sand medium while inhibiting growth in media. This difference is attributed to a reduced level of microbial activity in the sand. With higher levels of microbial activity, rapid decomposition of the extract may have resulted in a burst of ammonia evolution that proved damaging to cucumbers. The natural buffering capacity of the soil medium apparently mitigated the effects of the ammonia. Ammonium hydroxide, which did not depend on microbiological activity to release ammonia, proved lethal to cucumbers grown in sand. A diminished effect on growth was observed as the cation exchange capacity of the medium increased. Because high levels of alfalfa hay and ammonium hydroxide were required to produce toxic levels of ammonia in soil, it is unlikely that cucumbers would be harmed under normal field usage of alfalfa hay. 3aanimal manures 3aCucumis sativus 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aphytotoxicity 3aalfalfa 3aplant residues 3aammonium hydroxide 3asoil 3agrowing media 3abuffering capacity 3acation exchange 0acapacity 0aeffects1 aMcSay, A.E.1 aWorkman, S.M.0 tHortScience.g1991 Apr., v. 26, no. 4 p.380-383x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02719naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005800126300001600184500001500200520171200215650002501927650001701952650002601969650002301995650002502018650001302043650001902056650001502075653001202090653001802102653001302120653001102133700001702144700001702161700001902178773006902197852000902266939003302275946001302308655001202321IND9102197620221120063846.0910515e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910219762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, B.P.10aFlooding reduces gas exchange and growth in snap bean  ap. 372-373.  a2019-12-04  aThis study was conducted to determine the effect of various flooding durations on the growth, water relations, and photosynthesis of the snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Greenhouse-grown plants of cv. Blue Lake 274 were flooded for 0 (control), 1, 3, 5, or 7 days. Leaf water potential, stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E), and net photosynthesis (Pn) were measured at the completion of the flooding period and after recovery for 7 days. Root, stem, and leaf dry weights were recorded after plants were allowed to recover from the flooding stress for 7 days. The values for leaf water potential, gs, E, and Pn decreased quadratically with the increase in the duration of flooding. The Pn of plants flooded for 1 day was 17% lower than that of the control and it reached near zero in plants flooded for 7 days. The decrease in Pn after 1 day of flooding was not associated with leaf water potential or gs; however, for longer duration of flooding, Pn decline coincided with the decline in gs. A week after the cessation of flooding, the level of recovery in leaf water potential, E, and Pn was linear and that in g, quadratic to the duration of prior stress experienced by the plant. However, after recovering for 7 days, none of the flooded plants regained gas exchange activities at par with the control. The relationship of stem dry weight to duration of flooding was linear, while a quadratic model provided the best fit for the regression of root and leaf dry weight on the number of days of flooding. Overall, even 1 day of flooding reduces photosynthesis in snap bean and causes a decrease in dry weight of the plant, the extent of decrease in both increasing with the duration of flooding. 3astomatal conductance 3agas exchange 3agreenhouse production 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aleaf water potential 3aduration 3aphotosynthesis 3avegetables 0aeffects 0atranspiration 0aflooding 0agrowth1 aTucker, K.A.1 aSutton, J.D.1 aBhardwaj, H.L.0 tHortScience.g1991 Apr., v. 26, no. 4 p.372-373x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01377naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245004800133300001200181520064000193650001400833651001100847653001200858653001600870653001100886653002300897700001900920773007500939852000901014939003301023945000801056946001101064655001201075991597513750742620221123034924.0811021e198104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE819181752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPidgeon, E.R.10aDemand trends in Canada's mushroom industry  ap. 1-6.  aExtract: This article analyzes the markets for fresh and processed Canadian mushrooms and makes recommendations on how the industry could expand.

Currently, a range from 100 to 300 kg nitrogen (N) ha(-1) per growing season is suggested, based on factors such as location in the state, desired maintenance level, soil conditions, etc. Research was conducted at the G.C. Horn Turfgrass Field Laboratory in Gainesville, FL from 2000 to 2002, utilizing medium to high management levels and at a sod farm in Bradenton, FL from 2001 and 2002, under low management conditions. Nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications in both locations. In Gainesville, best visual quality was generally obtained with medium (MN) or high nitrogen rates (HN). In Bradenton, MN, and HN rates provided best visual quality responses in 2002 and 2003, but higher rates of N were required than in Gainesville to maintain acceptable quality. This higher N requirement could be due to the longer growing season in Bradenton or to poor turfgrass growth resulting from inadequate pest control. In the absence of biotic or abiotic stresses, the highest rates of N were not necessary to maintain an acceptable quality lawn. 3aStenotaphrum secundatum 3aturf grasses 3alawns and turf 3afertilizer rates 3afertilizer requirements 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrogen 3asoil fertility 3apotassium 3aappearance (quality) 3agrowing season 3aplant pests 3apest control 3aFlorida 0aturf quality1 aUnruh, J.B.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2007, v. 30, no. 1-3 p.453-461dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070919b20071002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/05  aOther US 7aarticle02372naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100002500119245008800144300001600232500002400248500001500272520106400287650002201351650002801373650002101401650001801422650001801440650001201458650002601470650002801496650002301524650001501547650002601562650001601588650002101604653002401625700001501649773008901664852000901753856009301762930003301855945002501888946001301913655001201926IND4390643620221122173753.0070424s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439064362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8411 aValdez-Aguilar, L.A.10aResponse of Selected Greenhouse Ornamental Plants to Alkalinity in Irrigation Water  ap. 441-452.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTolerance to alkalinity was evaluated in rose 'Pink Cupido,' ivy geranium 'Peppermint Candy,' vinca 'Apricot Delight,' chrysanthemum 'Miramar,' hibiscus 'Bimini Breeze' and 'Mango Breeze' plants irrigated with solutions containing 0 to 10 mM sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3).

Several physiological traits related with pepper plant development (leaf mineral concentration, net photosynthesis rate, transpiration, leaf sugar, and chlorophyll concentration) and fruit yield were determined. In T-1, chlorophyll was significantly lower and sugar concentration was significantly higher than in those where mineral fertilizers had been added (T-2 and T-3). There were no significant differences in photosynthetic rate among treatments. Increasing mineral fertilizer rates increased vegetative growth at the expense of fruit yield. Leaf nutrient concentrations most affected by the treatments were the N-fractions, and changes in the other parameters measured are discussed on the basis of these differences. 3asweet peppers 3anutrient content 3amineral fertilizers 3aCapsicum annuum 3anitrogen 3afertilizer rates 3acalcium 3atranspiration 3amagnesium 3acrop yield 3avegetative growth 3apotassium 3ahorse manure 3aphotosynthesis 3asoil solarization 3achlorophyll 3asoil fumigation 3asugar content 3aphosphorus 0aplant growth1 aCastellar, I.1 aHellin, P.1 aFenoll, J.1 aNavarro, J.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2007, v. 30, no. 1-3 p.367-379dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070919b20071002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/05  aOther US 7aarticle03071naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002000161245012100181300001600302500002400318500001500342520151300357650001901870650001901889650001801908650001501926650002701941650001801968650002101986650001502007650002702022650002202049650002002071650001102091650001402102650002102116650002502137650001002162650001602172650001102188653001402199700002002213700001602233773010702249852000902356856009302365930003302458945002502491946001302516655001202529IND4390641020221122173743.0070424s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439064102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Treatments consisted of 0, 1400, 2800, and 4200 mg sodium chloride (NaCl) kg(-1) soil and three rootstocks (Sarakhs, Badami, and Qazvini cultivars). They were gradually exposed to salinity stress before and/or after root inoculation with a water suspension of 10(7) conidia/mL of a pistachio isolate of V. dahliae. Salt stress significantly increased rootstock shoot and root colonization by V. dahliae. All rootstocks were susceptible to V. dahliae, but symptoms of the disease appeared earlier in Sarakhs, a salt sensitive cultivar. Moreover, salinity and V. dahliae interaction increased the concentrations of sodium (Na), potassium (K) and chloride (Cl), but decreased the K/Na ratio in all rootstocks. Shoot and root tissues of inoculated Sarakhs and Qazvini (a salt tolerant) contained the highest and the lowest concentrations of Na, K, and Cl, respectively. In salinity treatments, shoot and root dry weight of all rootstocks decreased as compared with controls. Sarakhs showed smaller shoot and root dry weight than Qazvini and Badami. Also, increasing the NaCl level increased accumulation of Na, K, and Cl in shoot and root of the rootstocks. Sarakhs showed higher concentrations of ions in the shoot and root. Based on shoot and root dry weights and ion accumulation, Sarakhs and Qazvini were susceptible and tolerant to salinity, respectively. 3asalt tolerance 3adisease course 3aPistacia vera 3apistachios 3amicrobial colonization 3asoil salinity 3adisease severity 3arootstocks 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aVerticillium wilt 3asodium chloride 3asodium 3apotassium 3acalcareous soils 3aVerticillium dahliae 3aroots 3asalt stress 3ashoots 0achlorides1 aBanihashemi, Z.1 aMaftoun, M.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2007, v. 30, no. 1-3 p.241-252dDekkerwJournal:jnl43215x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070919b20071002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/05  aOther US 7aarticle02269naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100002500128245007400153300001500227500002400242520096100266650001601227650001301243650001101256650002601267650002001293650001501313650002601328650002301354650001101377650002101388650001901409650002301428650001901451650002001470651001401490700001701504700001701521773008801538852000901626856009301635930003301728945002501761946001301786655001201799IND4390639320221122135149.0070424s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439063932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aJ5001 aGutierrez Boem, F.H.10aSeed Number and Yield Determination in Sulfur Deficient Soybean Crops  ap. 93-104.  aIncludes references  aIn soybean, seed number and yield is largely determined by the environmental conditions between initial bloom and the beginning of seed filling. Four field experiments were conducted to determine the effects of two sources of sulfur (S) on crop growth during the critical period of seed number determination and yield. Ammonium sulfate and gypsum were applied at a rate of 15 kg S ha(-1). Seed yield was closely related to the number of seeds per m2 (R2 = 0.93), but seed number was not related to crop growth between bloom and the beginning of seed filling. There was no effect of fertilization on aboveground biomass accumulation until the seed filling period began. The results from this study suggest that a moderate S deficiency reduced seed yield by affecting crop growth during the seed filling period. This late effect of a moderate S deficiency could be a consequence of the known high sulfate mobility in soils and low S remobilization in plants. 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3asulfur 3anutrient deficiencies 3aplant nutrition 3acrop yield 3afield experimentation 3asulfur fertilizers 3agypsum 3aammonium sulfate 3afilling period 3anutritional status 3asoil fertility 3anutrient uptake 3aArgentina1 aPrystupa, P.1 aFerraris, G.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2007, v. 30, no. 1-3 p.93-104dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070919b20071002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/09/05  aOther US 7aarticle03701naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157072000900175100001600184245012500200300001800325500002400343500001500367520167400382650001802056650002502074650002002099650001402119650002402133650001902157650001602176650001102192650001602203650001202219650001402231650003202245650002402277650002002301650002802321650000902349650001202358650004602370650001602416650001902432650003202451650003002483650004402513650003202557653003202589653002102621653001902642653001602661653002402677653001102701700001402712700001602726700001702742773009602759852000902855856008002864930003302944945002502977946001303002655001203015IND4390668320221122081008.0070426e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439066832DNAL7 a173687372pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2101 aSchwalm, A.10aChanges in testicular histology and sperm quality in llamas (Lama glama), following exposure to high ambient temperature  ap. 1316-1323.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of the study was to investigate whether a moderately elevated ambient temperature (29 °C, 4 weeks, 24 h per day) has an effect on the spermatogenesis in male llamas (Lama glama) and to monitor the recrudescence of spermatogenesis. Thirteen llamas were used. Semen parameters were monitored in four of the llamas and six animals were castrated at different times after the heat treatment. An additional three llamas were used as control animals and were castrated without any treatment. Spermatogenesis was found to be severely impaired due to the high environmental temperature. Sperm concentration declined from 97.5 million to 10 million spermatozoa/ml. Sperm motility declined from 63.1% to 15.0% and the percentage of morphologically abnormal sperm cells increased from 26.3% up to 50.5%. The changes in sperm parameters corresponded to the histological analysis of the testes. We found an increase in destroyed tubules, where no stage of the spermatogenic cycle could be established from 1.8% up to 38.2%, and a reduction of the spermatogonial proliferation rate (Ki-67 histochemistry) represented by tubules with proliferating spermatogonia from 79.5% to 45.7% directly after the heat treatment. Apoptosis (TUNEL assay) showed no significant changes during the experiment. The recrudescence of spermatogenesis within 6 weeks after the heat treatment was found to be due to an increase of mitotic proliferation of spermatogonia and not due to a decrease in the apoptotic rate. Our data indicate that in llamas the thermoregulatory ability is not sufficient enough to prevent heat caused damage to the testis at longer acting ambient temperature of 29 °C. 3aspermatogonia 3aseminiferous tubules 3aspermatogenesis 3ahistology 3aambient temperature 3asperm motility 3aheat stress 3allamas 3aspermatozoa 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis 2aBody Temperature Regulation 2aCamelids, New World 2aHot Temperature 2aKi-67 Antigenxanalysis 2aMale 2aMitosis 2aSeminiferous Tubulesxanatomy & histology 2aSperm Count 2aSperm Motility 2aSpermatogenesisxphysiology 2aSpermatogoniaxphysiology 2aSpermatozoaxabnormalitiesxphysiology. 2aTestisxanatomy & histology 0aspermatogenic recrudescence 0asperm parameters 0aabnormal sperm 0aheat damage 0asperm concentration 0atestes1 aGauly, M.1 aErhardt, G.1 aBergmann, M.0 tTheriogenology.g2007 May, v. 67, no. 8 p.1316-1323dButterworth-Heinemannx0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.02.0053electronic resource  a20070501b20070602c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/04/30  aOther US 7aarticle04284naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157072000900175100001500184245014000199300001800339500002400357500001500381520200900396650002302405650001102428650002102439650001502460650002002475650002102495650001802516650001902534650001202553650001402565650002702579650001202606650001402618650002702632650001102659650005002670650004202720650001102762650003902773650003502812650003202847650003002879650003402909650005302943653001802996653002203014653002203036653002203058653002203080653002903102653003703131700001403168700001403182700001603196700001303212700001403225700001203239700001403251773009603265852000903361856009703370930003303467945002503500946001303525655001203538IND4390668620221122081031.0070426e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439066862DNAL7 a174200402pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2101 aFeng, W.G.10aEffects of follicular atresia and size on the developmental competence of bovine oocytes: A study using the well-in-drop culture system  ap. 1339-1350.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of granulosa cell (GC) apoptosis and follicle size on the competence of bovine oocytes were studied using a well-in-drop (WID) oocyte/embryo culture system, which allows identification of follicular origin. Hatching rates of blastocysts did not differ (P > 0.05) between oocytes cultured in the WID system (13%) and those cultured in the conventional group system (16%). Hatching rates of blastocysts were higher (P < 0.05) in early atretic (17%) than in non-atretic (8%) and late atretic follicles (10%) of the same size (4-8 mm), and in 6-8 mm (22%) than in 4-5 mm follicles (15%) at the early atretic stage. More oocytes (P < 0.05) from late atretic (17%) than from non-atreteic (7%) or early atretic follicles (9%) of the same size (4-8 mm) were arrested at Grade 1 cumulus expansion (only cells in the peripheral two layers began to expand). Similarly, more oocytes from 2 to 3 mm follicles (30%) than from 6 to 8 mm follicles (21%) at the same (late) atretic stage had Grade 1 cumulus expansion (P < 0.05). Hatching blastocyst percentages of oocytes with Grade 3 (all layers of the cumulus except corona radiate cells expanded) or Grade 4 (full) cumulus expansion were higher in early atretic (20%) than in non-atretic (13%) or late atretic follicles (12%). Hatching blastocyst percentages of oocytes from follicles at the early atretic stage increased as cumulus expanded from Grade 2 (9%) to Grade 4 (27%). Regardless of the degree of follicle atresia, 72-76% of the floating cells in the follicular fluid (FF) were undergoing apoptosis. The floating cell density in FF was highly (r = 0.6-0.7) correlated with oocyte developmental potency. In conclusion, the WID culture system was as efficient as group culture and allowed identification of follicular origin. Furthermore, the developmental potential of oocytes was affected by GC apoptosis, follicle size and cumulus expansion, and the floating cell density in FF could be used as a simple and non-invasive marker of oocyte quality. 3afollicular atresia 3acattle 3afollicular fluid 3ablastocyst 3agranulosa cells 3acumulus oophorus 3aembryogenesis 3aembryo culture 3aoocytes 3aapoptosis 3ain vitro fertilization 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis 2aBlastocystxphysiology 2aCattle 2aCell Culture Techniquesxmethodsxveterinary. 2aEmbryo Culture Techniquesxveterinary 2aFemale 2aFertilization in Vitroxveterinary 2aFollicular Atresiaxphysiology 2aGranulosa Cellsxphysiology 2aIn Situ Nick-End Labeling 2aOocytesxgrowth & development 2aOvarian Folliclexanatomy & histologyxcytology. 0afollicle size 0aovarian follicles 0aoocyte competence 0afollicle diameter 0acumulus expansion 0ablastocyst hatching rate 0aindividual oocyte/embryo culture1 aSui, H.S.1 aHan, Z.B.1 aChang, Z.L.1 aZhou, P.1 aLiu, D.J.1 aBao, S.1 aTan, J.H.0 tTheriogenology.g2007 May, v. 67, no. 8 p.1339-1350dButterworth-Heinemannx0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.01.0173Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070502b20070602c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/05/01  aOther US 7aarticle02133naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001700157245012200174300001600296500002400312520081700336650002301153650001201176650001001188650001801198650001901216650002501235650002501260650001401285650002501299653003401324700001501358700001701373700001401390700001501404773011401419852000901533856008801542930003301630945002501663946001101688655001201699IND4390664920221122081045.0070426e20070515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439066492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aWilson, S.M.10aInteractions between Streptococcus suis serotype 2 and cells of the myeloid lineage in the palatine tonsil of the pig  ap. 116-123.  aIncludes references  aStreptococcus suis is a major pathogen in pigs and causes significant morbidity and mortality in herds world-wide. A major problem with S. suis is the presence of asymptomatic carrier animals which can spread the organism within and between herds. The palatine tonsil is one of the main sites where the organism can be recovered, both in infected and carrier animals. The use of multiple-colour immunohistology allowed identification of the cell types associated with bacteria in the tonsils of infected gnotobiotic piglets. Bacteria were never associated with T-cells or B-cells but were always associated with cells of the myeloid lineage. Expression of CD16 and CD163 on these leukocytes suggested an association with mature macrophages in tonsil, which may lead to clearance or control of the micro-organism. 3aStreptococcus suis 3atonsils 3aswine 3acarrier state 3aswine diseases 3abacterial infections 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aserotypes 3aantigen presentation 0aStreptococcus suis serotype 21 aNorton, P.1 aHaverson, K.1 aLeigh, J.1 aBailey, M.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2007 May 15, v. 117, no. 1-2 p.116-123dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.02.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20071205b20080102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/11/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02741naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002300182245012500205300001400330500002400344520127800368650001501646650001901661650001501680650001601695650001901711650001801730650002001748650001201768650000901780650003201789650003201821650004601853650002701899653001601926653002401942700001701966773011201983852000902095856008602104930003302190945002502223946001102248655001202259IND4390820720221122022743.0070504e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439082072DNAL7 a180890862pmid7 a10.1016/j.asd.2006.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL0011 aCosta-Ayub, C.L.S.10aUltrastructural aspects of spermiogenesis and synspermia in the brown spider Loxosceles intermedia (Araneae: Sicariidae)  ap. 41-51.  aIncludes references  aThis study reports ultrastructural and cytochemical aspects of spermiogenesis and synspermia in the brown spider Loxosceles intermedia. The roundish early spermatids are initially interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges, forming groups of four cells. During spermiogenesis, these cells pass through a series of modifications: (1) progressive nuclear condensation brings chromatin into a fibrillar arrangement; (2) the nucleus becomes long and asymmetric, with a short post-centriolar elongation; (3) formation of the long, cone-shaped acrosome and the F-actin acrosomal filament; (4) establishment of the implantation fossa and the 9 x 2 + 3 pattern flagellum, which extends away from the sperm cell body. Eventually, the entire cell undergoes twisting and folding resulting in a synspermium, containing four sperm cells in which the flagellum and nucleus are delimitated by the plasma membrane, as individualized structures, but remain involved by the fused remaining cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Reaching the vas deferens, the synspermia are surrounded by a basic glycoproteic secretion. Synspermia are considered a derivative character, probably developed in this Sicariidae species, as well as in other Haplogynae, as an adaptation to improve the reproductive strategy. 3aLoxosceles 3aspermiogenesis 3aspermatids 3aspermatozoa 3aultrastructure 3acytochemistry 3asperm transport 2aAnimals 2aMale 2aSpermatogenesisxphysiology 2aSpermatozoaxultrastructure 2aSpidersxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aTestisxultrastructure 0afused sperm 0asperm transfer form1 aFaraco, C.D.0 tArthropod structure & development.g2007 Mar., v. 36, no. 1 p.41-51dElsevier Science Ltd.x1467-80397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asd.2006.07.0043Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070509b20070602c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/05/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02437naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191100001900200245004900219300001600268500012300284500002400407500001500431520088600446650001401332650001601346650001401362650001001376650001601386650001101402650001901413650001301432653001701445653001801462653001401480653002301494653002501517653002401542653001501566653002001581700001601601773011401617852000901731856008601740930003301826945002501859946001101884655001201895IND4390819020221122022115.0070504e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439081902DNAL7 a180890782pmid7 a10.1016/j.asd.2006.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL400 0aL001 0aL600 0aL7001 aStavenga, D.G.10aEvolution of color and vision of butterflies  ap. 307-318.  aIn the special issue: Origin and Evolution of Arthropod Visual Systems, Part I / edited by R.R.

The corneal nipple array and the tapetum, optical structures that many but not all butterflies share with moths, suggest that moths are ancestral to butterflies, in agreement with molecular phylogeny. A basic set of ultraviolet-, blue- and green-sensitive receptors, encountered among nymphalid butterflies, forms the basis for trichromatic vision. Screening pigments surrounding the light-receiving rhabdoms can modify the spectral sensitivity of the photoreceptors so that the sensitivity peak is in the violet, yellow, red, or even deep-red, specifically in swallowtails (Papilionidae) and whites (Pieridae), thus enhancing color discriminability. The photoreceptor sensitivity spectra are presumably tuned to the wing colors of conspecific butterflies. 3aommatidia 3aLepidoptera 3aphylogeny 3acolor 3abutterflies 3avision 3aphotoreceptors 3apigments 0acolor vision 0acompound eyes 0aevolution 0aliterature reviews 0aspectral sensitivity 0atrichromatic vision 0awing color 0avisual pigments1 aArikawa, A.0 tArthropod structure & development.g2006 Dec., v. 35, no. 4 p.307-318dElsevier Science Ltd.x1467-80397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asd.2006.08.0113Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/05/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02464naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245007400164300001600238500001100254520125200265592002801517650002101545650002801566650001101594650001001605650001701615650001801632650001001650650001001660651001001670700001301680700001501693700001301708700001801721700005801739700005601797773010901853856008301962852000902045655001202054IND60748204520221116215307.0211005e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074820452DNAL7 a10.1007/s12250-020-00340-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Lėĭ,10aCurrent Status and Challenge of Pseudorabies Virus Infection in China  ap. 588-607.  aReview  aPseudorabies (PR), also called Aujeszky’s disease, is a highly infectious disease caused by pseudorabies virus (PRV). Without specific host tropism, PRV can infect a wide variety of mammals, including pig, sheep, cattle, etc., thereby causing severe clinical symptoms and acute death. PRV was firstly reported in China in 1950s, while outbreaks of emerging PRV variants have been documented in partial regions since 2011, leading to significant economic losses in swine industry. Although scientists have been devoting to the design of diagnostic approaches and the development of vaccines during the past years, PR remains a vital infectious disease widely prevalent in Chinese pig industry. Especially, its potential threat to human health has also attracted the worldwide attention. In this review, we will provide a summary of current understanding of PRV in China, mainly focusing on PRV history, the existing diagnosis methods, PRV prevalence in pig population and other susceptible mammals, molecular characteristics, and the available vaccines against its infection. Additionally, promising agents including traditional Chinese herbal medicines and novel inhibitors that may be employed to treat this viral infection, are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAujeszky disease 3aSuid alphaherpesvirus 1 3acattle 3adeath 3ahuman health 3apork industry 3asheep 3aswine 3aChina1 aYao, Jun1 aYang, Yadi1 aLuo, Wei1 aYuan, Xiaomin1 aYang, Lingchen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3338-88411 aWang, Aibing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0470-82200 tVirologica Sinica.g2021 Aug., v. 36, no. 4 p.588-607dSpringer SingaporewJournal:1429x1674-07697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12250-020-00340-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01482naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024003600130040001800166100001600184245008200200300001600282520038000298592002800678650002100706650001200727650001400739650001300753650002200766650002300788650001000811650000900821650001400830650002400844700001600868700001700884773011600901856008201017852000901099655001201108IND60624494820221119065954.0181203e19821001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062449482DNAL7 a10.1258/0023677827809358872doi4 a0023-6772(19821001)16:4L.348;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFile, T.

Recent evidence suggests that microbial necromass is a significant source of SOC, yet a global quantitative assessment across the whole soil profile is lacking. We aimed to assess the vertical distribution and control of microbial‐derived SOC in forest soils. LOCATION: Global forests. TIME PERIOD: 1996–2019. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Soil microbial necromass carbon. METHODS: We evaluated the proportions of fungal and bacterial necromass C in total SOC in the litter layer, O horizon soil, and various depths of mineral soil in forests using microbial biomarker (glucosamine and muramic acid) data. RESULTS: The total microbial necromass C increased significantly with soil depth, ranging from 30% of SOC in O horizon soil to 62% of SOC in mineral soils below 50 cm. However, only bacterial necromass C followed this increasing trend with soil depth; fungal necromass C showed little variation across the whole soil profile. Higher fungal and bacterial necromass C was observed in soils with lower C/N ratios and smaller aggregate sizes. Soil C/N ratio and microbial biomass C dominantly determined microbial necromass C in surface soil (above 20 cm), but soil clay content was the primary factor in subsoil (below 20 cm). MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Microbial necromass C accounted for high percentages of the total SOC in forest soils (particularly at depths >20 cm), but its long‐term stabilization may be governed by different mechanisms at different soil horizons. Substrate quality regulates microbial activity and then controls biomass turnover in surface soil, while aggregate occlusion facilitates mineral protection of microbial necromass C in subsoil. These differential controls of microbial‐derived organic C could be applied in Earth system studies for predicting soil organic C dynamics in forests.  aPublisher supplied data  a31800521cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31670526cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31800373cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31922052cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aEarth system science 3abiomarkers 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aclay fraction 3aforest litter 3aforest soils 3aforests 3afungi 3aglucosamine 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amineral soils 3amuramic acid 3anecromass 3aorganic horizons 3aprediction 3asoil depth 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil profiles 3aspatial distribution 3asubsoil1 aLiao, Shu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8584-29731 aTan, Siyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6956-32211 aPeng, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7314-20161 aWang, Dingyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0966-88381 aYue, Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7709-85231 aWu, Fuzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0411-59081 aYang Yusheng,0 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2020 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.1829-1839dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3920180x1466-822X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.131593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012900159300001800288520110600306592002801412650003401440650002501474650001301499650001001512650002001522650001901542650002801561650002801589650001101617650003101628650002301659650001501682650001701697700002401714700001901738773021501757856007401972852000902046655001202055IND60479056420221122073627.0160117e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047905642DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.129332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Je‐Wook10aDielectric barrier discharge plasma for microbial decontamination of dried laver: effects on physicochemical characteristics  ap. 2630-2638.  aDielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma in atmospheric pressure air was used for microbial decontamination of thin sheets of dried laver, which are commonly used in kimbab preparation. Microbial contaminants namely aerobic bacteria, moulds and marine bacteria were found in sun‐dried laver sheets. DBD plasma was generated at an output voltage of 30 kV AC and a frequency of 30 kHz. Upon the plasma treatment of laver, 2.5‐log (99.68%), nearly 1.5‐log (96.84%) and above 1.0‐log (90%) unit reductions in viable counts of aerobic bacteria, marine bacteria and moulds were observed over a 10‐min period, respectively. The inactivation pattern fitted well to Singh–Heldman model or pseudo first‐order kinetics. Compared to control laver, no significant (P > 0.05) changes in the colour characteristics, total phenolic content and 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity were observed in plasma‐treated laver. Furthermore, DBD plasma‐treated laver sheets had exerted no negative impact on the sensory characteristics of kimbab and can extend the shelf life.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aatmospheric pressure 3abacteria 3acolor 3adecontamination 3aedible seaweed 3afree radical scavengers 3amicrobial contamination 3amodels 3aphysicochemical properties 3asensory properties 3ashelf life 3asolar drying1 aPuligundla, Pradeep1 aMok, Chulkyoon0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2015 Dec., v. 50, no. 12 p.2630-2638dPublished for the Institute of Food Science and Technology (U.K.) by Blackwell Scientific Publicationsx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.129333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245015400171300001600325520088600341592002801227650002701255650000901282650000901291650001001300650001901310650001101329650001501340650000701355650001601362650002701378650001401405653000801419653001401427653001501441653001001456653000901466653001601475653001101491653001901502653001201521700002601533700002601559700002201585700001701607700002301624700001901647700002301666773010001689856008701789852000901876655001201885IND60524566620221123033510.0190402e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052456662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.06.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Darra, Nada10aEffect of pulsed electric field treatment during cold maceration and alcoholic fermentation on major red wine qualitative and quantitative parameters  ap. 352-360.  aThis work studies the effect of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment at moderate and high field strengths (E=0.8kV/cm & 5kV/cm) prior and during alcoholic fermentation (AF) of red grapes on improving different parameters of pre-treated extracts: pH, °Brix, colour intensity (CI), total polyphenols content (TPI) of Cabernet Sauvignon red wine. Similar trends were observed for treating grapes using moderate and high electric field strength on the enhancement of CI and TPI of the wine after AF. The application of PEF using moderate strengths at different times during cold maceration (CM) (0, 2 and 4days) was more efficient for treatment during CM. The treatment during AF showed lower extraction rate compared to treating during CM and prior to AF. Our results clearly show that the best time for applying the PEF-treatment through the red fermentation is during the CM step.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcoholic fermentation 3abrix 3acold 3acolor 3aelectric field 3agrapes 3amaceration 3apH 3apolyphenols 3apulsed electric fields 3ared wines 0aPEF 0aIntensity 0aExtraction 0aGrape 0aWine 0aPolyphenols 0aColour 0aCopigmentation 0aTannins1 aRājiḥah, Hibah N.,1 aDucasse, Marie-Agnès1 aTurk, Mohammad F.1 aGrimi, Nabil1 aMaroun, Richard G.1 aLouka, Nicolas1 aVorobiev, Eugène,0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 213 p.352-360dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.06.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245011100160300001600271520152400287592002801811650002501839650001701864650001401881650001301895650001201908650002001920650001401940650001001954651001201964700001901976700001901995700002102014773013002035856007702165852000902242655001202251IND60765314620221118162702.0220419e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076531462DNAL7 a10.17221/57/2021-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÁbri, Tamás10aStand structure and growth of Robinia pseudoacacia ‘Jászkiséri’ – ‘Jászkiséri’ black locust  ap. 489-497.  aBlack locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) is one of the most widespread tree species introduced into Europe and also into Hungary. It covers 24% of the total Hungarian forest area, providing 25% of the annual timber output of the country. Due to the demands of consumers, new cultivars are to be produced by means of improvement techniques and are to be introduced into the practical forestry use. Mono- and multiclonal cultivars were developed, then variety comparison trials and cultivation tests were established. Based on preliminary yield tests the locust cultivar ‘Jászkiséri’ (Robinia pseudoacacia ‘Jászkiséri’) proved to be one of the best black locust cultivars. Consequently, a more precise investigation of the stand structure of this cultivar may also make a significant contribution to the improvement of the relevant cultivation technology. In this study, based on full inventories of 13 stands in 7 subcompartments, age of 5 to 35 years, relationships of mean tree volume to diameter (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9797) and basal area (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9781), furthermore the relationship between mean tree volume and diameter of the stands (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9993) were examined. Besides that, the comparison of 15-year-old ‘Jászkiséri’ and common black locust (a case study) were presented in this paper, where ‘Jászkiséri’ proved to be better: significant differences (P < 0.05) were found in diameter, mean tree volume and stem form.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3acase studies 3acultivars 3aforestry 3aforests 3astand structure 3astem form 3atrees 3aHungary1 aKeserű, Zsolt1 aRásó, János1 aRédei, Károly,0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 67, no. 10 p.489-497dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/57/2021-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011900173300001800292500001900310520186700329592002802196596010602224650001602330650002202346650001502368650001002383650001302393650001102406650001502417650001302432650001102445650001302456650001502469650002102484650002602505700006602531700001702597700002202614700001902636700002302655700002502678773015002703856008202853852000902935655001202944IND60697671820221118040825.0200606e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069767182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-019-03294-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristofides, Andrea10aEvidence for miR-548c-5p regulation of FOXC2 transcription through a distal genomic target site in human podocytes  ap. 2441-2459.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPodocytes are highly differentiated epithelial cells outlining the glomerular vessels. FOXC2 is a transcription factor essential for inducing podocyte differentiation, development and maturation, and is considered to be the earliest podocyte marker. miRNA prediction analysis revealed a full-length target site for the primate-specific miR-548c-5p at a genomic region > 8 kb upstream of FOXC2. We hypothesised that the transcription rates of FOXC2 during podocyte differentiation might be tuned by miR-548c-5p through this target site. Experiments were performed with cultured human podocytes, transfected with luciferase reporter constructs bearing this target site region within an enhancer element of the native plasmid. The results confirmed a seed region-driven targeting potential by the miRNA, with mimics downregulating and inhibitors enhancing luciferase activity. Introducing mutations into the miRNA target seed region abolished the expected response. In cultured podocytes, FOXC2 mRNA and protein levels responded to miR-548c-5p abundance in a coordinated manner before and after induction of differentiation, with high statistical significance. Ago-ChIP experiments revealed occupancy of the miRNA target site by miRNA/RISC in undifferentiated cells and its release when differentiation is initiated, allowing its interaction with the gene’s promoter region to amplify FOXC2 expression, as shown by chromosome conformation capture and qRT-PCR. Moreover, the expression pattern of FOXC2 during podocyte differentiation seems to be affected by miR-548c-5p, as removal of either endogenous or mimic miR-548c-5p results in increased FOXC2 protein levels and cells resembling those undergoing differentiation. Collectively, results indicate a well-orchestrated regulatory model of FOXC2 expression by a remote upstream target site for miR-548c-5p.  aPublisher supplied data  aStrategic Infrastructure Project NEW INFRASTRUCTURE/STRATEGIC/ 0308/24cResearch Promotion Foundation 3achromosomes 3aenhancer elements 3aepithelium 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahumans 3aluciferase 3amicroRNA 3amodels 3aplasmids 3aprediction 3apromoter regions 3atranscription factors1 aPapagregoriou, Gregory1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2440-97891 aDweep, Harsh1 aMakrides, Neoklis1 aGretz, Norbert1 aFelekkis, Kyriacos1 aDeltas, Constantinos0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2020 June, v. 77, no. 12 p.2441-2459dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-019-03294-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03468naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005700149245009800206300001600304506011700320506007600437520157200513592002802085506003702113650002602150650001702176650002002193650001502213650002602228650001302254650002502267650001302292650000902305650002102314650002302335651001002358653001602368653001202384653001602396653001402412653001402426700001402440700001602454700001402470700001702484700002002501700005702521700001602578773023902594856008402833852000902917655001202926IND60756601920221207094126.0220726e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075660192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.iswcr.2021.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yongcui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0922-057114aThe feasibility of using soil seed bank for natural regeneration of degraded sandy grasslands  ap. 414-421.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDesertification in degraded grasslands is manifested through the development of bare sandy patches, which eventually lead to habitat fragmentation. The ability of these bare sandy patches to regenerate naturally through in-situ soil seed banks is not well understood. To fill this knowledge gap, we randomly selected 24 bare sandy patches with areas ranging from 19 to 898 m² in a desertified grassland of the Horqin sandy land, Northern China to determine whether soil seed bank can be used for natural regeneration of bare sandy patches. Species composition and density of soil seed bank as well as aboveground vegetation composition, abundance and coverage were investigated. We then determined their relationships with in-situ habitat characteristics. Our observations showed that the studied area had low soil seed bank density and species richness, as well as depauperate soil seed bank communities. Consequently, local soil seed bank was not able to provide sufficient seed source for natural regeneration. This was indicated by the relationships between aboveground vegetation, soil seed bank and the in-situ habitat characteristics. For bare patches with an area between 300 m² and 900 m², increase the soil seed bank density and species richness should be the main restoration measures. For bare patches with a small area of less than 50 m², restoration of vegetation density should be the main measure. Our data highlighted that different extents of desertification, indicated by different bare patches, are requiring distinct restoration measures.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abotanical composition 3aburied seeds 3adesertification 3agrasslands 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3anatural regeneration 3aresearch 3asoil 3aspecies richness 3awater conservation 3aChina 0aDegradation 0aIn-situ 0aRestoration 0aSeed bank 0aSemi-arid1 aZhu, Lei,1 aLiu, Zhimin1 aAla, MuSa1 aLin, Jixiang1 aQian, Jianqiang1 aZhou, Quanlai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7887-36861 aWang, Lixin0 tInternational soil and water conservation research.g2022 Sept., v. 10, no. 3 p.414-421dElsevier B.V.aInternational Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water & Power PresswJournal:23246x2095-63397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.iswcr.2021.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010900165300001600274520167200290592002801962650002801990650002802018650001502046650001402061650001102075650002802086650001402114650001702128650002502145650001802170650001002188650001502198650001202213651001002225700001402235700001202249700005702261700005302318773010902371856008302480852000902563655001202572IND60748204920221116215122.0211005e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074820492DNAL7 a10.1007/s12250-020-00319-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Junmin,10aMetagenomic Profiling of Viruses Associated with Rhipicephalus microplus Ticks in Yunnan Province, China  ap. 623-635.  aTicks are well known as vectors of many viruses which usually do great harm to human and animal health. Yunnan Province, widely covered by flourishing vegetation and mainly relying on farming husbandry, is abundant with Rhipicephalus microplus ticks. Therefore, it is of great significance to characterize the viral profile present in R. microplus parasitizing on cattle in Yunnan Province. In this study, a total of 7387 R. microplus ticks were collected from cattle and buffalo in the northwest and southeast areas of Yunnan Province from 2015 to 2017. We investigated the virome of R. microplus using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the prevalence of important identified viruses among tick groups by RT-PCR. It revealed the presence of diverse virus concerning chu-, rhabdo-, phlebo-, flavi- and parvo- viruses in Yunnan. These viruses consist of single-stranded, circular and segmented sense RNAs, showing a greatly diversity in genomic organization. Furthermore, continuous epidemiological survey among ticks reveals broad prevalence of three viruses (Yunnan mivirus 1, Wuhan tick vrius 1 and YN tick-associated phlebovirus 1) and two possible prevalent viruses including a flavivirus-like segmented virus (Jingmen tick virus) and a bovine hokovirus 2 in Yunnan. Serological investigation among cattle indicates that these identified viruses may be infectious to cattle and can elicit corresponding antibody. Our findings on R. microplus-associated viral community will contribute to the prevention of viral disease and tracking the viral evolution. Further analysis is needed to better elucidate the pathogenicity and natural circulation of these viruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3aanimal and human health 3aantibodies 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3aepidemiological studies 3aevolution 3ametagenomics 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogenicity 3aticks 3avegetation 3aviruses 3aChina1 aShen, Shu1 aWu, Hui1 aZhang, Yunzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4503-48241 aDeng, Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5385-083X0 tVirologica Sinica.g2021 Aug., v. 36, no. 4 p.623-635dSpringer SingaporewJournal:1429x1674-07697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12250-020-00319-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245007800196300001800274500002000292520173400312592002802046650002902074650001202103650001202115650002502127650000902152650002102161650002502182650001802207650001302225650002302238650002302261650001802284650001902302650002102321650001202342651001102354700005502365700002202420700001702442773013602459856007302595852000902668655001202677IND60712228320221120045252.0201009e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071222832DNAL7 a10.1111/geb.131472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoods, Taylor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6277-126010aTesting the diversity–biomass relationship in riverine fish communities  ap. 1743-1757.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: We examined the diversity–biomass relationship in stream fish communities and quantified direct and indirect effects of abiotic variables on this relationship. LOCATION: France. TIME PERIOD: 1992–2012. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Stream fishes. METHODS: We analysed the relationship between biodiversity (species richness and functional diversity) and fish community biomass at 1,357 stream sites distributed throughout France. We used piecewise path analysis to quantify effects of abiotic and biodiversity variables on biomass and assess relative contributions of native and non‐native species on the diversity–biomass relationship. RESULTS: Biodiversity showed a direct positive relationship with biomass after controlling for sampling effort, and direct effects of biodiversity variables on community biomass exceeded those of climate and physical habitat variables. Our analysis indicates that positive effects of species richness on biomass exceeded those of functional diversity. Indirect effects of abiotic variables mediated by biodiversity metrics indicated that biomass increased in warmer, lowland habitats. Human impact had no effect on native biodiversity but had a positive effect on non‐native biodiversity. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that direct effects of biodiversity on community biomass outweigh those of abiotic variables in riverine fish communities, but resource partitioning alone is unlikely to drive the effects of biodiversity on biomass in this system. Quantification of the relative roles of anthropogenic impacts, biodiversity and environmental context in the regulation of ecosystem functioning will be necessary to understand the potential consequences of ongoing global change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomass 3aclimate 3aecological footprint 3afish 3afish communities 3afunctional diversity 3aglobal change 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3apath analysis 3ariparian areas 3aspecies richness 3astreams 3aFrance1 aComte, Lise1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8030-00191 aTedesco, Pablo A.1 aGiam, Xingli0 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2020 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.1743-1757dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3920180x1466-822X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.131473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245006300169300001600232520155400248592002801802650002001830650001101850650001501861650001701876650001501893650001501908650001601923650002301939650001701962650002201979650002702001650002802028650002302056650001202079650001702091650001002108650001102118653000902129653002302138653001102161653002002172653002102192653002302213700001802236700002202254700003102276773010302307856008702410852000902497655001202506IND60112484820221116142922.0190408e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011248482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aČuš, Franc10aAnalytical determination of Dolenjska region wines quality  ap. 274-280.  aWe monitored the levels of pesticide residues (GC–MS and LC–MS–MS), copper (FAAS), biogenic amines (HPLC-DAD), volatile phenols (SBSE-GC–MS) and microbiological quality (membrane filtration) in bottled Cviček and Blaufränkisch wines in two consecutive years. In bottled Cviček wines of 2008 and 2009 vintages sampled at the producers, residues of eight and twelve pesticides were determined respectively. Consequently, the producers should make an attempt to reduce the number of pesticide residues in wines. The most frequently determined pesticides were fenhexamid, cyprodinil, metalaxyl-M, iprovalicarb, dimethomorph, fludioxonil and pyrimethanil. The concentrations of pesticide residues in samples did not exceed the proposed maximum residue limits (MRLs). The highest concentration in 2008 was determined for iprovalicarb (0.20 mg L−1) and in 2009 for fenhexamid (0.31 mg L−1). Copper levels in the Cviček wines were definitely too high and 17 samples in 2008 and seven in 2009 exceeded the MRL. The microbiological stability of the wines was poor and should be improved. However, the levels of biogenic amines in the traded Cviček and Blaufränkisch wines were low. Furthermore, we only detected 4-ethylguaiacol and 4-ethylphenol above the LOQ (limit of quantification) in three Blaufränkisch wines in concentrations of 81–152 μg L−1 and 149–435 μg L−1. These results together with Brettanomyces spp. yeast detection in two Cviček wines signify that producers should pay more attention to the both issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogenic amines 3acopper 3acyprodinil 3adimethomorph 3afenhexamid 3afiltration 3afludioxonil 3agas chromatography 3aiprovalicarb 3amass spectrometry 3amaximum residue limits 3amicrobiological quality 3apesticide residues 3aphenols 3apyrimethanil 3awines 3ayeasts 0aWine 0aPesticide residues 0aCopper 0aBiogenic amines 0aVolatile phenols 0aBrettanomyces spp.1 aBach, Benoît1 aBarnavon, Laurent1 aPongrac, Vida Žnidaršič0 tFood control.g2013 Sept., v. 33, no. 1 p.274-280dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03901naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245017800165300001600343520190000359592002802259650002102287650002602308650001302334650002902347650001202376650001502388650001802403650001002421650002602431650002402457650002302481650002002504650001002524650001902534650002102553650001202574650001502586650001902601650001302620650000902633650002002642650001102662650001702673650001402690650002302704650001102727653000902738653000802747653000802755653000802763653002702771653002802798653001802826653002602844700002002870700001602890700001802906700001602924700001402940700001702954773013802971856008503109852000903194655001203203IND60535141620221119145332.0190318e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053514162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2014.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNace, E.L.10aModulation of innate immune function and phenotype in bred dairy heifers during the periparturient period induced by feeding an immunostimulant for 60 days prior to delivery  ap. 240-250.  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a feed additive (OmniGen-AF®, reported to have immune modulating activity) on innate immunity and health events during the periparturient period in dairy heifers when immunity is suppressed. From 60 days prepartum through calving, supplemented heifers (n=20) received OmniGen-AF® daily and were compared with unsupplemented controls (n=20). Blood leukocyte innate immune activity (phenotype markers, phagocytic activity, and reactive oxygen species—ROS production) was measured prior to feeding (60 days prepartum), 30 days later, and on days 1, 7, 14, and 30 postpartum. Adverse health events (udder edema, ketosis, displaced abomasum, and death) and milk production were measured at calving and into early lactation. The fraction of leukocytes with measurable CD62L (l-selectin) on their surface from supplemented heifers tended to be greater during the periparturient period in treated heifers than controls (p=0.100). Likewise, leukocyte phagocytosis of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus during this time period tended to be greater in heifers supplemented with OmniGen-AF® (p=0.100). Conversely, ROS production in response to phorbol myristate acetate or when leukocytes were stimulated with killed S. aureus lysate tended to be greater among control heifers compared with supplemented animals (p=0.100). Supplemented heifers exhibited fewer incidents of udder edema than controls (p=0.030) and tended to exhibit a lower rate of new cases of mastitis (p=0.098); however, no differences were observed in milk somatic cell counts or level of milk production. Results demonstrate a positive role of OmniGen-AF® in amplifying leukocyte function consistent with antibacterial activity during the periparturient period, and support the continued study of dietary supplementation to enhance mammary gland health in dairy cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aacetates 3aantibacterial properties 3acalving 3adairy cows 3adairy heifers 3adeath 3adiet study techniques 3adietary supplements 3adisplaced abomasum 3aearly lactation 3aedema 3afeed additives 3aimmunostimulants 3aketosis 3aleukocytes 3amammary glands 3amastitis 3amilk 3amilk production 3aoxygen 3aphagocytosis 3aphenotype 3asomatic cell count 3audders 0aFACS 0aIMI 0aROS 0aSCC 0aInnate immune function 0aDietary supplementation 0aDairy heifers 0aPeriparturient period1 aNickerson, S.C.1 aKautz, F.M.1 aBreidling, S.1 aWochele, D.1 aEly, L.O.1 aHurley, D.J.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 161, no. 3-4 p.240-250dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2014.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245006100162300001800223500000900241520154400250592002801794650002401822650001801846650000901864650001001873650002001883650004701903651001101950651001401961651001101975651001001986651001401996773012202010856008102132852000902213655001202222IND60665526320221116224147.0191228e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066552632DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2004.03452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Yong-Bi10aGeographic Patterns of RAPD Variation in Cultivated Flax  ap. 1084-1091.  aepub  aGeographic studies of plant molecular diversity can provide insights into plant domestication and enhance plant germplasm management and utilization, but such studies are lacking in cultivated flax (Linum usitatissimum L.). The objective of this study was to assess the geographic patterns of flax variability in a world collection of cultivated flax by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Sixteen RAPD primers were applied to screen 2727 flax accessions representing 63 countries and one group of unknown origin, and 149 RAPD bands were scored for each accession. Analyses of the RAPD data revealed a wide range of occurrence frequencies of polymorphic bands from 0.0004 to 0.9978 with an average of 0.537. The majority (84.2%) of the RAPD variation resided within accessions of each country and only 15.8% of the variation was present among accessions of different countries. Grouping the accessions into 12 major regions explained 8.2% of the RAPD variation. Accessions from the East Asia and European regions were most diverse, but accessions from the regions of Indian Subcontinent and Africa were most distinct. Accessions from the West Asia region were genetically more related to those from the Africa region and less to those from the Indian Subcontinent region. These findings are significant for understanding flax domestication and also are useful in classifying intraspecific diversity of cultivated flax, establishing a core subset of the flax collection, and exploring new sources of genes for flax improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLinum usitatissimum 3adomestication 3aflax 3agenes 3aplant germplasm 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aAfrica 3aEast Asia 3aEurope 3aIndia 3aWest Asia0 tCrop science.g2005 May, v. 45, no. 3 p.1084-1091dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2004.03453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003200166245008900198300001600287520123100303592002801534650001401562650002301576650000901599650001801608650001601626650002601642650002201668650002701690650002201717650002401739650002001763650001901783650001901802650002001821650001401841650002401855650001001879650001401889650001501903650001001918650003501928650001201963650003001975650002202005650001502027650001302042651001002055653001502065653001202080653002002092653003402112653003102146653003002177700002402207700002402231700002802255773011702283856008202400852000902482655001202491IND60517278020221116210505.0190729e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051727802DNAL7 a256696182pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820150000492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aREBOREDO-FERNÁNDEZ, AURORA10aOccurrence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium in wild birds in Galicia (Northwest Spain)  ap. 917-925.  aFaecal samples were obtained from 433 wild birds being treated in wildlife recovery centres in Galicia (Northwest Spain), between February 2007 and September 2009.

Besides, as another common phenomenon in industry, corrosion of various active metals is of great importance in deciding the service life of such materials. Therefore, for the sake of solving such problems, it is imperative, but also challenging, to find suitable materials with good performance. On the other hand, the complicated fabrication procedures generally hinder practical applications of superhydrophobic and superoleophilic materials. Here, we present a simple method for preparing a three-dimensional material based on a commercially available sponge and other substrates functionalized by depositing nanoscale polypyrrole (PPy) particles, which is followed by modification of a low-surface-energy material such as fluoroalkylsilane (FAS). Such superhydrophobic samples can efficiently separate oils and organic solvents from water and are endowed with good anti-corrosion properties of several metals to a greater extent as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrosion 3adurability 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustry 3ametals 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apyrroles 3asolvents1 aGuo, Zhiguang0 tRSC advances.g2015 Dec. 21, v. 5, no. 130 p.107880-107888dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra19632a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245015500183300001800338520113400356592002801490650002601518650002101544650001801565650001501583650002301598650000901621650002001630650001601650650002701666650001201693650002301705650001001728650001801738650001801756650001501774650002201789650004301811650000901854650001301863650002901876650001201905650002901917650002501946650003501971650001602006650005802022650005002080650005102130650003802181650003702219650003702256650004002293650002602333650004502359700001702404700002102421700003002442700002002472773010602492856008202598852000902680655001202689IND4475731220221120202501.0200520e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447573122DNAL7 a216955092pmid7 a10.1007/s10646-011-0723-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuerto, María10aAcute effects of pure cylindrospermopsin on the activity and transcription of antioxidant enzymes in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) exposed by gavage  ap. 1852-1860.  aThe cyanobacterial toxin cylindrospermopsin (CYN) is a widely distributed contaminant of freshwater systems with the consequent risk for human and wildlife, particularly fish.

The activity and relative mRNA expression by real-time PCR of antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and soluble glutathione-S-transferases (sGST) and the sGST protein abundance by Western blot analysis were evaluated in liver and kidney. Also the induction of lipid peroxidation (LPO) was assayed. Results show an increase of LPO products in both organs. Moreover, CYN altered the activity, gene expression and protein abundance of the enzymes, indicating the importance of GPx and sGST in CYN pathogenicity. This is the first time that CYN is reported to affect these enzymes in fish and they have shown to be responsive biomarkers of CYN toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aWestern blotting 3aacute effects 3abiomarkers 3acylindrospermopsin 3afish 3agene expression 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3akidneys 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3apathogenicity 3apollutants 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aCichlidsxmetabolism 2aEnzymesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFresh Water 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxdrug effects 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGlutathione Transferasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aKidneyxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aLiverxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aToxicity Tests, Acute 2aUracilxanalogs & derivativesxtoxicity.1 aJos, Angeles1 aPichardo, Silvia1 aGutiérrez-Praena, Daniel1 aCameán, Ana M.0 tEcotoxicology.g2011 Nov., v. 20, no. 8 p.1852-1860dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-011-0723-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245013700159500002000296520125900316592002801575650004401603650001601647650001401663650001001677650001501687650004401702650000901746650001901755650001501774650001601789650001101805650001901816650001601835650001601851650002201867650001401889700005701903700001801960700001601978773011501994856007802109852000902187655001202196IND60749481120220217000000.0210903e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074948112DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2020002402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Wenxi10aGrafted Starch Foam Stabilizer ESt‐g‐NAA for High‐Temperature Resistant CGA Drilling Fluid via Inverse Emulsion Polymerization  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aColloidal gas aphron (CGA) drilling fluid is an environmentally friendly near‐balanced drilling technology that has been successfully applied to depleted oil/gas reservoirs. To overcome the limitations of its application in high‐temperature drilling, acrylamide (AM), 2‐acrylamido‐2‐methyl‐1‐propane sulfonic acid (AMPS), and N‐vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) are grafted onto starch via inverse emulsion polymerization, and a foam stabilizer ESt‐g‐NAA with a temperature resistance of ≥150 °C is synthesized. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H‐NMR) analysis suggest that all monomers are grafted onto starch efficiently. ESt‐g‐NAA has good solubility and thermal stability, as well as an excellent ability to stabilize foams at high temperatures. Based on microscopic observation, stable aphrons are generated successfully in the CGA drilling fluid prepared by ESt‐g‐NAA and surfactant after 150 °C aged. Results show that ESt‐g‐NAA based CGA drilling fluid aged at appointed temperatures (120–180 °C) is a high‐performance drilling fluid with shear‐thinning behavior, extremely high values of low shear rate viscosity (LSRV), and well‐building capabilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacrylamides 3aemulsions 3afoams 3amicroscopy 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3apolymerization 3asolubility 3astabilizers 3astarch 3asulfonic acids 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3aviscosity1 aZheng, Xiuhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3034-04071 aShi, Jingjing1 aWang, Yifan0 tStärke =.g2021 Sept., v. 73, no. 9-10 p.e2000240-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2020002403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014200167520106900309592002801378650001801406650001201424650001401436650001301450650001701463650002601480650000901506650001801515650001901533650001701552650002101569650001101590650000901601650000701610650001801617650001901635650001701654650001601671650001901687653003401706653002701740653001301767653001601780653002101796653001901817700002401836700001601860700002201876700001601898700001801914773009501932856008302027852000902110655001202119IND60681873220221120171206.0200517e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068187322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2020.1005262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBashiri, Sahra10aEssential oil-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers: The effects of liquid lipid type on the physicochemical properties in beverage models  aNanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) can be used in the development of new functional foods. Cinnamon essential oil (CEO)-loaded NLC were prepared using different liquid edible oils (corn, sesamol, sweet almond, and black seed oil), a solid lipid (cocoa butter) and a surfactant (Tween 80). The average size and the encapsulation efficiency of CEO-NLC were in the range of 100 ± 1 - 120 ± 10 nm and more than 82.1 ± 0.03%, respectively, while the optimum results were obtained for the almond oil-based NLC. The zeta potentials of different formulation were -14.9 ± 0.1 to -17.5 ± 0.04 mV. The physicochemical stability of CEO-NLC was evaluated during 40 days with different pH conditions (i.e., pH of milk at 6.8 and some fruit juices at 3.8) and pasteurization treatment. Both particle size and the encapsulation stability slightly changed with different pH conditions and pasteurization treatment. The almond oil-based NLC showed promising properties for increasing the protection and stability of CEO with different conditions of food beverages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus dulcis 3aalmonds 3abeverages 3acinnamon 3acocoa butter 3acooking fats and oils 3acorn 3aencapsulation 3aessential oils 3afruit juices 3afunctional foods 3alipids 3amilk 3apH 3aparticle size 3apasteurization 3apolysorbates 3asurfactants 3azeta potential 0aNanostructured lipid carriers 0aCinnamon essential oil 0aCorn oil 0aSesamol oil 0aSweet almond oil 0aBlack seed oil1 aGhanbarzadeh, Babak1 aAyaseh, Ali1 aDehghannya, Jalal1 aEhsani, Ali1 aOzyurt, Hazal0 tFood bioscience.g2020 June, v. 35 p.100526-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2020.1005263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03670naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100005400191245009400245300001600339506007600355520167000431592002802101506003702129650002102166650003202187650002302219650001802242650002602260650002702286650001502313650001402328650002102342650002202363650001002385650001102395650001502406650001402421650004302435650002002478650002402498650001302522651001002535653001902545653001702564653002002581653002402601700002202625700006102647700006102708700005902769700002802828773011802856856008502974852000903059655001203068IND60681873320221207101231.0200412e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068187332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijppaw.2020.01.0052doi7 aPMC69974902pmcid7 a320254882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Serene1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7644-923210aPrevalence of common tick-borne pathogens in white-tailed deer and coyotes in south Texas  ap. 129-135.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDetermining which wildlife hosts are involved in the enzootic cycles of tick-borne diseases (TBD) enables enhanced surveillance and risk assessment of potential transmission to humans and domestic species. Currently, there is limited data to indicate which tick-borne pathogens (TBP) can infect coyotes. Additionally, limited surveillance data for white-tailed deer (WTD) in south Texas is available. The purpose of this study was to detect current infections of common TBP in coyotes and WTD in south Texas, which represents a transboundary region and common site for animal migrations across the U.S.-Mexico border. A patent pending real-time PCR assay, the TickPath layerplex test, was used to screen whole-blood samples for species from Borrelia, Rickettsia, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, and Babesia genera. Conventional PCR and subsequent sequencing of positive samples confirmed the pathogen species. Of 122 coyote samples, 11/122 (9.0%) were positive for Babesia vogeli and 1/122 (0.8%) was positive for Borrelia turicatae. Of 245 WTD samples, 1/245 (0.4%) was positive for Anaplasma platys, 4/245 (1.6%) were positive for Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and 18/245 (7.3%) were positive for Theileria cervi. All positive samples from both species, except for one coyote, were collected from counties located in south Texas along the U.S.Mexico border. One coyote positive for B. vogeli originated from a county in northern Texas. The results from this study depicts the first known molecular detection of B. turicatae in a coyote, and demonstrates that coyotes and WTDs can potentially serve as sentinels for several zoonotic TBD as well as TBD that affect domestic animals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnaplasma platys 3aBabesia canis subsp. vogeli 3aBorrelia turicatae 3aCanis latrans 3aEhrlichia chaffeensis 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aRickettsia 3aTheileria 3adomestic animals 3aenzootic diseases 3ahosts 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk assessment 3atick-borne diseases 3awildlife 3aTexas 0aAnaplasma spp. 0aBabesia spp. 0aTheileria cervi 0aZoonotic infections1 aModarelli, Joseph1 aTomeček, John M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7494-283X1 aFrench, Justin T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0726-82241 aHilton, Clayton1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4016-14851 aEsteve-Gasent, Maria D.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2020 Apr., v. 11 p.129-135dElsevier LtdwJournal:21679x2213-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijppaw.2020.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245010600172300001800278520090500296592002801201650001501229650001001244650001601254650001301270650001101283650002101294650002001315650001601335650001001351650002001361650001301381650001301394650003101407650001901438650002201457650001901479653001801498653001601516653001601532653002501548653002501573700002001598700001401618700001501632700001501647700001601662700001901678700001701697700001801714773010101732856009001833852000901923655001201932IND60599685120221121001342.0180702e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059968512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.11.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Beike10aRose-bengal-conjugated gold nanorods for in vivo photodynamic and photothermal oral cancer therapies  ap. 1954-1966.  aGold nanorods (GNRs) conjugated with rose bengal (RB) molecules exhibit efficient singlet oxygen generation when illuminated by 532 nm green light and high photothermal efficiency under 810 nm near-infrared (NIR) irradiation.

Because of their negative influences on human health, the characteristics and potential driving forces of PAH emissions should be evaluated to establish effective mitigation strategies for different economic sectors. This study is the first to quantify the embodied and enabled PAH emissions of 108 sectors in China in 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017. The results show that the total sectoral emissions increased by 92% (from 28.0 to 53.7 kt) from 2002 to 2012 and decreased to 53.0 kt in 2017. The eight aggregated sectors had different characteristics according to their production-, consumption-, and income-based emissions. Both the embodied and enabled emission flows increased (from 13.8 to 29.2 kt and from 11.3 to 20.5 kt, respectively) with time. The influences of the major final demands and primary inputs reversed from increasing to decreasing emissions over time. In particular, the primary input structure had a stronger impact on decreasing emissions than the final demand structure. The results revealed that different mitigation policies should be applied to different sectors and that adjusting primary input behaviors might be a relatively efficient method to reduce PAH emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental science 3ahuman health 3atechnology 3aChina1 aZhang, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0946-55201 aKrebs, Peter0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 55, no. 6 p.3582-3592dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c081193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245010600209300001000315520157900325592002801904596006101932650001901993650001202012650001002024650001102034650002202045650002002067650002102087650001702108651002102125651001402146651002602160700002002186700006002206700001902266700001702285700002002302700002202322700001402344773011102358856008302469852000902552655001202561IND60769747720221122034525.0220617e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076974772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-022-03320-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavenport, Mae A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8242-507413aAn experiential model of drought risk and future irrigation behaviors among central Minnesota farmers  ap. 8.  aAnticipatory water planning must address not only future climatic conditions but also the experiential dimensions of risk that drive human and societal adaptation. Compared to the western USA, agricultural producers in the upper Corn Belt have had less exposure to extreme drought and less irrigated agriculture. If climate change threatens to increase drought frequency or severity in the Corn Belt, a transition from rain-fed agriculture to irrigated agriculture in this region would require systemic changes and significant financial investments. Knowing what drives drought risk perceptions and irrigation behaviors will inform anticipatory planning and water supply management. We surveyed central Minnesota farmers about their drought risk perceptions in two groundwater management areas where climate models project heightened variability in water supply during the growing season. We examined the influence of farmers’ drought exposure beliefs, farm sensitivity appraisals, and drought risk perceptions on future irrigation behaviors. We presented farmers with experiential scenarios of future drought derived from downscaled climate projections and asked about their likelihood of adopting or expanding irrigation systems under those conditions. Findings indicate that many farmers surveyed are concerned about drought, in part because they believe that future droughts are likely in the area and their farms are sensitive to drought. More than one quarter of farmers reported being likely to adopt or expand irrigation under several drought-experience scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data  a1012161cusda national institute of food and agriculture 3aclimate change 3adrought 3afarms 3ahumans 3airrigated farming 3arainfed farming 3awater management 3awater supply 3aCorn Belt region 3aMinnesota 3aWestern United States1 aKreiter, Amelia1 aBrauman, Kate A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8099-285X1 aKeeler, Bonnie1 aArbuckle, J.1 aSharma, Vasudha1 aPradhananga, Amit1 aNoe, Ryan0 tClimatic change.g2022 Mar., v. 171, no. 1-2 p.8-8dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-022-03320-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003300146245009000179300001800269520113800287592002801425650002001453650001301473650002101486650001401507650001101521650001601532650002501548650001401573650002001587650001001607650002001617650001801637650002801655650001801683700004101701700003501742700002601777773013401803856008201937852000902019655001202028IND60538441620180413000000.0160815e20160727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053844162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b014392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez-Antonio, Claudia,10aEnergy Integration of a Hydrotreatment Process for Sustainable Biojet Fuel Production  ap. 8165-8175.  aBiojet fuel has been identified as the most promising alternative for sustainable development of the aviation sector. There are several processes for biojet fuel production, being the hydrotreating of vegetable oils the most attractive. Considering that one of the reactions in the process is exothermic, it is possible to use this energy to reduce the heating requirements and the environmental impact of the process. Therefore, in this work we propose the energy integration of the hydrotreating process to produce biojet fuel, considering Jatropha curcas as renewable raw material. Results show a decreasing in heating–cooling services when energy integration is performed in the process; however, the investment costs are increased due to the equipment required to perform the integration. Therefore, the total annual costs of processes, with and without energy integration, are similar. Nevertheless, energy integration allows a reduction of 86% in the environmental impact of the process. The application of energy integration allows reducing the carbon footprint and increasing the sustainability of renewable aviation fuel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha curcas 3aaviation 3acarbon footprint 3achemistry 3aenergy 3aengineering 3aenvironmental impact 3aequipment 3afuel production 3afuels 3aheat production 3araw materials 3asustainable development 3avegetable oil1 aRomero-Izquierdo, Araceli Guadalupe,1 aIsrael Gómez-Castro, Fernando1 aHernández, Salvador,0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2016 July 27, v. 55, no. 29 p.8165-8175dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.6b014393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03419naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012400155300001600279500002000295520200100315592002802316650002302344650001502367650001802382650001402400650002302414650001502437650002702452650001402479650001202493650002102505650001102526650001502537650001102552650001402563650002402577650001402601650002302615650001302638650001302651651001102664651001102675651001602686700001602702773011302718856007302831852000902904655001202913IND60547855320221121153137.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054785532DNAL7 a10.1111/jen.122872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlieber, J.14aThe entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana has epiphytic and endophytic activity against the tomato leaf miner Tuta absoluta  ap. 580-589.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe recent introduction and rapid spread of the tomato leaf miner Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East poses a severe threat to future cultivation of tomato and other Solanaceae. Among the best practicable means for effective and sustainable control of this invasive insect pest are entomopathogenic fungi, which can either prevent a further spread of this insect to new areas or keep population densities below an economic threshold level. Here, we report on the efficacy of a commercially available mycoinsecticide based on the entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill. (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) against all four larval stages of T. absoluta. In bioassays, high mortality rates and significantly reduced longevity of larvae were obvious when larvae had fed for a period of around 15 days on leaves with B. bassiana propagules present on the surface as an epiphyte with mortality values corrected for variance in control mortality of 90–100%. In addition, a second mode of action of B. bassiana against T. absoluta larvae was evident in bioassays in the form of an endophytic establishment of this fungus in treated tomato plants. Longevity of T. absoluta L4 larvae was significantly lower in individuals which had fed on surface‐sterilized tomato leaves obtained from plants treated 18 days before the bioassay with a B. bassiana suspension compared to larvae feeding on control plants treated with water. Corrected mortality reached values between 30% and 50% for all larval instars. Growth of tomato plants was not inhibited due to colonization by endophytic B. bassiana and a weak systemic translocation of fungal propagules in non‐treated leaves was evident in the assays. Accordingly, entomopathogenic fungi like B. bassiana express different modes of action again target insect pests, which is of particular relevance for the design of efficient management strategies for invasive pests like T. absoluta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aSolanaceae 3aTuta absoluta 3abioassays 3aeconomic threshold 3aendophytes 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3aepiphytes 3ainstars 3ainvasive species 3alarvae 3aleafminers 3aleaves 3alongevity 3amechanism of action 3amortality 3apopulation density 3atomatoes 3avariance 3aAfrica 3aEurope 3aMiddle East1 aReineke, A.0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2016 Sept., v. 140, no. 8 p.580-589dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0931-20487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jen.122873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01990naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245014200165300001600307500002000323520104300343592002801386650001801414650002001432650001601452650001101468650001201479700002301491773009201514856007301606852000901679655001201688IND60571708820221122235528.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057170882DNAL7 a10.1111/eth.125692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSizemore, Brittany A.10aTime‐of‐Day Discriminative Learning: Contrasting the Use of Spatial Compared to Feature Information in Homing Pigeons (Columba livia)  ap. 982-990.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study examined time‐of‐day associative learning to either spatial or feature information in homing pigeons in an open‐field, laboratory setting. Homing pigeons are well known for their navigational abilities and generally have been shown to rely more heavily on spatial than nonspatial cues in recognizing a goal. However, during goal localization, homing pigeons also successfully use nonspatial, feature information. Homing pigeons were divided into two groups and were trained to locate two time‐of‐day dependent, food reward sites using either discriminative spatial or feature information. Because of the importance of the hippocampus in controlling avian memory, we hypothesized that homing pigeons trained with spatial cues would be superior in learning the time‐of‐day discrimination compared to the pigeons trained with feature cues. Indeed, homing pigeons that were trained with spatial information outperformed the pigeons trained with feature information in learning the time‐of‐day discrimination task.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColumba livia 3aanimal behavior 3ahippocampus 3amemory 3apigeons1 aBingman, Verner P.0 tEthology.g2016 Dec., v. 122, no. 12 p.982-990dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0179-16137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eth.125693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245008400184300001600268500001500284520128600299592002801585650001301613650001401626650002001640650001601660650001801676650002401694650001701718650002801735650001401763650001001777650001101787650001501798651001201813653001501825653001601840653002101856653002601877653002001903653001301923653001701936653001401953700001801967700002001985773011702005856008202122852000902204655001202213IND60517278420221116210316.0190729e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051727842DNAL7 a257319852pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820150001042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEBBERT, M.

However, to date, no statistical comparisons have been made between the prevalence, richness and composition of parasite communities in sympatric populations of baboons and P. troglodytes. We compared parasite communities in sympatric P. troglodytes and Papio papio living in a wilderness site, in the Republic of Senegal, West Africa. We asked whether, in the absence of humans, there are significant differences between these hosts in their interactions with gastrointestinal parasites. We tested whether host, location, or time of collection accounted for variation in prevalence, richness and community composition, and compared prevalence across six studies. We concluded that, despite being closely related, there are significant differences between these two hosts with respect to their parasite communities. At our study site, prevalence of Balantidium, Trichuris and Watsonius was higher in P. papio. Papio papio harboured more parasites per host, and we found evidence of a positive association between Trichuris and Balantidium in P. troglodytes but not P. papio.  aPublisher supplied data 3asympatry 3aparasites 3aPan troglodytes 3aPapio papio 3apublic health 3acommunity structure 3aBalantioides 3agastrointestinal system 3aTrichuris 3ahosts 3ahumans 3awilderness 3aSenegal 0aprevalence 0aBalantidium 0amixed infections 0acommunity composition 0across infection 0arichness 0abiodiversity 0ahelminths1 aMcGREW, W.

The gene was present in one copy per haploid genome. The isolated clone contained 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of 810 and 170 nucleotides, respectively and a single intron with highly repetitive sequences. The cDNA encoded the protein with an apparent mass of 10.6 kDa and a pI (isoelectric point) of 5.3. It was cysteine-rich and had an N-terminal hydrophobic domain with characteristics of a secretory signal. Amino acid sequence comparisons demonstrated that the protein was closely related to a family of cereal seed storage proteins and protease inhibitors. The fusion of β-glucuronidase to the TomA108 promoter demonstrated that the promoter was highly active from early-meiosis to free microspores production in tapetum of tobacco. This strong and highly specific promoter can be potentially used to generate male sterility for efficient production of plant hybrids.  aPublisher supplied data 3atomatoes 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3amessenger RNA 3aplant genetics 3acomplementary DNA 3aanthers 3abeta-glucuronidase 3atissue distribution 3aflowers 3aamino acid sequences 3agenomics 3aproteinase inhibitors 3areporter genes 3aamylases 3agene expression regulation 3apromoter regions 3acysteine 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCysteinexchemistry 2aDNA, Complementaryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxchemistry 2aFlowersxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenome, Plantxgenetics 2aGlucuronidasexmetabolism 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Framesxgenetics 2aOrgan Specificity 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistry 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acidxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTobaccoxcytologyxenzymology. 0aenzyme inhibitors 0anucleotide sequences1 aLiu, G.

T.10aAdsorption of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons from Heavy Naphthenic Oil Using Commercial Activated Carbons. 2. Column Adsorption Studies  ap. 8184-8190.  aContinuous adsorption and desorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from heavy naphthenic oils (HNOs) were performed using commercial activated carbon on fixed bed experiments. In part 1, HNO samples with high PAH content (ca. 8 wt %) were treated in batch adsorption experiments, showing decrease in PAH concentration to ca. 3%. In this study, successive column experiments were carried out to study the reduction in capacity along continuous cycles and optimal operational conditions. A column simulation model, using the particle parameters obtained in the previous study, was applied to predict breakthrough curves for adsorption and desorption runs. After several cycles of adsorption/desorption, using solvent or inert gas, only a slight decrease in PAH adsorption capacity was observed. Selectivities for PAH adsorption in relation to aromatics adsorption were also estimated from the adsorption breakthrough curves data.

HL-2-14 against fish parasite Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, and elucidate its chemical structure. By electron ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum (¹H NMR and ¹³C NMR), the compound was identified as amphotericin B (AmB). The in vitro trials revealed that AmB can effectively kill the theronts and tomonts of I. multifiliis with the median lethal concentration (LC₅₀) of 0·8 mg L⁻¹ at 30 min for the theronts and 4·3 mg L⁻¹ at 2 h for the tomonts, respectively. AmB at 5 mg L⁻¹ significantly reduced I. multifiliis infectivity prevalence and intensity on grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), and consequently decreased fish mortality, from 100% in control group to 30% in treated group. The 72 h acute toxicity (LC₅₀) of AmB on grass carp was 20·6 mg L⁻¹, but fish mortality was occurred when exposure to 13·0 mg L⁻¹. These results indicated that AmB was effective in the therapy of I. multifiliis infection, but the safety concentration margin is relatively narrow. Further efforts aiming to decrease the toxicity and improve the therapeutic profile remain to be needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aIchthyophthirius multifiliis 3aStreptomyces 3aacute toxicity 3aamphotericin B 3aantiparasitic properties 3achemical structure 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afish 3aionization 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparasites 3apathogenicity 3atherapeutics 0aichthyophthiriasis 0astreptomycete 0aamphotericin B 0aanti-parasitics 0agrass carp1 aSHAN, XIAO-FENG1 aKANG, YUAN-HUAN1 aSHENG, YU-XUAN1 aCHEN, LONG1 aWang, Wei,1 aMA, HONG-XIA0 tParasitology.g2015 June, v. 142, no. 7 p.910-916dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820150001163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245009600173300001800269500002000287500000900307520144900316592002801765596002101793650002001814650001301834650000901847650001601856650000901872650002601881650001501907650001601922650001401938650001501952650001701967700002101984700002902005700002002034700001902054700002302073700001902096700002102115700002702136773013402163856008402297852000902381655001202390IND60665526920221116224052.0220805e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066552692DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2017.01.00072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguate, Fernando M.10aUse of Hyperspectral Image Data Outperforms Vegetation Indices in Prediction of Maize Yield  ap. 2517-2524.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aHyperspectral cameras can provide reflectance data at hundreds of wavelengths. This information can be used to derive vegetation indices (VIs) that are correlated with agronomic and physiological traits. However, the data generated by hyperspectral cameras are richer than what can be summarized in a VI. Therefore, in this study, we examined whether prediction equations using hyperspectral image data can lead to better predictive performance for grain yield than what can be achieved using VIs. For hyperspectral prediction equations, we considered three estimation methods: ordinary least squares, partial least squares (a dimension reduction method), and a Bayesian shrinkage and variable selection procedure. We also examined the benefits of combining reflectance data collected at different time points. Data were generated by CIMMYT in 11 maize (Zea mays L.) yield trials conducted in 2014 under heat and drought stress. Our results indicate that using data from 62 bands leads to higher prediction accuracy than what can be achieved using individual VIs. Overall, the shrinkage and variable selection method was the best‐performing one. Among the models using data from a single time point, the one using reflectance collected at 28 d after flowering gave the highest prediction accuracy. Combining image data collected at multiple time points led to an increase in prediction accuracy compared with using single‐time‐point data.  aPublisher supplied data  aR01GM101219cNIH 3aBayesian theory 3aZea mays 3acorn 3agrain yield 3aheat 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aprediction 3areflectance 3ashrinkage 3avegetation 3awater stress1 aTrachsel, Samuel1 aPérez, Lorena González1 aBurgueño, Juan1 aCrossa, José,1 aBalzarini, Mónica1 aGouache, David1 aBogard, Matthieu1 ade los Campos, Gustavo0 tCrop science.g2017 Sept., v. 57, no. 5 p.2517-2524dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2017.01.00073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03892naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245010700185500001900292520208700311592002802398650002202426650001802448650001102466650001202477650001502489650001202504650001302516650001602529650002302545650002202568650001102590650002102601650002002622650001502642650001902657650002602676650001902702650002502721650002502746650003702771650001702808651000902825653002602834653002502860653002202885653002502907700006402932700006302996700006303059773010903122856008603231852000903317655001203326IND60678482920221122013757.0200113e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067848292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1091092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLangeroodi, Ali Reza Safahani10aTo what extent arbuscular mycorrhiza can protect chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) against drought stress  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWater deficiency is one of the most significant limiting factors resulting in severe crop yield reduction. This study hypothesizes that the inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) minimize the detrimental effects of drought in chicory (Cichorium intybus L.). The objective was to evaluate how AM inoculation affects agro-biochemical traits of chicory under different irrigation rates. Field experiments were conducted in 2017 and 2018 in north of Iran and designed as a factorial combination of three irrigation rates [40, 65 and 90 % of maximum allowable depletion of available soil water (IR¹, IR² and IR³, respectively)], two AM inoculations [inoculated and not inoculated (AM⁺ and AM⁻, respectively)] and two chicory ecotypes [Sefid Isfahan and Siyah Shiraz (E¹ and E², respectively)]. Crop growth, pigments and minerals content, carbon exchange rate, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance were evaluated. The data showed that the mycorrhizal colonization increased chicory growth performance by 12.4 %, 16.1 % and 21.0 %, under I¹, I², and I³ water regime, respectively. The mineral content and photosynthesis parameters decreased as irrigation water decreased, irrespective of whether plants were inoculated or not. Similarly, AM⁺ plants had higher inulin percentage and the mean inulin degree of polymerisation than AM⁻ plant under all of irrigation levels. Furthermore, inoculated chicory plants under drought stress showed an enhanced activity of the antioxidant system, such as superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, ascorbic acid and glutathione, while the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and the oxidative damage were reduced. The two ecotypes tended to respond similarly to irrigation and AM treatments for all growth and quality parameters measured in the experiment, even if ecotype Siyah Shiraz performed better than ecotype Sefid Isfahan. The improved plant performance and inulin content in the inoculated plants demonstrate that AM has the potential to minimize the detrimental effects of drought stress on chicory under semi-arid conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCichorium intybus 3aascorbic acid 3acarbon 3achicory 3acrop yield 3adrought 3aecotypes 3aglutathione 3agrowth performance 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ainulin 3airrigation water 3amineral content 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant available water 3apolymerization 3astomatal conductance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awater stress 3aIran 0aArbuscular mycorrhiza 0aCichorium intybus L. 0aGrowth parameters 0aAntioxidant activity1 aOsipitan, O.

In addition to high temperature and shear, the presence of plasticizers is essential in the TPS production process, to break the strong inter‐ and intra‐molecular interactions of the starch chains. The properties of these plasticizers—their functional groups, molecular weight, thermal stability, and compatibility with the polymer, among others—play an important role in the production of TPS. This work therefore brings together research evaluating starch–plasticizer molecular interactions and their effect on the structure, polymer properties, retrogradation, and processing of TPS obtained by extrusion; in addition, it collects and analyzes information on the process conditions used in the extrusion of different starches in the presence of different plasticizers. The objective of this review is to provide a clear description of the importance of the effect of plasticizers on the properties of TPS obtained by extrusion, indicating the potential of some plasticizers to broaden the field of application of TPS.  aPublisher supplied data  cGeneral Royalties System (SGR)  cSistema General de Regalías de Colombia 3aextrusion 3amolecular weight 3aretrogradation 3astarch 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3athermoplastics1 aGómez‐López, Rudy A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3950-07771 aSolanilla‐Duque, José F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6664-91341 aSerna‐Cock, Liliana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2911-08711 aVillada‐Castillo, Héctor S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5557-32150 tStärke =.g2021 Sept., v. 73, no. 9-10 p.e2100060-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2021000603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013100165300001800296520110600314592002801420650002801448650003001476650001901506650002001525650002901545650001101574650001701585650001401602650001801616650002101634650001501655700002501670700002101695773010201716856008101818852000901899655001201908IND60086477320221116172846.0141101e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008647732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2012.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrsolin, P.C.10aAssessment of the mutagenic, recombinagenic and carcinogenic potential of orlistat in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 2598-2604.  aIn this study the mutagenic, recombinagenic, carcinogenic and anticarcinogenic potential of orlistat was assessed using the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) and the epithelial tumor detection test (wts). The experiments were conducted on Drosophila melanogaster. In the assessment using SMART, larvae, descendants from the standard (ST) cross and the high bioactivation (HB) cross, were treated chronically with three orlistat concentrations. The results revealed a recombinagenic effect, associated with orlistat, in the descendants of the HB cross, at all three levels of concentration. Homologous recombination can function as a determinant at different stages of carcinogenesis. For verification, larvae from the wts test, descendants of the wts/TM3 virgin female and mwh/mwh male cross, were treated with the same three orlistat concentrations separately and in association with mitomicin C (0.1mM). The results did not, however, provide evidence that orlistat has carcinogenic potential nor was it associated with the reduction of tumors induced by mitomicin C in D. melanogaster.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinogenicity 3ahomologous recombination 3alarvae 3amutagenicity 3aneoplasms 3asomatic cells 3asomatic mutation 3atoxicology1 aSilva-Oliveira, R.G.1 aNepomuceno, J.C.0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2012 Aug., v. 50, no. 8 p.2598-2604dElsevier Ltdx0278-69157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2012.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011700165300001400282520169000296592002801986650002302014650001902037650001502056650001302071650001302084650001602097650001502113650001002128650002202138650001502160650001302175650002202188650001402210650002402224650002502248650001502273651001002288651001802298653001902316653001602335653001702351653000702368653002502375653002502400700001602425700001702441700001702458700001602475700001702491700001602508773010802524856008602632852000902718655001202727IND60567974820221117224740.0190318e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056797482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Ying10aPopulation structure of Rhizobium etli-like strains nodulated with Phaseolus vulgaris in two ecoregions of China  ap. 14-23.  aPopulation genetics could reveal the evolutionary relationships of different populations in the same bacterial species or closely related species. To estimate the evolutionary history of bean-nodulating Rhizobium etli-like bacteria in China, the genetic diversity and population structures of 77 strains belonging to seven genomic species isolated from eight sites in the temperate and subtropical regions were investigated in this study. As results, seven clades were defined in the phylogenetic network based upon the sequences of eight housekeeping and adaptation genes, in which some strains of different genospecies were intermingled due to the effects of adaptation genes on the phylogeny of chromosome. The close phylogenetic relationships of the tested strains with a Columbian strain R. etli CIAT 652, and their deeply separating from the Mexican reference strains demonstrated the evolution of Chinese bean-nodulating bacteria directly from the ancestors of South America. Distinct populations with varied haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were observed in the alkaline, strong acid and neutral-acid soils, and they may be affected by natural selection in the alkaline/strong acid soils, or by the neutral selection in other sampling sites. The isolates in the neutral and acid soils were admixture containing more of the ancestral lineages similar to the American strains, while the isolates in strong acid (Chutan) and alkaline (Daqing) soils formed independent clusters. Soil factors shaped the rhizobial populations stronger than the geographic distance. Moreover, recombination contributed more in the evolution of R. etli-related populations than mutation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aRhizobium etli 3aacid soils 3aancestry 3abacteria 3achromosomes 3aecoregions 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amutation 3anatural selection 3aphylogeny 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation structure 3asubtropics 3aChina 3aSouth America 0aRhizobium etli 0aCommon bean 0aBiogeography 0apH 0aPopulation structure 0aEvolutionary history1 aWang, Entao1 aTong, Wenjun1 aQiao, Yajuan1 aZhao, Liang1 aChen, Weimin1 aWei, Gehong0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2017 Sept., v. 112 p.14-23dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.04.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245009700177300001600274520091500290592002801205650000801233650002001241650002601261650001701287650001101304650001501315650002401330650002201354650001101376650001801387650001001405650001501415651000901430653003001439653001101469653001201480653001001492653002701502700003101529700002301560773012401583856008301707852000901790655001201799IND60681873920221120202123.0201223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068187392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.inpa.2020.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdollahpour, Shamsollah10aPrediction of wheat moisture content at harvest time through ANN and SVR modeling techniques  ap. 500-510.  aThe grain moisture content at harvest time is a key factor that limits harvesting windows. The present study aimed to develop a new methodology to predict wheat moisture content by using multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and support vector regression (SVR) techniques. Five input variables included the number of days after sowing, air temperature, air relative humidity, wind speed on an hourly basis, and precipitation on a 6-hour basis. The study area was Sari County located in the north of Iran. Data were collected from field experiments in two crop years (2016/17 and 2017/18). The results indicated that the developed MLP model outperformed the SVR model in determining wheat moisture content by R² and RMSE value of 0.92 and 2.09% (wet basis) against 0.79 and 3.09%, respectively. In conclusion, the developed MLP model can be considered a useful method to estimate wheat moisture content at harvest time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair temperature 3afield experimentation 3aharvest date 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3arelative humidity 3asowing 3awater content 3awheat 3awind speed 3aIran 0aArtificial neural network 0aCereal 0aHarvest 0aModel 0aSupport vector machine1 aKosari-Moghaddam, Armaghan1 aBannayan, Mohammad0 tInformation processing in agriculture.g2020 Dec., v. 7, no. 4 p.500-510dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23276x2214-31737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.inpa.2020.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245010400164300001200268520157700280592002801857650001101885650001501896650002101911650002001932650002901952650002201981650001402003650001302017650001802030650002802048650001802076650001302094650001802107650000702125650003402132653002902166653002802195653002702223653002902250653001902279700001502298700001602313700001602329700001802345700001802363700001702381773007302398856008502471852000902556655001202565IND60567974920221117224912.0170627e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056797492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2017.04.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKe, Hong12aA MWCNTs-Pt nanohybrids-based highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence sensor for flavonoids assay  ap. 1-7.  aElectrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay has gradually drawn increasing interest to be considered as one of the potential strategies to be applicable in a wide range of medicine target determination. In this protocol, a facile and ultrasensitive ECL sensor platform was developed aiming at rapidly quantitative detection of polyphenolic flavonoids based on multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) nanohybrids/nafion/Ru(bpy)32+ modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in Ru(bpy)32+/tri-n-propylamine (TPA) co-reaction system. Attributed to the synergistic ECL signal amplification of both PtNPs and MWCNTs facilitating the electron transfer, this proposed sensor could sensitively analyze the flavonoids through an annihilation ECL emission mechanism since the less generated amount of excitation state Ru(Ⅱ)* on account of the principle that flavones are prone to donate electrons and scavenge free radicals to further show a competitive relationship with Ru(Ⅲ) on the reaction with TPA*. The influences of pH, Ru(bpy)32+ absorption time and TPA co-reactant concentration were investigated and the sensor exhibited a linear response to flavonoids when the concentration ranges from 6.50×10–11 to 1.00×10−7M with a detection limit (LOD) of 2.17×10–11M (S/N=3) upon the optimized conditions. Furthermore, high sensitivity, excellent stability and reproducibility were verified to declare the promise for being applicable to analyze the flavones content in real flavones medicine samples and ginkgo leaves extracts with satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGinkgo 3aabsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3aflavones 3afree radicals 3aglassy carbon electrode 3aleaf extracts 3amedicine 3ananoparticles 3apH 3astandard operating procedures 0aElectrochemiluminescence 0aFlavonoids polyphenolic 0aGinkgo leaves extracts 0aMWCNTs-PtNPs nanohybrids 0aMedicine assay1 aZhang, Xin1 aGuo, Weiwei1 aZhang, Amin1 aWang, Zhiming1 aHuang, Chusen1 aJia, Nengqin0 tTalanta.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 171 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2017.04.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010600167300001400273520087100287592002801158650002401186650002501210650001801235650001601253650001601269650001301285700006001298700002601358700002101384773010901405856008301514852000901597655001201606IND60681874120221120161528.0201223e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068187412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cofs.2020.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkuro, Paula K10aPerspective on oleogelator mixtures, structure design and behaviour towards digestibility of oleogels  ap. 27-35.  aThe concepts of either multi-component supramolecular gels or structures derived from oleogels have not yet been fully investigated to their respective potentials.

The flux of organic cosolvents forms the main problem for these applications because of changing cosolvent concentrations. The present paper investigates the permeability of small linear alcohols, namely, methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol, through commercial ion-exchange membranes. The membrane permeability decreases with increasing molecular size of the cosolvent. This indicates that the transport is limited by steric hindrance in the membrane. However, the use of 1-propanol leads to a high pressure drop and a high permeability in certain membranes. In addition, the effect of operating parameters on the cosolvent permeability was tested. A change in current density has only a minor influence on the cosolvent flux. The flux of organic cosolvents was found to be mainly determined by the concentration gradient of alcohol across the membrane. The cosolvent permeability decreases with an increase in the concentration gradient. A screening of several cation and anion-exchange membranes from PCA GmbH and Astom Corporation was performed and showed that all membranes tested have a lower permeability than Nafion membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3acations 3aelectrodialysis 3aengineering 3aethanol 3aion-exchange membranes 3amembrane permeability 3amethanol 3amolecular weight 3ascreening 3asolvents1 aBruggen, Bart van der,1 aPinoy, Luc0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2016 July 27, v. 55, no. 29 p.8215-8224dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.6b019153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245022300166300001400389520126800403592002801671650005601699650001201755650002401767650002401791650002001815650001801835650001401853650001201867650005001879650002101929650001601950650003101966650003501997650000902032650001702041650002902058650001402087653000802101653000802109653000802117653005602125653001002181653001302191653001502204653004102219700001202260700001502272700001302287700001802300700001702318700001302335700001102348700002002359773013602379856008502515852000902600655001202609IND60535142620221119145430.0190318e20141215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053514262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2014.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yanping10aIdentification of a single nucleotide promoter polymorphism regulating the transcription of ubiquitin specific protease 18 gene related to the resistance to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection  ap. 65-71.  aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), characterized by reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disease and mortality in piglets, is a major infectious disease that causes great economic loss throughout the world. Previous studies revealed that the overexpression of porcine ubiquitin specific protease 18 (USP18) gene inhibits PRRSV replication in vitro. The objective of this study is to compare the promoter activity of USP18 in Chinese indigenous Dapulian (DPL) pigs and Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire (DLY) commercial pigs and screen single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) affecting porcine USP18 transcription. We found that the promoter activity was significantly higher in DPL pigs than DLY commercial pigs (p<0.05), deletion of the promoter from –1790 to –1314bp decreased the transcriptional activity by roughly 60% (p<0.05) and a SNP G–1533A in this region increased the mRNA expression both prior to and post PRRSV infection in MARC-145 cells. Population genetics analysis showed that allele A was only detected in Chinese pig breeds which are generally resistant to PRRSV. These results suggest that the SNP G–1533A polymorphism in the promoter region of porcine USP18 gene is a potential DNA marker for the resistance to PRRSV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aalleles 3afinancial economics 3agene overexpression 3agenetic markers 3amessenger RNA 3amortality 3apiglets 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3apromoter regions 3aproteinases 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asows 3aswine breeds 3atranscription (genetics) 3aubiquitin 0aDPL 0aDLY 0aPig 0aPorcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus 0aUSP18 0aPromoter 0aResistance 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)1 aSun, Yi1 aXing, Feng1 aKang, Li1 aWang, Pengfei1 aWang, Liyuan1 aLiu, Hao1 aLi, Yi1 aJiang, Yunliang0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2014 Dec. 15, v. 162, no. 3-4 p.65-71dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2014.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001600159245007300175300001600248500000900264520135800273592002801631650001801659650002301677650001801700650001301718650001601731650001301747650001501760650001501775650001401790700001801804700001701822700001701839773014701856852000902003856009602012655001202108IND2201756520221120183041.0191125e199905  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220175652DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1999.03615995006300030016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrye, K.

Equilibrium tension lysimeter replicates were installed in a natural prairie, and N-fertilized no-tillage and chisel-plow agroecosystems to measure drainage through undisturbed soil. The ETLs were used to monitor drainage continuously at 1.4 m below the soil surface through a 0.2-µm pore diameter stainless steel porous plate (0.19 m²). Heat dissipation sensors were used to record variations in matric potential inside and outside the ETL's sampling area. Suction was maintained on lysimeters according to the matric potential experienced by the surrounding bulk soil. Cumulative lysimeter drainage was 199, 563, and 793 mm for the prairie, fertilized no-tillage, and fertilized chisel-plow agroeco-systems for 132 wk between 25 June 1995 and 3 Jan. 1998. Drainage accounted for 11, 31, and 44% of precipitation inputs for the prairie, fertilized no-tillage, and fertilized chisel plow systems. Variability between lysimeter replicates was smallest for the prairie, where the coefficient of variation (CV) was 8.2%, and largest for the N-fertilized no-tillage agroecosystem (CV = 36.6%).

Here, GO was first modified with poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) and triethylenetetramine (TTA) through γ-ray radiation. Then, a tiny small amount (0.04%) of the prepared modified GO was filled with a PET/ethylene-methyl acrylate-glycidyl methacrylate random terpolymer (PET/ST2000) blend. The morphological analyses on these filled PET blends confirmed that the surface chemical structure of GO had a crucial impact on the mechanical property of the blend. The chemical bonding between GO and ST2000 was more efficient in improving the dispersibility of GO and the compatibility between PET and ST2000, leading to a 2.5-fold increase in the impact strength, along with a slight increase in tensile strength. However, the addition of reduced GO lacking polar groups caused fatal damage in the mechanical property of the blend.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3achemical structure 3adispersibility 3aengineering 3agamma radiation 3agraphene oxide 3aimpact strength 3apolymers 3atensile strength1 aDuan, Guowei1 aWang, Weikang1 aWang, Mozhen1 aWu, Qichao1 aZhou, Xiao1 aGe, Xuewu0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2016 July 27, v. 55, no. 29 p.8123-8132dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.6b019353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014400169500001900313520182700332592002802159650002802187650002302215650002502238650002102263650001102284650001602295650002102311650002102332650001102353650001302364650002302377650001302400650001802413650002002431650002502451653001702476700002002493700005502513700005602568700002102624700001602645773010902661856008602770852000902856655001202865IND60678483220221121041707.0200113e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067848322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1091122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Huiping10aNitrogen application modified the effect of deficit irrigation on tomato transpiration, and water use efficiency in different growth stages  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNitrogen (N) application affects the relationships between tomato transpiration (T), water use efficiency (WUE) and soil water content (SWC), and is important for practical agricultural management. This study investigated T (hourly, Tₕ, and daily, TC) and WUE (leaf scale, WUEL, and plant scale, WUEP) differences of tomato grown in a solar greenhouse in response to different N and irrigation treatments. Three N application rates (0, 100 and 200 mg N kg⁻¹ soil) were applied with four irrigation levels (full irrigation, Wck; and deficit irrigation, half amount of Wck, happened in different growth stage, W1, W2 and W3 respectively). Results showed that N application partly alleviated reductions in T associated with deficit irrigation, and it enhanced the promotion of deficit irrigation in WUEL. In tomato fruit late growth stage (stage 3), a balance is needed between irrigation and N application rate, higher N application can improve T and WUEL under higher irrigation water available. The positive effects of N2 and N3 on T were more pronounced when SWC was in the range of 0.19 − 0.22 cm³ cm⁻³ and 0.22 − 0.26 cm³ cm⁻³, respectively in this study. In tomato fruit early growth stage (stage 1), N application aggravated the reduction in WUEP due to deficit irrigation, while in tomato fruit middle and late growth stages (stage 2 and 3), N application enhanced the promotion of deficit irrigation on WUEP. Generally, in tomato early growth stage, there should be no water shortage and N excess; in fruit middle and late growth stages, more N can be applied along with the increase of SWC. This study proposes a prospect to implement integrative management of irrigation and N application during tomato growth, promoting transpiration and water use efficiency in a scientific way.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural management 3adeficit irrigation 3adevelopmental stages 3afertilizer rates 3afruits 3agreenhouses 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3asoil water content 3atomatoes 3atranspiration 3awater shortages 3awater use efficiency 0aGrowth stage1 aKang, Shaozhong1 aLi, Fusheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4189-33541 aDu, Taisheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6146-02171 aShukla, Manoj K.1 aLi, Xiaojie0 tScientia horticulturae.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 263 p.109112-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1091123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013200163300001800295520098900313592002801302596009801330596010401428596007201532650001801604650002501622650002101647650002501668650001601693650002001709650001701729650002101746650002701767650002501794650002101819650002101840650001701861700001701878700001801895700001501913700001501928700001501943700001701958700005101975700005602026773012902082856008502211852000902296655001202305IND60781273420221116162048.0220628e20220616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078127342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.2c010502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Meng10aBiocompatible Abscisic Acid-Sensing Supramolecular Hybridization Probe for Spatiotemporal Fluorescence Imaging in Plant Tissues  ap. 8999-9008.  aAchieving detection of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is of critical importance for understanding plant growth and development. We report a hybrid supramolecular fluorescent probe that uses bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a host. Aggregation-induced emission of fluorescent chromophores (AIEgens) enables luminescence in the presence of BSA. ABA and its aptamer act as a switch to trigger this fluorescent system, the strategy that exhibits high sensitivity to abscisic acid with a detection limit of 0.098 nM. The probe test strip also enables visualization of ABA content from plants by colorimetric observation with the naked eye. In particular, the high biocompatibility and small molecular size of the prepared fluorescent probe allow for effective monitoring of ABA in plant tissues by fluorescence imaging. This strategy provides a new perspective to achieve the detection of endogenous and exogenous ABA in plants and has important implications for plant biology research.  aPublisher supplied data  aB20088cHigher Education Discipline Innovation Projectdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100013314  a2572021BU03cCentral University Basic Research Fund of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018594  aNAcHeilongjiang Touyan Innovation Team Programdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aabscisic acid 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiocompatibility 3abovine serum albumin 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3agrowth and development 3ahybridization probes 3amolecular weight 3aoligonucleotides 3aplant growth1 aYin, Chenhui1 aJiang, Xinxin1 aSun, Qijun1 aXu, Xiaoyu1 aMa, Yanmei1 aLiu, Xinjian1 aNiu, Na1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6609-65681 aChen, Ligang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7950-25960 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 June 16, v. 94, no. 25 p.8999-9008dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c010503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008300170300001400253520220300267592002802470650003102498650001402529650000902543650003102552650001102583650001802594650001402612650001002626653000802636653003602644653001502680653001602695653001702711653001702728700002002745700002102765700002402786773013602810856008502946852000903031655001203040IND60535142720221119145554.0190318e20141215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053514272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2014.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBismarck, Doris10aCanine CD4+CD8+ double-positive T cells can develop from CD4+ and CD8+ T cells  ap. 72-82.  aFor a long time the expression of the CD4 and CD8 receptor on peripheral blood T cells was thought to be mutually exclusive. However, in canine peripheral blood, similar to other species as swine or human for example, mature CD4+CD8+ double-positive (dp) T cells exist which simultaneously express both surface receptors and have features of activated T cells. Canine CD4+CD8+dp T cells are heterogeneous and can be divided into three subpopulations by their intensity of CD4 and CD8α expression: CD4brightCD8αbright, CD4dimCD8αbright and CD4dimCD8αdim. The number of CD4+CD8α+dp T cells increases after in vitro stimulation of canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) raising the question of their progenitor(s). Thus, the aim of our study was to characterize the progenitor(s) of canine CD4+CD8α+dp T cells. By cell tracing experiments we identified both CD4+ single-positive (sp) and also CD8α+sp T cells as progenitors of canine CD4+CD8α+dp T cells after in vitro stimulation. CD4+sp T cells almost exclusively upregulate a CD8αα homodimer, whereas CD8α+sp T cells can become CD4+CD8αβ+ or CD4+CD8αα+. Even in the absence of other cells, highly purified CD4+sp T cells can become double-positive upon in vitro stimulation, whereas highly purified CD8α+sp T cells fail to do so. However, CD8α+sp T cells can additionally express CD4 when stimulated in the presence of CD4−CD8α− double-negative (dn) cells or more efficiently when stimulated in the presence of CD4+sp T cells. Soluble factors secreted by CD4+sp T cells are sufficient for the upregulation of CD4 on CD8α+sp T cells, but direct cell–cell contact between CD4+sp and CD8α+sp T cells is more efficient. mRNA analysis shows that additional CD4 expression on CD8α+sp T cells results from de novo synthesis. Thus, uptake of soluble CD4 or trogocytosis is less likely as mechanism for generation of canine double-positive T cells. CD4+CD8α+dp T cells are highly activated independent of their origin except when generated in coculture of CD8α+sp T cells with CD4−CD8α−dn cells. Overall, in dog, CD4+sp T cells are the more potent progenitors of CD4+CD8α+dp T cells compared to CD8α+sp T cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3acoculture 3adogs 3agene expression regulation 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3areceptors 3aswine 0aDog 0aCD4+CD8+double-positive T cells 0aProgenitor 0aStimulation 0aCD8 receptor 0aCD4 receptor1 aMoore, Peter F.1 aAlber, Gottfried1 avon Buttlar, Heiner0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2014 Dec. 15, v. 162, no. 3-4 p.72-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2014.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01927naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015500158300002000313520075600333592002801089650002601117650001501143650001301158650002801171650001701199650001501216650001801231650001401249650001101263650002001274700001901294700001501313700001701328773012501345856007401470852000901544655001201553IND60669438820221119225547.0190920e20151030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066943882DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra19682e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Cai-Ming10aLuminescence and slow magnetic relaxation of isostructural 2D lanthanide metal–organic frameworks derived from both nicotinate N-oxide and glutarate  ap. 92980-92987.  aThree lanthanide coordination polymers containing both nicotinate N-oxide and glutarate, {[Ln(NNO)(glu)]·0.25H₂O}∞ (Ln = Eu, 1; Ln = Gd, 2; Ln = Dy, 3; HNNO = nicotinic acid N-oxide, H₂glu = glutaric acid), have been hydrothermally synthesized, which are isostructural, showing 2D layer network structures.

This knowledge gap is sustained by lacking technologies for trace-level angiotensin detection throughout tissues, such as the brain. To provide a bridging solution, we enhanced capillary electrophoresis (CE) nanoflow electrospray ionization (ESI) with large-volume sample stacking and employed trapped ion mobility time-of-flight (timsTOF) tandem HRMS detection. A dynamic pH junction helped stack approximately 10 times more of the sample than optimal using the field-amplified reference. In conjunction, the efficiency of ion generation was maximized by a cone-jet nanospray on a low sheath-flow tapered-tip nano-electrospray emitter. The platform provided additional peptide-dependent information, the collision cross section, to filter chemical noise and improve sequence identification and detection limits. The lower limit of detection reached sub-picomolar or ∼30 zmol (∼18,000 copies) level. All nine targeted angiotensin peptides in mouse tissue samples were detectable and quantifiable from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus even after removal of circulatory blood components (perfusion). We anticipate CE-ESI with timsTOF HRMS to be broadly applicable for the ultrasensitive detection of brain peptidomes in pursuit of a better understanding of the brain.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcArnold and Mabel Beckman Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000997  aNAcUniversity of Marylanddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008510  aR01HL137103cNational Heart and Lung Institutedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000850 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood 3acapillary electrophoresis 3adetection limit 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3ahypothalamus 3amice 3apH 3apeptides 3arenin-angiotensin system1 aJia, Dashuang1 aIyer, Laxmi1 aYu, Zhe1 aChoi, Sam B.1 aMarvar, Paul J.1 aNemes, Péter,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4704-49970 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 June 13, v. 94, no. 25 p.9018-9025dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c010623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010800158300001800266500002000284520169800304592002802002650001802030650001702048650001002065650000902075650002002084650001302104650001402117650001002131650002602141650001402167650002302181651001402204651002302218700002302241700001902264700002402283700002302307773010202330856007302432852000902505655001202514IND60547856320221121230211.0160903e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054785632DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.137122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStieb, Sara M.10aDepth‐dependent plasticity in opsin gene expression varies between damselfish (Pomacentridae) species  ap. 3645-3661.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPhenotypic plasticity plays an important role in adapting the visual capability of many animal species to changing sensory requirements. Such variability may be driven by developmental change or may result from environmental changes in light habitat, thereby improving performance in different photic environments. In this study, we examined inter‐ and intraspecific plasticity of visual sensitivities in seven damselfish species, part of the species‐rich and colourful fish fauna of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Our goal was to test whether the visual systems of damselfish were tuned to the prevailing light environment in different habitats and/or other aspects of their lifestyle. More specifically, we compared the opsin gene expression levels from individuals living in different photic habitats. We found that all species expressed rod opsin (RH1) used for dim‐light vision, and primarily three cone opsins (SWS1, RH2B and RH2A) used for colour vision. While RH1 levels changed exclusively following a diurnal cycle, cone opsin expression varied with depth in four of the seven species. Estimates of visual pigment performance imply that changes in opsin expression adjust visual sensitivities to the dominant photic regime. However, we also discovered that some species show a more stable opsin expression profile. Further, we found indication that seasonal changes, possibly linked to changes in the photic environment, might also trigger opsin expression. These findings suggest that plasticity in opsin gene expression of damselfish is highly species‐specific, possibly due to ecological differences in visual tasks or, alternatively, under phylogenetic constraints.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPomacentridae 3acolor vision 3afauna 3afish 3agene expression 3ahabitats 3alifestyle 3aopsin 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aphylogeny 3aseasonal variation 3aAustralia 3aGreat Barrier Reef1 aCarleton, Karen L.1 aCortesi, Fabio1 aMarshall, N.

Solutions supersaturated with respect to rhodochrosite that was detected in various natural environments suggest that equilibrium assumptions may not be satisfactory and kinetic processes may be dominant. This study was conducted to evaluate the precipitation mechanisms of rhodochrosite in natural environments where DOC is present and there are variations in partial pressure of CO₂ (PCO₂). Precipitation rates were measured in supersaturated solutions of rhodochrosite in the presence of seeds of the mineral and PCO₂ 0.035 kPa, 5 kPa, and 10 kPa and in a concentration range of DOC of 0.02 to 3.2 mM of Suwannee River fulvic acid. Precipitation rates were measured in the absence and presence of 1 mM leonardite humic acid. Precipitation rates increased when the PCO₂ increased and decreased when the concentration of the fulvic acid increased at constant levels of supersaturation. However, higher concentrations of DOC were needed to produce the same reduction in precipitation rates when PCO₂ was increased. The most likely causes of the increase in the precipitation rate when PCO₂ increases are an increase in the negative surface charge and an increase in the activity of MnHCO⁺₃. No significant change in the precipitation rate of rhodochrosite was measured when the leonardite humic acid was added to the reaction vessels. The lack of inhibition of leonardite humic acid on rhodochrosite precipitation is explained by its molecular configuration in solution.

In particular, high quality fluorinated graphene offers a great potential in modulating variable properties by regulating its surface microstructure. Moreover, the fluorine introduction and carbon-fluorine bonding characters will enable some interesting biological response. Here, the biological responses to bacteria and cells of fluorinated graphene were studied. Present work revealed that partially fluorinated graphene behaved satisfactory antibacterial ability. Fluorinated graphene showed well facilitating function to cell adhesion in early period, however, after a longer incubation period, the enhanced intracellular ROS level in rBMSCs on the fully fluorinated graphene gives rise to the decrease of cell viability. It was found that there is no statistical difference in the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and matrix mineralization of rBMSCs on pristine graphene, partially fluorinated graphene and fluorographene. In addition, the introduction of fluorine into pristine graphene plane reduced the adhesion and aggregation of blood platelets due to the attenuation of π–π interaction between material surface and blood protein. The findings in this work revealed that partial fluorinated graphene exhibited better antibacterial ability and cytocompatibility, outperforming pristine graphene and fluorographene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abacteria 3abiocompatibility 3ablood platelets 3ablood proteins 3acell adhesion 3acolloids 3afluorine 3agraphene 3ahalides 3amicrostructure 3amineralization 0aFluorinated graphene 0aPlasma modification 0aAntibacterial property 0aBiological response1 aWang, Tianbo1 aCao, Huiliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5209-44971 aZhu, Hongqin1 aDi, Zengfeng1 aLiu, Xuanyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9440-81430 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 173 p.681-688dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.10.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245016700164500001900331520153500350592002801885650001701913650001201930650001001942650001401952650001801966650001101984650002001995650002502015650002002040650001002060650002302070653002202093653002302115653002202138653002602160700001402186700005202200773010902252856008602361852000902447655001202456IND60678483520221121030809.0200113e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067848352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1091152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Meng10aPre-harvest application of harpin β protein improves fruit on-tree and storage quality attributes of ‘Lapins’ and ‘Regina’ sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe purpose of this study was to determine the effects of pre-harvest application concentration, frequency, and timing of harpin β protein on improving quality attributes (fruit firmness (FF), size, skin color, soluble solids content (SSC), and titratable acidity (TA)), susceptibility to physiological postharvest disorders (stem browning, surface pitting, and decay), and nutrient uptake in ‘Lapins’ and ‘Regina’ sweet cherries. A single application of 1.5 mg L⁻¹ harpin 1 week before harvest (1WBH) was effective in increasing FF, SSC, TA, and calcium (Ca) uptake of ‘Lapins’ cherries at harvest compared to the control fruit. Two split applications of 1.5 mg L⁻¹ harpin at 1WBH and straw color resulted in firmer ‘Lapins’ cherries as a single spray, but did not further affect quality attributes. Increasing application frequency from 1 to 3 times (pit hardening, straw color, and 1WBH) effectively retained high FF and low incidences of stem browning and surface pitting in ‘Lapins’ cherries after 4 weeks of storage at 0 °C. For ‘Regina’ cherries, three applications of 1.5 mg L⁻¹ harpin at full bloom, shuck fall, and 1WBH enhanced FF, stem pull force, and Ca uptake at harvest; surface pitting was reduced. In conclusion, 3 applications of 1.5 mg L⁻¹ harpin β protein at pit hardening, straw color, and 1WBH improved fruit quality of ‘Lapins’ cherries, while the quality of ‘Regina’ cherries was improved by applications at full bloom, shuck fall, and 1WBH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus avium 3acalcium 3acolor 3aflowering 3afruit quality 3afruits 3anutrient uptake 3apreharvest treatment 3astorage quality 3astraw 3atitratable acidity 0aHarpin β protein 0aApplication timing 0aQuality attribute 0aPostharvest disorders1 aWang, Yan1 aDong, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4129-46370 tScientia horticulturae.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 263 p.109115-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1091153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04228naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001900159245005700178300001600235500000900251520305500260592002803315650002403343650001203367650001103379650001303390650001803403650002003421650003203441650002003473650001503493650002403508650002103532650001603553700002103569773014703590852000903737856009603746655001203842IND2201756920221120173012.0191125e199905  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220175692DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1999.03615995006300030020x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlose, Susanne10aArylsulfatase Activity of Microbial Biomass in Soils  ap. 569-574.  aepub  aQuantification of the different pools of enzyme activity in soils (intra- and extracellular) is desired to assess the contribution of the microbial community to specific enzyme reactions and ecological changes in soils. Arylsulfatase activity was assayed at optimal pH (acetate buffer, pH 5.8) in 10 surface soils before and after chloroform-fumigation, and microbial biomass C (Cₘᵢc) was determined by a chloroform-fumigation-extraction method, and microbial biomass N (Nₘᵢc) by a chloroform-fumigation-incubation method. The Cₘᵢc values ranged from 31 to 784 mg kg⁻¹ soil (average = 252 mg kg⁻¹ soil) and the Nₘᵢc values ranged from 6 to 28 mg kg⁻¹ soil (average = 12 mg kg⁻¹ soil), resulting in (C/N)ₘᵢc ratios ranging from 5.2 to 30.3 (average = 20.3). The C/N ratios of the soils ranged from 8.6 to 18.1 (average = 12.3). Expressed as percentages of organic C or N, the Cₘᵢc values ranged from 0.24 to 1.8% (average = 1.0%) and the Nₘᵢc values ranged from 0.36 to 1.2% (average = 0.63%). The activities of total (intra- and extracellular) arylsulfatase after chloroform fumigation without toluene treatment; intracellular arylsulfatase (activity of the microbial biomass), i.e., [(total activity) − (extracellular activity)]; and extracellular arylsulfatase (before chloroform fumigation without toluene treatment) were significantly correlated with Cₘᵢc (r = 0.88**, 0.85**, and 0.94***, respectively) and Nₘᵢc (r = 0.81**, 0.83**, and 0.89***, respectively). The total arylsulfatase activity, the activity of the microbial biomass, and the extracellular activity were significantly correlated with organic C (r = 0.88***, 0.90***, and 0.72*, respectively) and total N (r = 0.89***, 0.90***, and 0.77*, respectively). Clay content was also correlated with the activity of total (r = 0.75*) and extracellular arylsulfatase (r = 0.83**). Expressed as percentages of total activity, the arylsulfatase activity of the microbial biomass ranged from 39.6 to 73.1% (average = 57.7%). The remaining activity (26.9–60.4%, average = 42.8%) was extracellular. When toluene was used as a plasmolytic agent in the nonfumigated soils, the arylsulfatase activity resulting from this treatment ranged from 24.6 to 48.1% (average = 40.3%). When expressed per milligram of Cₘᵢc (specific activity), the arylsulfatase activity of the microbial biomass ranged from 65 to 955 (average = 455) µg PN h⁻¹. The total arylsulfatase activity and the activity of the microbial biomass were underestimated, because tests with arylsulfatase purified from two molluscs (Helix pomatia and Patella vulgata) showed that chloroform fumigation decreased the activity by 50 and 23%, respectively.

In our earlier study, rosiglitazone enhanced adipogenesis particularly the brown adipogenesis of iMSC3. In this study, the transcriptomic profiles of iMSC3 derived adipocytes with and without rosiglitazone were analyzed through mRNA sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 1508 genes were differentially expressed between iMSC3 and the derived adipocytes without rosiglitazone treatment. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that rosiglitazone regulates PPAR and PI3K-Akt pathways. The constant rosiglitazone treatment enhanced the expression of Fatty Acid Binding Protein 4 (FABP4) which enriched GO terms such as fatty acid binding, lipid droplet, as well as white and brown fat cell differentiation. Moreover, the constant treatment upregulated several lipid droplets (LDs) associated proteins such as PLIN1. Rosiglitazone also activated the receptor complex PTK2B that has essential roles in beige adipocytes thermogenic program. Several uniquely expressed novel regulators of brown adipogenesis were also expressed in adipocytes derived with rosiglitazone: PRDM16, ZBTB16, HOXA4, and KLF15 in addition to other uniquely expressed genes. CONCLUSIONS: Rosiglitazone regulated several differentially regulated genes and non-coding RNAs that warrant further investigation about their roles in adipogenesis particularly brown adipogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipogenesis 3abone marrow 3abrown adipocytes 3adroplets 3afatty acids 3agenomics 3ahumans 3amodels 3aobesity 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3atelomerase 3atranscriptomics1 aKhan, Amir Ali1 aFayyad, Abeer Maher1 aAbdallah, Sallam Hasan1 aKhattak, Muhammad Nasir Khan0 tBMC genomic data.g2022 Dec., v. 23, no. 1 p.17-17dBioMed CentralwJournal:27685x2730-68447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12863-022-01027-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011900160500002000279520096800299592002801267596007501295650002401370650001301394650002101407650001101428650001301439650002101452650001701473650002001490650001101510700001301521700001401534700001301548700005601561773011501617856007801732852000901810655001201819IND60749482620220217000000.0210903e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074948262DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2021000482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMingda, Hou10aAntioxidant and Immunomodulatory Activities In Vitro of a Neutral Polysaccharide from Ginger (Zingiber Officinale)  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, crude polysaccharides from ginger are obtained by ultrasonic‐assisted enzymatic extraction.

These results show that pGP can be used as a potential antioxidant agent in medicine or functional food.  aPublisher supplied data  aH2017003cNatural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China 3aZingiber officinale 3adialysis 3afunctional foods 3aginger 3amedicine 3amolecular weight 3aphagocytosis 3apolysaccharides 3asugars1 aJun, Gao1 aZiqi, Liu1 aYu, Shan1 aShuyong, Liu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6244-54220 tStärke =.g2021 Sept., v. 73, no. 9-10 p.e2100048-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2021000483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03420naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007900171300001600250500001900266520181900285592002802104650002202132650001602154650001202170650000902182650001002191650001002201650004502211650003302256650001402289650001102303650001302314650001602327650001802343650001402361650003102375650001402406650002202420651001002442653002502452653003302477653002602510700001702536700001402553700001702567700002002584700001502604773016502619856008502784852000902869655001202878IND60682455120221123004639.0200128e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068245512DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(19)62655-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCHANG, Jia-ying12aA new Curvularia lunata variety discovered in Huanghuaihai Region in China  ap. 551-560.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe purpose of this study was to identify the dominant pathogens of Curvularia leaf spot and their pathogenicity variation in Huanghuaihai Region of China in recent years. In 2013 and 2016–2017, the occurrences of Curvularia leaf spots on maize were investigated in fields located in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Anhui provinces, and 292 fungi were isolated from diseased leaves. These fungal isolates were subjected to morphological identification, and 232 isolates were found to have about 70% uncurved conidia and were identified as Curvularia lunata var. Most of the conidia of 2 representative isolates, namely, HNWB-131 and HNWB-185, were oblong with parallel septations and were distinctly different from a reference isolate CX-3. For further determination, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), the large subunit (LSU), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-α) sequences of HNWB-131, HNWB-185, and CX-3 were amplified and sequenced. The results of sequence analysis showed that the 4 gene sequences from the 3 isolates had a similarity of more than 99% to C. lunata. Based on the sequences of ITS and the combined data of the 4 genes, neighbor-joining trees were constructed for phylogenetic analysis. The results indicated that these 3 isolates were clustered together with C. lunata. The expression of Clg2p and ClUrase genes in mycelia and conidia was significantly (P<0.05) higher in CX-3 than in HNWB-131 and HNWB-185. This study found that the dominant pathogen of Curvularia leaf spot was a new variety of C. lunata with morphological variations in Huanghuaihai Region from 2013 to 2017. The pathogenicity of the C. lunata var. was not significantly enhanced, and the expression of Clg2p and ClUrase genes of C. lunata var. was decreased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurvularia lunata 3aagriculture 3aconidia 3acorn 3afungi 3agenes 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3amycelium 3anew variety 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3aChina 0aCurvularia leaf spot 0amorphological identification 0aphylogenetic analysis1 aLIU, Shu-sen1 aShi, Jie,1 aGuo, Zining,1 aZHANG, Hai-jian1 aChen, Jie,0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2020 Feb., v. 19, no. 2 p.551-560dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

The enzyme dihydroxyacetone kinase (DAK) has shown to be involved in DHA detoxification and osmoregulation. Among protozoa of the genus Trypanosoma, T. brucei, which causes sleeping sickness, is highly sensitive to DHA and does not have orthologous genes to DAK. Conversely, T. cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas Disease, has two putative ATP-dependent DAK (TcDAKs) sequences in its genome. Here we show that T. cruzi epimastigote lysates present a DAK specific activity of 27.1 nmol/min/mg of protein and that this form of the parasite is able to grow in the presence of 2 mM DHA. TcDAK gene was cloned and the recombinant enzyme (recTcDAK) was expressed in Escherichia coli. An anti-recTcDAK serum reacted with a protein of the expected molecular mass of 61 kDa in epimastigotes. recTcDAK presented maximal activity using Mg⁺², showing a Km of 6.5 μM for DHA and a K₀.₅ of 124.7 μM for ATP. As it was reported for other DAKs, recTcDAK activity was inhibited by FAD with an IC₅₀ value of 0.33 mM. In conclusion, TcDAK is the first DAK described in trypanosomatids confirming another divergent metabolism between T. brucei and T. cruzi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aEscherichia coli 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3ablood serum 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3aepimastigotes 3aetiological agents 3agenes 3ametabolism 3amolecular weight 3aosmoregulation 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3atoxicity 0aGlycerol 0aDihydroxyacetone 0aFMN cyclase 0aFAD 0aProtozoan1 aGaravaglia, Patricia Andrea1 aTasso, Laura Mónica1 aMaidana, Cristina Graciela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0173-88621 aBautista Cannata, Joaquín Juan1 aGarcía, Gabriela Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6272-64430 tExperimental parasitology.g2021 Dec., v. 231 p.108178-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2021.1081783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007500148245014900223300001600372500001900388520173700407592002802144650002502172650001702197650002502214650002102239650001202260650001302272650001602285650001302301650001902314650001302333650001902346650001402365650001402379650002102393650002002414650001702434650002202451653002102473653002702494653001602521653001802537653001602555700006902571773012002640856008302760852000902843655001202852IND60705613320221122143819.0201223e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070561332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2020.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, Anna Paula Azevedo de1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9258-594710aGreen strategies for active food packagings: A systematic review on active properties of graphene-based nanomaterials and biodegradable polymers  ap. 130-143.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe emergence of microorganisms resistant to antibiotics and oxidation processes are serious challenges faced by the food packaging industry. Since the packaging can be hurdle technology to food protection and preservation, active packagings receive increasing attention due to the possibility of microbial, quality, and safety control of the product packed.This Systematic Review aims to present strategies based on nanocarbon and biodegradables polymers to enhance main properties and adding new functionalities for packaging materials. A refined search on four databases in the last five years retrieved a total of 23 articles. This review focused on antimicrobial and antioxidant activity, target pathogens, and mechanisms.Carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, polylactide, and chitosan were the primary materials found increasing antimicrobial and antioxidant features. This work found bioactive compounds as a secondary approach. Both polymers from biomass and nanocarbons can play a role at antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant mechanisms. The surface area and pristine sp² carbon domains on basal surfaces of graphene oxide contributed with radical stabilizing. The main modes of action proposed for bacterial and fungi control have been membrane disruption and oxidative stress. Although good potential against other pathogens, no work was recovered considering the antiviral activity of nanocomposites. Possibly, one of the significant promising alternatives for preservation of consumer's health is the conventional antimicrobials replacement by bioactive compounds from natural sources associated with nanotechnology, since it proved to favor inhibition of the oxidation and several microbial growths synergistically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aantiviral properties 3abiodegradability 3abiomass 3achitosan 3afood safety 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aindustry 3ananocomposites 3ananotubes 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3apolylactic acid 3asurface area 3asystematic review 0aActive packaging 0aBiodegradable polymers 0aNanocarbons 0aAntimicrobial 0aAntioxidant1 aConte Junior, Carlos Adam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6133-50800 tTrends in food science & technology.g2020 Sept., v. 103 p.130-143dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2020.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010400177520146300281592002801744650001401772650001201786650001301798650001401811650002401825651001201849653001801861653003101879653002301910700001901933700005701952700001902009773009602028856008702124852000902211655001202220IND60756380520221117013625.0211213e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075638052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1155222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMumbi Chabala, Lydia14aThe effect of water deficit and livestock stocking density on soil organic carbon stocks in Namibia  aLivestock integrated land use systems are considered as viable options for enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in a changing climate. This study assessed the influence of water deficit and livestock stocking density on soil carbon stocks. A total of 101 matching data were extracted from map layers of water deficit and livestock stocking density for C storage in Arenosols of Omusati and Otjozondjupa regions of Namibia. Maps for water deficit and livestock stocking density were obtained from national databases. The SOC data were arranged into four treatment combinations represented by two levels of water deficit and two levels of livestock stocking density. Linear mixed models (LMM) were then used to evaluate differences in SOC stocks in response to livestock stocking density and water deficit. Results showed that there was a significant interaction (p = 0.013) between the effects of livestock stocking density and water deficit on C-stocks. In conditions where the water deficit was small, the SOC stock was larger under more intensive grazing. Whilst in conditions where water deficit was large, the SOC stock was larger under less intensive grazing. Furthermore, the difference between SOC stock at large and small water deficits was larger under more intensive grazing. This shows that the impacts of a changing climate, and changes in the intensity of grazing must be considered together to predict effects on the SOC stock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArenosols 3aclimate 3aland use 3alivestock 3asoil organic carbon 3aNamibia 0aWater deficit 0aLivestock stocking density 0aSoil carbon stocks1 aAngombe, Simon1 aAmelung, Wulf1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4920-46671 aMurray Lark, R0 tGeoderma.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 407 p.115522-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1155223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012500173300001400298520166700312592002801979650002702007650001102034650002402045650001202069650001502081650002202096650001202118650001502130650003402145650001902179650002902198650001002227650001202237650000902249651001202258653002902270653004002299653002502339700002102364700001702385773011502402856008402517852000902601655001202610IND60122491720221118063516.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012249172DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2013.8569352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMynttinen, Sinikka10aNon-industrial private forest owners' willingness to supply forest-based energy wood in the South Savo region in Finland  ap. 41-50.  aThe consumption of energy wood in Finland has increased dramatically since the early 2000s, and the region of South Savo is a bellwether for its usage across the country. This increase is partly due to the national policy of sustainable energy, region's wealth of forests but is also dependent on non-industrial private forest owners (NIPF) deciding to sell energy wood. In this study, a survey with a structured questionnaire was conducted among the NIPFs in the region of South Savo to enlarge the understanding of their willingness to sell energy wood in the future and adopt new approaches to forestry that involves energy wood thinning as well as their current production of energy wood. Moreover, the factors influencing forest owner's motivations relating to energy wood thinning as well as information needs were analysed with multivariate techniques. The results show that almost half of the forest owners in the South Savo region had not sold energy wood. However, forest owners within the region generally had positive attitudes towards selling small-sized energy wood and forestry methods that involve energy wood thinning. Moreover, forest owners' willingness to sell different types of energy wood varied, depending on their background. The study suggests that the increase in supply of energy wood presumes both intensified extension services for forest owners and markets that are better organised than at the moment. The results may also prove beneficial in informing policy-makers regarding which specific target group(s) to focus on when promoting energy wood sales among NIPFs and which aspects of energy wood harvesting and sales to promote.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aenergy 3aextension education 3aforests 3aharvesting 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amotivation 3anonindustrial private forests 3aquestionnaires 3arenewable energy sources 3asales 3asurveys 3awood 3aFinland 0aforest-based energy wood 0anon-industrial private forest owner 0aenergy wood thinning1 aKarttunen, Kalle1 aRanta, Tapio0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 29, no. 1 p.41-50dTaylor & Francisx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2013.8569353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024003500130040001800165100001900183245008900202300001400291520088600305592002801191650001401219650001301233650001001246650001001256650002301266650000901289650001601298700002401314700001701338700001901355700002201374773011401396856008201510852000901592655001201601IND60624492320221119065421.0181203e19820101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062449232DNAL7 a10.1258/0023677827809087242doi4 a0023-6772(19820101)16:1L.59;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoopman, J.

The aim of this study was to assess the dietary iron intakes of adolescent females using dietary diversity as a proxy in relation to iron status. Purposive sampling procedure was used to select 120 foods and nutrition female students from 6 rural government schools in Ondo West Local Government of Southwestern Nigeria, which was predominantly of Yoruba ethnic group. The students were screened for serum ferritin concentration of less than 12.0 µg/L with normal hemoglobin concentration to determine iron deficiency status. A standardized Food and Agriculture Organization 24-hour diet recall questionnaire was adapted, tested, and used to calculate dietary diversity score. Analyses were done using SPSS version 16. The result indicated that the mean age was 14 ± 1.45 years, 57 (47.5%) adolescent females were iron deficient, and 63 (52.5%) non–iron deficient. Girls in the 16 to 19 years range were significantly more likely to be iron deficient than other groups (odds ratio = 2.81, 95% confidence interval = 1.12-6.54). Mean Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) was 2.6 ± 1.058, which showed a significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .037). Heme iron source (P = .032) was consumed lesser than the non-heme iron (P = .002) by iron-deficient girls. Girls with low DDS were at significantly higher risk (odds ratio = 1.79, 95% confidence interval = 0.50-2.17, P = .006) compared with the high and moderate DDS groups. In conclusion, there was a low intake of dietary iron among adolescent girls. Nutrition education should be intensified among female adolescents to improve their nutritional knowledge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aadolescents 3ablood serum 3aconfidence interval 3adiet recall 3afemales 3aferritin 3afoods 3agirls 3aheme iron 3ahemoglobin 3airon deficiency anemia 3alocal government 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrition education 3anutrition knowledge 3aodds ratio 3apublic health 3aquestionnaires 3aschools 3astudents 3aNigeria 0adietary diversity 0airon intake 0aadolescents 0afemales 0airon deficiency0 tInfant, child & adolescent nutrition.g, v. 5, no. 2 p.85-91dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000000085x1941-40727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/19414064134756613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03390naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012100165300001800286520175200304592002802056596006402084650001802148650002502166650002602191650002502217650001902242650001702261650001502278650002002293650001302313650001902326650002702345650001402372650000902386650001402395651001002409700001802419700002402437700001502461700002202476700003002498700001402528700002202542700001802564700006102582773013802643856008202781852000902863655001202872IND60748201820221116213947.0210821e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074820182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-021-01592-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuarez, Rudy10aWhole-Genome sequencing and comparative genomics of Mycobacterium spp. from farmed Atlantic and coho salmon in Chile  ap. 1323-1336.  aSeveral members of the Mycobacterium genus cause invasive infections in humans and animals. According to a recent phylogenetic analysis, some strains of Mycobacterium salmoniphilum (Msal), which are the main culprit in bacterial outbreaks in freshwater fish aquaculture, have been assigned to a separate branch containing Mycobacterium franklinii (Mfra), another species that causes infections in humans. However, this genus is little studied in an aquaculture context. Here, we isolated four Mycobacterium spp. strains from freshwater cultures of Atlantic and coho salmon in Chile and performed whole-genome sequencing for deep genomic characterization. In addition, we described the gross pathology and histopathology of the outbreaks. Several bioinformatic analyses were performed using the genomes of these four Mycobacterium isolates in conjunction with those of Msal strains, four Msal-like strains, and one Mfra strains, plus 17 other publicly available Mycobacterium genomes. We found that three isolates are clustered into the Msal branch, whereas one isolate clustered with the Mfra/Msal-like strains. We further evaluated the presence of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes and observed that the four isolates were closely related to the Msal and Msal-like taxa and carried several antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes that are similar to those of other pathogenic members of the Mycobacterium clade. Altogether, our characterization Msal and Msal-like presented here shed new light on the basis of mycobacteriosis provides quantitative evidence that Mycobacterium strains are a potential risk for aquaculture asetiological agents of emerging diseases, and highlight their biological scopes in the aquaculture industry.  aPublisher supplied data  aCIBA#2019-3cCentro de Investigaciones Biologicas Aplicadas 3aMycobacterium 3aOncorhynchus kisutch 3aantibiotic resistance 3aaquaculture industry 3abioinformatics 3afish culture 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3agenomics 3ahistopathology 3amycobacterial diseases 3aphylogeny 3arisk 3avirulence 3aChile1 aKusch, Karina1 aMiranda, Claudio D.1 aLi, Tianlu1 aCampanini, Javier1 aBehra, Phani Rama Krishna1 aAro, Luis1 aMartinez, Alexis,1 aGodoy, Marcos1 aMedina, Daniel A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8183-00430 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2021 Sept., v. 114, no. 9 p.1323-1336dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl28287x0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-021-01592-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012500167520150300292592002801795650001501823650002701838650001701865650001501882650001501897650001901912650004001931650002101971650002101992650001202013650001902025653002002044653001602064653002202080653001302102700001502115700001702130700002002147773009602167856008702263852000902350655001202359IND60756380720221117013530.0211227e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075638072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1155612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Chao10aPhotosynthesis regulates the diel hysteresis pattern between soil respiration and soil temperature in a steppe grassland  aSoil respiration is an important ecosystem process in drylands and is closely related to soil temperature but often occurs out of phase with soil temperature. As ecosystem engineers in dryland ecosystems, biological soil crusts (biocrusts) greatly affect soil carbon cycle processes, such as soil respiration. However, the diel hysteresis pattern between soil respiration and soil temperature at biocrusted microsites and its influencing factors are not well understood. Here, we performed continuous field measurements of in situ soil respiration to evaluate the effect of biocrusts on the diurnal cycles of soil respiration and the influencing factors of the diel hysteresis pattern between soil respiration and soil temperature at biocrusted microsites. Over daily cycles, soil respiration peaked earlier than soil temperature, and their relationship exhibited similar clockwise hysteresis loops at both bare and biocrusted microsites. Unexpectedly, the effect of biocrusts on the diel hysteresis pattern between soil respiration and soil temperature was negligible. However, photosynthesis may be the key driver regulating the diel hysteresis pattern between soil respiration and soil temperature, because little or even no hysteresis was observed between soil respiration and photosynthetically active radiation. Our results highlight the important role of photosynthate transportation in plants or biocrusts in diel hysteresis pattern regulation between soil respiration and soil temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3abiological soil crusts 3acarbon cycle 3aecosystems 3ahysteresis 3aphotosynthesis 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3asteppes 3atransportation 0aSoil CO2 efflux 0aTemperature 0aDiurnal variation 0aDrylands1 aChen, Ning1 aQiao, Linjie1 aZhao, Changming0 tGeoderma.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 408 p.115561-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1155613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007600168300001600244520185700260592002802117650001102145650001402156650001902170650001802189650002102207650001202228650001402240650001802254650001602272650001202288650002702300650001502327650002502342650001502367650001102382650001102393650001102404650001302415650002502428650001502453650001602468651002302484651002502507651002902532653001602561653002102577653002302598653001202621653002302633653002702656700001902683773012202702856008102824852000902905655001202914IND60604597820221118105445.0180717e20150526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060459782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2015.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŁuczaj, Łukasz12aA hundred years of change in wild vegetable use in southern Herzegovina  ap. 297-304.  aWild vegetable mixes used in southern Europe are interesting from the pharmacological point of view, as they contain many species which have considerable nutritional and medicinal value, but some are potentially toxic to humans. Although many ethnobotanical studies document the rich tradition of using wild vegetables at the turn of the 20th and 21st century in the Mediterranean region, there is a dearth of older historical studies which could help us to assess the extent of Traditional Knowledge loss.The aim of this study was to document the use of wild foods in an area of southern Herzegovina (in Bosnia–Herzegovina) and to compare it with a list of 27 taxa of wild green vegetables used there, compiled in 1913 by Vejsil Ćurčić. We carried out 49 interviews in the same area to estimate the current use and knowledge of wild foods.Eighty-two species of wild food and herbal tea plants were recorded in the study. This includes 44 species whose wild leaves are used as salads or cooked side dishes, 17 species with edible fruits and 24 species whose leaves, shoots or flowers are used for everyday herbal teas. On average, 14.2 species (median=16.5) were listed per interview, including 9.0 species of wild vegetables. Out of 27 plant names mentioned 100 years ago – five remain unidentified. Out of the 22 species or species groups, which were identified, 18 are still used as wild vegetables (including five species used very rarely and known by very few people or only by one person).Nowadays, the most commonly used wild greens are: Dioscorea communis, Sonchus spp., Allium spp., Papaver rhoeas, Rumex pulcher, Silene latifolia, and Taraxacum spp.Although we observed some changes in the names and uses of plants compared to the list from a hundred years ago, around three quarters of the taxa are still used to some extent nowadays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium 3aDioscorea 3aPapaver rhoeas 3aRumex pulcher 3aSilene latifolia 3aSonchus 3aTaraxacum 3aedible fruits 3aethnobotany 3aflowers 3agreen leafy vegetables 3aherbal tea 3aindigenous knowledge 3ainterviews 3aleaves 3asalads 3ashoots 3atoxicity 3atraditional medicine 3awild foods 3awild plants 3aBosnia-Herzegovina 3aMediterranean region 3aSouthern European region 0aEthnobotany 0aWild food plants 0aWild edible plants 0aBalkans 0aMediterranean diet 0aHistorical ethnobotany1 aDolina, Katija0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2015 May 26, v. 166 p.297-304dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2015.02.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245015500165300001400320520149500334592002801829650001201857650001901869650001101888650001701899650001501916650001301931650004301944650001501987650001502002651001002017653001802027653002802045653001502073653000902088653001502097653001502112700001602127700002702143700001402170773011502184856008402299852000902383655001202392IND60122491920221118063500.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012249192DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2013.8619222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Zhiwei10aScale effects of vegetation and topography on burn severity under prevailing fire weather conditions in boreal forest landscapes of Northeastern China  ap. 60-70.  aUnderstanding the controlling factors of burn severity requires consideration of the scale at which these factors work. This investigation explored how well topography and vegetation factors can explain variation of burn severity in a boreal forest landscape of northern China under prevailing fire weather conditions. Eight grain sizes were examined that ranged from 30 to 2500 m. A burn severity map was derived from calculating the difference between pre- and post-fire Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of two Landsat Thematic Mapper images. Results indicate that (1) burn severity in the boreal forest landscape of northern China was mainly controlled by vegetation at grain sizes smaller than 500 m. At grain sizes larger than 1000 m, topography accounted for more variation in burn severity; (2) the relative importance of topography factors was stable with increasing grain sizes and generally ranked in order of aspect, slope, and elevation; (3) stand age appeared to be more important where canopy cover and understory cover substantially fluctuated with increasing grain sizes; and (4) the linear relationships between burn severity and specific factors of topography and vegetation decreased with increasing grain sizes. Our study can help managers to design fire management plans according to vegetation characteristics that are found important in controlling burn severity and prioritize management locations based on the relative importance of vegetation and topography.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aboreal forests 3acanopy 3afire weather 3alandscapes 3amanagers 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3atopography 3aunderstory 3aChina 0aburn severity 0aboreal forest landscape 0agrain size 0aNDVI 0atopography 0avegetation1 aHe, Hong S.1 aBobryk, Christopher W.1 aLiang, Yu0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 29, no. 1 p.60-70dTaylor & Francisx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2013.8619223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245016000171300001600331520106200347592002801409650000801437650001801445650002001463650002801483650001201511650001701523650001601540650002501556650001801581650002201599653003701621653001801658653001901676653002301695653001901718700002101737700002101758700002201779700001801801700002301819700002001842700001901862700002101881773010201902856008702004852000902091655001202100IND60112482020221116142934.0190408e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011248202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhmori, Kiyomi12aA DNA extraction and purification method using an ion-exchange resin type kit for the detection of genetically modified papaya in processed papaya products  ap. 728-735.  aA method for the extraction and purification of genomic DNA from processed papaya products is essential for the detection of approved genetically modified (GM) papaya, according to GM labeling regulations, and unapproved GM papaya, to restrict the import or sale of products containing it. Here, we investigated methods for the extraction of DNA from processed papaya products, including dried papaya, canned papaya and papaya jam. The extraction of DNA from dried papaya and canned papaya required a pre-digestion step, using RNase, cellulase and proteinase K. In the case of papaya jam, α-amylase was found to be indispensable to obtain DNA with high yield and purity. The DNA yield was considerably higher when an ion-exchange resin type kit (IER-100G) was used, compared with other five methods (IER-20G, QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit, DNeasy Plant Maxi Kit, GM Quicker 3 Kit and Wizard Cleanup Resin System). We developed a suitable method for the extraction and purification of DNA from processed papaya products, which could be used to detect GM papaya.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalpha-amylase 3aanalytical kits 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aimports 3aion exchange 3apeptidase K 3apurification methods 3aribonucleases 3atransgenic plants 0aGenetically modified (GM) papaya 0aReal-time PCR 0aDNA extraction 0aIon-exchange resin 0aProcessed food1 aNakamura, Kosuke1 aKasahara, Masaki1 aTakabatake, Reona1 aKitta, Kazumi1 aFujimaki, Teruhisa1 aKondo, Kazunari1 aTeshima, Reiko1 aAkiyama, Hiroshi0 tFood control.g2013 Aug., v. 32, no. 2 p.728-735dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015100174520128600325592002801611650001401639650002001653650001501673650002401688650002201712650001401734650001501748650002401763650002401787650002701811650002901838650002301867650001901890650001401909650002201923650001801945650001401963651001101977653002301988653002602011653001502037653001202052653001502064700002602079700002002105700002502125700001902150700002402169700001802193700002602211773011602237856008502353852000902438655001202447IND60756599120221121012128.0211219e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075659912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1018662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMumcuoglu, Kosta Y.10aPathogens in ticks collected in Israel: I.

Birds are identified as signs, messengers, augurs, teachers, and beings that can affect one's life and livelihood. The significations of birds vary across cultures and shift over time, but not in entirely arbitrary ways. In this review of published literature from the Human Relations Area Files and elsewhere on birds as signs, we extracted details about 498 kinds of birds in 123 ethnolinguistic groups and found that, worldwide, owls, crows, cuckoos, woodpeckers, herons, eagles, nightjars, and chickens were the most reported as sign-bearers. Ninety-two percent of signifying birds were categorized as of Least Concern in terms of conservation priority. Half of all signs were communicated by vocalizations and a quarter by bird behavior. Contrary to our expectations, when analyzed by order, passerines were not the most common sign-vehicles (23%); rather, near-passerines made up 34%, and 23% were non-passerines, both of the latter over-represented in comparison to number of species worldwide. Predictive signs can be understood as keys to human cognitive processes for remembering details of past experience and predicting/hypothesizing the future. The honed ecological awareness acquired by paying attention to birds translates more generally to sophisticated connective worldviews that extend our perceptive awareness in space and time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArdeidae 3aCuculidae 3aPasseriformes 3aanthropology 3achickens 3acognition 3acrows 3aeagles 3ahumans 3ainterpersonal relationships 3alivelihood 3aprediction 3aspace and time 3ateachers 3avocalization 3awoodpeckers 0aecosemiotics 0aecological indicators 0abiocultural salience 0aethno-ornithology 0acrosscultural ethnobiology1 aPark, Karen E.0 tJournal of ethnobiology.g2018 Dec. 21, v. 38, no. 4 p.533-549dSociety of EthnobiologywJournal:19742x2162-44967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2993/0278-0771-38.4.5333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245005900183300001800242500001500260520162600275592002801901650002701929650001701956650000901973650001101982650002601993650000902019650000902028650001202037650002502049650001602074650003002090650001202120650001302132650000902145650003502154650002502189650001302214650001102227650001502238650002902253650002202282650002502304650003802329650002102367650003002388651001202418651001302430651001202443651001202455651001402467651001202481700001902493700002302512700002402535700001902559700002002578700002102598700002102619773013502640856004802775852000902823655001202832IND50072766320221117200632.0140208e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007276632DNAL7 a240819202pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-013-2091-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQarri, Flora10aMulti-elements atmospheric deposition study in Albania  ap. 2506-2518.  a2019-12-06  aFor the first time, the moss biomonitoring technique and inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometric (ICP-AES) analytical technique were applied to study multi-element atmospheric deposition in Albania. Moss samples (Hypnum cupressiforme) were collected during the summer of 2011 and September–October 2010 from 62 sites, evenly distributed over the country. Sampling was performed in accordance with the LRTAP Convention–ICP Vegetation protocol and sampling strategy of the European Programme on Biomonitoring of Heavy Metal Atmospheric Deposition. ICP-AES analysis made it possible to determine concentrations of 19 elements including key toxic metals such as Pb, Cd, As, and Cu. Cluster and factor analysis with varimax rotation was applied to distinguish elements mainly of anthropogenic origin from those predominantly originating from natural sources. Geographical distribution maps of the elements over the sampled territory were constructed using GIS technology. The median values of the elements in moss samples of Albania were high for Al, Cr, Ni, Fe, and V and low for Cd, Cu, and Zn compared to other European countries, but generally were of a similar level as some of the neighboring countries such as Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, and Romania. This study was conducted in the framework of ICP Vegetation in order to provide a reliable assessment of air quality throughout Albania and to produce information needed for better identification of contamination sources and improving the potential for assessing environmental and health risks in Albania, associated with toxic metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric deposition 3aheavy metals 3alead 3asummer 3amosses and liverworts 3arisk 3airon 3acadmium 3aHypnum cupressiforme 3aair quality 3ageographical distribution 3aarsenic 3achromium 3azinc 3ageographic information systems 3aenvironmental health 3aaluminum 3anickel 3avegetation 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aArsenicxanalysis 2aBryopsidaxchemistry 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aMetalsxanalysis 2aSpectrophotometry, Atomic 3aCroatia 3aBulgaria 3aRomania 3aAlbania 0aMacedonia 0aAlbania1 aLazo, Pranvera1 aStafilov, Trajče,1 aFrontasyeva, Marina1 aHarmens, Harry1 aBekteshi, Lirim1 aBaceva, Katerina1 aGoryainova, Zoya0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Feb., v. 21, no. 4 p.2506-2518dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-2091-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245009500199300001800294520113900312592002801451650001501479650001601494650002401510650001601534650001101550650001601561650001701577650001601594650001901610650001301629650001101642650001301653650001901666650001601685700001601701700010201717700001601819700001401835700001401849700001801863773014201881856007402023852000902097655001202106IND60642757220221117160526.0190508e20170628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064275722DNAL7 a10.1039/c7tb00875a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuThese authors contributed equally to this work., Dan10aSe & N co-doped carbon dots for high-performance fluorescence imaging agent of angiography  ap. 4988-4992.  aBoth long wavelength excitation and emission are highly desired for fluorescent carbon dots in bio-related applications. According to semiconductor theory, heteroatom doping is an effective way to tune the band gap of a semiconductor. In this work, we developed an exceedingly simple and mild one-pot method to synthesize selenium and nitrogen co-doped carbon dots (Se&N-CDs) by using low cost citric acid, ethane diamine and selenium powder as the starting materials. After doping the Se element into N-CDs, the absorption of Se&N-CDs was expanded from UV to the visible light region (∼497 nm). More important is that the Se&N-CDs show a strong green light emission with a high quantum yield of ∼52%, attributed to the new Se-state introduced in the Se&N-CDs due to the low electronegativity of Se. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate that Se&N-CDs have an excellent performance as a dye for fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA). After injection, a clear vascular image in the retina and detailed images of the capillary bed were exhibited in the FFA image. This will provide a great advantage for bio-imaging and diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aangiography 3acarbon quantum dots 3acitric acid 3aethane 3afluorescein 3afluorescence 3agreen light 3aimage analysis 3anitrogen 3aretina 3aselenium 3asemiconductors 3awavelengths1 aMiao, Xiang1 aWangCurrent address: School of Physics, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, P.

However, how an RA gradient distribution influences cardiac development remains obscure due to the lack of appropriate experimental apparatus. To address this issue, a polymeric micelle system with covalently attached RA was engineered to deliver gradient quantities of RA upon photo-irradiation. A photo-degradable polymeric nanoparticle (NP) composed of an amphiphilic methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone)-co-poly(azido-ε-caprolactone-g-ortho nitrobenzyl retinoic ester) copolymer was synthesized, and hanging RA was covalently attached through a photo-sensitive o-nitrobenzyl (ONB) linker. The ONB linker was efficiently cleaved when exposed to a light (365 nm)-gradient, and the consequent gradient release of RA from the micelles was demonstrated. The efficacy of the photo-gradient-mediated RA release was validated across different concentrations of polymer micelles over varied irradiation periods. It was confirmed that polymer micelles demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity when exposed to mouse embryoid bodies (EBs).

The control structure combines in a synchronous way modeling and simulation environments with efficient system identification and dynamic optimization tools and methods. Process simulation provides a complete dynamic description of the current status of the operation, including the evolution of temperature and pressure in the retort unit as well as temporal and spatial distribution of temperature and quality or safety parameters within the product. Such virtual representation will be regularly confronted with plant measurements to quantify the degree of discrepancy (uncertainty) between real plant and models and react accordingly when such discrepancy becomes unacceptable by re-estimating plant parameters, either during the cycle or from batch to batch. The virtual plant will be also accessed by the regulatory system as well as the dynamic optimization module. In the first instance to estimate unmeasured states related with the product status (e.g. temperature in the product or lethality) under feed-back control. In the second, to continuously recompute optimal cycle profiles so to respond to unexpected disturbances or deviations from the prescribed safety constraints while maximizing quality attributes. Experimental evidence of the complete control system performance will be given on the operation of a pilot plant prototype.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3afoods 3aquality control 3asimulation models 3atemperature 3auncertainty 0aThermal sterilization 0aReal time optimization 0aOn-line control 0aParameter identification 0aOptimal quality control 0aFood safety control1 aArias-Méndez, Ana1 aBalsa-Canto, Eva1 aGarcía, Míriam R.1 aMolina, Juan I.1 aVilas, Carlos1 aVillafín, Marcos0 tFood control.g2013 Aug., v. 32, no. 2 p.392-403dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03553naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245011000172300001600282520212500298592002802423650002202451650001502473650001502488650001202503650001102515650001102526650001502537650001602552650001502568650001902583653002802602653002402630653002202654653001802676653003202694700001602726700001502742700001602757700001302773700001702786700005002803773013302853856008802986852000903074655001203083IND60705614220221122122729.0200824e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070561422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Juepeng10aCross-regional oil palm tree counting and detection via a multi-level attention domain adaptation network  ap. 154-177.  aProviding an accurate evaluation of palm tree plantation in a large region can bring meaningful impacts in both economic and ecological aspects. However, the enormous spatial scale and the variety of geological features across regions has made it a grand challenge with limited solutions based on manual human monitoring efforts. Although deep learning based algorithms have demonstrated potential in forming an automated approach in recent years, the labelling efforts needed for covering different features in different regions largely constrain its effectiveness in large-scale problems. In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptive oil palm tree detection method, i.e., a Multi-level Attention Domain Adaptation Network (MADAN) to reap cross-regional oil palm tree counting and detection. MADAN consists of 4 procedures: First, we adopted a batch-instance normalization network (BIN) based feature extractor for improving the generalization ability of the model, integrating batch normalization and instance normalization. Second, we embedded a multi-level attention mechanism (MLA) into our architecture for enhancing the transferability, including a feature level attention and an entropy level attention. Then we designed a minimum entropy regularization (MER) to increase the confidence of the classifier predictions through assigning the entropy level attention value to the entropy penalty. Finally, we employed a sliding window-based prediction and an IOU based post-processing approach to attain the final detection results. We conducted comprehensive ablation experiments using three different satellite images of large-scale oil palm plantation area with six transfer tasks. MADAN improves the detection accuracy by 14.98% in terms of average F1-score compared with the Baseline method (without DA), and performs 3.55–14.49% better than existing domain adaptation methods. Experimental results demonstrate the great potential of our MADAN for large-scale and cross-regional oil palm tree counting and detection, guaranteeing a high detection accuracy as well as saving the manual annotation efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aalgorithms 3aautomation 3aentropy 3ahumans 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aplantations 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 0aOil palm tree detection 0aAttention mechanism 0aDomain adaptation 0aDeep learning 0aAdversarial neural networks1 aFu, Haohuan1 aLi, Weijia1 aWu, Wenzhao1 aZhao, Yi1 aDong, Runmin1 aYu, Le1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3115-20420 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2020 Sept., v. 167 p.154-177dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12409x0924-27167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015500169300001800324520126500342592002801607596008801635596006701723650002901790650002701819650001201846650001501858650001201873650001801885650002301903650004201926650001201968650001901980650001201999650001302011650001102024700001802035700002102053700002002074700006302094773013802157856008202295852000902377655001202386IND60748202620221116215521.0210821e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074820262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-021-01607-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDzanaeva, Ljubov14aThe impact of transcription factors Znf1, Sip4, Adr1, Tup1, and Hap4 on xylose alcoholic fermentation in the engineered yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 1373-1385.  aLignocellulosic biomass is an attractive sustainable platform for fuel ethanol production. Xylose is a second after glucose most abounded sugar in lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Effective conversion of xylose to ethanol is one of key prerequisite for the development of an efficient conversion of biomass to ethanol. Engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains are able to xylose fermentation. However, the yield and productivities of xylose fermentation remains lower in comparison with glucose fermentation. In this work, we studied impact of transcription factors Znf1, Sip4, Adr1, Tup1, and Hap4 on xylose catabolism. We have isolated znf1Δ, adr1Δ, tup1Δ and hap4Δ mutants, and strains overexpressing SIP4, ADR1 and HAP4 genes on the background of xylose-fermenting strain of S. cerevisiae aiming to explore involvement of these transcription factors in regulation of xylose growth and fermentation. It was shown that hap4Δ reveal 1.8-fold increase of ethanol production from xylose as compared to that of parental strain. The hap4Δ mutant accumulates 10.38 g l⁻¹ of ethanol with an overall ethanol yield reaching 0.41 g g⁻¹ of consumed xylose. While the other constructed strains revealed a decrease in ethanol production from this pentose.  aPublisher supplied data  aUMO-2016/21/B/NZ1/00280 and DEC-2020/37/B/NZ1/02232cPolish National Science Center  aGrants 2-21 and 17-21cNational Academy of Sciences of Ukraine 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalcoholic fermentation 3abiomass 3acatabolism 3aethanol 3aethanol fuels 3aethanol production 3agenetically engineered microorganisms 3aglucose 3alignocellulose 3amutants 3apentoses 3axylose1 aKruk, Barbara1 aRuchala, Justyna1 aSibirny, Andriy1 aDmytruk, Kostyantyn1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3661-89130 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2021 Sept., v. 114, no. 9 p.1373-1385dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl28287x0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-021-01607-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01824naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010300169300001600272520093300288592002801221650001501249650001201264650001101276651001901287700002001306773012801326856008301454852000901537655001201546IND60765312520220422000000.0220422e20111202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076531252DNAL7 a10.17221/57/2010-agricecon2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKřístková, Z.10aModelling direct payments to agriculture in a CGE Framework &ndash; analysis of the Czech Republic  ap. 517-528.  aThe paper deals with modelling of the direct payments subsidies to agriculture and their impact on the economy of the Czech Republic. With the use of the general equilibrium model, scenarios concerning an increase of subsidies reaching 100% of the national envelope and a complete removal of both SAPS and Top-Up payments are applied. The results show that if the full amount of subsidies is granted, the value added in agriculture and the connected sectors is stimulated, with a positive effect on the total GDP. However, if the direct payments are completely removed, negative effects on employment can be expected, suggesting that the direct payments play a positive role in the economy. The paper further points out that the effects of direct payments on the incomes of farmer households are limited, suggesting that the farmers&rsquo; living standard should be supported by other policy instruments than the direct payments  aPublisher supplied data 3aemployment 3afarmers 3amodels 3aCzech Republic1 aHabrychová, A.0 tZemědělská ekonomika.g, v. 57, no. 11 p.517-528dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:22848x0139-570X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/57/2010-agricecon3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010200175300001600277520117000293592002801463650001701491650001901508650001401527650001101541650001301552650002501565650001301590651001101603653001801614653002801632653002401660653001901684700002201703700002201725773011801747856008401865852000901949655001201958IND60122492820221119043300.0150325e20140217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012249282DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2014.8815432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTikkanen, Olli-Pekka10aRecovery of boreal forest structures near abandoned villages in Western White Sea Karelia, Russia  ap. 152-161.  aRegeneration of natural forest structures and dead wood has a key role in the long-term maintenance of biodiversity in most parts of the boreal zone. In order to obtain benchmarks for practical dead wood management rapidly, we utilised unintended historical experiments in land use by studying the recovery of forests surrounding abandoned villages along 2.5-km transects in NW Russia. The signs of past human forest use declined as a function of distance from villages. We found that the closest forests were 130 yr old or younger and contained very few elements typical of natural forests. Forests at a distance of between 1 and 1.5 km were older than 150 yr but showed marks of selective cuttings and had a less complete continuum of dead wood than forests that were 2–2.5 km from the villages. The most remote stands, which were generally older than 200 yr, predominantly had no signs of past forest use and had the most diverse dead wood composition. Our study shows that full recovery of the dead wood continuum in middle boreal forests is a slow process and also that less intensive past forest use can have a significant effect on the dead wood continuum.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aboreal forests 3adead wood 3ahumans 3aland use 3anatural regeneration 3avillages 3aRussia 0aafforestation 0abiodiversity management 0adead wood continuum 0aforest history1 aRuokolainen, Anna1 aHeikkilä, Raimo,0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2014 Feb. 17, v. 29, no. 2 p.152-161dTaylor & Francisx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2014.8815433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04084naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245008800168300001600256520217700272592002802449650002002477650001502497650002802512650002202540650002002562650002302582650002002605650001102625650002402636650002302660650001502683650001602698650002102714651001202735651001002747653002602757653001902783653003602802653001502838653003202853653002902885700005702914700003102971700003003002700006003032700001803092700002403110700001903134700006003153773020803213856008803421852000903509655001203518IND60705614420221122122717.0200824e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070561442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoco, Joe,10aGaussian processes retrieval of LAI from Sentinel-2 top-of-atmosphere radiance data  ap. 289-304.  aRetrieval of vegetation properties from satellite and airborne optical data usually takes place after atmospheric correction, yet it is also possible to develop retrieval algorithms directly from top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance data. One of the key vegetation variables that can be retrieved from at-sensor TOA radiance data is leaf area index (LAI) if algorithms account for variability in atmosphere. We demonstrate the feasibility of LAI retrieval from Sentinel-2 (S2) TOA radiance data (L1C product) in a hybrid machine learning framework. To achieve this, the coupled leaf-canopy-atmosphere radiative transfer models PROSAIL-6SV were used to simulate a look-up table (LUT) of TOA radiance data and associated input variables. This LUT was then used to train the Bayesian machine learning algorithms Gaussian processes regression (GPR) and variational heteroscedastic GPR (VHGPR). PROSAIL simulations were also used to train GPR and VHGPR models for LAI retrieval from S2 images at bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) level (L2A product) for comparison purposes. The BOA and TOA LAI products were consistently validated against a field dataset with GPR (R2 of 0.78) and with VHGPR (R2 of 0.80) and for both cases a slightly lower RMSE for the TOA LAI product (about 10% reduction). Because of delivering superior accuracies and lower uncertainties, the VHGPR models were further applied for LAI mapping using S2 acquisitions over the agricultural sites Marchfeld (Austria) and Barrax (Spain). The models led to consistent LAI maps at BOA and TOA scale. The LAI maps were also compared against LAI maps as generated by the SNAP toolbox, which is based on a neural network (NN). Maps were again consistent, however the SNAP NN model tends to overestimate over dense vegetation cover. Overall, this study demonstrated that hybrid LAI retrieval algorithms can be developed from TOA radiance data given a cloud-free sky, thus without the need of atmospheric correction. To the benefit of the community, the development of such hybrid models for the retrieval vegetation properties from BOA or TOA images has been streamlined in the freely downloadable ALG-ARTMO software framework.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3aheteroskedasticity 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3anormal distribution 3aradiative transfer 3asatellites 3auncertainty 3avegetation cover 3aAustria 3aSpain 0aBiophysical variables 0aLAI estimation 0aTop-of-atmosphere radiance data 0aSentinel-2 0aGaussian process regression 0aRadiative transfer model1 aVicent, Jorge1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4018-94211 aRivera-Caicedo, Juan Pablo1 aMorcillo-Pallarés, Pablo1 aVuolo, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4823-17001 aSabater, Neus1 aCamps-Valls, Gustau1 aMoreno, José,1 aVerrelst, Jochem1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6313-20810 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2020 Sept., v. 167 p.289-304dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Bacterial cells were Gram-stain-negative, yellow-colored, strictly aerobic, rod-shaped, catalase- and oxidase-positive, non-motile, and chemoorganoheterotrophic. The novel isolate grew at NaCl concentrations of 0.5–7%, pH 6.5–9.0, and 15–37 °C. A phylogenetic study on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain DJ-13ᵀ belongs to the family Flavobacteriaceae and that it shared the greatest sequence similarity (95.9%) with Croceivirga lutea CSW06ᵀ. Strain DJ-13ᵀ comprised iso-C17:0 3-OH, iso-C15:0, and iso-C15:1 G as the main (> 10%) cellular fatty acids. Menaquinone-6 (MK-6) was the only respiratory quinone. The assembled draft genome size of strain DJ-13ᵀ was 3.71 Mbp with G + C content of 38.7 mol%. The average nucleotide identity (ANI), digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH), and average amino acid identity (AAI) values of DJ-13ᵀ and the species of the genus Croceivirga were found to be 74.9–75.5%, 13.4–14.7%, and 68.2–72.4%, respectively. Strain DJ-13ᵀ contained phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified aminolipids, and five unidentified lipids as polar lipids. From the polyphasic taxonomic results presented, the strain is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Croceivirga for which the name Croceivirga thetidis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of C. thetidis sp. nov. is DJ-13ᵀ (= KCTC 72790ᵀ = NBRC 114252ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcropora 3aFlavobacterium 3aRyukyu Archipelago 3aamino acids 3acorals 3agenome 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3aquinones 3asequence homology1 aYasumoto-Hirose, Mina1 aKasai, Hiroaki0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2021 Sept., v. 114, no. 9 p.1407-1416dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl28287x0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-021-01611-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015000170300001600320520134200336592002801678650001901706650001801725650002001743650001801763650002601781650003301807650002401840650001501864650002401879650001701903653002001920653002001940653002201960653002701982653002802009700002002037700002302057700002002080700002202100700002502122700003002147773014502177856008602322852000902408655001202417IND60773650720220419000000.0220419e20220416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077365072DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2020.18516842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Sushanta10aIdentifying suitable soil quality indicators in an Indian rice-wheat system as influenced by long-term (30 years) inorganic-organic fertilization  ap. 704-718.  aA long-term experiment was initiated in a sub-humid tropical Indian rice-wheat system to identify suitable soil quality indicators for determining yield and sustainability of the system as influenced by chemical fertilizers (NPK) alone or in combination with organic amendments viz. farmyard manure (FYM), paddy straw (PS) and green manure (GM). Soil samples were analysed for physical, chemical and biological indicators after 30 crop cycles and the soil quality index (SQI) was calculated by nonlinear scoring functions following the methodology of principal component analysis and multiple regression analysis-based minimum data set selection. Application of NPK fertilizers in combination with FYM and GM significantly increased systems yield and sustainability (sustainable yield index or SYI) as well as improved soil properties compared to the control and other combinations. The value of the dimensionless SQI varied from 2.0 in the control plot to 3.1 in the NPK+FYM. A greater SYI and SQI in the NPK+FYM treatment suggested that FYM in combination with chemical fertilizers has an edge over GM and PS. Among all the indicators (30) under study, available-N, soil organic carbon, available-B and aryl-sulfatase were screened as suitable indicators which contributed 24, 29, 24, 22%, respectively to the SQI in NPK+FYM treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manures 3aarylsulfatase 3adata collection 3agreen manures 3along term experiments 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3arice straw 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 0aFarmyard manure 0aNPK fertilizers 0arice-wheat system 0asoil quality indicator 0asustainable yield index1 aSaha, Bholanath1 aMohanty, Samanyita1 aRay, Manabendra1 aHazra, Gora Chand1 aChatterjee, Soumitra1 aMukhopadhyay, Swapan Kuma0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2022 Apr. 16, v. 68, no. 5 p.704-718dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4585x1476-35677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2020.18516843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007300167520111500240592002801355653001201383653001201395653003401407653002201441653001801463700001501481773015201496856008301648852000901731655001201740IND60756381720221117013731.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075638172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jics.2021.1002352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDewangan, G.P.10aFluidization characteristics of sawdust in a cold flow fluidized bed  aIndia has abundance of biomass such as rice husk, bagasse, wheat straw, sawdust etc. which is used as a main or auxiliary fuel in the fluidized bed combustor, gasifier and pyrolizer. Design of such fluidized bed equipments require the knowledge of minimum fluidization velocity (Uₘf), complete fluidization velocity (Ucf) and transport disengagement height (TDH). The present work reports the fluidization characteristic, Uₘf, Ucf and TDH of the individual size groups of sawdust and mixture thereof. The results indicate that the Uₘf and Ucf have a tendency to increase with increase in particle diameter, however the TDH shows the reverse trend. The sawdust particle size of 925 and 1200 ​μm showed significant difference between their Uₘf and Ucf, an essential parameter for controlled fluidization. Based on the experimental work new correlations for the prediction of Uₘf, Ucf and TDH for sawdust sample are proposed. The proposed correlations of Uₘf, Ucf and TDH are in good agreement with experimental values and the deviations found within the range of nearly ±10% for all the samples.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBiomass 0aSawdust 0aMinimum fluidization velocity 0aParticle diameter 0aPressure drop1 aSaha, S.N.0 tJournal of the Indian Chemical Society.g2021 Dec., v. 98, no. 12 p.100235-dElsevier B.V.aIndian Chemical SocietywJournal:17766x0019-45227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jics.2021.1002353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245016700156300001800323520118100341592002801522650002201550650001901572650002301591650001801614650002001632650002901652650001701681650001301698650001601711650001401727650003201741651001001773700001701783700001701800700001601817700001701833700001801850700001301868773012801881856007402009852000902083655001202092IND60697669920221118035901.0200606e20200604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069766992DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay00264j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Meihua10aAu nanoparticle preconcentration coupled with CE-electrochemiluminescence detection for sensitive analysis of fluoroquinolones in European eel (Anguilla anguilla)  ap. 2693-2702.  aIn this work, a novel method based on gold nanoparticle preconcentration coupled with CE for electrochemiluminescence detection of ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin in European eels was developed. The addition of gold nanoparticles induced the rapid enrichment of fluoroquinolones, which was simpler than the conventional enrichment approaches such as solid phase extraction and solid-phase microextraction. More than 100 times enrichment was observed after gold nanoparticle aggregation-based preconcentration. The CE-electrochemiluminescence parameters that affected the separation and detection were optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the linear ranges for the four fluoroquinolones were 0.090–8.0 μmol L⁻¹ with the detection limits between 0.020 and 0.050 μmol L⁻¹. The proposed approach showed the advantages of high sensitivity, high selectivity, a wide linear range, and a low detection limit. It was used to analyze fluoroquinolones in European eel, and the results showed that the developed method can satisfy the detection requirements for fluoroquinolone determination in aquatic products set by China and the European Union.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnguilla anguilla 3aEuropean Union 3aanalytical methods 3aciprofloxacin 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aenrofloxacin 3ananogold 3anorfloxacin 3aofloxacin 3asolid phase microextraction 3aChina1 aGuo, Longhua1 aYin, Yuechun1 aChen, Lifen1 aChen, Zhitao1 aLiu, Jingjing1 aQiu, Bin0 tAnalytical methods.g2020 June 4, v. 12, no. 21 p.2693-2702dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay00264j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01263naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024003500130040001800165100001800183245005600201300001400257520029700271592002800568650001300596650001600609650002300625650001700648650001300665650001400678700002100692700001900713773011400732856008200846852000900928655001200937IND60624493420221119065259.0181203e19820101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062449342DNAL7 a10.1258/0023677827809088502doi4 a0023-6772(19820101)16:1L.84;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRest, Joan R.10aMalocclusion in inbred strain-2 weanling guineapigs  ap. 84-87.  aThe incidence of malocclusion was recorded for 4 years.

However, little research has been done to investigate the accuracy of using scanning airborne LiDAR to perform road geomatics tasks common to forest engineering. We used airborne LiDAR to estimate existing forest road characteristics in support of a road assessment under four different canopy conditions. In estimating existing road centerlines, LiDAR data had a vertical root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.28 m and a horizontal RMSE of 1.21 m. Road grades were estimated to within 1% slope of the value sampled in the field and horizontal curve radii were estimated with an average absolute error of 3.17 m. The results suggest that airborne LiDAR is an acceptable data source to estimate forest road centerlines and grades, but some caution should be used in estimating horizontal curve radii, particularly on sharp curves.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3aforest engineering 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3alidar 3amodels 3aremote sensing 0atransportation 0aLiDAR 0aplanning1 aWing, Michael G.0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2014 Feb. 17, v. 29, no. 2 p.174-182dTaylor & Francisx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2014.8815463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003500152245011300187300001600300520127800316592002801594650001601622650003301638650001001671650003501681650002001716650001201736650000901748650001401757650002501771650000901796650001201805650000901817650001401826650001101840650001901851650001301870651001101883653001201894653000901906653001001915653000901925653001101934653001101945700003601956700002801992700003902020700003802059773010302097856008702200852000902287655001202296IND60112483120221116143109.0190408e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011248312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Luis Fernandes Pereira10aAssessment of cadmium and lead in commercially important seafood from São Francisco do Conde, Bahia, Brazil  ap. 193-199.  aIn the municipality of São Francisco do Conde, located in Todos os Santos Bay, Brazil, there is a high risk of environmental cadmium and lead contamination produced by industrial sources. In this work, a determination of cadmium and lead contamination in fish (Centropomus undecimalis and Mugil brasiliensis), mussels (Mytella guyanensis) and shrimp (Penaeus brasiliensis) is reported. Forty-seven samples collected from the villages of São Bento, Muribeca and Pati Island were analyzed for their trace metal levels using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). Cadmium and lead contents detected in the samples were found to range from 0.01 to 1.04 mg kg−1 and from 0.10 to 5.40 mg kg−1, respectively. Brazilian legislation establishes legal limits for cadmium and lead in fish meat of 1.0 mg kg−1 and 2.0 mg kg−1, respectively. The measured levels of cadmium in most of the mussel samples were within legal limits (1.04 mg kg−1). However, the measured lead contents of some samples of mussel (2.20–5.40 mg kg−1) and shrimp (2.20–3.40 mg kg−1) were found to be above the legal limit. The results demonstrate that the tendency to bioaccumulate trace elements in shellfish and mollusks is greater than that observed in fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentropomus 3aFarfantepenaeus brasiliensis 3aMugil 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3afish 3afish meat 3alaws and regulations 3alead 3amussels 3arisk 3ashellfish 3ashrimp 3atrace elements 3avillages 3aBrazil 0aCadmium 0aLead 0aETAAS 0aFish 0aShrimp 0aMussel1 aTrigueiro, Ivaldo Nidio Sitonio1 aLemos, Valfredo Azevedo1 ada Nóbrega Furtunato, Dalva Maria1 aCardoso, Ryzia de Cássia Vieira,0 tFood control.g2013 Sept., v. 33, no. 1 p.193-199dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245015200165520160800317592002801925650005201953650002402005650002302029650002002052650002302072650003002095650001302125650003002138650004502168650002702213650002402240650001002264650001202274651002302286653001002309653001302319653001702332653001802349700001502367700001502382700001902397700001402416700001602430700001902446773011502465856008502580852000902665655001202674IND60682451820221120051645.0200405e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068245182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2020.1013822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulz, A.10aMolecular discrimination of Hyalomma tick species serving as reservoirs and vectors for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus in sub-Saharan Africa  aThe species identification of tick vectors of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), especially Hyalomma (H.) species, is a prerequisite to understand the eco-epidemiology of this disease and to reveal vector and virus reservoir species. However, the morphologic species discrimination can be difficult for damaged or blood-fed ticks and in case of species intercrosses. Therefore, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis to distinguish the most common Hyalomma species from sub-Saharan Africa (H. truncatum, H. rufipes and H. dromedarii). Within the last years, MALDI-TOF MS analysis based on tick leg proteins has been shown to be a reliable method to distinguish several tick species. For this purpose, a reference spectral library of several European, American and African tick species was established. In this study, six different Hyalomma species were tested, all of which were all clearly distinguishable by mass spectrometric analyses. Moreover, MALDI TOF- MS was able to confirm morphologic findings where sequencing provided ambiguous results. In addition, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on the CO1 gene amplification of ticks has been developed for the unequivocal species identification by amplicon sequencing and specific restriction endonuclease cleavage pattern analysis. RFLP proved to be a feasible auxiliary discrimination tool for selected Hyalomma species when access to sequencing methods is not available, as for instance during field studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus 3aHyalomma dromedarii 3aHyalomma truncatum 3adisease vectors 3agene amplification 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aproteins 3arestriction endonucleases 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aspecies identification 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3aviruses 3aSub-Saharan Africa 0aCCHFV 0aHyalomma 0aMALDI-TOF MS 0aDNA barcoding1 aKarger, A.1 aBettin, B.1 aEisenbarth, A.1 aSas, M.A.1 aSilaghi, C.1 aGroschup, M.H.0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2020 May, v. 11, no. 3 p.101382-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2020.1013823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011700170300001800287500000900305520163900314592002801953650002001981650001202001650001302013650001402026650001202040650001902052650001702071650003102088650001202119650001202131650001502143650001202158650002902170650002402199650002302223700001702246700001702263700001502280700001702295773012402312856008502436852000902521655001202530IND60665524520221119184913.0191228e199909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066552452DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1999.3951265x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFonseca, C.E.L.10aNear Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy Prediction and Heritability of Neutral Detergent-Soluble Fiber in Alfalfa  ap. 1265-1270.  aepub  aIncreasing neutral detergent-soluble fiber (NDSF) concentration has been considered a strategy for breeding alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) with improved quality. Pectin is the main component of NDSF and is highly digestible, but the assay for NDSF is time-consuming. The objectives were (i) to determine the potential use of near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to predict NDSF concentration in alfalfa and (ii) to estimate NDSF heritability and gain from selection. Herbage was sampled five times across 2 yr from two populations of half-sib (HS) progeny tested at Ithaca, NY. Calibration equations were developed by multiple linear regression of laboratory values of NDSF on NIRS spectra. Samples from one harvest were assayed twice to compare extraction methods. Means of NDSF from 90- and 80%-ethanol extractions were 213.1 ± 7.21 and 179.5 ± 5.89 g kg⁻¹, respectively. Assay standard deviations were low for both ethanol concentrations. Because a better calibration equation was obtained with the 80%-ethanol assay, all remaining samples were assayed by that technique. Standard errors of calibration were small, ranging from 4.71 to 7.54 g kg⁻¹ Coefficients of multiple determination (R ²) ranged from 0.72 to 0.97. Most heritability estimates for NDSF were significantly greater than zero, ranging from −0.03 ± 0.20 to 0.56 ± 0.17 and averaging 0.41. Expected gain from selection of parents based on HS progeny ranged from 4.6 to 19.0 g kg⁻¹ and averaged 10.3 g kg⁻¹ Selecting parents with higher NDSF concentrations predicted by NIRS evaluations of HS progenies may improve forage quality of alfalfa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3abreeding 3aequations 3aethanol 3aforage quality 3aheritability 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aparents 3apectins 3aprediction 3aprogeny 3areflectance spectroscopy 3aregression analysis 3astandard deviation1 aHansen, J.L.1 aThomas, E.M.1 aPell, A.N.1 aViands, D.R.0 tCrop science.g1999 Sept., v. 39, no. 5 p.1265-1270dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1999.3951265x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01977naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245011200163300001600275520101000291592002801301653001501329653002401344653001601368653002201384653002301406700002201429773015001451856007701601852000901678655001201687IND60522454820221121151156.0160603e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052245482DNAL7 a10.5560/znb.2012-00792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReiss, Guido J.10aSynthesis, Structure and Spectroscopy of a New Polyiodide in the α,ω-Diazaniumalkane Iodide/Iodine System  ap. 447-451.  aThe reaction of 1,4-diaminobutane with hydroiodic acid in the presence of iodine yields the title compound 1,4-diazaniumbutane tetraiodide, C₄H₁₄N₂I₄ (1).

The objective of this study was to determine genetic and environmental effects on seed weight and seed yield within two switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) cultivars. Thirty half-sib families of ‘Sunburst’ (large seeded) and ‘Summer’ (small seeded) were evaluated for 3 yr in Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) sod (competitive) and tilled (noncompetitive) spaced-plant nurseries at Brookings, SD, and in a tilled spaced-plant nursery at Highmore, SD. Parents were evaluated in a separate nursery. Significant differences were found among families within both cultivars for 100-seed weight, but significant family × environment interactions indicated nonuniformity in responses of families to environmental variability. Narrow-sense heritability estimates for 100-seed weight were 0.88 for Sunburst and 0.58 for Summer. Seed weight increased in response to increased ambient moisture, but was similar for competitive and noncompetitive environments (grand means were 101 and 175 mg 100 seeds⁻¹ for Summer and Sunburst, respectively) at Brookings. However, mean plasticity for seed weight was evident from markedly reduced seed weights for both cultivars at Highmore. Magnitude and direction of plasticity for seed weight differed for the two cultivars. Plastic families of Summer generally had heavier seeds in the competitive environment, whereas those of Sunburst had heavier seeds in the noncompetitive environment. Significant differences were found among families within both cultivars for seed yield. Summer had 70% higher mean seed yields than Sunburst, and annual seed-yield means varied by greater than 80%. Seed weight was highly responsive to temporal and spatial environmental variation, but genetic variation was adequate to expect progress from selection within both cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3aPoa pratensis 3acultivars 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental impact 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3aparents 3aseed weight 3aseed yield 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3avigor 3aSouth Dakota0 tCrop science.g2003 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.63-67dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2003.63003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245009900173300001800272520117500290592002801465650001301493650001001506650002901516650001601545650001301561650002801574650001201602650001201614650001801626650001501644653001301659653002001672653003601692653002101728653002901749700002101778700002101799773010101820856009001921852000902011655001202020IND60599683420221121033820.0180702e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059968342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.11.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZakhem, Elie10aNeo-innervation of a bioengineered intestinal smooth muscle construct around chitosan scaffold  ap. 1882-1889.  aNeuromuscular disorders of the gut result in disturbances in gastrointestinal transit. The objective of this study was to evaluate the neo-innervation of smooth muscle in an attempt to restore lost innervation. We have previously shown the potential use of composite chitosan scaffolds as support for intestinal smooth muscle constructs. However, the constructs lacked neuronal component. Here, we bioengineered innervated colonic smooth muscle constructs using rabbit colon smooth muscle and enteric neural progenitor cells. We also bioengineered smooth muscle only tissue constructs using colonic smooth muscle cells. The constructs were placed next to each other around tubular chitosan scaffolds and left in culture. Real time force generation conducted on the intrinsically innervated smooth muscle constructs showed differentiated functional neurons. The bioengineered smooth muscle only constructs became neo-innervated. The neo-innervation results were confirmed by immunostaining assays. Chitosan supported (1) the differentiation of neural progenitor cells in the constructs and (2) the neo-innervation of non-innervated smooth muscle around the same scaffold.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3acolon 3agastrointestinal transit 3ainnervation 3amyocytes 3aneuromuscular disorders 3aneurons 3arabbits 3asmooth muscle 3astem cells 0aChitosan 0aNeo-innervation 0aEnteric neural progenitor cells 0aForce generation 0aSmooth muscle constructs1 aRaghavan, Shreya1 aBitar, Khalil N.0 tBiomaterials.g2014 Feb., v. 35, no. 6 p.1882-1889dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.11.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245018300199300001800382500002000400506007600420520179000496592002802286506003702314650001402351650001602365650002102381650002502402650001102427650002602438700001902464700002202483773012302505856007402628852000902702655001202711IND60547853520221207072226.0160903e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054785352DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.143682doi7 aPMC51084252pmcid7 a273622772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuesler, I.M.10aEchocardiographic Assessment of Left Atrial Size and Function in Warmblood Horses: Reference Intervals, Allometric Scaling, and Agreement of Different Echocardiographic Variables  ap. 1241-1252.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Echocardiographic assessment of left atrial (LA) size and function in horses is not standardized. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to establish reference intervals for echocardiographic indices of LA size and function in Warmblood horses and to provide proof of concept for allometric scaling of variables and for the clinical use of area‐based indices. ANIMALS: Thirty‐one healthy Warmblood horses and 91 Warmblood horses with a primary diagnosis of mitral regurgitation (MR) or aortic regurgitation (AR). METHODS: Retrospective study. Echocardiographic indices of LA size and function were measured and scaled to body weight (BWT). Reference intervals were calculated, the influence of BWT, age, and valvular regurgitation on LA size and function was investigated and agreement between different measurements of LA size was assessed. RESULTS: Allometric scaling of variables of LA size allowed for correction of differences in BWT. Indices of LA size documented LA enlargement with moderate and severe MR and AR, whereas most indices of LA mechanical function were not significantly altered by valvular regurgitation. Different indices of LA size were in fair to good agreement but still lead to discordant conclusions with regard to assessment of LA enlargement in individual horses. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Allometric scaling of echocardiographic variables of LA size is advised to correct for differences in BWT among Warmblood horses. Assessment of LA dimensions should be based on an integrative approach combining subjective evaluation and assessment of multiple measurements, including area‐based variables. The clinical relevance of indices of LA mechanical function remains unclear when used in horses with mitral or aortic regurgitation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aallometry 3abody weight 3aechocardiography 3aheart valve diseases 3ahorses 3aretrospective studies1 aMitchell, K.J.1 aSchwarzwald, C.C.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2016 July, v. 30, no. 4 p.1241-1252dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.143683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001400169245008800183300001600271520088400287592002801171650001501199650002201214650001201236650002501248650001501273650001801288650001501306650001101321650003401332650001601366650002701382650003601409650002601445650002601471650002001497650001501517650001301532650002101545650003601566650002101602650003001623650001301653650002301666650002101689650002001710650002101730700001901751700001601770700001201786700001701798700001901815773008801834856008601922852000902008655001202017IND4466540220221120042200.0141110e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446654022DNAL7 a226096792pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.04.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Qiang10aHydrolysis of sweet sorghum bagasse and eucalyptus wood chips with liquid hot water  ap. 220-225.  aThe chemical composition, hydrolysis products, and kinetics during liquid hot water pretreatment of sweet sorghum bagasse (SSB) and eucalyptus wood chips (EWC) were investigated. Under optimal conditions, a total xylose recovery of 79.6% and 55.6% for SSB and of 74.9% and 84.4% for EWC was achieved after pretreatments in a step-change flow rate reactor (184°C, 20ml/min, 8min, and 10ml/min, 10min) and batch stirred reactor (184°C, 5%w/v, 18min), respectively. More than 90% of the xylose was recovered as oligomers from SSB, independent of the type of reactor employed. The activation energies of xylan decomposition of SSB in the step-change flow rate reactor was 6.5-fold greater than that of EWC in the batch stirred reactor due to accumulation of acidic products. These findings show that sugar recovery is dependent on the reactor configuration for specific substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aactivation energy 3abagasse 3achemical composition 3ahydrolysis 3asweet sorghum 3awood chips 3axylose 2aBatch Cell Culture Techniques 2aBioreactors 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCellulosexanalysisxchemistry. 2aEucalyptusxchemistry 2aFuraldehydexanalysis 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrolysis 2aKinetics 2aLigninxanalysis 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aModels, Chemical 2aPolysaccharidesxanalysis 2aRheology 2aSorghumxchemistry 2aWaterxchemistry 2aWoodxchemistry 2aXylosexanalysis1 aZhuang, Xinshu1 aWang, Qiong1 aQi, Wei1 aTan, Xuesong1 aYuan, Zhenhong0 tBioresource technology.g2012 July, v. 116 p.220-225dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.04.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015900157300001800316520154900334592002801883650002101911650001501932650001601947650001801963650001701981650001701998650001702015650002002032650002902052650002002081650001302101650001302114700001702127700001902144773014202163856007502305852000902380655001202389IND60769745320221122054630.0220310e20220309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076974532DNAL7 a10.1039/d1tb02849a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Jongdarm10aBiomimetic polypyrrole/hyaluronic acid electrodes integrated with hyaluronidase inhibitors offer persistent electroactivity and resistance to cell binding  ap. 1591-1600.  aConductive polymers, including polypyrrole (PPy), have garnered much attention as bioelectrodes because of their high conductivity, low interfacial resistance, environmental stability, and biocompatibility. In particular, the introduction of high-molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HA) into PPy enables the fabrication of biomimetic and biocompatible electrodes (i.e., PPy/HA) characterized by low biofouling. However, as HA is readily degraded by enzymes (i.e., hyaluronidase (HAase)) in a biological milieu, PPy/HA substantially loses its original properties, including resistance to cell adhesion and electrical activity. We found that HAase treatment of PPy/HA substantially degraded the HA moieties in PPy/HA, resulting in increased water contact angles, increased impedance, and conversion of non-cell adhesive to cell adhesive surfaces. Hence, it is desirable to mitigate HA degradation to achieve persistent performance of PPy/HA electrodes. Accordingly, we incorporated glycyrrhizin as an HAase inhibitor (HI) into PPy/HA electrodes. HI-incorporated PPy/HA (PPy/HA/HI) successfully prevented the degradation of the HA moiety and non-specific cell adhesion on the electrodes, in the presence of HAase (2.5 U mL⁻¹), without cytotoxicity. These excellent properties allowed for maintenance of the electrical sensitivity of PPy/HA during cell culture with HAase. Altogether, biomimetic PPy/HA, which is resistant to degradation by HAase, may serve as an effective platform for the development of reliable and biocompatible bioelectrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiofouling 3abiomimetics 3acell adhesion 3acell culture 3acytotoxicity 3aglycyrrhizin 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahyaluronoglucosaminidase 3amicroelectrodes 3amoieties 3apyrroles1 aLee, Sanghun1 aLee, Jae Young0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2022 Mar. 9, v. 10, no. 10 p.1591-1600dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1tb02849a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245012100181300001600302520140600318592002801724650001301752650001601765650002101781650002201802650001801824650001101842650002401853650002401877650001001901650001001911650001901921650001801940650001401958650001001972650000901982650001801991650001002009650001502019653001902034653002102053653002202074653001602096653001802112700001702130700001502147700005702162773011602219856008202335852000902417655001202426IND60517276520221116205705.0190729e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051727652DNAL7 a254752532pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820140018262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMASSON, G.10aImpact of the cestode Triaenophorus nodulosus on the exotic Lepomis gibbosus and the autochthonous Perca fluviatilis  ap. 745-755.  aThe effects of plerocercoids of the cestode Triaenophorus nodulosus infecting the livers of native Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis and non-native pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus was investigated in 17 sites along the Moselle watershed. With a single exception, infected individuals were not observed in the main channel whether or not northern pike Esox lucius, a final host, was present. In ponds where the pike was present, the prevalence of T. nodulosus averaged 86% in Eurasian perch and 15% in pumpkinseed. The parasite was not present at all in ponds when pike were absent. Parasite load, hepatosomatic index (HSI), gonadosomatic index (GSI) and body condition index (CI) were compared between hosts in one site where parasite prevalence and fish abundance was highest. HSI in infected perch was significantly higher than in uninfected perch, whereas no differences in HSI were detected between infected and uninfected pumpkinseed. While perch were more frequently infected and had a greater average parasite load than pumpkinseed, there were no significant differences in either indicator between the two species. Furthermore, no significant differences in GSI or CI were observed between infected and uninfected fish in either species, by either gender or maturity stage. We hypothesize that pumpkinseed is more resistant to the parasite or less likely to feed upon infected copepods than perch.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3aEsox lucius 3aLepomis gibbosus 3aPerca fluviatilis 3aTriaenophorus 3agender 3agonadosomatic index 3ahepatosomatic index 3ahosts 3aliver 3amaturity stage 3aparasite load 3aparasites 3aperch 3apike 3aplerocercoids 3aponds 3awatersheds 0aliver parasite 0ainvasive species 0acondition indices 0awaterbodies 0aMoselle River1 aVANACKER, M.1 aFOX, M.

Benzyl alcohol was found to be a good co-solvent as it afforded a high coversion and reduced deactivation of the cells. Half-lives of the wet and lyophilized whole cell biocatalysts in pure benzyl alcohol were 23.07 and 11.21 hours, respectively. The initial reaction rates at 30°C were 13.1 and 11.0μmol/min, respectively, for the wet and lyophilized cells. With optimized conditions in a reaction medium containing phosphate buffer and benzyl alcohol (1:1 by vol) with 230mM 1-acetonapthone, more than 98% and 81% conversion (ee >99%) was achieved in 5 hours with the wet and lyophilized cells, respectively. Both the cell preparations showed maximum conversion at 30°C. A thermodynamic characterization revealed that the wet cells were more thermostable than the lyophilized cells. The calculated half-life of the wet cells at pH 7 was 93 hours, whereas that of the lyophilized cells was 71 hours at the same condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeotrichum candidum 3abenzyl alcohol 3abiocatalysts 3afreeze drying 3ahalf life 3apH 3aphosphates 3asolvents 3athermal stability1 aSingh, Amit1 aBanerjee, Uttam Chand0 tNew biotechnology.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 29, no. 3 p.359-364dElsevier B.V.x1871-67847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2011.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03116naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245013700205300001800342500001900360520178000379592002802159650001502187650001102202650001802213650002602231650003402257650002702291650001902318650002002337653003302357653000802390653002702398653001702425700006102442773013902503856007902642852000902721655001202730IND60731081620221120061423.0210316e20210305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073108162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.0c073552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Glubt, Sarah1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8705-101910aContribution of Nonaqueous-Phase Liquids to the Retention and Transport of Per and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Porous Media  ap. 3706-3715.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPer and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) cocontamination with nonaqueous-phase organic liquids (NAPLs) has been observed or suspected at various sites, particularly at fire-training areas at which aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs) were applied. The objectives of this study are to (1) delineate the relative significance of specific PFAS-NAPL processes on PFAS retention, including partitioning into the bulk NAPL phase and adsorption to the NAPL–water interface; (2) investigate the influence of NAPL properties, saturation, and mass-transfer constraints on PFAS retention; and (3) determine whether PFAS may impact NAPL distribution through mobilization or dissolution. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are used as representative PFAS, and trichloroethene (TCE) and decane are used as representative NAPLs. NAPL–water interfacial adsorption was quantified with NAPL–water interfacial-tension measurements; partitioning into NAPL was quantified with batch experiments, and retardation factors (R) in the absence and presence of residual NAPL were determined with miscible-displacement transport experiments. R values increased in the presence of residual NAPL, with adsorption to the NAPL–water interface accounting for as much as ∼77% of retention and solid-phase adsorption also significantly contributing to retention. Additionally, this study provides the first QSPR analysis focused on NAPL–water interfacial adsorption coefficients, with results consistent with those from previous air–water studies. Lastly, this initial investigation into PFAS impacts on NAPL behavior determined that PFOS/PFOA are unlikely to enhance solubilization or mobilization of NAPL under the conditions present at many AFFF legacy sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adecane 3amass transfer 3amiscible displacement 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3asolubilization 3asurface tension 0aperfluorooctanesulfonic acid 0aTCE 0ainterfacial adsorption 0apartitioning1 aBrusseau, Mark L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6937-29750 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2021 Mar. 05, v. 55, no. 6 p.3706-3715dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c073553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012500161300001600286500002000302520151800322592002801840650003001868650002401898650001401922650003101936650001301967650001001980650001401990650002302004650000902027700002102036700002402057700002402081700002002105773009202125856007302217852000902290655001202299IND60571707120221117184640.0170712e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057170712DNAL7 a10.1111/eth.125322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoyce, Brendan J.10aBackground Predation Risk and Learned Predator Recognition in Convict Cichlids: Does Risk Allocation Constrain Learning?  ap. 841-849.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aExposure to elevated levels of background predation risk is known to shape the behavioural response of prey organisms to known and unknown predation threats. However, less is known regarding the effects of background predation risk on predator recognition learning. Here, we test the potential effects of elevated background predation risk on the strength and retention of learned predator recognition in juvenile convict cichlids (Amatitlania nigrofasciata). In a series of laboratory trials, we exposed shoals of juvenile cichlids to conditions of elevated (vs. low) levels of background risk and then conditioned them to recognize a novel predator odour (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss). The results of our first experiment demonstrate that despite showing reduced response intensities during initial conditioning (due to risk allocation), conditioned cichlids from high vs. low background risk show similar intensities of learned recognition when tested 24 h post‐conditioning. Moreover, elevated levels of background risk induced a predator avoidance response among unconditioned cichlids (due to induced neophobia). Our second experiment demonstrates that while we find no difference in the strength of learning when tested 24 h post‐conditioning, retention of acquired recognition is enhanced among cichlids from the high background predation risk treatment. Together, our results highlight the complex interacting effects past experience plays in shaping the response to acute predation threats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmatitlania nigrofasciata 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3ajuveniles 3alaboratory experimentation 3alearning 3aodors 3apredation 3apredator avoidance 3arisk1 aDemers, Ebony E.1 aFerrari, Maud C.

Synthesis was performed by direct co-precipitation of Zn(NO₃)₂ and Al(NO₃)₃ in the polysaccharide solutions at pH ~ 8.5. The reaction products were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), elemental and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). It was found that welan gum is successfully intercalated into the Zn-Al-LDH structure, giving a d-spacing of 2:38 nm for the interlayer distance, while neutral scleroglucan failed to be intercalated. Instead, this biopolymer was only surface-adsorbed on inorganic CaAl-OH-LDH platelets, as was evidenced by de-washing experiments. These results indicate that the anionic functionality of the polysaccharides presents a main driving force behind their intercalation. In contrast to regular xanthan gum, EPS I was intercalated into the LDH structure to give a sharp X-ray reflection representing a d-spacing of 2:77 nm. This behavior proves that slight modifications of the polysaccharide can greatly improve its intercalation ability.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPolysaccharide 0aLayered Double Hydroxide 0aIntercalation 0aWelan Gum 0aScleroglucan1 aNg, Serina1 aForaita, Sebastian0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 67, no. 5 p.479-487dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5560/znb.2012-00813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011900165520134800284592002801632650004401660650001401704650001701718650002201735650002901757650001301786650001901799650001901818650001601837650001601853650002701869650001001896650004101906650001601947650001601963650001501979650001301994650000702007650001702014650002002031650001102051650002002062650001602082650002102098650002102119650001102140650001802151653002102169653002602190653001302216653002702229700002602256700002302282773012202305856008302427852000902510655001202519IND60681871620221122154938.0200221e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068187162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1015052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJavee, Anand10aBioactive glycolipid biosurfactant from seaweed Sargassum myriocystum associated bacteria Streptomyces sp. SNJASM6  aA potent biosurfactant (Bs) from Streptomyces sp. SNJASM6 was isolated from the seaweed Sargassum myriocystum J. Agardh. The Streptomyces sp. culture was optimized with a key ingredient for the yield of Bs production. The emulsification index in surfactants, oils, hydrocarbons were estimated by using Tween 20 (62.52 ± 0.41), Coconut oil (63.52 ± 0.19) and Xylene (62.38 ± 0.31) respectively. Subsequently, the starch and yeast extract was the best-optimized sources for the Bs production which were found to be (68%) and (65%) respectively. The biochemical study and the structural characterizations such as TLC, FTIR, XRD, TGA, and GC-MS confirmed the lipid nature of the isolated biosurfactant. An efficient water surface tension significantly decreases from 69.2 to 32.8 mN/m, however, the isolated biosurfactant, has a micelle concentration of (36 mg/L). The emulsifying activity and stability of Bs were also studied at the various condition like temperature, pH and NaCl which were found to be 58%, 76%, and 65% respectively. Around (200 μg/ml) of purified lipid Bs derived from Streptomyces sp. showed antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and fungus. Thus, the isolated Streptomyces sp. SNJASM6 (accession no MF383378) Bs having potent antimicrobial activity could be bioremediation in the marine background.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aSargassum 3aStreptomyces 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3abiosurfactants 3acoconut oil 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3afungi 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglycolipids 3aingredients 3amacroalgae 3amicelles 3apH 3apolysorbates 3asodium chloride 3astarch 3asurface tension 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3avirulent strains 3axylene 3ayeast extract 0aStreptomyces sp. 0aSargassum myriocystum 0aLipid Bs 0aAntimicrobial activity1 aKaruppan, Ramamoorthy1 aSubramani, Nagaraj0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2020 Jan., v. 23 p.101505-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2020.1015053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011800153300001800271520149800289592002801787650002101815650001901836650001701855650001701872650001801889650001001907650001301917650001101930650001501941650002101956650001701977650001501994650002202009700001202031773014202043856007402185852000902259655001202268IND60749479320221120213956.0210903e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074947932DNAL7 a10.1039/d1tb00984b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Lei10aPolyethylenimine-modified graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets: a label-free Raman traceable siRNA delivery system  ap. 6895-6901.  aSince the nanotoxicity of gene delivery carriers has raised world-wide concerns, it is important to trace their intracellular performance, for example via uptake visualization. Here, we develop a novel ultrathin graphitic carbon nitride (g-C₃N₄) composite nanosystem for label-free Raman-traceable small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery. Through low molecular weight polyethylenimine (PEI) modifications, these nanosystems can obtain siRNA loading capabilities. The lateral size of the PEI-g-C₃N₄ composite is around 100–150 nm with a thickness of nearly 0.6 nm. The designed label-free delivery system could avoid possible obstacles associated with artificial labels and it shows cytotoxicity toward cancer cells and good biocompatibility in normal human cells. The label-free PEI-g-C₃N₄ gene nanocarrier can be directly traced via Raman microscopy, which makes it suitable for intracellular visualization. Intracellular uptake of the self-fluorescent g-C₃N₄ nanosheets can also be traced via fluorescence imaging. The PEI modified g-C₃N₄ ultrathin nanosheets possess gene delivery capacity together with unique dual-traceable Raman and fluorescence features. Raman traces not only have higher specificity than fluorescence ones but they can also avoid background noises. Thus, they may replace widely implemented fluorescence tracing. This work could provide a label-free traceable platform for investigating the intracellular performances of gene delivery nanosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acarbon nitride 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence 3agene transfer 3agenes 3agraphene 3ahumans 3amicroscopy 3amolecular weight 3ananocarriers 3ananosheets 3apolyethyleneimine1 aDu, Xin0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2021 Sept. 1, v. 9, no. 34 p.6895-6901dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1tb00984b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245006000172300001600232520143100248592002801679650002101707650001501728650002001743650001901763650001501782650001001797650001101807650001001818650001101828650001401839650001901853650001901872650001901891650001701910650001301927650002001940650002801960650002001988650001402008650001602022650002602038653002102064653001602085653002102101653001702122653001702139653001102156700006002167700006302227773013302290856008502423852000902508655001202517IND60682452320221120060611.0200601e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068245232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2020.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchumacher, Julia10aLight sensing in plant- and rock-associated black fungi  ap. 407-417.  aFungi that share light-flooded habitats with phototrophs may profit from their excess photosynthetic products. But to cope with sunlight-associated stresses [e.g. high temperatures, UV radiation with associated DNA damage, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), desiccation and osmotic stresses] it is important for fungi to accurately sense and respond to changes in light. To test the hypothesis that light is an environmental cue that Ascomycota use to coordinate growth, stress responses as well as to establish pathogenic or symbiotic relationships, the photoreceptor (PR) distribution in species from different ecological niches was analysed. The genomes of black [dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin-containing] fungi from phyllosphere and exposed solid surfaces contain multiple photoreceptors (PRs). The plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea (Leotiomycetes) has a highly sophisticated photosensory and signalling system that helps to avoid light and to locate susceptible hosts. Rock-inhabiting Dothideomycetes and Eurotiomycetes including Knufia petricola possess equal numbers of PRs along with the same set of protective pigments. This similarity between black fungi from plant and rock surfaces suggests that photoperception and -regulation are important for fungi that receive nutrients through cooperation with phototrophs. Genetic tools for manipulating K. petricola exist and will be used to test this idea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aDNA damage 3aDothideomycetes 3aEurotiomycetes 3aautotrophs 3afungi 3agenome 3ahosts 3aniches 3anutrients 3aosmotic stress 3aphotoreceptors 3aphotosynthesis 3aphyllosphere 3apigments 3aplant pathogens 3areactive oxygen species 3astress response 3asymbiosis 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 0aBotrytis cinerea 0aDHN melanin 0aKnufia petricola 0aPhyllosphere 0aRock biofilm 0aStress1 aGorbushina, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7685-77971 aGorbushina, Anna A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7685-77970 tFungal biology.g2020 May, v. 124, no. 5 p.407-417dElsevier LtdaBritish Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2020.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015100166300001600317520146600333592002801799650002301827650002601850650001601876650001601892650001901908650001101927650002001938650001001958650001101968650001301979650001901992650002002011650002202031650001002053650001902063650001502082650001102097650001102108650002202119700002402141700001602165700001702181700001702198773010302215856008102318852000902399655001202408IND50059558420221119034644.0151024e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005955842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-012-9716-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashmi, Nadeem10aExogenous salicylic acid stimulates physiological and biochemical changes to improve growth, yield and active constituents of fennel essential oil  ap. 281-291.  aFennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill) is a high-value medicinal and essential oil bearing plant used extensively in pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries. A pot experiment was carried out in the natural conditions of net house to resolve whether the foliar application of salicylic acid (SA) might enhance the growth, yield and essential oil production of fennel. Plants were sprayed three times with SA. The first spray was carried out at 40 days after sowing (DAS); the second and third sprays were applied one and 2 weeks later, the plants were sprayed with deionised water (control) and different concentrations of SA (10⁻⁵, 10⁻⁴ and 10⁻³ M). The foliar spray of SA at 10⁻⁴ M significantly enhanced the vegetative growth (shoot and root lengths, fresh and dry weights), physiological and biochemical characteristics (chl ‘a’, chl ‘b’, total chlorophyll and carotenoids contents, nitrate reductase activity, carbonic anhydrase activity, leaf-N, -P and -K contents), yield characteristics (number of umbels and fruits, 1,000-seed weight and seed yield) and essential oil yield of fennel. GLC analysis revealed the significant increase in the components of essential oil, viz. trans-anethole (80.4–84.7 %), methyl chavicol (2.3–2.5 %) and fenchone (5.6–7.9 %). It was concluded that foliar spray of SA at 10⁻⁴ M might be employed for enhancing the plant growth as well as yield and quality of essential oil of fennel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFoeniculum vulgare 3acarbonate dehydratase 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aessential oils 3afennel 3afoliar spraying 3afoods 3afruits 3aindustry 3ainflorescences 3amethyl chavicol 3anitrate reductase 3aroots 3asalicylic acid 3aseed yield 3ashoots 3asowing 3avegetative growth1 aKhan, M.

In this study, a novel strategy, atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutagenesis combined with genome shuffling and hybridization, was successfully applied to obtain a multiple stress-tolerant flocculating industrial S. cerevisiae strain E-158. The enhanced strain E-158 grew better under various stress conditions compared with the original strain KF-7. The concentrations of ethanol produced by strain E-158 during batch fermentation were 10.14 %–81.02 % higher than those produced by strain KF-7 under high ethanol, high temperature, and high osmosis stress conditions. The stress tolerance of E-158 kept stable even after 30 times of sub-cultivation. The lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in strain E-158 manifested that the antioxidant defense ability of E-158 was improved and contributed to its multiple stress-tolerance. This study provided a stress-tolerant strain for industrial ethanol production and a feasible strategy for breeding multiple stress-tolerant industrial S. cerevisiae strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aambient temperature 3aantioxidant activity 3abatch fermentation 3acatalase 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3agenome 3ahybridization 3amutagenesis 3aosmosis 3areactive oxygen species 3astress tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aMultiple stress-tolerance 0aEthanol fermentation 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 0aARTP mutagenesis 0aGenome shuffling 0aVery high gravity fermentation1 aLi, Bo1 aWang, Shi-Peng1 aXia, Zi-Yuan1 aGou, Min1 aTang, Yue-Qin0 tProcess biochemistry.g2021 Mar., v. 102 p.275-285dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2020.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245012900166300001600295520148800311592002801799650003001827650001501857650001301872650001801885650001801903650001601921650001801937650001501955650001701970650001201987650002001999650001302019650001902032650000902051650001102060650002402071650000702095650002002102650000902122650001702131650001902148650001802167650001802185650001102203700001902214700001902233700002102252700001902273773011402292856008402406852000902490655001202499IND4460748120221121132920.0141111e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446074812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Chien-Hui10aEffects of cultural medium and conditions on the proliferation and hypoglycemic activity of Saccharomyces pastorianus no. 54  ap. 159-165.  aA yeast strain of Saccharomyces pastorianus no. 54 with hypoglycemic activity was isolated from soils of a winery.

After investigation of the effects of addition of various substances, including 1% of 5 different sugars and glycerol, 0.1% of 6 nitrogen-containing substances, and 1ppm of 7 growth factors, the diluted strawberry juice added with 1% glucose, 0.1% yeast extract and 1ppm aspartic acid was optimized at 20°C with initial pH value of 6.0 for cultivating S. pastorianus no. 54 in flask. The scale-up system of a 5-L fermentor was further established by using the same medium with initial pH 6.0 and being incubated at 20°C with an aeration rate of 1.2vvm for 96h. The hypoglycemic activity of yeast cells cultivated in fermentor was 3.11 times of that in flask. Oral administration of the cultured yeast at a dosage of 130mg/kg body weight/day for 6days could significantly reduce the plasma glucose content in STZ-induced diabetic mice and keep their body weights in the normal range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces pastorianus 3aadipocytes 3aaeration 3aaspartic acid 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3aculture media 3afermenters 3afruit juices 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3aglycerol 3agrowth factors 3amice 3amodels 3aoral administration 3apH 3areducing sugars 3asoil 3astrawberries 3astreptozotocin 3asugar content 3ayeast extract 3ayeasts1 aLin, Hong-Ting1 aWu, Guan-James1 aWang, Sheng-Hong1 aTsai, Guo-Jane0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2011 Aug., v. 112, no. 2 p.159-165dElsevier B.V.x1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012100156300002000277520169800297592002801995650001502023650001302038650001502051650002002066650002802086650000902114650001302123650001902136650001702155650000902172650002302181650001502204650001902219650001302238650002202251650003102273650002502304650001702329650002002346650001702366653002602383653003002409653003802439653002502477653003802502700001802540700002202558700001902580700001802599700001702617773012602634856007502760852000902835655001202844IND60527798120221121232432.0160715e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052779812DNAL7 a10.1021/am506389m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jaewook10aPlasmon-Induced Photoluminescence Immunoassay for Tuberculosis Monitoring Using Gold-Nanoparticle-Decorated Graphene  ap. 21380-21388.  aMetal-nanoparticle-functionalized graphene, in particular, graphene sheets containing Au nanoparticles (Au NPs), have generated considerable interest because of their unique optical and electrical characteristics. In this study, we successfully produced graphene sheets decorated with Au NPs (AuGrp) using phytochemicals as reducing agents. During this reaction, Au ions intercalated into the layered graphene flakes and were then reduced into NPs, exfoliating the graphene sheets. The physicochemical properties of the AuGrp nanocomposites were characterized, and the exfoliation process was investigated using a molecular dynamics simulation of Au NPs between graphene sheets. Our proposed technique is advantageous because the phytochemicals are mild reducing agents that preserve the graphene structure during exfoliation and NP decoration. The dispersity of the NPs on the graphene sheets was drastically improved due to the use of metal-ion intercalation. Moreover, the electrical conductivity was 6–30 times higher than that of bare graphene and reduced graphene oxide. Using antibody (Ab) modified AuGrp sheets and quantum dots, a plasmonic-induced photoluminescence immunoassay of tuberculosis (TB) antigen (aG) CFP-10 was demonstrated for a potential application of these materials. The enhancement of photoluminescence (PL) response was monitored depending on the various TB aG concentrations from 5.1 pg/mL to 51 μg/mL, and the detection limit for CFP-10 was 4.5 pg/mL. Furthermore, the selectivity was demonstrated with Ag85 as the other TB aG, and PL enhancement was not observed in this case. Therefore, AuGrp-based immunoassay showed the potential for biosensor application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aelectrical conductivity 3agold 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aimmunoassays 3aions 3amolecular dynamics 3amonitoring 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3aphotoluminescence 3aphysicochemical properties 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3aquantum dots 3areducing agents 3atuberculosis 0aAu-decorated graphene 0amild reduction conditions 0aplasmon resonance energy transfer 0atuberculosis sensing 0aplasmon-induced photoluminescence1 aKim, Jeonghyo1 aAhmed, Syed Rahin1 aZhou, Hongjian1 aKim, Jong-Man1 aLee, Jaebeom0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 6, no. 23 p.21380-21388dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam506389m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008400162300002000246520146700266592002801733650001601761650001401777650002301791650001901814650001801833650001201851650001201863650001601875653002001891653001801911653002001929653002201949653002901971653001402000700002102014700001702035700001402052700001602066700001402082700001302096700001502109773012602124856007502250852000902325655001202334IND60527798220170718000000.0160715e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052779822DNAL7 a10.1021/am506391n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrarese Lupi, F.10aHigh Aspect Ratio PS-b-PMMA Block Copolymer Masks for Lithographic Applications  ap. 21389-21396.  aThe control of the self-assembly (SA) process and nanostructure orientation in diblock copolymer (DBC) thick films is a crucial technological issue. Perpendicular orientation of the nanostructures in symmetric and asymmetric poly(styrene)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) block copolymer films obtained by means of simple thermal treatments was demonstrated to occur in well-defined thickness windows featuring modest maximum values, thus resulting in low aspect ratio (h/d < 2) of the final lithographic mask. In this manuscript, the thickness window corresponding to the perpendicular orientation of the cylindrical structures in asymmetric DBC is investigated at high temperatures (190 °C ≤ T ≤ 310 °C) using a rapid thermal processing machine. A systematic study of the annealing conditions (temperature and time) of asymmetric PS-b-PMMA (Mₙ = 67.1, polydispersity index = 1.09) films, with thicknesses ranging from 10 to 400 nm, allowed ordered patterns, with a maximum value of orientational correlation length of 350 nm, to be obtained for film thicknesses up to 200 nm. The complete propagation of the cylindrical structures through the whole film thickness in a high aspect ratio PS template (h/d ≈ 7) is probed by lift-off process. Si nanopillars are obtained having the same lateral ordering and characteristic dimensions of the DBC lithographic mask as further confirmed by grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aannealing 3acomposite polymers 3aheat treatment 3ananomaterials 3asilicon 3astyrene 3atemperature 0ablock copolymer 0aself-assembly 0ananolithography 0ahigh aspect-ratio 0arapid thermal processing 0aPS-b-PMMA1 aGiammaria, T.

The Cd stress reduced the root and shoot growth of sesame, and plant contents of photosynthetic pigments; however, the application of Ca²⁺ improved these parameters under Cd stress condition. The hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde and soluble sugar contents were higher under Cd stress, and were reduced by Ca²⁺ treatment. The antioxidant enzyme activities in the leaves of sesame, superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) were higher under Cd stress, whereas reduced concentration was observed in Ca²⁺-treated plants. Cd stress increased the contents of diacylglycerol and sterol ester; however Ca²⁺ treatment resulted in a significant increase in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine. Our results indicated that application of calcium enables sesame plants to withstand the deleterious impact of cadmium through upregulating acquired systemic tolerance system as lipid fractions (galactolipids, phospholipids, neutral lipids), antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, CAT, APX, GR) hence protect membrane functions.  aThe authors would like to extend their sincere appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University for its funding this research group no.

The first two were homologous series of alkane 1,2-diols and 1,3-diols, both ranging from C20 to C26. The upper and lower petal surfaces contained 0.11 and 0.09μg/cm2 of 1,2-diols, respectively. 1,3-Diols were present at quantities one order of magnitude less than the 1,2-diols. Both series had similar chain length distributions, with 6–20%, 59–73% and 20–31% of the C20, C22 and C24 diols, respectively. The other two compound classes were primary and secondary monoacetates of C20–C24 1,2-diols. The monoacetates had chain length profiles similar to the free 1,2-diols, and amounted to 0.04 and 0.09μg/cm2 on the adaxial and abaxial sides, respectively. Methods were developed to minimize acyl migration during monoacetate isomer analyses. The ratios of diol 1-acetates to diol 2-acetates averaged close to 3:5, and thus opposite to the chemical equilibrium ratio of 7:3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCosmos bipinnatus 3aalkanes 3achemical equilibrium 3acorolla 3aepicuticular wax 3aisomers 2aAlcoholsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aAlkanesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aAsteraceaexchemistry 2aFlowersxchemistry 2aMolecular Structure 2aWaxesxchemistry 0aCosmos bipinnatus 0aAsteraceae 0aCuticular wax 0aPetal surface 0aFlowers 0aDiols 0aAcyl migration 0aAcetates 0aGC–MS1 aPeng, Chen1 aJetter, Reinhard0 tPhytochemistry.g2013 July, v. 91 p.249-256dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01110naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002500172245005900197300001400256520013400270592002800404650001400432650001700446650002300463650004000486650002200526653001400548653001700562653001300579773009500592856008800687852000900775655001200784IND60113563720221120102245.0190318e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011356372DNAL7 a227217822pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordell, Geoffrey A.10aFifty years of alkaloid biosynthesis in Phytochemistry  ap. 29-51.  aAn overview is presented of the studies related to the biosynthesis of alkaloids published in Phytochemistry in the past 50years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaloids 3abiosynthesis 3aplant biochemistry 2aAlkaloidsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aPlantsxchemistry 0aAlkaloids 0aBiosynthesis 0aOverview0 tPhytochemistry.g2013 July, v. 91 p.29-51dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01338naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002100148245011000169300001600279520033800295592002800633650001300661650001000674650001900684650002500703650001900728650001200747650000900759700001500768700002200783773011400805856008400919852000901003655001201012IND4460748520221121172119.0141111e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446074852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShindo, Hironori10aEffect of amino group density for prevention of mammary gland tissue detachment from coated glass surface  ap. 180-183.  aTissue detachment from histological glass slides coated with different amino group densities was investigated during heat treatment for immunohistochemical staining.

Some botanical aspects and antifungal activity of Etlingera flexuosa (Zingiberaceae) from Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 21: 3547-3553. Etlingera flexuosa is a species of Etlingera endemic to the island of Sulawesi and its natural distribution is restricted to Central and South Sulawesi, where it has been utilized for different purposes. Despite the limited knowledge in the aspects of botany and its antimicrobial activities, the use of plants as a source of alternative solutions to health problems is on the rise. The objectives of this study were to obtain some information about the several botanical aspects of E. flexuosa and its antifungal activity. This research was conducted from March to December 2019 and samples were collected from the montane forest of Lore Lindu National Park (LLNP) near Sedoa Village, Lore Utara Sub-district, Poso District, Indonesia. The identification of plant specimens and extractions was carried out at the Laboratory of Plant Biosystematics, Tadulako University, Palu, Indonesia. The antifungal activity was tested using agar diffusion methods. The results showed that E. flexuosa is a perennial herb naturally distributed in Sulawesi island. It usually grows in the pristine submontane and montane forests, sometimes in light and open condition or on the slope of natural disturbed forest at the altitude of 1500 -1700 m a.s.l. The forest is dominated by Fagaceae family, of which E. flexuosa has been utilized extensively by local community of Topo Baria ethnic for various purposes such as flavor enhancer in food, vegetable, traditional medicine, and as roofing materials. It contains some secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, tannins, saponins, terpenoids, alkaloids and steroids, and also shows antioxidant activity. Conclusively, the extract of E. flexuosa could be used as inhibiting agent for the growth of Candida albicans yeast.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida albicans 3aEtlingera 3aFagaceae 3aagar 3aaltitude 3aantifungal properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aflavonoids 3aflavor enhancers 3aforest damage 3ageographical distribution 3amontane forests 3anational parks 3asaponins 3asecondary metabolites 3ataxonomy 3aterpenoids 3atraditional medicine 3avegetables 3avillages 3ayeasts 3aIndonesia 0aantifungal 0aethnobotany 0aetlingera flexuosa 0aphytochemical1 aUmrah1 aHarso, Wahyu1 aNurainas1 aZubair, Muhammad Sulaiman 0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 July, v. 21, no. 8dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2108173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245009200165300001600257520128300273592002801556650001701584650002301601650001901624650002101643650002501664650002301689650001201712700001601724773012801740856008001868852000901948655001201957IND60765264920220419000000.0220419e20120224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076526492DNAL7 a10.17221/5233-agricecon2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHudečková, H.14aThe shuttle migration with regard to social potential of rural settlements (case study)  ap. 457-464.  aThis article concerns shuttle migration activities of rural inhabitants and at the same time asks how this phenomenon influences social potential of rural settlements. The authors draw on the social ecology. Among its basic topics belongs spatial behavior. The authors ask about the impacts of the extent of shuttle migration and of how rural inhabitants perceive it (the object of the survey are 5 municipalities in the Central Bohemia Region) on social potential of the municipality. This potential is indicated by a&nbsp;cooperation of the migrants and non-migrants in the local government, especially with regards to development strategies involving transport infrastructure and public-transport services. The used method is a&nbsp;sociological empirical research that combines quantitative and qualitative approach and uses the appropriate techniques, such as a&nbsp;document study, observation, questionnaires and time-and-space mapping. Analysis of the collected data leads firstly to identification of positives and negatives of the shuttle-migration activities for the rural settlements, and secondly results in outlining empirical research of the shuttle migration in a&nbsp;wider spectrum of rural municipalities in regard to endogenous approach to local development.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aempirical research 3ainfrastructure 3alocal government 3aqualitative analysis 3asocial environment 3asurveys1 aKříž, L.0 tZemědělská ekonomika.g, v. 50, no. 10 p.457-464dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:22848x0139-570X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/5233-agricecon3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001600148245016400164300001600328520164300344592002801987650002702015650002602042650002802068650002702096650002702123650002002150650002602170650002202196650003002218650001702248650001802265650001402283650001702297650001702314650001502331650002802346650001102374650000902385650001102394650001502405700001602420700002002436700002002456700001902476700001502495773011402510856008402624852000902708655001202717IND4460748720221121132918.0141111e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446074872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xinlong10aEffects of probiotic fermentation on the enhancement of biological and pharmacological activities of Codonopsis lanceolata extracted by high pressure treatment  ap. 188-193.  aThis study was designed to evaluate the enhancement of antioxidant, antimicrobial, enzymatic, cytotoxic, and cognitive activities of Codonopsis lanceolata extracted by high pressure treatment followed by probiotic fermentation. Dried C. lanceolata samples were subjected to 400MPa for 20min and then fermented with Bifidobacterium longum B6 (HPE-BLF) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (HPE-LRF) at 37°C for 7days. Compared to conventional extraction (CE-NF, 6.69mg GAE/g), the phenol amounts of HPE-BLF and HPE-LRF were significantly increased to more than 8mg GAE/g, while the lowest flavonoid contents were observed for HPE-BLF (0.44mg RE/mL) and HPE-LRF (0.45mg RE/mL) (p<0.05). Cinnamic acid was the most abundant phenolic acid in the fermented C. lanceolata. The highest DPPH scavenging activities were observed for HPE-BLF and HPE-LRF, with minimum EC₅₀ values of 1.26 and 1.18mg/mL, respectively. The HPE-BLF and HPE-LRF samples exhibited the most noticeable antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Shigella boydii (MICs<15mg/mL). The fermented C. lanceolata samples effectively inhibited α-glucosidase and tyrosinase activities and potentially improved a scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice. The application of a fermentation process can effectively improve the biological and pharmacological activities of high-pressure-extracted C. lanceolata by increasing the extraction efficacy and inducing probiotic conversion. The results suggest that the combined treatment of HPE and a fermentation process could be used as alternative extraction method over CE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium longum 3aCodonopsis lanceolata 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aShigella boydii 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aanti-infective properties 3aantioxidants 3acinnamic acid 3acognition 3acytotoxicity 3afermentation 3aflavonoids 3ahigh pressure treatment 3amemory 3amice 3aphenol 3aprobiotics1 aZou, Yunyun1 aYoon, Won-Byong1 aPark, Sung Jin,1 aPark, Dong-Sik1 aAhn, Juhee0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2011 Aug., v. 112, no. 2 p.188-193dElsevier B.V.x1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245016000174300001600334500001500350520160000365592002801965650001201993650001102005650001802016650002402034650002302058650001702081650001302098653001702111700001802128700002102146700002002167700002102187700001802208700001702226700002102243700002902264773012502293856005502418852000902473655001202482IND4473497420221119032951.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447349742DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.2011.01206.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aENNOS, RICHARD A.10aProcessâBased Species Action Plans: an approach to conserve contemporary evolutionary processes that sustain diversity in taxonomically complex groups  ap. 194-203.  a2019-12-06  aMany endemic plant species belong to taxonomically complex groups. These endemics have often arisen as a consequence of recent and rapid evolutionary divergence facilitated by processes such as hybridization, polyploidy and/or breeding system transitions. The rapid and dynamic nature of divergence in taxonomically complex groups leads to problems in the implementation of traditional speciesâbased approaches for the conservation of the biodiversity that they contain. Firstly, the taxa of interest can be difficult to define and identify, leading to practical difficulties in implementing conservation measures. Secondly, a speciesâbased approach often fails to capture the complexity of diversity present in the taxonomically complex group. To accommodate these challenges, we have developed a ProcessâBased Species Action Plan approach. This is designed to conserve the processes leading to the generation of biodiversity, rather than focusing on the preservation of individual named taxa. We illustrate the approach using a group of endemic tree species (Sorbus) on the Scottish island of Arran that have originated via a combination of multiple recent hybridization events and apomixis. The plan focuses on the optimization of habitat management to ensure the reproduction and regeneration of Sorbus in the zone in which these evolutionary processes operate, and to facilitate hybridization that will ensure the continued generation of diversity in this group.âÂ© 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, 168, 194â203.  aPublisher supplied data 3aislands 3aSorbus 3ahybridization 3adivergent evolution 3aindigenous species 3abiodiversity 3ahabitats 0areproduction1 aWHITLOCK, RAJ1 aFay, Michael F.,1 aJones, Barbara,1 aNEAVES, LINDA E.1 aPayne, Robin,1 aTaylor, Ian,1 aDE VERE, NATASHA1 aHollingsworth, Peter M.,0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g2012 Feb., v. 168, no. 2 p.194-203dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2011.01206.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002900181245009600210506007600306520148800382592002801870506003701898650001801935650002501953650001701978650001601995650001502011650001802026650001402044650001402058650000902072650001302081650001602094650001202110650001102122650002002133650002302153700002302176700002602199700002502225700002202250700002402272700002302296700002602319700002102345700002802366773012602394856007402520852000902594655001202603IND60649789320221207131803.0190706e20190614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064978932DNAL7 a10.3390/md170603542doi7 aPMC66274962pmcid7 a312078712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuluaga Tamayo, Marisol 10aAstaxanthin Complexes to Attenuate Muscle Damage after In Vivo Femoral Ischemia-Reperfusion  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a(1) Background: Reperfusion injury refers to the cell and tissue damage induced, when blood flow is restored after an ischemic period. While reperfusion reestablishes oxygen supply, it generates a high concentration of radicals, resulting in tissue dysfunction and damage. Here, we aimed to challenge and achieve the potential of a delivery system based on astaxanthin, a natural antioxidant, in attenuating the muscle damage in an animal model of femoral hind-limb ischemia and reperfusion. (2) Methods: The antioxidant capacity and non-toxicity of astaxanthin was validated before and after loading into a polysaccharide scaffold. The capacity of astaxanthin to compensate stress damages was also studied after ischemia induced by femoral artery clamping and followed by varied periods of reperfusion. (3) Results: Histological evaluation showed a positive labeling for CD68 and CD163 macrophage markers, indicating a remodeling process. In addition, higher levels of Nrf2 and NQO1 expression in the sham group compared to the antioxidant group could reflect a reduction of the oxidative damage after 15 days of reperfusion. Furthermore, non-significant differences were observed in non-heme iron deposition in both groups, reflecting a cell population susceptible to free radical damage. (4) Conclusions: Our results suggest that the in situ release of an antioxidant molecule could be effective in improving the antioxidant defenses of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-damaged muscles.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aastaxanthin 3ablood flow 3afree radicals 3ahindlimbs 3ahistology 3airon 3aischemia 3amacrophages 3amuscles 3aoxygen 3apolysaccharides 3areperfusion injury1 aChoudat, Laurence 1 aAid-Launais, Rachida 1 aThibaudeau, Olivier 1 aLouedec, Liliane 1 aLetourneur, Didier 1 aGueguen, Virginie 1 aMeddahi-Pellé, Anne 1 aCouvelard, Anne 1 aPavon-Djavid, Graciela 0 tMarine drugs.g2019 June 14, v. 17, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md170603543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009100167500001900258520087600277592002801153650001001181650002501191650000901216650001301225650002001238650001001258650001801268650001701286650001101303650000901314650003301323650002001356653000901376653001701385653000801402653000801410653001701418700001801435700002601453700002601479773009501505856008601600852000901686655001201695IND60716173520221120075113.0210212e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071617352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2020.1083612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSezer, Banu10aProtein based evaluation of meat species by using laser induced breakdown spectroscopy  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMeat adulteration through partial substitution with cheaper species or mislabeling causes significant problems in terms of health, religious beliefs, economy, and product quality.

Among these are the alkaloids, a group of small nitrogen-containing molecules. Alkaloids often have strong biological activity that protects alkaloid-producing plants from herbivores, and often accumulate to high concentrations in a specific organelle of a particular organ in the producing plant. However, knowledge of the membrane transport mechanism of alkaloids is still limited. Coptis japonica, a perennial Ranunculaceous plant, produces the benzylisoquinoline alkaloid berberine. This alkaloid, though biosynthesized in root tissues, accumulates in the rhizome, suggesting translocation of the molecule via xylem. In this study, a gene encoding a ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein of B-type, Cjabcb2, was isolated from C. japonica. Northern analysis showed that Cjabcb2 was preferentially expressed in the rhizome, which is the sink organ of berberine. Functional analysis of CjABCB2 using yeast suggested that CjABCB2 transports berberine in an inward direction. Membrane separation and in situ hybridization data indicated that CjABCB2 might be involved in translocation of berberine from the root to the rhizome by transporting berberine at the plasma membrane of cells around the xylem of the rhizome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoptis japonica 3aberberine 3abioactive properties 3agenes 3aherbivores 3ain situ hybridization 3aplasma membrane 3asecondary metabolites 3axylem 3ayeasts 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aAlkaloidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBiological Transport 2aCells, Cultured 2aCoptisxchemistryxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Structure 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 0aCoptis japonica 0aRanunculaceae 0aABC transporter 0aAlkaloid 0aBerberine 0aCjABCB2 0aTranslocation1 aDalmas, Fabien1 aDan, Kazuyuki1 aKato, Nobuhiko1 aUeda, Kazumitsu1 aSatō, Fumihiko,1 aForestier, Cyrille1 aYazaki, Kazufumi0 tPhytochemistry.g2013 July, v. 91 p.109-116dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02106naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014500171500001900316520089500335592002801230650001601258650000801274650001701282650001201299650001301311650001601324653001801340653002601358653001201384653001101396653001601407653002501423700001201448700001401460700001401474700001801488773009501506856008601601852000901687655001201696IND60716173620221120084758.0210212e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071617362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2020.1083622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColl-Brasas, E.10aProcessing parameters involved in the development of texture and tyrosine precipitates in dry-cured ham: Modelisation of texture development  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this study was to quantify the effects of different processing parameters on texture development and the incidence of white film and tyrosine crystals in dry-cured ham. Hams were dry-salted for 0.65, 0.8 or 1.0 days/kg. After drying for 45 days at 5 °C, they were dried at 10, 15 or 20 °C until reaching 33% weight loss and, thereafter, dried at 25 °C until reaching 36 or 40% weight loss. The salting time, drying temperature and target weight loss significantly affected the texture and incidence of white film and tyrosine crystals. A beneficial effect of drying at 20 °C on texture was found, which was especially important for low target weight loss (33%). Besides, hams dried at 20 °C and those with 40% weight loss showed higher incidence of tyrosine crystals.

Many entrepreneurs, particularly in the animal production, decided to go out of business, mainly because the continued operation of obsolete slaughterhouses would require considerable investment effort; at the end of the day, some meat producers closed their slaughter operations and focused on specialised meat processing. Compared with the year before, the profit of food processors declined by 23%. This was due to the faster decline in revenues than expenses, increased cost of revenues, and the reduced output. Although profitable companies still prevailed, the percentage of loss-making companies increased in comparison with the previous year. The starch industry, sugar industry and the confectionery (including coffee substitutes) industry were some of the sectors where all operators were profitable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acompliance 3aeconomic performance 3afood industry 3ahygiene 3ameat 3aslaughter 3astarch 3asugar industry 3asweets0 tZemědělská ekonomika.g, v. 50, no. 11 p.495-501dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:22848x0139-570X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/5239-agricecon3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141245008400166300001600250520142500266592002801691650002601719650001501745650001201760650001301772650002001785650001501805650002101820650002401841651001101865700002401876773012701900856007502027852000902102655001202111IND60649716120221119034730.0190705e20140313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064971612DNAL7 a10.3390/land30103002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEriksson, O.q(Ove),10aHistorical Landscape Perspectives on Grasslands in Sweden and the Baltic Region  ap. 300-321.  aA landscape perspective is generally recognized as essential for conservation biology. The main underlying reason is that species respond to features of the landscape at various spatial scales, for example habitat area, connectivity, and matrix habitats. However, there is also an “historical” component of a landscape perspective, which has not received similar attention. The underlying reasons for historical effects are that humans have influenced landscapes during several millennia and that species and communities may respond slowly to land use change. An historical perspective on landscapes also relates to how we perceive “natural” vs. “cultural” landscapes, and thus how conservation actions are motivated and valuated. We review studies from Sweden and the Baltic region in the context of an historical landscape perspective, focusing on semi-natural grasslands, i.e., grasslands formed by long-term human management for grazing and hay-making. Semi-natural grasslands are today a high concern for conservation. Historical effects are ubiquitous on species distributions and patterns of species richness, and have important implications for developing informed conservation programs in semi-natural grasslands, particularly with regard to assumptions of historical baselines, the choice of conservation targets, and insights on time-lags in the response of species to current landscape change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation programs 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3ahabitats 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3aspecies richness 3awildlife management 3aSweden1 aCousins, Sara A.

The result is a bullet-shaped structure surrounding the Sun—called the heliosphere—that demarcates the balance between the outward pressure of the solar wind and the inward pressure of the surrounding gas. Every day, the heliosphere encounters a mass equivalent to Mount Everest, of what is often referred to as empty space, but which actually consists of atoms (mostly hydrogen), molecules, and dust. Some of that material is trapped at the nose of the heliosphere, some is diverted around it, and some passes right through it. On page 1291 of this issue, McComas et al.

Herpetofauna community establishment on the microhabitat as a result of land mines fragmentation in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 18: 709-714. Herpetofauna community is established because of habitat suitability or adaptation process that forces a species to survive. In the mining region, herpetofauna habitat change has occurred. The loss of natural habitat and the creation of an artificial habitat result in severance of corridor as a connecting line between herpetofauna habitats so that only microhabitat remains. Microhabitats of herpetofauna survive on limited food resources. The process of surviving of herpetofauna in microhabitats is reflected on the phenomenon of the food chain i.e. reptiles act as predators (top) and amphibians are as preys and as insect predators (middle). In the mining area, an area with a source of water is the destination for all animals, especially herpetofauna, and it even becomes the microhabitat for certain species. The purpose of this study is to determine the species of herpetofauna, its communities and its domination on the water area its microhabitats within the mine area. The exploration is carried out by direct observation (visual encounter surveys). The survey location determination is done intentionally (purposive sampling) on the potential habitat in some locations of water sources, such as pit dam, settling pond, man-made lake (embung), rivers and swamps. Based on the similarity index, there are five species of herpetofauna dominating the life in microhabitats and playing role in the formation of food chain community. Enhydris enhydris and Dendrelaphis pictus are species of snake and act as predator of frog Fejervarya cancrivora and Polypedates leucomystax.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorneo 3aDendrelaphis 3aFejervarya 3aMuslims 3aPolypedates 3aartificial habitats 3afood chain 3afrogs 3aherpetofauna 3ainsects 3alakes 3amicrohabitats 3asnakes 3asurveys 3aIndonesia 0aherpetofauna 0amicrohabitat 0afragmentation 0amining area0 tBiodiversitas.g2017 Apr., v. 18, no. 2 p.709-714dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d1802393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02036naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245009400168300001800262520114200280592002801422650001201450650001101462650002001473650001601493700001901509700001601528773010401544856008901648852000901737655001201746IND60534299320221118122334.0160802e20160218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053429932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b026342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Qiunan10aKinetic Study on the Process of Cyclopentane + Methane Hydrate Formation in NaCl Solution  ap. 1310-1316.  aIn this work, the formation kinetics of cyclopentane (CP) + methane hydrate is studied. CP is used as a promoter to accelerate the hydrate formation. The total methane consumption, the induction time, and the formation rate were investigated under different hydrate formation conditions in NaCl solution. The results indicated that the pressure driving force could increase the gas consumption and shorten the induction time. Meanwhile, the induction time could be greatly influenced by the pressure driving force at a lower temperature. Especially, it could be shortened to a minimum value of 110 s with the increase of the pressure driving force at a fixed operating condition (CP concentration, 7.45%; NaCl solution concentration, 3.50%; and temperature, 298.15 K). Moreover, the hydrate formation rate would be accelerated with the increase of the stirring rate by its promotion in the dissolution and dispersion of methane. Finally, a higher CP concentration was favorable for the rapid hydrate formation of CP + CH₄ binary hydrates. The amount of CP used could determine the amount of methane incorporated into the hydrate phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3amethane 3amixing 3asodium chloride 3atemperature1 aSong, Yongchen1 aLi, Xiaosen0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 Feb. 18, v. 30, no. 2 p.1310-1316dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.5b026343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009900167300001600266520129700282592002801579650001501607650002501622650001601647653004101663653003801704653002901742653003901771700006301810700002201873773011301895856008602008852000902094655001202103IND60555387920221123030507.0180831e20161110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055538792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaas, Karen10aIntegrating corporate sustainability assessment, management accounting, control, and reporting  ap. 237-248.  aMuch has been written about “why” companies are involved in sustainability issues. However, relatively little research has addressed the integrative “how” question, particularly “how companies can and do integrate sustainability assessment, management accounting, management control, and reporting?” Corporate sustainability, however, requires integrative measurement and management of sustainability issues rather than isolated applications of different tools in the organization. This article reviews literature dealing with links and partial links between sustainability assessment, management accounting, management control, and reporting. The main findings show that the various concepts (performance assessment, management accounting, management control, and reporting) are defined and used in various ways but mainly dealt within an isolated manner. Based on these findings this paper proposes a comprehensive, integrated framework of sustainability assessment, accounting, control and reporting. From a scientific perspective, the proposed framework is a first attempt to integrate these isolated concepts. It can help researchers and practitioners to better understand how the four concepts are related and could be linked to each other to develop an integrated approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccounting 3abusiness enterprises 3aresearchers 0aSustainability management accounting 0aSustainability management control 0aSustainability reporting 0aIntegrated sustainability approach1 aSchaltegger, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7756-55261 aCrutzen, Nathalie0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Nov. 10, v. 136 p.237-248dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245014100155300002000296520148500316592002801801650001601829650003401845650002201879650001501901650002801916650001101944650001301955650001901968650001101987653002601998653001702024653002002041653002402061653003702085700001902122700001902141700001702160700002102177700002002198700002102218700001802239700001802257700002002275773012602295856007502421852000902496655001202505IND60527799220170710000000.0160715e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052779922DNAL7 a10.1021/am506465b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeyer, Paul10aLattice Matching as the Determining Factor for Molecular Tilt and Multilayer Growth Mode of the Nanographene Hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene  ap. 21484-21493.  aThe microstructure, morphology, and growth dynamics of hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC, C₄₂H₁₈) thin films deposited on inert substrates of similar surface energies are studied with particular emphasis on the influence of substrate symmetry and substrate–molecule lattice matching on the resulting films of this material. By combining atomic force microscopy (AFM) with X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (NEXAFS), and in situ X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements, it is shown that HBC forms polycrystalline films on SiO₂, where molecules are oriented in an upright fashion and adopt the known bulk structure. Remarkably, HBC films deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) exhibit a new, substrate-induced polymorph, where all molecules adopt a recumbent orientation with planar π-stacking. Formation of this new phase, however, depends critically on the coherence of the underlying graphite lattice since HBC grown on defective HOPG reveals the same orientation and phase as on SiO₂. These results therefore demonstrate that the resulting film structure and morphology are not solely governed by the adsorption energy but also by the presence or absence of symmetry- and lattice-matching between the substrate and admolecules. Moreover, it highlights that weakly interacting substrates of high quality and coherence can be useful to induce new polymorphs with distinctly different molecular arrangements than the bulk structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3aenergy 3agraphene 3amicrostructure 3asilica 0aorganic semiconductor 0ananographene 0aX-ray structure 0amorphology of films 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons1 aBreuer, Tobias1 aNdiaye, Saliou1 aZykov, Anton1 aViertel, Andreas1 aGensler, Manuel1 aRabe, Jürgen P.1 aHecht, Stefan1 aWitte, Gregor1 aKowarik, Stefan0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 6, no. 23 p.21484-21493dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam506465b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03622naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007600170500001900246520214500265592002802410650000802438650002502446650001702471650001602488650001602504650001602520650001302536650001002549650002202559650002002581650001602601650003102617650001902648650001502667651001002682653001502692653002902707653003902736653002402775700001502799700002102814700001602835700002002851700001202871700001802883773010702901856008703008852000903095655001203104IND60727218220221120123140.0210401e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072721822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1182212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Chengyuan10aUnderstanding the impact of meteorology on ozone in 334 cities of China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe daily variations of near-surface ozone (O₃), one of the major air pollutants in China, depend on meteorological conditions. In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of O₃ pollution and the complicated interactions among the controlling meteorological factors. In China, O₃ pollution is becoming severe and high-concentration areas are expanding greatly. We found that O₃ was correlated to numerous meteorological variables including air pressure, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, sunshine duration, evaporation, and precipitation. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), we developed predictive models to forecast the maximum daily 8 h O₃ mass concentration for 334 cities in China. Different cities were influenced by different meteorological variables, with temperature (90.77%), relative humidity (68.15%), and sunshine hours (66.96%) being the top three influencing factors. In addition, we found that the influence of these meteorological factors on O₃ pollution was nonlinear and impacted by the interaction between variables. Considering individual relationships between each meteorological factor and O₃, the average coefficient of determination (R²) of GAMs for the 334 cities was 0.64 ± 0.16. However, considering the interaction between variables, the average R² for 334 cities of revised GAMs increased to 0.72 ± 0.15. The R² was significantly improved in 96.72% of the cities after considering the interactions among the meteorological factors based on a ten-fold cross-validation method. Furthermore, we found that the GAM residuals were unbiased. As an example of using and interpreting the GAM results, we focused on a case study in Hangzhou during the G20 summit in 2016. During this period, nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) and volatile organic compounds were reduced by 51.67% and 49.00%, respectively, because of local emission controls. Despite these changes in precursor emissions, O₃ changed slightly during this period, suggesting that O₃ in Hangzhou at the time was not controlled by local precursor emissions, but was impacted by meteorological conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatmospheric pressure 3acase studies 3aenvironment 3aevaporation 3ameteorology 3anitrogen 3aozone 3arelative humidity 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3avolatile organic compounds 3awind direction 3awind speed 3aChina 0aOzone (O3) 0aMeteorological condition 0aGeneralized additive models (GAMs) 0aHangzhou G20 summit1 aKang, Ping1 aJaffe, Daniel A.1 aLi, Chunkai1 aZhang, Xiaoling1 aWu, Kai1 aZhou, Mingwei0 tAtmospheric environment.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 248 p.118221-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.1182213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008900167300001800256520164600274592002801920650001701948650001501965650003501980650001702015650002802032650002002060651001302080651001302093653003702106653002202143653003202165653002102197700001602218700001802234700001302252700001802265773011502283856008602398852000902484655001202493IND60555388020221123034142.0180831e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055538802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.05.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGabriel, A.10aImproving the idea selection process in creative workshops through contextualisation  ap. 1503-1513.  aCreativity workshops (i.e. brainstorming, creativity contests and design jams) are increasingly being used by organisations to explore new design spaces and find original ideas for new products or services. The selection of ideas resulting from these creative processes is a key activity for a firm, as it serves as a foundation for time management and decisions on further investments. Moreover, the selection of promising ideas has a more significant impact than the creative process itself as it colours the overall innovation process. We argue that this type of decision is strongly context dependent. That is, the selection process is conditioned by several factors such as the firm's technological and organisational capabilities and its strategy. This implies that a relevant idea for a particular company is not necessarily relevant for another. This paper proposes a context formalisation approach, supported by multi-criteria decision-making analysis tools to evaluate ideas resulting from a creative workshop. This evaluation process seeks to assist the decision-making by requiring success criteria to take into account the firm's context and priorities and give decision-makers the keys to establish a coherent evaluation. Implementation of this approach during a creative workshop validates the appeal of this type of contextualised evaluation. It contributes to the field of practical application of ideas in productive environments. The proposed methodology is illustrated through a case study on the new eco-tourism services for the city of Leticia in the Amazonian region of Colombia with a view to sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aecotourism 3amulti-criteria decision making 3anew products 3asustainable development 3atime management 3aAmazonia 3aColombia 0aMulti-criteria decision analysis 0aCreative workshop 0aIdea evaluation methodology 0aCreative process1 aCamargo, M.1 aMonticolo, D.1 aBoly, V.1 aBourgault, M.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 135 p.1503-1513dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.05.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245019800202506007600400520158900476592002802065506003702093650001902130650001902149650001802168650001002186650001602196650001702212650001602229650001102245650002202256650001802278650002402296650001002320650001602330650001702346650001802363650003702381650001402418650002002432650002302452650003202475700002002507700002102527700001702548700001902565700001802584700002602602700002102628700003102649773012602680856007402806852000902880655001202889IND60649789920221207132849.0190706e20190617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064978992DNAL7 a10.3390/md170603602doi7 aPMC66271052pmcid7 a312130272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJan, Jing-Shiun 10aHirsutanol A Attenuates Lipopolysaccharide-Mediated Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 Expression and Cytokines Production and Improves Endotoxemia-Induced Acute Sickness Behavior and Acute Lung Injury  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aActivated human monocytes/macrophages, which increase the levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, are the essential mechanisms for the progression of sepsis. In the present study, we determined the functions and mechanisms of hirsutanolA (HA), which is isolated from the red alga-derived marine fungus Chondrostereum sp. NTOU4196, on the production of pro-inflammatory mediators produced from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated THP-1 cells. Our results showed that HA suppressed LPS-triggered MMP-9-mediated gelatinolysis and expression of protein and mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner without effects on TIMP-1 activity. Also, HA significantly attenuated the levels of TNF-&alpha;, IL-6, and IL-1&beta; from LPS-treated THP-1 cells. Moreover, HA significantly inhibited LPS-mediated STAT3 (Tyr705) phosphorylation, I&kappa;B&alpha; degradation and ERK1/2 activation in THP-1 cells. In an LPS-induced endotoxemia mouse model, studies indicated that HA pretreatment improved endotoxemia-induced acute sickness behavior, including acute motor deficits and anxiety-like behavior. HA also attenuated LPS-induced phospho-STAT3 and pro-MMP-9 activity in the hippocampus. Notably, HA reduced pathologic lung injury features, including interstitial tissue edema, infiltration of inflammatory cells and alveolar collapse. Likewise, HA suppressed the induction of phospho-STAT3 and pro-MMP-9 in lung tissues. In conclusion, our results provide pharmacological evidence that HA could be a useful agent for treating inflammatory diseases, including sepsis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChondrostereum 3aIKappaB kinase 3aanimal models 3aedema 3aendotoxemia 3agelatinase B 3ahippocampus 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3alungs 3amacrophages 3amarine fungi 3amessenger RNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amonocytes 3aphosphorylation 3asepsis (infection) 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aYang, Chih-Hao 1 aWang, Mong-Heng 1 aLin, Fan-Li 1 aYen, Jing-Lun 1 aHsieh, Irene 1 aKhotimchenko, Maksim 1 aLee, Tzong-Huei 1 aHsiao, G.

CONTEXT: Interspecific hybridization and polyploidy are important evolutionary phenomena in vascular plants. Natural hybridization between species living in sympatry can sometimes occur. Less frequent are successful hybridizations between species having different ploidy levels. At Saint Crépin location (French Alps), where sympatry between the tetraploid Juniperus thurifera and the diploid Juniperus sabina occurs, three individuals with an atypical morphology have been observed. AIMS: Prospect interspecific hybrids and interspecific genetic introgression occurrence. METHODS: Flow cytometry was employed to screen ploidy levels. Four chloroplast markers, nrDNA (ITS), and AFLP markers were used to unravel hybridization and potential introgression events. Variability of pollen size and morphology was assessed to have a first insight on the regularity of microsporogenesis in hybrids. RESULTS: The three putative hybrids were shown to be triploids. Molecular data demonstrated that these individuals were hybrids originated from a cross between J. sabina and J. thurifera and suggested that a backcross at least with J. thurifera is possible. Male triploid hybrids produced heterogeneous pollen and displayed evidence of irregularity in the microsporogenesis. CONCLUSION: This study sheds light on a rare case of hybridization in a natural sympatric population of two Juniperus species with different ploidy levels. This mechanism might have been an important driver for the evolution and diversification of this coniferous genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuniperus sabina 3aJuniperus thurifera 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abackcrossing 3achloroplasts 3adiploidy 3aevolution 3aflow cytometry 3agenetic markers 3ahybrids 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aintrogression 3amales 3amicrosporogenesis 3apollen 3apollen size 3aribosomal DNA 3asympatry 3atetraploidy 3atriploidy 3avascular plants 3aAlps region 3aFrance1 aTakvorian, Najat1 aAvramidou, Maria1 aGarraud, Luc1 aAdams, Robert P.1 aSiljak-Yakovlev, Sonja1 aKharrat, Magda Bou Dagher1 aRobert, Thierry0 tAnnals of forest science.g2020 Dec., v. 77, no. 4 p.93-93dSpringer PariswJournal:2137x1286-45607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-020-00969-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245011600198506007600314520103800390592002801428506003701456650001701493650002401510650002201534650001201556650002501568650001101593650001901604650002201623650001901645650002601664650001701690651001801707700001801725700001801743700001801761700001601779700001601795773012501811856007401936852000902010655001202019IND60649790020221207110237.0190706e20190529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064979002DNAL7 a10.3390/md170603162doi7 aPMC66278092pmcid7 a311463772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yashu 10aPotential TSPO Ligand and Photooxidation Quencher Isorenieratene from Arctic Ocean <i>Rhodococcus</i> sp. B7740  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDue to its special aromatic structure, isorenieratene is thought to be an active natural antioxidant and photo/UV damage inhibitor. In this work, isorenieratene that was extracted from Rhodococcus sp. B7740 isolated from the Arctic Ocean, showed excellent scavenging ability of both singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical in the UVB-induced auto-oxidation process using the EPR method. Within an ARPE-19 cell model damaged by UVB radiation, isorenieratene showed fine protective effects (1.13 &plusmn; 0.03 fold) compared with macular xanthophylls (MXs) through upregulating of tspo. The molecular docking was firstly performed to investigate the interaction of isorenieratene with TSPO as a special ligand. Results showed isorenieratene might form a better binding conformation (S-score &minus;8.5438) than MXs and indicate that isorenieratene not only can function as a direct antioxidant but also activate tspo in ARPE-19 cells. Thus, isorenieratene might ease the UV-related damages including age-related macular degeneration (AMD).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautoxidation 3acomputer simulation 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aligands 3amacular degeneration 3amodels 3aphotooxidation 3aprotective effect 3asinglet oxygen 3aultraviolet radiation 3axanthophylls 3aArctic region1 aGuo, Mengyao 1 aYang, Jifang 1 aChen, Jigang 1 aXie, Bijun 1 aSun, Zhida 0 tMarine drugs.g2019 May 29, v. 17, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md170603163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012300166300001600289520116800305592002801473650002001501650004201521650001501563650001901578650000901597650001301606650002001619650001001639650001801649653002001667653001201687653001601699653003001715653001001745653001701755700001601772700001501788700001701803700001701820700001201837700001201849700001701861700001701878700001701895700001801912700005701930773013901987856008202126852000902208655001202217IND60596987820221119102138.0180622e20180825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059698782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.05.1972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaodan10amiRNA editing landscape reveals miR-34c regulated spermatogenesis through structure and target change in pig and mouse  ap. 486-492.  aSpermatogenesis has a close relationship with male infertility. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in their regulation of target genes during spermatogenesis. A huge dataset of high-throughput sequencing all over the world provides the basis to dig the cryptic molecular mechanism. But how to take advantage of the big data and unearth the miRNA regulation is still a challenging problem. Here we integrated transcriptome of spermatogenesis and found miRNA regulate spermatogenesis through miRNA editing. We then compared different species and found that the distributions of miRNA editing site number and editing types among different cell types during spermatogenesis are conservative. Interesting, we further found that nearly half of the editing events occurred in the seed region in both mouse and pig. Finally, we foundmiR-34c, which is edited frequently at all stages during spermatogenesis, regulates its target genes through the RNA structure changing and shows dysfunction when it is edited. Summary, we depicted the overall profile of miRNA editing during spermatogenesis in mouse and pig and reveal miR-34c may play its roles through miRNA editing.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3alandscapes 3amale fertility 3amice 3amicroRNA 3aspermatogenesis 3aswine 3atranscriptome 0aSpermatogenesis 0amiR-34c 0aRNA editing 0aIntegrative transcriptome 0aMotif 0aConservative1 aZhang, Peng1 aLi, Leijie1 aChe, Dongxue1 aLi, Tongtong1 aLi, Hao1 aLi, Qun1 aJia, Haiyang1 aTao, Shiheng1 aHua, Jinlian1 aZeng, Wenxian1 aLiao, Mingzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5216-57420 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Aug. 25, v. 502 p.486-492dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.05.1973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245005900156300002000215520157400235592002801809650002201837650001401859650001401873650001101887650001301898650002201911650002101933650001801954650002401972650003301996650001202029650001602041650003702057653002402094653002402118653002402142653003202166653001302198653001902211700001502230700002302245700002002268773012602288856007502414852000902489655001202498IND60527799520221121232456.0160715e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052779952DNAL7 a10.1021/am506498p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jianxin10aSolution Deposition of Thin Carbon Coatings on LiFePO4  ap. 21550-21557.  aWe report the synthesis of ultrathin carbon coatings on polycrystalline LiFePO₄ via solution deposition and subsequent annealing. The annealing temperature was systematically investigated with polymer systems on LiFePO₄ nanostructures. The crystal structures, sizes, and morphologies were monitored and analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Micro-Raman and TEM were used to interrogate the carbon coatings after heat-treatments. Electrochemical performance of coated materials was investigated by cyclic voltammograms (CVs) and galvanostatic charge–discharge analysis. The olivine structured LiFePO₄ remained stable up to 600 °C but underwent a rapid reduction reaction from LiFePO₄ to Fe₂P above 700 °C. The good compatibility between polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the surface of LiFePO₄ enabled the formation of core–shell structure, which was transformed into a thin carbon coating on LiFePO₄ after annealing. Both PEG and sucrose carbon-based sources yielded high-quality carbon coatings after annealing, as determined by the graphitic/disordered (G/D) ratios of 1.30 and 1.20, respectively. By producing more uniform and coherent coatings on LiFePO₄ particles, batteries with significantly less carbon (i.e., 0.41 wt %) were fabricated and demonstrated comparable performance to traditionally synthesized carbon-coated LiFePO₄ with higher carbon loadings (ca. 2.64 wt %). This will enable development of batteries with higher active material loading and therefore significantly larger energy densities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aannealing 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acoatings 3acrystal structure 3aelectrochemistry 3ananomaterials 3apolyethylene glycol 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asucrose 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0alithium ion battery 0aconductive coatings 0asolution deposition 0aelectrochemical performance 0agraphite 0aenergy density1 aYoo, Kevin1 aEl-halees, Ibrahim1 aKisailus, David0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 6, no. 23 p.21550-21557dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam506498p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245012500170506002800295520170200323592002802025506003702053650002802090650001602118650002002134650002202154650002202176650001402198650001502212650002102227650001102248650001402259651001402273653002802287653002002315653002002335653000902355653000902364700002502373700002002398700002402418700002502442773009302467856008002560852000902640655001202649IND60764548420221215143102.0211121e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076454842DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2012162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArif, Muhammad Fauzi10aShort Communication: rbcL and matK chloroplast DNA composition of green chireta (Andrographis paniculata) from Indonesia  aResource is Open Access  aArif MF, Aristya GR, Subositi D, Sai AN, Kasiamdari RS. 2019. Short Communication: rbcL and matK chloroplast DNA composition of green chireta (Andrographis paniculata) from Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 3575-3583. Green chireta (Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Wall. ex Nees.) is often used by the traditional community as a medicinal herb in Indonesia. However, nucleotide study of green chireta from Indonesia has never been done. The objectives of this study were to analyze the rbcL and matK chloroplast gene composition of green chireta from Indonesia and to analyze the relationship with other Andrographis species. The result proved that all the DNA composition of green chireta used in this study was similar to the A. paniculata from GenBank. The rbcL composition was similar to A. paniculata KF521878, A. paniculata JQ922118, and A. paniculata JQ230990 from GenBank while the matK composition was similar to A. paniculata LC461762. Total 501 bp of rbcL and 639 bp of matK can be aligned produced 167 and 213 amino acid from translation. The amino acid translation result showed no different expression from rbcL genes but there was one sample expressed different translations from the matK gene. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the Neighbor-Joining method with 1000 bootstrap values and the Kimura 2-Parameter (K2P) model in the MEGA7 software. Both rbcL and matK genes grouped the samples into the same clade as A. paniculata from GenBank. No variation was detected from the rbcL gene but two haplotypes were detected from the matK gene. This composition and sequence data serve as a database for Andrographis species from Indonesia which can be used for various studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAndrographis paniculata 3aamino acids 3achloroplast DNA 3achloroplast genes 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3ahaplotypes 3amedicinal plants 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3aIndonesia 0aandrographis paniculata 0achloroplast dna 0amedicinal plant 0arbcl 0amatk1 aAristya, Ganies Riza1 aSubositi, Dyah 1 aSari, Aniska Novita1 aKasiamdari, Rina Sri0 tBiodiversitas.g2019 Nov., v. 20, no. 12dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2012163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002500172245008500197300001600282520089500298592002801193650001501221650002001236650002201256650001401278650001701292650001001309650002201319650001201341650001401353650001201367650001301379650002301392650003201415650002401447650002801471650003601499650002401535653002401559653002001583653002201603653001701625653001401642653002001656653001601676653001901692653001701711700001901728700002101747773009701768856008801865852000901953655001201962IND60113564920221122033746.0190318e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011356492DNAL7 a236842362pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2013.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatsis, Evangelos C.10aOccurrence of nudicaulin structural variants in flowers of papaveraceous species  ap. 105-112.  aThe intense color of yellow Papaver nudicaule flowers is conferred by the presence of nudicaulins, a group of alkaloids with a unique pentacyclic skeleton composed of an indole ring and a polyphenolic moiety. Petals from eight different Papaveraceae species composed of different color varieties were probed for the presence of nudicaulins. In addition to their occurrence in yellow P. nudicaule flowers, nudicaulins I–VIII were detected and quantified in orange flowers of P. nudicaule, and in yellow and orange Papaver alpinum flowers. Meconopsis cambrica petals showed a divergent nudicaulin spectrum, with compounds having an attached 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl group (HMG) instead of a malonyl unit at one of the glucose units. Flavonols and anthocyanins that accompany nudicaulins were identified. The taxonomical significance of the occurrence of nudicaulins is briefly discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeconopsis 3aPapaver alpinum 3aPapaver nudicaule 3aalkaloids 3aanthocyanins 3acolor 3acolored varieties 3acorolla 3aflavonols 3aglucose 3askeleton 2aFlowersxchemistry 2aIndole Alkaloidsxchemistry 2aMolecular Structure 2aPapaveraceaexchemistry 2aPigments, Biologicalxchemistry 2aSpecies Specificity 0aMeconopsis cambrica 0aPapaver alpinum 0aPapaver nudicaule 0aAnthocyanins 0aFlavonols 0aFlower pigments 0aNudicaulins 0aHMG conjugates 0aPapaveraceae1 aBöhm, Hartmut1 aSchneider, Bernd0 tPhytochemistry.g2013 Aug., v. 92 p.105-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2013.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013100162300001600293520163900309592002801948650001601976650001401992650001302006650001102019650002102030650001502051650001002066650001502076650001702091650001302108650001402121650004302135650005202178650001702230650001202247653001702259653001402276653000902290653000902299653001002308700005302318700001302371700001602384700001702400700002002417700001902437773013902456856008202595852000902677655001202686IND60596987920221119102053.0180622e20180825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059698792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.05.1982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Lei10aFOXP4-AS1 participates in the development and progression of osteosarcoma by downregulating LATS1 via binding to LSD1 and EZH2  ap. 493-500.  aOsteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. LncRNA has been confirmed to participate in a variety of cancers. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of FOXP4-AS1 on the development of osteosarcoma (OS) and its underlying mechanism. FOXP4-AS1 expressions in 60 OS tissues and paracancerous tissues were detected by qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction). We confirmed that FOXP4-AS1 was overexpressed in OS tissues than that of paracancerous tissues. The disease-free survival and overall survival of OS patients were not correlated with age, gender and tumor location, but remarkably correlated with FOXP4-AS1 expression, tumor size and lung metastasis. For in vitro experiments, MG63 cells expressed a higher expression of FOXP4-AS1, whereas U2OS cells expressed a lower expression, which were selected for the following studies. Overexpressed FOXP4-AS1 led to enhanced proliferation, migration and invasion, shortened G0/G1 phase, as well as inhibited cell cycle. Knockdown of FOXP4-AS1 in MG63 cells obtained the opposite results. Furthermore, RIP assay indicated that FOXP4-AS1 could inhibit LATS1 expression by binding to LSD1 and EZH2, so as to participate in OS development. In conclusion, these results revealed that FOXP4-AS1 is overexpressed in OS, and is the independent risk factor in OS prognosis. Upregulated FOXP4-AS1 promotes the proliferation, migration and cell cycle, but inhibits apoptosis of OS cells. Furthermore, FOXP4-AS1 participates in the development and progression of OS by downregulating LATS1 via binding to LSD1 and EZH2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aapoptosis 3achildren 3agender 3ain vitro studies 3ainterphase 3alungs 3ametastasis 3aosteosarcoma 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arisk factors 3atissues 0aOsteosarcoma 0aFOXP4-AS1 0aLSD1 0aEZH2 0aLATS11 aGe, Dawei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3603-34481 aChen, Xi1 aQiu, Junjun1 aYin, Zhaowei1 aZheng, Shengnai1 aJiang, Chunzhi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Aug. 25, v. 502 p.493-500dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.05.1983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01771naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001800142245007600160520073500236592002800971650001400999650001801013650003001031653002001061653001701081653002301098653002001121653001901141653001301160653001801173700001901191700002101210773010301231856007801334852000901412655001201421IND4461250720221120131222.0160209e20110622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446125072DNAL7 a10.2202/1556-3758.22112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerarasu, V T10aHeat Transfer Studies in Coiled Agitated Vessel with Varying Heat Input  aHeat transfer studies in a coiled agitated vessel with varying heat input is presented using two agitators namely propeller and disk turbine.

The heat transfer coefficient also increases with heat input for a given agitator speed for turbine agitator for all the heat inputs, whereas for propeller it is increasing up to a certain value and then decreases. The heat transfer coefficient (heat transfer rate) for turbine agitator is higher than that for propeller for all heat inputs.

It is still not clear which species are optimal for a microalgae biorefinery, as well as the influence of their composition on the biocrude oil molecular composition. Moreover, the molecular characterization itself of the HTL biocrude oils is troublesome because of the presence of a huge number of different molecular constituents. In this work, a stepwise Py-GC-MS procedure, originally developed to solve certain issues of conventional GC-MS analysis, was further improved using a non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) assisted peak resolution. This procedure not only increased the speed of GC-MS interpretation and made it more objective, it also disclosed additional information on certain HTL biocrude constituents which are usually neglected by the manual data handling and it minimized the fraction of unidentified compounds. With this novel analysis strategy, the biocrude oils produced during a screening with 8 different microalgae strains at two different process conditions (250 and 375 °C, both for 5 min) were analyzed. Main chemical constituents produced by HTL were quantified, obtaining a satisfactory chemical description of this matrix. The results revealed that the influence of process conditions was more important than the difference in the strains applied. Moreover, even if different biocrude yields were observed, the chemical composition results were similar for the different algal strains when processed at the same temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3achemical composition 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aliquefaction 3amicroalgae 3ascreening 3atemperature1 aLópez Barreiro, Diego1 aConti, Roberto1 aFabbri, Daniele1 aBrilman, Wim0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 Feb. 18, v. 30, no. 2 p.1135-1144dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.5b026883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008400168300001400252520107500266536037101341592002801712596004901740596002301789650002101812650001001833650001401843650002301857650000901880650001901889650001601908650001901924650002501943653002401968653001701992653001602009700001502025700001502040700001802055700001702073773012502090856008502215852000902300655001202309IND60638900720221118055735.0190501e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063890072DNAL7 a10.1080/17429145.2017.12793562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzeem, Ahmad10aPhotosynthetic response of two okra cultivars under salt stress and re-watering  ap. 67-77.  aTwo cultivars of okra (Chinese green and Chinese red) were subjected to salt stress (0%, 6%, 12% and 18%) and equal proportions of NaCl and CaCl₂ in Hoagland’s nutrient solution and re-watering. Salt stress significantly reduced growth parameters and photosynthetic attributes of both cultivars. Treatment subjected to 18% salt stress caused 90% redundancy in growth parameters of both cultivars compared to control. Re-watering gave a positive response for plant growth of both cultivars in different levels. Chinese green showed better recovery at 6–0% re-watering level and Chinese red showed 12–6% and 6–0%, due to its salt tolerance nature. Considering re-watering water use efficiency and net photosynthetic rate the optimum values of salt tolerance for Chinese green and Chinese red were 8.3% and 12.02%, respectively. The best re-watering degree found as salt stress level ranged from 12.02% to 6% for Chinese red and 8.3% to 2.3% for Chinese green. This study provided a new method for the determination of irrigation time and quantification in crops.  aThis study was supported by the project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 31301243]; the national key basic research program (973) special projects [2013CB956701], the Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, the research foundation for introduce talents of Jiangsu University [13JDG030].  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cJiangsu University 3acalcium chloride 3acrops 3acultivars 3anutrient solutions 3aokra 3aphotosynthesis 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3awater use efficiency 0aphotosynthetic rate 0aplant growth 0are-watering1 aWu, Yanyou1 aXing, Deke1 aJaved, Qaiser1 aUllah, Ikram0 tJournal of plant interactions.g2017 Jan. 1, v. 12, no. 1 p.67-77dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000112x1742-91537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17429145.2017.12793563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03968naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002500181245014200206506007600348520192400424592002802348506003702376650002202413650001202435650002402447650002502471650002102496650002002517650002602537650002702563650002102590650001602611650001302627650002002640650001602660650002002676650001502696650002602711650002402737650002502761650001802786650003202804650003302836650001102869650002902880650001702909650002202926650001102948700002202959700001702981700002302998700001803021700002103039700002103060700002803081773012603109856007403235852000903309655001203318IND60649787220221207131457.0190706e20190604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064978722DNAL7 a10.3390/md170603352doi7 aPMC66273672pmcid7 a311674552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Costa, Elisabete 10aLipidomic Signatures Reveal Seasonal Shifts on the Relative Abundance of High-Valued Lipids from the Brown Algae <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i>  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFucus vesiculosus is an edible brown macroalga, with health benefits associated with its consumption and also a source of bioactive molecules. It is acknowledged that the biochemical composition of macroalgae changes when exposed to different environmental conditions occurring on different habitats, such as the water temperature, and light intensity. In the present study, the polar lipidome of Fucus vesiculosus was characterized for the first time using modern high-resolution HILIC&ndash;MS, and MS/MS approaches, to evaluate the phenotypic variability in two seasons of the year, e.g., winter and spring. A total of 187 molecular species were identified over eighteen classes of glycolipids, phospholipids and betaine lipids. Principal component analysis (PCA) multivariate statistical analysis and cluster analysis of polar lipid classes, polar lipid species and total fatty acids (FA) datasets, showed clustering according to the seasonal groups. While the lipid profile of Fucus vesiculosus harvested in the winter and spring yielded the same molecular species, the relative abundance of these species was significantly different. In the winter, changes were mainly due to the increased relative abundance of some molecular species of glycolipids and phospholipids, bearing octadeca(poly)enoic (18:3, 18:4) and eicosa(poly)enoic (20:4, 20:5) FA and betaine lipids species with short saturated FA (14:0) and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA). Importantly, glycolipids with n-3 PUFA and sulfolipids, have been reported to have important biological activities and therapeutic value. Overall, Fucus vesiculosus is a promising source of bioactive compounds that can be used as functional food or ingredients for human nutrition, feed, pharma, and cosmetic formulations. In this study, samples harvested in the winter season maximized yields of these bioactive components, when compared with samples harvested in the spring.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFucus vesiculosus 3abetaine 3abioactive compounds 3abioactive properties 3acluster analysis 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3afatty acid composition 3afunctional foods 3aglycolipids 3ahabitats 3ahuman nutrition 3aingredients 3alight intensity 3amacroalgae 3amultivariate analysis 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aphenotypic variation 3aphospholipids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aprincipal component analysis 3aspring 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atherapeutics 3awater temperature 3awinter1 aDomingues, Pedro 1 aMelo, Tania,1 aCoelho, Elisabete 1 aPereira, Rui 1 aCalado, Ricardo 1 aAbreu, Maria  H.1 aDomingues, M.

Little is known about the land cover changes and conversion rates on La Gonave. Using Landsat images from 1990 to 2010, this research investigates landscape dynamics through image classification, change detection, and landscape pattern analysis. Five land cover classes were considered: Agriculture, Forest/Dense Vegetation (DV), Shrub, Barren/Eroded, and Nonforested Wetlands. Overall image classification accuracy was 87%. Results of land cover change analysis show that all major land cover types experienced substantial changes from 1990 to 2010. The area percent change was −39.7, −22.7, 87.4, and −7.0 for Agriculture, Forest/Dense Vegetation, Shrub, and Barren/Eroded. Landscape pattern analysis illustrated the encroachment of Shrub cover in core Forest/DV patches and the decline of Agricultural patch integrity. Agricultural abandonment, deforestation, and forest regrowth combined to generate a dynamic island landscape, resulting in higher levels of land cover fragmentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3adeforestation 3aforests 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3alifestyle 3areforestation 3ashrubs 3awetlands 3aHaiti1 aShao, Yang1 aKennedy, Lisa M.1 aCampbell, James B.0 tLand.g2013 Sept. 16, v. 2, no. 3 p.493-507dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land20304933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245014500158300002000303520123100323592002801554650002201582650001701604650002601621650001501647650002101662650001101683650001301694650001601707653002701723653003701750653002301787653001401810653003601824653002501860700002101885700002001906700002001926700002001946773012601966856007502092852000902167655001202176IND60527796620170710000000.0160715e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052779662DNAL7 a10.1021/am506245v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeydecker, Tim10aSolution-Processed Field-Effect Transistors Based on Dihexylquaterthiophene Films with Performances Exceeding Those of Vacuum-Sublimed Films  ap. 21248-21255.  aSolution-processable oligothiophenes are model systems for charge transport and fabrication of organic field-effect transistors (OFET) . Herein we report a structure vs function relationship study focused on the electrical characteristics of solution-processed dihexylquaterthiophene (DH4T)-based OFET. We show that by combining the tailoring of all interfaces in the bottom-contact bottom-gate transistor, via chemisorption of ad hoc molecules on electrodes and dielectric, with suitable choice of the film preparation conditions (including solvent type, concentration, volume, and deposition method), it is possible to fabricate devices exhibiting field-effect mobilities exceeding those of vacuum-processed DH4T transistors. In particular, the evaporation rate of the solvent, the processing temperature, as well as the concentration of the semiconducting material were found to hold a paramount importance in driving the self-assembly toward the formation of highly ordered and low-dimensional supramolecular architectures, confirming the kinetically governed nature of the self-assembly process. Among the various architectures, hundreds-of-micrometers long and thin DH4T crystallites exhibited enhanced charge transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical elements 3acrystallites 3aelectrical properties 3aelectrodes 3aevaporation rate 3amodels 3asolvents 3atemperature 0adihexylquaterthiophene 0aorganic field-effect transistors 0acontact resistance 0adrop-cast 0ametal−semiconductor interface 0adielectric treatment1 aTrong Duong, Duc1 aSalleo, Alberto1 aOrgiu, Emanuele1 aSamorì, Paolo,0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 6, no. 23 p.21248-21255dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam506245v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245007200208300001400280520159900294592002801893650001501921650002501936650001201961650001501973650001701988653002502005653000902030653003902039653001602078653001002094653003102104700001902135700001902154773011102173856008602284852000902370655001202379IND60555384420221123012940.0180831e20161110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055538442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.01.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerego, Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4038-063712aA lot of icing but little cake? Taking integrated reporting forward  ap. 53-64.  aIntegrated reporting has fast emerged as a new accounting practice to help firms understand how they create value and be able to effectively communicate this to external stakeholders. While insightful experiences from the early-adopters of integrated reporting start to accumulate, the development of the field and how integrated reporting may be successfully implemented remains challenging and contested. Several issues are still controversial with no consensus reached on the central purpose about integrated reporting. This paper relies upon a qualitative approach to accomplish two objectives. First, we provide a review of the embryonic academic literature in the integrated reporting field in order to summarize extant knowledge. Second, in response to a gap in the literature on managerial perceptions concerning integrated reporting, we present the sensemaking approaches of three key experts impacting integrated reporting practices at the global level using semi-structured interviews. Our findings suggest that experts perceive the field to be fragmented and believe that most companies currently have weak understanding of the business value of integrated reporting. The experts give insights into how they perceive the field to be progressing despite challenges and on where they see improvements in the diffusion of practices in integrated reporting. Our study contributes to this special issue by reframing the existing implementation challenges of integrated reporting into promising and inclusive research opportunities that align the priorities of both academia and business.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccounting 3abusiness enterprises 3aexperts 3ainterviews 3astakeholders 0aIntegrated reporting 0aIIRC 0aCorporate sustainability reporting 0aMateriality 0aValue 0aOrganizational sensemaking1 aKennedy, Steve1 aWhiteman, Gail0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Nov. 10, v. 136 p.53-64dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.01.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245009600207300001100303500001900314520193000333592002802263596004802291650001102339650002102350650002302371650001002394650002902404650001302433650001502446650000902461650000902470650001402479650001602493650001502509650001702524650001202541650001302553651001202566700002302578773010902601856008302710852000902793655001202802IND60712854520221118060836.0201222e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071285452DNAL7 a10.1186/s13570-020-00175-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBollig, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7133-613210aAbundant herds: Accumulation, herd management, and land-use patterns in a conservation area  ap. 20.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNorth-eastern Namibia’s Zambezi Region became part of the world’s largest transboundary conservation area in the early 2010s: the Kavango–Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. While wildlife numbers and wildlife-based tourism are increasing rapidly in this conservation zone, cattle herds and livestock-based economies are expanding as well. More than conservation and wildlife-based tourism, cattle husbandry is a project of the local population and of the local elite in particular. Cattle are an expression of wealth and are regarded as a means of saving. At the same time, cattle can be used to plough fields, pull sledges, and produce milk and meat for home consumption and also for sale. Cattle also fulfil important social functions; they are necessary for bridewealth payments and are used in cattle loans with which wealthy herd owners furnish poorer relatives. Recent investments into self-financed boreholes have opened new rangelands for the wealthy, while the expansion of conservation areas in the region’s wetlands and the establishment of wildlife corridors have rendered other rangelands challenging due to prohibitions and increasing incidences of human–wildlife conflict. The needs and practices of expanding cattle husbandry often conflict with the demands and challenges of conservation and conservation-related tourism.This contribution describes the emergence and expansion of cattle husbandry in a region which had hardly any cattle before the 1960s and which has seen a major expansion of conservation areas and a subsequent refaunation since the 1980s. The contribution analyses current cattle ownership patterns and management practices. We argue that livestock husbandry and conservation have to be considered together and not as competing land-use strategies that need to be kept apart but as separate visions and aspirations of different stakeholders relating to the same landscape.  aPublisher supplied data  aSFB TR 228cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3acattle 3acattle husbandry 3aconservation areas 3aherds 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3aland use 3alandscapes 3ameat 3amilk 3aownership 3apastoralism 3arangelands 3astakeholders 3atourism 3awildlife 3aNamibia1 aVehrs, Hauke-Peter0 tPastoralism.g2020 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.20-20dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2262x2041-71367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13570-020-00175-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245012700176300001800303520102800321592002801349650002301377650001001400650001601410650001201426650001101438650001101449650001301460650001401473650001601487650000901503700002301512700002201535700002401557700002201581773013301603856008101736852000901817655001201826IND60596428620221122033624.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059642862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-018-1008-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogolitsyn, KonstantinG.14aThe differences between acid–base and redox properties of phenolic structures of coniferous and deciduous native lignins  ap. 1153-1164.  aNatural lignins are one of the most widespread biopolymers. The main active centers in the lignin macromolecules are phenolic hydroxyl groups. They form lignin macromolecules reactivity. The lignin is considered as a natural polyphenol. The main characteristics of the lignin reactivity are their acid–base and redox properties. Acid–base properties of lignins are characterized by pKₐ values of basic types of phenolic structures. The redox properties are characterized by effective oxidation potential and the Gibbs energy of the phenolic structures. This paper studies the acid–base and redox properties of the phenolic structures of coniferous and deciduous natural lignins. The authors analyze the representative slightly altered preparations of dioxane lignin extracted from coniferous wood (spruce, common juniper) and deciduous wood (common aspen). The study reveals the differences in the reaction properties of coniferous and deciduous lignins due to their functional nature and macromolecular properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuniperus communis 3aPicea 3abiopolymers 3adioxane 3aenergy 3alignin 3amoieties 3aoxidation 3apolyphenols 3awood1 aKhviuzov, SergeyS.1 aGusakova, MariaA.1 aPustynnaya, MariaA.1 aKrasikova, AnnaA.0 tWood science and technology.g2018 July, v. 52, no. 4 p.1153-1164dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl45947x0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-018-1008-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245013700162300001600299520123000315592002801545650001201573650001201585650001901597650001301616650001001629650001801639650001501657650002001672650001501692650002401707650001901731650001201750651001001762700002001772700002701792700001601819773012801835856007501963852000902038655001202047IND60649713320221119040523.0190705e20130924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064971332DNAL7 a10.3390/land20305082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReenberg, Anette10aLand Saturation in SE Niger: Triangulating Qualitative and Quantitative Information for Critical Assessment of Land Use Trajectories  ap. 508-533.  aThe paper analyzes land use changes, notably cropland expansion, in SE-Niger from the mid-1980s to 2011. It scrutinizes land use trajectories and investigates how cultivation shifts between dune landscapes and valleys (bas-fonds) in response to climate, population pressure, and sociocultural opportunities, combining lenses rooted in land change science and the notions of double exposure and human-environmental timelines. Specifically, the interest is directed towards exploring the value of different methods of land use data harvesting. The importance of cropland expansion is assessed in two ways: by interpreting Landsat satellite images and by interviewing local people to obtain qualitative descriptions. The results demonstrate a glaring discrepancy between the assessed land use trends derived from these two data sources. Issues such as important developments in landscape priorities, allocation of cropland between dunes and valleys, possible land saturation, and adaptation to climate change or globalization are portrayed very differently. It is concluded that critical attention to data reliability is crucial to avoid misleading narratives in land change science, especially in places covered by sparse data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acropland 3adunes 3aglobalization 3aharvesting 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3apopulation pressure 3aremote sensing 3avalleys 3aNiger1 aMaman, Issoufou1 aMoussa Ibrahim, Bouzou1 aFog, Bjarne0 tLand.g2013 Sept. 24, v. 2, no. 3 p.508-533dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land20305083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015500166300001600321520119900337592002801536650001601564650002301580650001301603650001001616650001901626650001401645650001301659650001401672650002401686650001701710653002001727653001101747653000901758653002901767653001201796700001601808700001301824700001601837700001501853700001601868700001901884700002101903700001301924700001701937700001401954773013901968856008202107852000902189655001202198IND60596985320221119102401.0180622e20180712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059698532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.05.1572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiaohui14aThe long non-coding RNA PCSEAT exhibits an oncogenic property in prostate cancer and functions as a competing endogenous RNA that associates with EZH2  ap. 262-268.  aProstate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy and the leading cause of cancer deaths in males. Recent studies demonstrate that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in many aspects of PCa. However, their biological roles in PCa remain imperfectly understood. Here,wecharacterized anlncRNA, PCaspecific expression and EZH2-associatedtranscript (PCSEAT, annotated as PRCAT38), which is specifically overexpressedin PCa. We further demonstrated that knockdown of PCSEAT results in the reduction of PCa cell growth and motility, and overexpression of PCSEAT reverses these phenotypes. Furthermore, bioactive PCSEAT is incorporated into exosomes and transmitted to adjacent cells, thus promoting cell proliferation and motility. Mechanistically, we found that PCSEAT promotes cell proliferation, at least in part by affecting miR-143-3p- and miR-24-2-5p-mediated regulation of EZH2, suggesting that PCSEAT and EZH2 competitively ‘sponge’ miR-143-3p and miR-24-2-5p.Overall, ourresultsrevealthat PCSEAT is specifically overexpressed in PCa patients and a potential oncogene in PCa cells via mediating EZH2 activity, indicating that PCSEAT may be a potential therapeutic target in PCa.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3aexosomes 3amales 3anon-coding RNA 3aoncogenes 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aprostatic neoplasms 3atherapeutics 0aProstate cancer 0aPCSEAT 0aEZH2 0aCompeting endogenous RNA 0aExosome1 aWang, Liang1 aLi, Rong1 aZhao, Yuhui1 aGu, Yinmin1 aLiu, Siying1 aCheng, Tianyou1 aHuang, Kuohsiang1 aYuan, Yi1 aSong, Dalong1 aGao, Shan0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 July 12, v. 502 p.262-268dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.05.1573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02160naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245011600164300002000280520083200300592002801132650001101160650002201171650001401193650001301207650001601220650001601236653004501252653001301297653001701310653001401327653002001341653001701361700002001378700001801398700002201416700002501438700001801463700002001481773014101501856007501642852000901717655001201726IND60527796720221121224513.0160715e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052779672DNAL7 a10.1021/am506246z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanford, Michael
G.10aPurification of Nanoscale Electron-Beam-Induced Platinum Deposits via a Pulsed Laser-Induced Oxidation Reaction  ap. 21256-21263.  aPlatinum–carbon deposits made via electron-beam-induced deposition were purified via a pulsed laser-induced oxidation reaction and erosion of the amorphous carbon to form pure platinum. Purification proceeds from the top down and is likely catalytically facilitated via the evolving platinum layer. Thermal simulations suggest a temperature threshold of ∼485 K, and the purification rate is a function of the PtC₅ thickness (80–360 nm) and laser pulse width (1–100 μs) in the ranges studied. The thickness dependence is attributed to the ∼235 nm penetration depth of the PtC₅ composite at the laser wavelength, and the pulse-width dependence is attributed to the increased temperatures achieved at longer pulse widths. Remarkably fast purification is realized at cumulative laser exposure times of less than 1 s.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aexposure duration 3aoxidation 3aplatinum 3atemperature 3awavelengths 0afocused electron-beam-induced deposition 0aplatinum 0apulsed laser 0aannealing 0ananofabrication 0apurification1 aLewis, Brett B.1 aNoh, Joo Hyon1 aFowlkes, Jason D.1 aRoberts, Nicholas A.1 aPlank, Harald1 aRack, Philip D.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 6, no. 23 p.21256-21263dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam506246z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001600181245010500197506007600302520126100378592002801639506003701667650003001704650001901734650001401753650002301767650001901790650001801809650002201827650001801849650002701867650001801894650001001912650001001922650002401932650001901956650001701975650001101992650003202003650001202035650001302047650002602060650002202086650002802108650002902136700001702165700001802182700001502200700001502215700001702230700002002247700001702267773012602284856007402410852000902484655001202493IND60649787320221207133110.0190706e20190605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064978732DNAL7 a10.3390/md170603362doi7 aPMC66273282pmcid7 a311956872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Xihua 10aReducing Effect of Farnesylquinone on Lipid Mass in <i>C. elegans</i> by Modulating Lipid Metabolism  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBioassay-guided fractionation of marine-derived fungi revealed that the EtOAc fraction from the fermentation broth of a mutated fungal strain Streptomyces nitrosporeus YBH10-5 had lipid-lowering effects in HepG2 cells. Chromatographic separation of the EtOAc fraction resulted in the isolation of 11 PKS-based derivatives, including a structurally unique meroterpenoid namely nitrosporeunol H (1). The structure of compound 1 was determined by the analysis of spectroscopic data. Further bioassay resulted in farnesylquinone (2) and its analogues to exert in vivo fat-reducing effects in C. elegans worm model. The underlying mode of action of compound 2 in the context of live worms was investigated, uncovering that compound 2 enhanced the mitochondrial &beta;-oxidation rate and changed the transcriptional level of energy metabolism genes. Additional experiments revealed that compound 2 exerted its effects in C. elegans partially through repressing FAT-5, an isoform of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) which catalyzes the conversion of saturated fatty acids to monounsaturated fatty acids, thereafter leading to the modification of the fatty acid profile. Thus, compound 2 was suggested to be a promising lead for further optimization to treat obesity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStreptomyces nitrosporeus 3abeta oxidation 3abioassays 3acatalytic activity 3achromatography 3aculture media 3aenergy metabolism 3aethyl acetate 3afatty acid composition 3afractionation 3afungi 3agenes 3amechanism of action 3ameroterpenoids 3amitochondria 3amodels 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3aobesity 3aquinones 3asaturated fatty acids 3aspectral analysis 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3atranscription (genetics)1 aXu, Manglin 1 aYang, Aigang 1 aZhao, Yan 1 aLiu, Dong 1 aHuang, Jian 1 aProksch, Peter 1 aLin, Wenhan 0 tMarine drugs.g2019 June 05, v. 17, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md170603363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245014800198506007600346520174000422592002802162506003702190650001602227650001502243650002002258650003402278650002602312650001702338650001602355650002502371650001602396650001002412650001802422650001802440650003002458650002102488650001002509650001002519650000902529650001202538650001502550650002102565650001602586700001702602700001502619700001602634700001502650700001402665700001802679773012602697856007402823852000902897655001202906IND60649787420221207134208.0190706e20190605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064978742DNAL7 a10.3390/md170603372doi7 aPMC66277542pmcid7 a311957372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jihui 10a<i>Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous</i>-Derived Astaxanthin Regulates Lipid Metabolism and Gut Microbiota in Obese Mice Induced by A High-Fat Diet  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAstaxanthin is an important antioxidant with many biological activities such as anti-tumor, anti-obesity, cardioprotective, and immuno-modulatory activities. Most of these biological activities are derived from (3S,3&prime;S)-astaxanthin, while the activities of (3R,3&prime;R)-astaxanthin are rarely reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of (3R,3&prime;R)-astaxanthin on lipid metabolism and gut microbiota in mice fed with a high-fat diet. In this work, 40 male C57BL/6 mice were divided into 8 groups fed a high-fat diet supplemented or not with (3R,3&prime;R)-astaxanthin or Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous for 8 weeks. The weight gain, energy intake, fat index, plasma triacylglycerol and cholesterol, liver triacylglycerol and cholesterol, and gut microbiota were determined. The results showed that the addition of (3R,3&prime;R)-astaxanthin/X. dendrorhous to the high-fat diet as a supplement prevented weight gain, reduced plasma and liver triacylglycerol, and decreased plasma and liver total cholesterol. The addition of (3R,3&prime;R)-astaxanthin/X. dendrorhous also regulated the gut microbiota of the mice, which optimized the ratio of Bacteroides to Firmicutes and increased the content of Verrucomicrobia, especially Akkermansia. The changes in the gut microflora achieved a healthier structure, thus reducing the incidence of obesity. Thus (3R,3&prime;R)-Astaxanthin has the function of regulating lipid metabolism and gut microbiota to prevent obesity caused by a high-fat diet. The production strain of (3R,3&prime;R)-astaxanthin, X. dendrorhous, has the same function as astaxanthin in preventing obesity caused by a high-fat diet, which reflects its potential ability as a probiotic drug.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacteroides 3aFirmicutes 3aVerrucomicrobia 3aXanthophyllomyces dendrorhous 3aanimal disease models 3aantioxidants 3aastaxanthin 3abioactive properties 3acholesterol 3adrugs 3aenergy intake 3ahigh fat diet 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3amales 3amice 3aobesity 3aprobiotics 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight gain1 aLiu, Shiwen 1 aWang, Han 1 aXiao, Shan 1 aLi, Cheng 1 aLi, Ying 1 aLiu, Bingnan 0 tMarine drugs.g2019 June 05, v. 17, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md170603373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245008300173500001900256520115700275592002801432650001301460650002401473650001101497650001301508650001301521650001001534653003101544653002401575653004001599653003501639653004301674653003101717700002001748700002801768773010801796856008801904852000901992655001202001IND60716171820221121065420.0210301e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071617182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.1037982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngot, Philippe12aA nonlinear asymptotic model for the inertial flow at a fluid-porous interface  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn original nonlinear multi-dimensional model for the inertial fluid flow through a fluid-porous interface is derived by asymptotic theory for arbitrary flow directions. The interfacial region between the pure fluid and the homogeneous porous region is viewed as a thin transition porous layer characterized by smoothly evolving heterogeneities. The asymptotic analysis applied to the homogenized Navier-Stokes equations in this thin heterogeneous porous layer leads to nonlinear momentum jump conditions at the equivalent dividing interface. These jump conditions involve slip and friction coefficients whose dependence on porosity are analyzed. Moreover, we show that the resulting Navier-Stokes/Darcy-Forchheimer macroscale coupled model is globally dissipative in the porosity range 0<ϕp≤0.95,which also contributes to its physical relevance. To our knowledge, this innovative asymptotic model is the first nonlinear multi-dimensional model proposed in the literature for the inertial flow with arbitrary flow directions at a permeable interface. Besides, it clearly opens new perspectives to study turbulent flows at the fluid-porous interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3afriction 3amathematical theory 3amodels 3amomentum 3aporosity 3awater 0aFluid-porous inertial flow 0aAsymptotic analysis 0aNonlinear jump interface conditions 0aSlip and friction coefficients 0aNavier-Stokes/DDarcy-Forchheimer model 0aGlobally dissipative model1 aGoyeau, Benoît1 aOchoa-Tapia, J.

In this respect, IR could favor the integrative management of sustainability. Yet some scholars are more critical and argue that IR cannot contribute to sustainability management.This article contributes to the debate by analyzing how IR adopters communicate managerial aspects of corporate sustainability. Drawing on impression management studies, this study seeks to detect manipulations in this disclosure practice. A manual content analysis of reports available on the IIRC website and a multivariate statistical analysis reveal that firms offer biased IR disclosures. Firms not only provide limited forward-looking and quantitative disclosure of their actions to achieve sustainability outcomes but also avoid providing information about their sustainability performance when their social and environmental results are poor. The evidence suggests pessimistic conclusions about the capability of this reporting process to encourage the integrative management of corporate sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3amanagers 3amultivariate analysis 3asilos 0aIntegrated reporting 0aSustainability management 0aSustainability reporting 0aSustainability accounting 0aLeading indicators 0aImpression management1 aMelloni, Gaia1 aLai, Alessandro0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Nov. 10, v. 136 p.102-110dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.01.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01847naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245006700173300001800240520076900258592002801027650000801055650001301063650001301076650001101089650001601100650001001116650001601126650002101142650001901163700001601182700002001198700002901218700002401247773010401271856008901375852000901464655001201473IND60534297020221118122651.0160802e20160218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053429702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b024512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedeiros, H.

The temperature level of 1573 K was established for complete C₁₀H₈ cracking at 1.75 kW plasma power. High conversion efficiency of C₁₀H₈ is achieved varying the air flow rate in the range of 0.6–1.2 m³/h. The model approximates the characteristics of the considered MW plasma to thermal plasma in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).

Previous studies have implicated hydroxycinnamoyl quinate esters in the complexation of purine alkaloids in Coffea arabica. The goal of this study was to determine if Erythroxylum coca uses similar complexation agents to store abundant tropane alkaloids, such as cocaine and cinnamoyl cocaine. Metabolite analysis of various E. coca organs established a close correlation between levels of coca alkaloids and those of two hydroxycinnamoyl esters of quinic acid, chlorogenic acid and 4-coumaroyl quinate. The BAHD acyltransferase catalyzing the final step in hydroxycinnamoyl quinate biosynthesis was isolated and characterized, and its gene expression found to correlate with tropane alkaloid accumulation. A physical interaction between chlorogenic acid and cocaine was observed and quantified in vitro using UV and NMR spectroscopic methods yielding similar values to those reported for a caffeine chlorogenate complex in C. arabica. These results suggest that storage of cocaine and other coca alkaloids in large quantities in E. coca involves hydroxycinnamoyl quinate esters as complexation partners.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoffea arabica 3aErythroxylum coca var. coca 3abiosynthesis 3acaffeine 3achlorogenic acid 3acocaine 3agene expression 3ametabolites 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aquinic acid 3avacuoles 2aCinnamatesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCocaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCocainexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEsters 2aMolecular Structure 2aQuinic Acidxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aCocaine 0aHydroxycinnamoyl quinate esters 0aTropane alkaloid 0aErythroxylum coca 0aVacuole 0aChlorogenic acid1 aSchmidt, Gregor W.1 aPaetz, Christian1 aReichelt, Michael1 aSchneider, Bernd1 aGershenzon, Jonathan1 aD’Auria, John C.0 tPhytochemistry.g2013 July, v. 91 p.177-186dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011000165300001400275520108800289536019301377592002801570596006801598596007701666650002401743650002301767650001701790650002001807650002601827650001501853650001201868650001501880650001501895650001601910650001801926650001701944653001401961653000801975653001401983653001801997700001902015700001602034700002002050700001402070773012502084856008502209852000902294655001202303IND60638901120221118055613.0190501e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063890112DNAL7 a10.1080/17429145.2017.12938522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ying10aEffects of PEG-induced drought stress on regulation of indole alkaloid biosynthesis in Catharanthusroseus  ap. 87-91.  aCatharanthus roseus (C. roseus) plants were used to investigate the terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) accumulation under the condition of PEG-induced drought stress. Multivariate analysis showed that 35% PEG6000 could induce more obvious and stable accumulation on proline (PRO) content and the relative water content (RWC). The results indicated that there were gradual increase and then decrease (p < .05) in the contents of vindoline (VIN) and catharanthine (CAT) under 35% PEG6000 stress, but the content of vinblastine (VBL) increased gradually. In addition, the expression levels of tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC), strictosidine synthase (STR) and deacetylvindoline-4-O-acetyltransferase (DAT) were upregulated in plants under 35% PEG6000 stress. Further correlation analysis indicated that CAT accumulation was significantly correlated with TDC gene expression, and VBL accumulation was significantly correlated with peroxidase (p < .05). Our results suggest that the cultivation of C. roseus in drought stress would serve as effective treatment for accumulating TIAs.  aThis work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2572015CA07, C2572015CA03) and Heilongjiang province natural science fund project (No. C201235).  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. C201235cHeilongjiang province natural science fund project  aNo. 2572015CA07cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aacetyltransferases 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression 3amultivariate analysis 3aperoxidase 3aproline 3aterpenoids 3atryptophan 3avinblastine 3awater content 3awater stress 0aalkaloids 0aPEG 0avindoline 0acatharanthine1 aMeng, Qinghuan1 aDuan, Xihua1 aZhang, Zhonghua1 aLi, Dewen0 tJournal of plant interactions.g2017 Jan. 1, v. 12, no. 1 p.87-91dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000112x1742-91537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17429145.2017.12938523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245016100158300001600319520129300335592002801628650001601656650001701672650002601689650001301715650001601728650001401744651001701758700002001775700002001795700002301815700001601838773010501854856004101959852000902000655001202009IND50067262720221121025800.0130619e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006726272DNAL7 a10.1111/syen.120092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xingyue,10aSystematic revision reveals underestimated diversity of the South African endemic fishfly genus Taeniochauliodes Esben‐Petersen (Megaloptera: Corydalidae)  ap. 543-560.  aTaeniochauliodes is the most common and widely distributed fishfly genus in South Africa, with one historically recognized valid species Taeniochauliodes ochraceopennis Esben‐Petersen. The present systematic revision of Taeniochauliodes has found that this genus consists of at least eight species: T. angustus sp.n., T. attenuatus sp.n., T. barnardi sp.n., T. fuscus sp.n., T. minutus sp.n., and T. natalensis sp.n. Description of all new species and a redescription of T. esbenpeterseni comb.n. & stat.rev. and T. ochraceopennis are made. These species all have relatively narrowly confined distributions. An interspecific phylogeny of Taeniochauliodes is estimated based on adult morphological data. The historical biogeography of this genus is discussed based on the phylogenetic results and the present distribution of each species, suggesting that the origin of Taeniochauliodes likely dates back to the Late Cretaceous. The earliest branch, which separates T. natalensis sp.n. from the remaining South African species, suggests an early vicariance event occurred between KwaZulu‐Natal and more western parts of South Africa. Furthermore, speciation within Taeniochauliodes is hypothesized to be correlated with fragmentation of its forest habitat during the Plio‐Pleistocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorydalidae 3abiogeography 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aSouth Africa1 aPRICE, BENJAMIN1 aHayashi, Fumio,1 aDE MOOR, FERDINAND1 aYang, Ding,0 tSystematic entomology.g2013 July, v. 38, no. 3 p.543-560dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/syen.12009  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245013200177300001600309520138100325536018201706592002801888596003801916596008301954596003102037650002902068650001602097650002302113650003002136650001602166650001302182650001502195650001502210650002302225650001702248650004102265650002002306650002502326650001702351650001602368650001902384650001302403650001702416650001402433653001802447653001202465653002002477653002502497700001902522700002302541700002402564700001502588773012702603856008502730852000902815655001202824IND60638901220221118055659.0190501e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063890122DNAL7 a10.1080/17429145.2017.12942122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgamberdieva, Dilfuza10aCoordination between Bradyrhizobium and Pseudomonas alleviates salt stress in soybean through altering root system architecture  ap. 100-107.  aIt is a well accepted strategy to improve plant salt tolerance through inoculation with beneficial microorganisms. However, its underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. In the present study, hydroponic experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110 with salt-tolerant Pseudomonas putida TSAU1 on growth, protein content, nitrogen, and phosphorus uptake as well as root system architecture of soybean (Glycine max L.) under salt stress. The results indicated that the combined inoculation with USDA 110 and TSAU1 significantly improved plant growth, nitrogen and phosphorus contents, and contents of soluble leaf proteins under salt stress compared to the inoculation with the symbiont alone or compared to un-inoculated ones. The root architectural traits, like root length, surface area, project area, and root volume; as well as nodulation traits were also significantly increased by co-inoculation with USDA 110 and TSAU1. The plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) P. putida strain TSAU1 could improve the symbiotic interaction between the salt-stressed soybean and B. japonicum USDA 110. In conclusion, inoculation with B. japonicum and salt-tolerant P. putida synergistically improved soybean salt tolerance through altering root system architecture facilitating nitrogen and phosphorus acquisition, and nodule formation.  aThis research was supported by the Georg Forster Research Fellowship (НERMES), the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for DE and UNESCO/China, The Great Wall Fellowships for DJ.  aPublisher supplied data  cGeorg Forster Research Fellowship  cAlexander von Humboldt-Stiftung Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005156  cThe Great Wall Fellowships 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3aGlycine max 3aPseudomonas putida 3abeneficial microorganisms 3ahydroponics 3anitrogen 3anodulation 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus content 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aprotein content 3arhizosphere bacteria 3aroot systems 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asoybeans 3asurface area 3asymbionts 0aRhizobacteria 0asoybean 0anutrient uptake 0asoluble leaf protein1 aWirth, Stephan1 aJabborova, Dilfuza1 aRäsänen, Leena A.1 aLiao, Hong0 tJournal of plant interactions.g2017 Jan. 1, v. 12, no. 1 p.100-107dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000112x1742-91537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17429145.2017.12942123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01757naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245015500206300001000361500001900371500001100390520063500401592002801036650002301064650002401087650001101111650001201122650001801134650001601152650001001168651001501178651001601193773010701209856008201316852000901398655001201407IND60712854920221118060956.0201222e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071285492DNAL7 a10.1186/s13570-020-0159-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDioli, Maurizio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9025-745610aDromedary (Camelus dromedarius) and Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) crossbreeding husbandry practices in Turkey and Kazakhstan: An in-depth review  ap. 6.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aHybridization between dromedaries and Bactrian camels has been carried out since ancient times in various areas of the Middle East and Central Asia.

Mangrove forest in Sungai Apit Sub-district, Siak District, Riau is one of mangrove ecosystems that is still partly natural with some parts being damaged or rehabilitated. Degraded mangrove forest is a mangrove forest that has been disturbed by human activities and natural factors. This study aimed to investigate the floristic composition and stand structure of trees and seedlings in mangrove forests in Sungai Apit, Siak District, Riau Province, Indonesia in three vegetation conditions, i.e., natural, degraded, and rehabilitated forests. Line Transect Plot Method was used to collect data in three stations (i.e., Rawa Mekar Jaya, Sungai Rawa and Mengkapan villages) where each station consisted of three transects with a size of 10 x 100 m. A total of 20 species belonging 11 families were recorded in the studied sites with Rhizophora apiculata was the most dominant species in all forest conditions. The natural forest had the highest number of species followed by rehabilitated forest and the degraded forest. Stand structure in terms of tree density, mean diameter of mangrove trunks, and basal area differed significantly across the three vegetation conditions with the natural forest had the highest values followed by the rehabilitated forest, while the degraded forest was the lowest. For the seedling, the lowest number of species was observed in the degraded forest while the highest was in the rehabilitated forest, indicating the result of rehabilitation activities. Yet, seedling density in natural forests was lower than that in rehabilitated and degraded forests. This study provides information that differences in structure, species composition and recruitment of seedlings in mangrove forests in the three conditions and locations can be related to differences in recovery time and degradation levels which may be important for developing mangrove forest management and conservation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRhizophora apiculata 3abotanical composition 3adominant species 3aforest damage 3aforest management 3ahumans 3amangrove forests 3aseedlings 3astand structure 3atrees 3aIndonesia 0afloristic composition 0amangrove forest condition 0aseedling density 0astand structure 0asungai apit siak1 aHAMIDY, RASOEL 1 aMULYADI, ARAS 1 aEFRIYELDI0 tBiodiversitas.g2021 Sept., v. 22, no. 9dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2209453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03497naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136024004600175040001800221100002000239245011100259300001600370506002800386506004300414506007600457506003100533520144100564592002802005596004502033506003702078650002302115650001802138650001402156650001902170650001202189650001202201650001002213650002002223650003102243650001002274650004202284650001702326650004302343650002802386650001602414650001902430650001802449650001802467650002002485650001002505653000902515653001202524700002002536700001902556700002102575700001902596773012702615856008602742903002202828852000902850655001202859IND60638901420221207142137.0190501e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063890142DNAL7 a10.1080/17429145.2017.12988512chorus7 a10.1080/17429145.2017.12988512doi7 a10.1080/17429145.2017.12988512chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaires, Michel10aRNA-seq analysis of the salt stress-induced transcripts in fast-growing bioenergy tree, Paulownia elongata  ap. 128-136.  aResource is Open Access  aInforma UK Limited License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aPaulowina elongata is a fast-growing tree species is grown in different climates and types of soils. Environmental adaptability as well as high-yielding biomass make the P. elongata species an ideal candidate for biofuel production. High soil salinity is known to inhibit plant growth dramatically or leads to plant death. The purpose of this study was to characterize the salt-induced changes in the transcriptome of P. elongata. Transcriptome differences in response to salt stress were determined by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using next generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. A total of 645 genes were found to have significant altered expression in response to salt stress. Expression levels of a selective subset of these genes were chosen and confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of salt-induced transcriptome analysis in P. elongata. The current study indicates that differential expression of a select group of genes of P. elongata and their possible roles in pathways and mechanisms related to salt tolerance. Functional characterization of these genes will assist in future investigations of salt tolerance in P. elongata, which could be used to enhance biofuel production.

Initially, as a tool to collect relevant data in a representative and systematic way, hydrochemical monitoring provided evidence for widespread surface water acidification related to atmospheric pollution and long‐range air transport. Recognizing the strong effect biota can have on their chemical environment, in the context of catchment biogeochemistry, these data provided new insights into individual processes of soil and water acidification and helped to quantify the relative importance of natural and anthropogenic sources of H⁺. Furthermore, combined with large‐scale ecosystem manipulation and modeling, catchment biogeochemistry offered an effective tool to investigate risks of acidification and of nitrogen saturation of soils and waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid deposition 3aacidification 3aair pollution 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiogeochemistry 3aecosystems 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3aprotons 3arisk 3asoil water 3asurface water 3awatersheds 3aEurope1 aWright, R.

The extent of dextran modification (quantified by the molar ratio of attached alkyl tails to sugar repeat units) with native-, pH-adjusted-, 18-crown-6 ether pretreated pH-adjusted-, and stepwise addition of pretreated lipase AY yielded <3%, 49%, 64% and 96% modified dextran respectively. Lipase AY accelerated the transesterification of DexT40 from 2- to 63-fold higher than the non-catalyzed system. This procedure was extended to other acyl donors showing that modification pattern exhibited regioselectivity depending on acyl donor structure. Regioselectivity equaled between 2- and 3-OH with saturated fatty acyl donors. The 2-OH was favored for unsaturated fatty acyl donors, while sterically hindered acyl donors oriented modification toward 3-OH position. DexT40-VD at 96% modification was a water-insoluble polymer forming 150nm diameter nanoparticles in water which can be used as drug carrier systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida rugosa 3adextran 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adrug carriers 3aesters 3ananoparticles 3apolymers 3atransesterification1 aWongkongkatep, Jirarut1 aPanbangred, Watanalai1 aPhinyocheep, Pranee1 aMarie, Emmanuelle1 aDurand, Alain1 aInprakhon, Pranee0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2011 Aug., v. 112, no. 2 p.124-129dElsevier B.V.x1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245014500202300001200347520128900359592002801648650001301676650001501689650001501704650001201719650001101731650001301742650001501755650002301770650001301793650002001806650001501826651001501841700002401856700001501880773011801895856008102013852000902094655001202103IND60596429320221121021828.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059642932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-018-3365-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shasha1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1592-231010aFluctuations in the strength of chemical antifouling defenses in a red macroalga in response to variations in epibiont colonization pressure  ap. 107.  aMarine macroalgae in temperate regions are constantly exposed to colonization by fouling organisms, but the intensity of fouling fluctuates in time. We, therefore, hypothesized that a macroalgal species from these latitudes should be able to adjust its antifouling defense to the prevailing colonization pressure. To test this assumption, fouling pressure in the Western Baltic Sea as well as the activity of surface extracts gained from the non-native Gracilaria vermiculophylla against the diatom Stauroneis constricta and the filamentous alga Ceramium tenuicorne were assessed over one vegetation period on a monthly basis. We used two solvents with different polarities to extract chemical compounds from the alga. Both, hexane and dichloromethane (DCM) surface extracts, inhibited settlement of C. tenuicorne, while only hexane surface extracts deterred S. constricta. Furthermore, the activities of both extracts fluctuated on the scale of months and the fluctuations in the activity against C. tenuicorne, which were observed in DCM extracts, correlated with the intensity of fouling pressure that C. tenuicorne inflicted on G. vermiculophylla in the field. Thus, G. vermiculophylla appears to be able to adjust its antifouling defenses—at least partly—to fouling pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeramium 3aGracilaria 3aStauroneis 3afouling 3ahexane 3alatitude 3amacroalgae 3amethylene chloride 3asolvents 3atemperate zones 3avegetation 3aBaltic Sea1 aWeinberger, Florian1 aLenz, Mark0 tMarine biology.g2018 June, v. 165, no. 6 p.107-107dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-018-3365-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245010200179500001900281520196200300592002802262650001602290650001502306650001302321650001502334650003002349650001702379650001302396650001302409650000902422650001002431650001502441653003202456653002302488653002002511653001802531653002002549700002302569773010802592856008802700852000902788655001202797IND60716172420221120110135.0210503e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071617242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.1037952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoslemipour, Abolfazl10aDual-scale pore network reconstruction of vugular carbonates using multi-scale imaging techniques  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVuggy carbonate rocks have a complex geometry with pore size ranges from nano to several millimeters (e.g., vugs). Compared to other rocks (e.g., sandstones), this multiscale nature makes pore-scale studies very challenging. Vugs have significant effects on rock properties (e.g., porosity, permeability, capillary pressure, etc.) by establishing high conductive pathways. Multiscale pore network models can capture pores across various length scales and can be used to predict the flow behavior of these porous systems. In this study, a dual-scale PNM is implemented to reconstruct the behavior of a vuggy carbonate sample. The rock sample is CT scanned at two different scales. At the macro-scale (i.e., vugular-network), a medical-CT scanner is used to image the rock sample at the resolution of 100 μm. For better visualization of macropores (i.e., vugs) of the rock sample, imaging is conducted at both dry and saturated states with an X-ray attenuating brine (i.e., NaI solution). The rock is also imaged by a micro-CT scanner at the resolution of 0.75 μm to extract the micro-scale properties (i.e., micro-network). The images at both scales are preprocessed first. Then, the networks of both scales are extracted by two network extraction algorithms (i.e., the sub-network of the over-segmented watershed (SNOW) and the Maximal Ball (MB) method), and the results compared together. Then, a stochastically equivalent network based on the extracted micro-network properties is generated with a larger field of view (FOV). Then, vugs are randomly added to the reconstructed micro-network based on the properties of the macro-scale CT images. The result is a dual-scale unstructured irregular PNM. This modeling approach can efficiently preserve the vug-to-vug and vug-to-pore connectivity of overlapping vugs. The results show that the reconstructed dual-scale PNM has very close properties to the laboratory measurement data of the real rock sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acarbonates 3ageometry 3amacropores 3amicro-computed tomography 3apermeability 3aporosity 3ascanners 3asnow 3awater 3awatersheds 0aPore network reconstruction 0aDual-scale network 0aVuggy carbonate 0aMicro-CT scan 0aMedical-CT scan1 aSadeghnejad, Saeid0 tAdvances in water resources.g2021 Jan., v. 147 p.103795-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.1037953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245010900162300001600271520118500287592002801472650002501500650002301525650002101548650002201569650002201591650001501613650001101628650001301639650001301652651002001665700002201685773012801707856007501835852000901910655001201919IND60649714020221119040628.0190705e20130905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064971402DNAL7 a10.3390/land20304522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrews, Kelley A.10aForefronting the Socio-Ecological in Savanna Landscapes through Their Spatial and Temporal Contingencies  ap. 452-471.  aLandscape changes and the processes driving them have been a critical component in both research and management efforts of savanna systems. These dynamics impact human populations, wildlife, carbon storage, and general spatio-temporal dynamism in response to both anthropomorphic and climatic shifts. Both biophysical and human agents of change can be identified by isolating their respective spatial, temporal, and organizational contingencies. However, we argue here that a significant portion of savanna research has either considered humans as exogenous (e.g., via enacting regional or broader policies) or somewhat spatio-temporally removed from the system (e.g., as in many protected areas with limited current human habitation). Examples from African savanna research and particularly those systems of southern Africa are thus reviewed and used to model a stylized or prototypical savanna system and contingencies. Such an approach allows for a richer socio-temporal integration of theories and data on past biophysical and human histories to facilitate an improved framework for understanding savanna systems and their complex contingencies as socio-ecological landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon sequestration 3aconservation areas 3ahuman population 3ahuman settlements 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3amodels 3asavannas 3awildlife 3aSouthern Africa1 aYoung, Kenneth R.0 tLand.g2013 Sept. 05, v. 2, no. 3 p.452-471dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land20304523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03838naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100006600181245007100247300001800318500002000336506007600356520190600432592002802338506003702366650003502403650001102438650001502449650000902464650002202473650001402495650001902509650002702528650001402555650001102569650001402580650001802594650001702612650001402629650001302643650003902656650002002695650002302715700002302738700001802761700002202779700002602801700001702827700002302844700002402867700002802891700002102919700005902940773014202999856007403141852000903215655001203224IND60624174520221207095856.0181202e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062417452DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.153162doi7 aPMC62713302pmcid7 a303156632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVandenberghe, Hélène1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8738-700610aJuvenile‐onset polyneuropathy in American Staffordshire Terriers  ap. 2003-2012.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The only hereditary neurologic disorder described so far in American Staffordshire Terriers is adult‐onset cerebellar degeneration secondary to ceroid lipofuscinosis. We have seen several dogs with a newly recognized neurological disease characterized by locomotor weakness with or without respiratory signs and juvenile onset consistent with degenerative polyneuropathy of genetic origin. OBJECTIVES: To characterize a novel polyneuropathy in juvenile American Staffordshire Terriers. ANIMALS: Fourteen American Staffordshire Terriers presented with clinical signs consistent with juvenile‐onset polyneuropathy at 5 veterinary hospitals between May 2005 and July 2017. METHODS: Case series. Dogs were included retrospectively after a diagnosis of degenerative polyneuropathy had been confirmed by nerve biopsy. Clinical, pathological, electrophysiological, histological data, and outcome were reviewed and a pedigree analysis performed. RESULTS: All dogs displayed clinical signs of neuromuscular disease with generalized motor and sensory involvement, associated with focal signs of laryngeal paralysis (10/14 dogs) and megaesophagus (1/14 dogs). Histopathological findings were consistent with degenerative polyneuropathy. Follow‐up was available for 11 dogs, and 3 dogs were euthanized shortly after diagnosis. In these 11 dogs, the disease was slowly progressive and the animals maintained good quality of life with ability to walk. Pedigree analysis was mostly consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Juvenile polyneuropathy, associated with laryngeal paralysis, is a newly described entity in American Staffordshire Terriers, and results from degenerative neuropathy. When surgery for laryngeal paralysis is performed, lifespan may be similar to that of normal dogs even though affected dogs have locomotor disturbance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmerican Staffordshire Terrier 3abiopsy 3acerebellum 3adogs 3aelectrophysiology 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3ainheritance (genetics) 3ajuveniles 3alarynx 3alongevity 3amegaesophagus 3anerve tissue 3aparalysis 3apedigree 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3aquality of life 3aveterinary clinics1 aEscriou, Catherine1 aRosati, Marco1 aPorcarelli, Laura1 aRecio Caride, Alfredo1 aAñor, Sonia1 aGandini, Gualtiero1 aCorlazzoli, Daniele1 aThibaud, Jean‐Laurent1 aMatiasek, Kaspar1 aBlot, Stéphane1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8982-03170 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2018 Nov., v. 32, no. 6 p.2003-2012dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.153163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008900166300001300255500001500268520124100283592002801524650001601552650001701568650000901585650001701594650001101611650002501622650001801647650002401665650002001689650001501709650001301724650001501737651001001752653001701762700002801779700002201807700002001829700002001849773010801869856008101977852000902058655001202067IND50073988820221118192320.0150213e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007398882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-014-1896-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Julia,10aOccurrence and Ecotoxicological Risk Assessment of 14 Cytostatic Drugs in Wastewater  ap. 1896.  a2019-12-06  aCytostatic drugs are pharmaceutically active compounds used in chemotherapy to prevent or disrupt cell division. Only a few environmental studies have been focused on cytostatic drugs, in spite of their toxicity, their increasing consumption, and their discharge into municipal sewage. This fact can be mainly due to the lack of methods for their simultaneous analysis. This research describes the occurrence of 14 cytostatic drugs in influent and effluent wastewater from four wastewater treatment plants located in Seville (Spain) during 1-year period. A preliminary environmental risk assessment was also carried out. Five cytostatic drugs (cytarabine, etoposide, gemcitabine, iphosphamide, and methotrexate) were detected in influent wastewater at concentration levels up to 464 ng L⁻¹(cytarabine). Six of them (cytarabine, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, iphosphamide, paclitaxel, and vinorelbine) were detected in effluent wastewater at concentration levels up to 190 ng L⁻¹(cytarabine). Most of the detected cytostatic drugs are not significantly removed during wastewater treatment. Nevertheless, neither ecotoxicological nor genotoxical risks are expected to occur at the measured concentrations on the aquatic environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3adoxorubicin 3amethotrexate 3arisk 3adrug therapy 3asewage 3awastewater treatment 3acell division 3aaquatic environment 3arisk assessment 3apaclitaxel 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3aSpain 0achemotherapy1 aCamacho-Muñoz, Dolores1 aSantos, Juan Luis1 aAparicio, Irene1 aAlonso, Esteban0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2014 Mar., v. 225, no. 3 p.1896-1896dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-014-1896-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015200172500001900324520170100343592002802044650002902072650001202101650001902113650001802132650001002150650001402160650002202174650002202196650001102218650002302229650001502252650001302267650001402280650002502294650002402319650002002343651001402363651001302377651001502390651001302405651001502418653002102433653002602454653002302480653001402503653000902517653003102526700002402557700002402581700002802605700002502633700001902658700002202677773011202699856008202811852000902893655001202902IND60727215920221120153532.0210219e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072721592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2021.1035282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlier, J.q(Jean),10aCentral American and Caribbean population history of the Pseudocercospora fijiensis fungus responsible for the latest worldwide pandemics on banana  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAmong the emerging fungal diseases threatening food security, the Pseudocercospora fijiensis fungus causing black leaf streak disease of banana is one of the most marked examples of a recent worldwide pandemic on a major crop. We assessed how this pathogen spread throughout the latest invaded region, i.e. Central America and the Caribbean. We retraced its population history combining detailed monitoring information on disease outbreaks and population genetic analyses based on large-scale sampling of P. fijiensis isolates from 121 locations throughout the region. The results first suggested that sexual reproduction was not lost during the P. fijiensis expansion, even in the insular Caribbean context, and a high level of genotypic diversity was maintained in all the populations studied. The population genetic structure of P. fijiensis and historical data showed that two disease waves swept northward and southward in all banana-producing countries in the study area from an initial entry point in Honduras, probably mainly through gradual stepwise spore dispersal. Serial founder events accompanying the northern and southern waves led to the establishment of two different genetic groups. A different population structure was detected on the latest invaded islands (Martinique, Dominica and Guadeloupe), revealing multiple introductions and admixture events that may have been partly due to human activities. The results of this study highlight the need to step up surveillance to limit the spread of other known emerging diseases of banana spread mainly by humans, but also to curb gene flow between established pathogen populations which could increase their evolutionary potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycosphaerella fijiensis 3abananas 3ablack Sigatoka 3afood security 3afungi 3agene flow 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3amicrobial genetics 3amonitoring 3apandemic 3apathogens 3apopulation structure 3asexual reproduction 3aspore dispersal 3aCaribbean 3aDominica 3aGuadeloupe 3aHonduras 3aMartinique 0aEmerging disease 0aFungal plant pathogen 0aPopulation history 0aDispersal 0aMusa 0aPseudocercospora fijiensis1 aRobert, Stéphanie,1 aRoussel, Véronique1 aChilin-Charles, Yolande1 aLubin-Adjanoh, Nadia1 aGilabert, Aude1 aAbadie, Catherine0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2021 Mar., v. 148 p.103528-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl54870x1087-18457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2021.1035283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01502naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002600154245011700180300001600297520064500313592002800958650001200986650001200998650001101010650001601021651001501037773010801052856005501160852000901215655001201224IND50064453920221119032820.0130330e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006445392DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1756-1051.2012.01804.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStone, Robert Douglas10aWarneckea cordiformis sp. nov.

People suffer from a similar condition and describe numerous sensory abnormalities. Sensory changes have not been quantified in affected CKCS. OBJECTIVES: To use quantitative sensory testing (QST) to quantify thermal and mechanical thresholds in CKCS and to compare QST in dogs with and without syringomyelia (SM). ANIMALS: Forty‐four CKCS. METHODS: Prospective study. Dogs underwent neurological examinations and craniocervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thermal testing was performed over the humerus and thorax (n = 32); mechanical testing was performed on the paw and neck (n = 44). Latencies, thresholds, and response rates were compared with presence and severity of SM on MRI, presence of pain reported by the owner and pain identified on examination. RESULTS: Thirty dogs had SM, 30 were painful on examination, 29 were owner‐reported symptomatic. Thermal and mechanical variables were not significantly different based on presence or severity of SM. Dogs with pain on examination had decreased mechanical thresholds on the paw (0.38 kg, SD = 0.18) and neck (2.05 kg, SD = 0.74) compared to thresholds of dogs without pain on examination on the paw (0.60 kg, SD = 0.30) and neck (2.72 kg, SD = 0.57; P = .021). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Mechanical and thermal sensitivity does not appear to be related to the presence of SM, but mechanical sensitivity appears to be related to the presence of pain and clinical signs. Mechanical testing may be useful for assessing sensory abnormalities during clinical trials.  aPublisher supplied data  a02162‐MOUcAmerican Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club Charitable Trust  cAmerican Kennel Club Canine Health Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCavalier King Charles Spaniel 3aabnormal development 3aclinical trials 3adogs 3ahumerus 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amechanical testing 3aneck 3apain 3apeople 3aprospective studies 3asensory evaluation 3asyringomyelia 3athorax1 aGorney, Angela1 aWilliams, Kim1 aGriffith, Emily H.1 aCerda‐Gonzalez, Sofia1 aLascelles, B.

The name Pseudozyma churashimaensis sp. nov. was proposed for the novel species, with JCM 16988ᵀ as the type strain. Interestingly, P. churashimaensis was found to produce glycolipid biosurfactants, a mixture of mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs), including a novel tri-acetylated derivative (MEL-A2), from glucose. The observed critical micelle concentration (CMC) and the surface tension at CMC of MEL-A2 were 1.7×10⁻⁶M and 29.2mN/m, respectively. Moreover, on a water-penetration scan, MEL-A2 efficiently formed different lyotropic liquid crystalline phases, including the lamella phase at a wide range of concentrations, indicating its excellent surface-active and self-assembling properties. The novel strain of the genus Pseudozyma should thus facilitate the application of glycolipid biosurfactants in combination with other MEL producers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudozyma 3aSaccharum officinarum 3abiosurfactants 3agenes 3aglucose 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaves 3alipids 3amicelles 3anew species 3aribosomal RNA 3asugarcane 3asurface tension 3ayeasts1 aOgura, Yuki1 aTakashima, Masako1 aHirose, Naoto1 aFukuoka, Tokuma1 aImura, Tomohiro1 aKondo, Yukishige1 aKitamoto, Dai0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2011 Aug., v. 112, no. 2 p.137-144dElsevier B.V.x1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245013100204506007600335520099100411592002801402506003701430650001601467650001101483650001701494650001501511650001701526650001901543650004401562651001201606700002601618700001801644700002201662700002101684700002301705700002501728700001901753773012601772856007401898852000901972655001201981IND60649788420221207121904.0190706e20190611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064978842DNAL7 a10.3390/md170603462doi7 aPMC66282162pmcid7 a312125832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Byeoung-Kyu 10aNew Ophiobolin Derivatives from the Marine Fungus <i>Aspergillus flocculosus</i> and Their Cytotoxicities against Cancer Cells  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFive new sesterterpenes, 14,15-dehydro-6-epi-ophiobolin K (1), 14,15-dehydro- ophiobolin K (2), 14,15-dehydro-6-epi-ophiobolin G (3), 14,15-dehydro-ophiobolin G (4) and 14,15-dehydro-(Z)-14-ophiobolin G (5), together with four known ophiobolins (6&ndash;9) were isolated from the marine fungus Aspergillus flocculosus derived from the seaweed Padina sp. collected in Vietnam.

The analysis revealed a more rapid rate of spectral signal recovery than what was found in previous investigations in boreal and temperate forests. CONTEXT: The rate of post-disturbance vegetation recovery is an important component of forest dynamics. AIMS: In this study, we analyze the recovery of the spectral signal from forest clearcut areas in Mediterranean conditions when the coppice system of forest management is applied. METHODS: We used LTS surface reflectance data (1999–2015).We generated an annual reference database of clearcuts using visual interpretation and local forest inventory data, and then derived the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) spectral trajectories for these clearcuts. From these spectral trajectories, we calculated the Years to Recovery or Y2R, the number of years it takes for a pixel to return to within a specified threshold (i.e., 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%) of its pre-disturbance value. Spectral recovery rates were then corroborated using measures of canopy height derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. RESULTS: The coppice system is associated with rapid recovery rates when compared to rates of recovery from seeds or seedlings in temperate and boreal forest conditions. We found that the Y2R derived from the spectral trajectories of post-clearcut NBR and NDVI provided similar characterizations of rapid recovery for the coppice system of forest management applied in our study area. The ALS measures of canopy height indicated that the Y2R metric accurately captured the rapid regeneration of coppice systems. CONCLUSION: The rapid rate of spectral recovery associated with the coppice system is 2–4 years, which contrasts with values reported in boreal and temperate forest environments, where spectral recovery was attained in approximately 10 years. NBR is an effective index for assessing rapid recovery in this forest system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aboreal forests 3acanopy height 3aclearcutting 3acoppicing 3adatabases 3aforest dynamics 3aforest inventory 3aforest management 3alidar 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3areflectance 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3atemperate forests 3atime series analysis1 aGiannetti, Francesca1 aMazza, Erica1 aFrancini, Saverio1 aTravaglini, Davide1 aPegna, Raffaello1 aWhite, Joanne C.0 tAnnals of forest science.g2020 June, v. 77, no. 2 p.40-40dSpringer PariswJournal:2137x1286-45607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-020-00936-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010300165300001200268520119200280592002801472596004201500650001101542650002501553650000901578650001901587650001101606650001101617650001501628650001001643650002201653700001901675700001901694700002001713700001901733700001401752700001701766773011801783856008201901852000901983655001201992IND60596429820221120235058.0180904e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059642982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-018-3369-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorter, A. G.10aMarine infrastructure supports abundant, diverse fish assemblages at the expense of beta diversity  ap. 112.  aAnthropogenic structures are increasingly common in natural environments and present novel habitats for resident organisms. Marine breakwalls are similar to natural reefs in that they also provide habitat for diverse assemblages of mobile animals. However, it is unclear if fish assemblages on these artificial structures differ from those on neighbouring natural reefs in ecologically important ways. In this study, we compared fish assemblages at breakwalls and natural reefs in three different regions along 530 km of the East Australian coast. We found that fish assemblages associated with breakwalls were more diverse than those associated with natural reefs in two of the three regions studied. The functional niches being filled were similar at both habitats, with the exception of a higher abundance of piscivores at some breakwalls. However, β diversity tended low on the homogenous breakwalls compared to more heterogeneous natural reefs and was significantly lower at one region. The habitat heterogeneity model suggests that structural alterations to the layout of infrastructure could contribute to improving their ecological effects, potentially increasing β diversity.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014/RD/0113cNSW Environmental Trust 3acoasts 3aenvironmental impact 3afish 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3aniches 3apiscivores 3areefs 3aspecies diversity1 aFerrari, R.

We show that afforestation promotes defragmentation of pre-existing forests and new patch proliferation, in forest-dominated and non-forest-dominated landscapes respectively, while it is not associated to decreasing landscape diversity. These processes are modulated by geographic factors and might affect functional connectivity and biodiversity conservation in newly forested landscapes. CONTEXT: A recent forest increase in Europe might drive changes in the landscape pattern, with increasing forest defragmentation and connectivity but decreasing land cover diversity that, in turn, might affect biodiversity conservation. However, little is known about these patterns of change and their association with the environmental context. AIMS: To explore the association of forest cover increase with changes in the spatial pattern of European landscapes, while considering their original landscape composition, geographical position and elevation. METHODS: We obtained data from ESA and GFC land cover maps and other GIS layers and performed a set of GLM on randomly selected 752 landscapes with recent (1990–2012) forest increase. RESULTS: A decrease in landscape diversity in the last decades was not associated to forest increase but to high cropland and low scrub-grassland cover. A forest increase promoted the defragmentation of already-existing forests and new patch proliferation in forest-dominated and non-dominated landscapes, respectively. These processes also depend on elevation and geographical position, with forest defragmentation concentrated in Northern and Eastern Europe and new patch proliferation in southern and western regions, and in mid-elevation areas. CONCLUSION: Changes in afforested landscapes are more complex than expected and cannot be solely attributable to forest increase, but also to landscape composition and location across elevation and geographical gradients across Europe.  aPublisher supplied data  aBDNS 417789cAgència de Gestió d’Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca  aRTI2018-099397-B-C22cMCIU/AEI/ERDF, EU  aAPCIN_2016_0174cAgencia Estatal de Investigación (AEI) y el Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad (actualmente MICINN)  aCGL2015-70558-PcMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad 3aafforestation 3abiodiversity conservation 3acropland 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3aEastern European region 3aEurope1 aEspelta, Josep Maria1 aGordillo, Javier1 aPino, Joan0 tAnnals of forest science.g2020 June, v. 77, no. 2 p.43-43dSpringer PariswJournal:2137x1286-45607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-020-00946-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012200167300001600289520113800305592002801443650001401471650001401485650001701499650001401516650002601530650003301556650002101589650001201610650001901622650001501641650002601656650002001682650002401702650001701726650002601743653001401769653001401783653001401797653001401811653004201825700002701867773013901894856008202033852000902115655001202124IND60596986520221119102432.0180622e20180720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059698652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.05.1722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMallik, Aritra10aSaturated fatty acid palmitate negatively regulates autophagy by promoting ATG5 protein degradation in meniscus cells  ap. 370-374.  aObesity and associated metabolic factors are major risk factors for the development of osteoarthritis. Previously, we have shown that the free fatty acid palmitate induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and induces apoptosis in meniscus cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in these effects are not clearly understood. In our current study, we found that palmitate inhibits autophagy by modulating the protein levels of autophagy-related genes-5 (ATG5) that is associated with decreased lipidation of LC3 and increased activation of cleaved caspase 3. Pretreatment of meniscus cells with 4-phenyl butyric acid, a small molecule chemical chaperone that alleviates ER stress, or with MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, restored normal levels of ATG5 and autophagosome formation, and decreased expression of cleaved caspase 3. Thus, our data suggest that palmitate downregulates autophagy in meniscus cells by degrading ATG5 protein via ER-associated protein degradation, and thus promotes apoptosis. This is the first study to demonstrate that palmitate-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress negatively regulates autophagy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3abutyric acid 3acaspase-3 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3afree fatty acids 3aobesity 3aosteoarthritis 3apalmitates 3aproteasome inhibitors 3aprotein content 3aprotein degradation 3arisk factors 3asaturated fatty acids 0aER stress 0aAutophagy 0aApoptosis 0aATG genes 0aPalmitic acid and osteoarthritis (OA)1 aYammani, Raghunatha R.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 July 20, v. 502 p.370-374dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.05.1723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012800169300001800297520214100315592002802456650002702484650002902511650003602540650002002576650001802596650001002614650001702624650001102641650001502652651001402667651001602681700001802697773014202715856008102857852000902938655001202947IND60596427020221120122812.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059642702DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-018-3036-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRückriemen, Jana10aPilot study on the discrimination of commercial Leptospermum honeys from New Zealand and Australia by HPLC–MS/MS analysis  ap. 1203-1209.  aManuka honey from New Zealand is derived from the nectar of Leptospermum scoparium and contains high amounts of methylglyoxal (MGO), which is responsible for its extraordinary antibacterial properties and its high market value. It was shown recently, that honeys from Australian Leptospermum species, often referred to as “jellybush honey”, also contain MGO. Recently, an official method has been published by the Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) New Zealand to characterize monofloral and multifloral manuka honey from New Zealand, based on the concentration of the phytochemical compounds 2′-methoxyacetophenone (2-MAP), 2-methoxybenzoic acid (2-MB), 3-phenyllactic acid (3-PLA) and 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid (4-HPLA). Here we show that these phytochemical markers are suitable to differentiate honeys originating from Leptospermum species from New Zealand or Australia, respectively. Three non-manuka honeys and eight manuka honeys from New Zealand as well as four non-Leptospermum honeys and 15 Leptospermum honeys from Australia were analysed for their MGO content via RP-HPLC-UV and their 2-MAP, 2-MB, 4-HPLA and 3-PLA concentration via RP-HPLC–MS/MS. All non-manuka honeys contained only negligible amounts of MGO, whereas honeys from Leptospermum species contained up to 1100 mg/kg, independent of the geographical origin. No significant amounts of 3-PLA, 4-HPLA, 2-MB and 2-MAP were found in the non-manuka honeys. In contrast, all marker compounds were abundantly present in manuka honeys from New Zealand, thus enabling a characterization of monofloral or multifloral quality. All honey samples from Australian Leptospermum species contained 2-MAP in concentrations below the limit of detection. The concentrations of the other marker compounds ranged from 58 to 357 mg/kg for 3-PLA, from 1 to 3 mg/kg for 4-HPLA and from 26 to 175 mg/kg for 2-MB and were significantly different when compared to New Zealand manuka honeys. Based on the results of this study, the marker compounds suggested by the MPI might be useful to distinguish honeys derived from Leptospermum species of different geographical origins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptospermum scoparium 3aantibacterial properties 3achemical constituents of plants 3adetection limit 3afood research 3ahoney 3amarket value 3anectar 3aprovenance 3aAustralia 3aNew Zealand1 aHenle, Thomas0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2018 July, v. 244, no. 7 p.1203-1209dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-018-3036-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245014200175300001800317520146500335592002801800650003401828650002601862650002301888650002501911650002601936650001001962650000901972650001501981650001201996650001802008650002102026650001602047650004102063650004302104650001002147650001002157650002002167650003002187650002302217700001802240700002002258773014202278856008102420852000902501655001202510IND60596427120221120112359.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059642712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-018-3034-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJasicka-Misiak, Izabela10aChromatographic fingerprint, antioxidant activity, and colour characteristic of polish goldenrod (Solidago virgaurea L.) honey and flower  ap. 1169-1184.  aIn recent times, the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical interest in honey due to its well-known health properties has increased. Consumers need clear and precise information, so that they can make informed choices about their diet and the foods they buy. Therefore, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography with a photodiode array detector (HPLC-PAD) was revealed a general characteristic fingerprint of polish monofloral goldenrod honey and flowers. In addition, high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) has proven to be a useful tool for determining similarity patterns of common bands among honey from the same floral source and thus can be used for authenticating honey samples. A total of 137 volatile compounds were identified in goldenrod honey. Among them, hotrienol, nerol oxide, and benzyl cinnamate can be regarded as chemical markers specific to the botanical origin of goldenrod honey. The HPLC-PAD phenolic profile was similar across all samples, and gallic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and p-coumaric acid were shown to be the main components. The honey exhibited a moderate antioxidant potential DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl)—31.1–40.0% and ABTS (2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) diammonium salt)—46.7 to 56.9%, typical of light honeys, and this potential correlates well with the colour intensity and phenolic and flavonoid composition of the honey.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3a4-hydroxybenzoic acid 3aSolidago virgaurea 3aantioxidant activity 3abotanical composition 3acolor 3adiet 3aflavonoids 3aflowers 3afood research 3afunctional foods 3agallic acid 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahoney 3anerol 3ap-coumaric acid 3athin layer chromatography 3avolatile compounds1 aMakowicz, Ewa1 aStanek, Natalia0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2018 July, v. 244, no. 7 p.1169-1184dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-018-3034-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03689naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100001400174245013400188300001600322520133300338592002801671650002101699650002701720650001401747650002201761650002601783650001801809650001301827650001201840650002801852650001401880650001201894650000901906650001601915650002401931650001201955650001301967650002001980650002202000650002502022650001302047650003702060650005002097650002502147650003202172650004102204650004802245650003002293650004002323650003002363650005602393650005602449650003702505653001602542653002102558653002302579653002102602653003402623700001902657700001902676700001802695700001802713773013702731856009002868852000902958655001202967IND50060553820221119032945.0190318e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006055382DNAL7 a233333402pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.11.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jie10aInhibitory effect of lactoferrin against gray mould on tomato plants caused by Botrytis cinerea and possible mechanisms of action  ap. 151-157.  aLactoferrin (LF), an 80kDa iron binding glycoprotein, was effective in the control of gray mould caused by Botrytis cinerea on tomato. LF strongly inhibited spore germination and germ tube elongation of B. cinerea in vitro, especially at 100mg/L. When viewed by fluorescence microscopy following staining with propidium iodide, the membrane integrity of B. cinerea conidia treated with LF (50mg/L) decreased to 68% at 2h. The leakage of carbohydrate and protein from mycelia increased as the dose of LF increased compared with the untreated controls. Furthermore, methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) content in B. cinerea spores exposed to LF increased markedly. The activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in spores treated with LF were also 1.3, twice as high as those in the control at 6h, whereas ATP content was 1.5 times lower. In planta assays demonstrated that LF exhibited significant curative effect (76.3%, 100mg/L) against gray mould, compared with the preventive effect (52.6%, 100mg/L). The mechanisms by which LF decreased gray mould decay of tomato plant may be directly related to the severe damage to the conidia plasma membrane and loss of cytoplasmic materials from the hyphae. These findings suggest that LF has potential as an antifungal agent to reduce the severity of gray mould of tomato plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aaldehydes 3aantifungal agents 3aantifungal properties 3acarbohydrates 3acatalase 3aconidia 3afluorescence microscopy 3agerm tube 3aiodides 3airon 3alactoferrin 3amechanism of action 3amethane 3amycelium 3aplasma membrane 3aspore germination 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atomatoes 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexanalysis 2aBotrytisxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aCell Membranexdrug effects 2aFungicides, Industrialxpharmacology 2aHyphaexdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aLactoferrinxpharmacology 2aSolanum lycopersicumxmicrobiology. 2aMalondialdehydexanalysis 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aSpores, Fungalxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 0aLactoferrin 0aBotrytis cinerea 0aMembrane integrity 0aCellular leakage 0aMethane dicarboxylic aldehyde1 aXia, Xiao-Ming1 aWang, Hong-Yan1 aLi, Peng-Peng1 aWang, Kai-Yun0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 161, no. 3 p.151-157dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.11.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002100172245010100193300001300294520168900307592002801996650002102024650002602045650002502071650001702096650001002113650002002123650001302143650001602156650002002172650001502192650001102207650001802218650001302236650002502249650001002274650001002284650002002294650002602314650001202340650002202352650007302374650006902447650007502516650002402591653002202615653001702637653002602654653001202680653000902692653001002701700002102711773009402732856008802826852000902914655001202923IND60113561120221123042629.0190318e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011356112DNAL7 a235623722pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2013.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Fong-Chin10aMolecular characterization of NbEH1 and NbEH2, two epoxide hydrolases from Nicotiana benthamiana  ap. 6-15.  aPlant epoxide hydrolases (EH) form two major clades, named EH1 and EH2. To gain a better understanding of the biochemical roles of the two classes, NbEH1.1 and NbEH2.1 were isolated from Nicotiana benthamiana and StEH from potato and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant proteins were assayed with a variety of substrates. NbEH1.1 only accepted some aromatic epoxides, and displayed the highest enzyme activity towards phenyl glycidyl ether. In contrast, NbEH2.1 displayed a broad substrate range and similar substrate specificity as StEH. The latter enzymes showed activity towards all fatty acid epoxides examined. The activity (Vmax) of NbEH1.1 towards phenyl glycidyl ether was 10 times higher than that of NbEH2.1. On the contrary, NbEH2.1 converted cis-9,10-epoxystearic acid with Vmax of 3.83μmolminmg−1 but NbEH1.1 could not hydrolyze cis-9,10-epoxystearic acid. Expression analysis revealed that NbEH1.1 is induced by infection with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and wounding, whereas NbEH2.1 is present at a relatively constant level, not influenced by treatment with TMV and wounding. NbEH1.1 transcripts were present predominantly in roots, whereas NbEH2.1 mRNAs were detected primarily in leaves and stems. Overall, these two types of tobacco EH enzymes are distinguished not only by their gene expression, but also by different substrate specificities. EH1 seems not to participate in cutin biosynthesis and it may play a role in generating signals for activation of certain defence and stress responses in tobacco. However, members of the EH2 group hydrate fatty acid epoxides and may be involved in cutin monomer production in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3abiosynthesis 3acutin 3aenzyme activity 3aepoxides 3afatty acids 3agene expression 3ahydrolases 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3apotatoes 3arecombinant proteins 3aroots 3astems 3astress response 3asubstrate specificity 3atobacco 2aEnzyme Activation 2aEpoxide Hydrolasesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aTobaccoxenzymology 0aEpoxide hydrolase 0aPeroxygenase 0aNicotiana benthamiana 0aEpoxide 0aDiol 0aTriol1 aSchwab, Wilfried0 tPhytochemistry.g2013 June, v. 90 p.6-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2013.02.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245009900166506002800265520162900293592002801922506003701950650001501987650001502002650001302017650001402030650002702044650001502071650001802086650001402104650000702118650002602125650001602151650001302167650001302180651001402193653000902207653001402216653001102230653001602241653001602257653001202273773009202285856008002377852000902457655001202466IND60764542120221207141255.0170329e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076454212DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d1801322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKUSWANTORO, HERU10aDifferential response of roots growth of soybean germplasm under low pH and manganese toxicity  aResource is Open Access  aKuswantoro H. 2016. Differential response of roots growth of soybean germplasm under low pH and manganese toxicity. Biodiversitas 18: 257-262. Most of Indonesia dry land are covered by acid soil. The growth and development of the plant in this acid soil cope with low pH and micronutrients toxicity. The objective of this research was to study the response of root growth of soybean germplams to low pH and manganese toxicity. Nine soybean germplasm were treated in aquadest with pH 7 as control, aquadest with pH 4, and 75 ppm Mn with pH 4 in Seed Laboratory of Indonesian Legume and Tuber Crops Research Institute, Malang, Indonesia. Results showed that root length, number of lateral roots, root dry weight were lower in low pH and Mn toxicity than in the control. Shoot dry weight, hypocotyl length and epicotyl length were not influenced by low pH and Mn toxicity. Some genotypes showed increasing root length in low pH, and increasing number of lateral roots and root dry weight in Mn toxicity. Based on the acid soil adaptation index (ASAI) on root length, MLGG 0493 and MLGG 0496 showed the highest value index in three comparative conditions. The genotype of MLGG 0496 also showed the highest ASAI value on numbers of lateral root in three comparative conditions. MLGG 0494 achieved the highest ASAI value of root dry weight. However, the use of root dry weight as a criterion in soybean adaptation in low pH and Mn toxicity should be studied further because the tolerance is not just in increasing root dry weight as a result of root thickening.

Kinetics, Effects of Salinity, and Implications for Wettability and Bitumen Recovery  ap. 844-853.  aImproving the efficiency of secondary and tertiary oil recovery is one of the major challenges of the crude oil industry. Arguably the most significant advance made in recent years has been the realization of the importance of water chemistry during oil recovery. This has led to the concept of low-salinity waterflooding for conventional oil reservoirs, for which reducing the total salinity of the injection water has been found to improve oil recovery rates. Although the precise mechanisms responsible for the improvements are not completely understood, it is acknowledged that specific interactions in the crude oil/brine/rock (COBR) systems will modify wettability and interfacial energy. The present paper extends investigations of COBR interactions to higher viscosity oils and considers implications for heavy oil recovery. We have used NMR relaxation time measurements to study interactions in oil/brine/sand (OBS) systems containing either natural bitumen or a polybutene hydrocarbon (Glissopal). Exposing the oil-coated sands to water or aqueous group 1 and group 2 metal chloride solutions enabled the T₂ relaxation time spectrum to be determined as a function of time. The observed decreases in the geometric mean T₂ values with time obey first-order kinetics; for bitumen-coated sands, the rate constants are consistent with diffusion of water through the bitumen. Opto-digital microscopy verified the formation of ∼1–3 μm diameter water droplets in the initially dry bitumen coating, suggesting that water nucleation and growth also occur. This was not observed for the Glissopal-coated sand samples. No evidence was found for displacement of either viscous oil from the sand grains, although optical microscopy did reveal rearrangement of the bitumen coating, which possibly exposes fresh sand surfaces to the aqueous phase. This behavior is consistent with the finding that the original T₂ parameters determined for fresh sand are not fully restored simply by contacting the bitumen-sand surface to water or aqueous salt solutions under the ambient experimental conditions. Glissopal-coated sands exhibited smaller time-dependent T₂ changes compared with bitumen-coated sands. While not displacing viscous oils from the sand surface under the experimental conditions used, it is conjectured that water ingress into the surface oil layer could weaken oil/sand interactions which by analogy with recent studies on conventional oil recovery could provide an additional heavy oil recovery mechanism under more dynamic or higher temperature conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3achlorides 3acoatings 3adroplets 3aenergy 3ahydrochemistry 3alight microscopy 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoil fields 3aoils 3apetroleum 3asalinity 3asand 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awettability1 aJones, Marc1 aTaylor, Spencer E.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 Feb. 18, v. 30, no. 2 p.844-853dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.5b023523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245009700162300001800259520137800277592002801655650002201683650000901705650001201714650001301726650000901739650001101748651001201759700002201771700001801793700002301811700002101834773009901855852000901954856007101963930003302034946001302067655001202080IND60478049620221120045455.0160108e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047804962DNAL7 a10.1890/03-02692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales, Juan Manuel10aExtracting more out of relocation data: building movement models as mixtures of random walks  ap. 2436-2445.  aWe present a framework for fitting multiple random walks to animal movement paths consisting of ordered sets of step lengths and turning angles. Each step and turn is assigned to one of a number of random walks, each characteristic of a different behavioral state. Behavioral state assignments may be inferred purely from movement data or may include the habitat type in which the animals are located. Switching between different behavioral states may be modeled explicitly using a state transition matrix estimated directly from data, or switching probabilities may take into account the proximity of animals to landscape features. Model fitting is undertaken within a Bayesian framework using the WinBUGS software. These methods allow for identification of different movement states using several properties of observed paths and lead naturally to the formulation of movement models. Analysis of relocation data from elk released in east‐central Ontario, Canada, suggests a biphasic movement behavior: elk are either in an “encamped” state in which step lengths are small and turning angles are high, or in an “exploratory” state, in which daily step lengths are several kilometers and turning angles are small. Animals encamp in open habitat (agricultural fields and opened forest), but the exploratory state is not associated with any particular habitat type.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aelks 3aforests 3ahabitats 3alead 3amodels 3aOntario1 aHaydon, Daniel T.1 aFrair, Jacqui1 aHolsinger, Kent E.1 aFryxell, John M.0 tEcology.g2004 Sept., v. 85, no. 9 p.2436-2445dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-02693Available from publisher's site  a20050613b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02581naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001600141245007900157300001600236520157200252592002801824650001301852650001401865650001301879650001901892650001501911650002201926650001501948650001601963700002301979773016902002856007502171852000902246655001202255IND60649711620221119040810.0190705e20130308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064971162DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi20101352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Junjun10aSpatial Search Techniques for Mobile 3D Queries in Sensor Web Environments  ap. 135-154.  aDeveloping mobile geo-information systems for sensor web applications involves technologies that can access linked geographical and semantically related Internet information. Additionally, in tomorrow’s Web 4.0 world, it is envisioned that trillions of inexpensive micro-sensors placed throughout the environment will also become available for discovery based on their unique geo-referenced IP address. Exploring these enormous volumes of disparate heterogeneous data on today’s location and orientation aware smartphones requires context-aware smart applications and services that can deal with “information overload”. 3DQ (Three Dimensional Query) is our novel mobile spatial interaction (MSI) prototype that acts as a next-generation base for human interaction within such geospatial sensor web environments/urban landscapes. It filters information using “Hidden Query Removal” functionality that intelligently refines the search space by calculating the geometry of a three dimensional visibility shape (Vista space) at a user’s current location. This 3D shape then becomes the query “window” in a spatial database for retrieving information on only those objects visible within a user’s actual 3D field-of-view. 3DQ reduces information overload and serves to heighten situation awareness on constrained commercial off-the-shelf devices by providing visibility space searching as a mobile web service. The effects of variations in mobile spatial search techniques in terms of query speed vs. accuracy are evaluated and presented in this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3adatabases 3ageometry 3ageoreferencing 3alandscapes 3amobile telephones 3aprototypes 3aurban areas1 aCarswell, James D.0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2013 Mar. 08, v. 2, no. 1 p.135-154dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi20101353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03828naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024003000121040001800151100001600169245013600185500002000321506002800341506003000369520212600399592002802525596008302553596007002636506003702706650002202743650003302765650002802798650002002826650001002846650002202856650003502878650001202913650001302925650001802938650001302956650001402969651001802983700001903001700002503020700006203045773012303107856007303230903002203303852000903325655001203334IND60625485920221207122605.0181208e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062548592DNAL7 a10.1111/jfs.125312doi7 a10.1111/jfs.125312chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMing, Ziwen10aFlow rate of depuration system has minimal impact on Vibrio parahaemolyticus decontamination in Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas)  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aVibrio parahaemolyticus infections in the United States have been linked to consumption of raw oysters. Depuration has the potential to reduce contamination in live oysters after harvest. This study investigated the impact of depuration flow rate to reduce V. parahaemolyticus in raw oysters. Pacific oysters (n = 35 per trial) were inoculated with a cocktail of V. parahaemolyticus (10290, 10292, 10293, BE 98‐2029, and 027‐1c1) in freshly prepared artificial seawater (70 L). The inoculated oysters were depurated with flow rates of 15, 20, 25, and 35 L/min at 12.5 °C for up to 5 days and V. parahaemolyticus contamination was determined using a three‐tube most probable number (MPN) method. V. parahaemolyticus reductions were as flow rate moderately increased from 15 L/min (2.39 log MPN/g reduction in 5 days) to 35 L/min (3.39 log MPN/g reduction). These results suggest that depuration efficacy can be enhanced by increasing depuration flow rate to 35 L/min. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Vibrio parahaemolyticus can contaminate raw shellfish, including oysters, during their production and lead to outbreaks of foodborne illness. Depuration, a post‐harvest process, may be used by the shellfish industry to reduce the persistence of V. parahaemolyticus. Previous studies have demonstrated that the depuration process can reduce V. parahaemolyticus in oysters; however, further optimization of the process is necessary to achieve US Food Drug Administration's targeted reduction goal (>3.52 log MPN/g). This study evaluated the impact of depuration flow rate on the reduction of V. parahaemolyticus in Pacific oysters. Increasing flow rates (15–35 L/min) during depuration enhanced the clearance of V. parahaemolyticus in these oysters; however, these conditions were unable to consistently achieve the target of >3.52 log MPN/g reduction. This study provides a reference for the industry on the variability of V. parahaemolyticus in individual oysters and demonstrates that practical modifications (i.e., flow rate) can be implemented in depuration systems to maximize bacterial clearance.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  a#2011‐68003‐30005cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3adecontamination 3adrugs 3afoodborne illness 3amost probable number technique 3aoysters 3araw meat 3araw shellfish 3aseawater 3ashellfish 3aUnited States1 aSu, Yi‐Cheng1 aDeWitt, Christina M.1 aWaite‐Cusic, Joy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4556-29420 tJournal of food safety.g2018 Dec., v. 38, no. 6 p.e12531-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10993x0149-60857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfs.125313Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245015000172300001800322520091800340592002801258650001901286650001601305650001701321650001701338650002701355650001101382650001401393650001001407650001601417650000901433650002101442650001001463650000701473650001701480650001201497650000901509700002901518700002501547700004301572700002501615700002201640773021301662856007401875852000901949655001201958IND50085929620221116150557.0150206e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008592962DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.124322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorba, Karla Kalígia Silva14aThe effect of storage on nutritional, textural and sensory characteristics of creamy ricotta made from whey as well as cow's milk and goat's milk  ap. 1279-1286.  aThe aim of this study was to develop a creamy ricotta using a mixture of goat and cow whey as the main ingredients, with the addition of whole goat and cow milk.

The medium‐ and long‐chain fatty acid content was higher than the short‐chain fatty acid content. The flavour and aroma of creamy ricotta were described by the panel as having a soft texture and wet appearance.

These results point that this multifunctional strain can be proposed for phytorestoration of heavy metal contaminated sites.  aWe acknowledge Techno India University for funding the work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aDelftia 3aaerobic conditions 3aagar 3aammonia 3abacteria 3acoal 3acoal mine spoil 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogen cyanide 3aindole acetic acid 3alead 3ametal tolerance 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3aroots 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseeds 3ashoots 3asiderophores 3asolubilization 3asulfates 3asulfur 3athiosulfates 3atricalcium phosphate 0aDelftia sp 0afacultative chemolithoautotroph 0alead mobilization 0aphosphate solubilization 0apot based bioassay 0asulfur-oxidizing bacteria1 aRoy, Madhumita0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2019 May 12, v. 21, no. 6 p.531-540dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2018.15372383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04739naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245019200170506002800362520302300390592002803413506003703441650003303478650001903511650001903530650002003549650001503569650002803584650001603612650001303628650001703641650001103658650001503669650001003684650001303694650000903707650002203716650002103738650000903759650001303768650001503781650001503796651001403811653002203825653001903847653001603866653001003882700002103892700002003913700002203933700002503955773009203980856008004072852000904152655001204161IND60764542520221207141255.0211121e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076454252DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2102162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMUTAQIN, ASEP ZAINAL10aEthnobotany of suweg (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius): Folk classification, habitat, and traditional conservation in Cisoka Village, Majalengka District, Cimanuk Watershed Region, Indonesia  aResource is Open Access  aMutaqin AZ, Kurniadie D, Iskandar J, Nurzaman M, Partasasmita R. 2020. Ethnobotany of suweg (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius): Folk classification, habitat, and traditional conservation in Cisoka Village, Majalengka District, Cimanuk Watershed Region, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 21: 546-555. Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Dennst.) Nicolson or suweg is commonly called in Sunadese of West Java as suweg that is a species of tuber growing in many regions of the world, including in the Cimanuk Watershed, West Java Province, Indonesia. A. paeoniifolius usually grows in rural areas of West Java in some agroecosystem types, including the homegarden, garden, and mixed garden system. This plant species, in contrast to other tuber species, such as taro, has not been intensively cultivated by rural community in West Java. Even though A. paeoniifolius has not been intensively cultivated, this plant species in the future have the potential to be used for various purposes for human being. Because A. paeoniifolius, one of plant tubers, has a high resistance to unpredictable environmental changes, such as climate change, pest disruption, and easy to maintain. This study aimed to elucidate the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of rural people of Cisoka Village, Cikijing Sub-district, Majalengka District of Cimanuk Watershed, West Java on folk classification, habitat, and traditional conservation of A. paeoniifolius. The method used in this study was qualitative. Field data collection was undertaken by observation and semi-structured interviews or deep interviews with competent informants. The results of study showed that the rural population of Cisoka Village, Majalengka District, has recognized two kinds of Amorphophallus. Firstly, Amorphophallus is a commonly consumed that is called suweg which has scientific name as Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Dennst.) Nicolson. Secondly, Amorphophallus is recognized as not commonly consumed which is called 'iles-iles' (Amorphophallus variabilis Blume). Both species can be traditionally classified based on morphology (tubers, leaf blade and petioles, and flowers), habitat, utilization, cultivation, and suitability of growing places. Specifically, A. paeoniifolius, grows in various conditions, growing at non-cultivated lands, such as forests and cultivated land, such as homegarden, garden, mixed-garden, and rice fields, or pond edges, but predominantly grows in homegardens and gardens. Some of these lands are hieum or shaded areas and negrak or open areas. A. paeoniifolius starts to grow and develop at the beginning of the rainy season until approaching the dry season, which is characterized by yellowing and falling of petiole. Conservation of A. paeoniifolius has been based on tradition is carried out by the rural community through storage/ preparation of seeds, which does not destroy A. paeoniifolius that grows in several types of agroecosystems, and is managed semi-intensively in several types of agroecosystems such as homegardens and gardens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmorphophallus paeoniifolius 3aagroecosystems 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3adry season 3aenvironmental knowledge 3aethnobotany 3ahabitats 3ahome gardens 3ahumans 3aleaf blade 3apests 3apetioles 3arice 3arural communities 3arural population 3ataro 3avillages 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aIndonesia 0acimanuk watershed 0acisoka village 0aethnobotany 0asuweg1 aKURNIADIE, DENNY1 aISKANDAR, JOHAN1 aNURZAMAN, MOHAMAD1 aPartasasmita, Ruhyat0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Jan., v. 21, no. 2dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2102163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245011700151300001600268500001500284520149200299592002801791650002201819650001801841650001201859650001401871650002801885650003301913650001101946650001801957650001301975650002501988650001202013650002202025651001602047653001002063700001602073700001802089700001902107700001602126700001502142700001802157773011402175856007302289852000902362655001202371IND50085915020221118232406.0150206e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008591502DNAL7 a10.1111/ppa.121392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, S.10aGenetic variability and pathogenicity of Rhizoctonia solani associated with black scurf of potato in New Zealand  ap. 651-666.  a2019-12-06  aIsolates (a total of 129) of Rhizoctonia solani were collected from black scurf on potato tubers from different potato‐growing regions in New Zealand. Sequence analysis of the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (rDNA–ITS) regions from these isolates identified three anastomosis groups (AGs), AG‐3PT, AG‐2‐1 and AG‐5. Isolates classified as AG‐3PT were widely distributed, whereas AG‐2‐1 and AG‐5 were confined to distinct locations. Sequence heterogeneity was identified in the ITS regions of 100 AG‐3PT and AG‐2‐1 isolates. Variation in the sequence and length of the rDNA–IGS1 region was also observed for selected isolates of AG‐3PT and AG‐2‐1. Phylogenetic studies found all AG‐2‐1 isolates belong to AG‐2Nt, a subset of AG‐2‐1 previously associated with solanaceous crops in other countries. AG‐2‐1 isolates were consistently more aggressive than those of AG‐3PT. Delayed emergence, severe infection on stolons, formation of aerial tubers and considerable yield losses were associated with AG‐2‐1, but they caused negligible black scurf. In contrast, AG‐3PT caused black scurf on progeny tubers but variable effects on stem emergence and stolons. Furthermore, AG‐2‐1 isolates caused severe tuber malformation, but isolates of other AGs did not. This is the first report on the AG composition, genetic variability and pathogenicity of R. solani isolates associated with black scurf of New Zealand potatoes.  aPublisher supplied data 3asequence analysis 3aribosomal DNA 3astolons 3aphylogeny 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3atubers 3apathogenicity 3apotatoes 3aabnormal development 3aprogeny 3agenetic variation 3aNew Zealand 0acrops1 aShah, F.

Dihydrochalcones (mainly phloridzin, sieboldin, trilobatin, phloretin) represent the major flavonoid subgroup in apple green tissues. Although this class of phenolic compounds is found in very large amounts in some tissues (≈200mg/g of leaf DW), their physiological significance remains unclear. In the present study, we highlight their tissue-specific localization in young growing shoots suggesting a specific role in important physiological processes, most notably in response to biotic stress. Indeed, dihydrochalcones could constitute a basal defense, in particular phloretin which exhibits a strong broad-range bactericidal and fungicidal activity. Our results also indicate that sieboldin forms complexes with iron with strong affinity, reinforcing its antioxidant properties and conferring to this dihydrochalcone a potential for iron seclusion and/or storage. The importance of localization and biochemical properties of dihydrochalcones are discussed in view of the apple tree defense strategy against both biotic and abiotic stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3aantifungal properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aapples 3abiotic stress 3airon 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3aphenolic compounds 3aphloridzin 3aplant development 3ashoots 3atrees 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aAntifungal Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aBacteriaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aChalconesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFlavonoidsxchemistry 2aFungixdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aMalusxchemistry 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPlant Shootsxchemistry 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 0aMalus x domestica 0aRosaceae 0aHistolocalization 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aIron chelation 0aDihydrochalcones 0aPhloridzin 0aSieboldin 0aPhloretin1 aDugé de Bernonville, Thomas1 aLohou, David1 aGuyot, Sylvain1 aGuillemette, Thomas1 aBrisset, Marie-Noëlle1 aDat, James F.0 tPhytochemistry.g2013 June, v. 90 p.78-89dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2013.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006800152245012500220520104400345592002801389650000901417650001901426650001001445650001301455650001001468650001601478653001001494653002601504653000801530653002201538653003401560700006301594700005601657700005801713700002601771700007901797700007001876773009901946856008702045852000902132655001202141IND60716170820221121205323.0220103e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071617082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1285172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadaró, Amanda Teixeira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7015-623310aNear infrared hyperspectral imaging and spectral unmixing methods for evaluation of fiber distribution in enriched pasta  aPasta is mostly composed by wheat flour and water. Nevertheless, flour can be partially replaced by fibers to provide extra nutrients in the diet. However, fiber can affect the technological quality of pasta if not properly distributed. Usually, determinations of parameters in pasta are destructive and time-consuming. The use of Near Infrared-Hyperspectral Imaging (NIR-HSI), together with machine learning methods, is valuable to improve the efficiency in the assessment of pasta quality. This work aimed to investigate the ability of NIR-HSI and augmented Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) for the evaluation, resolution and quantification of fiber distribution in enriched pasta. Results showed R²V between 0.28 and 0.89, %LOF < 6%, variance explained over 99%, and similarity between pure and recovered spectra over 96% and 98% in models using pure flour and control as initial estimates, respectively, demonstrating the applicability of NIR-HSI and MCR-ALS in the identification of fiber in pasta.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3afood chemistry 3apasta 3avariance 3awater 3awheat flour 0aPasta 0aHyperspectral imaging 0aNIR 0aSpectral unmixing 0aMultivariate curve resolution1 aAmigo, José Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1319-13121 aBlasco, Jose1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4562-96681 aAleixos, Nuria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6051-33751 aFerreira, Amanda Rios1 aClerici, Maria Teresa Pedrosa Silva1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8445-336X1 aFernandes Barbin, Douglas,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9767-81300 tFood chemistry.g2021 May 01, v. 343 p.128517-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1285173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245013200166300001800298506002800316520157500344592002801919506003701947650001801984650001402002650003002016650002302046650002402069650001402093650002102107650001702128651001402145653001702159653002402176653002102200653002902221653001702250700001702267700002802284773010402312856008002416852000902496655001202505IND60764542620221207141251.0211116e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076454262DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d1804352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNURFADILAH, SITI10aSpecies richness, conservation status, and potential uses of plants in Segara Anakan Area of Sempu Island, East Java, Indonesia  ap. 1568-1588.  aResource is Open Access  aNurfadilah S, Hapsari L, Abywijaya IK. 2017. Species richness, conservation status, and potential uses of plants in Segara Anakan Area of Sempu Island, East Java, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 18: 1568-1588. Sempu Island is a small Island in Indonesia that has an important functional role as a nature reserve to protect unique landscapes and high plant species richness. Within the Island, one of the most frequently visited areas, Segara Anakan, needs careful attention in order to conserve its plant diversity. The objectives of the present study were to investigate the species richness, conservation status, and potential uses of plants in Segara Anakan, Sempu Island. The aim was to support management of the area and to reveal plants that have potential to be developed for useful products. A total of 77 plant species belonging to 43 families were recorded within the study area. These consisted of trees (55.84 %), shrubs (33.77%), herbs (9.09%) and epiphytes (1.3%). Two species were listed in the IUCN Red List as endangered (Cycas circinalis L. and Myristica teijsmannii Miq.). Plant species in Segara Anakan have many potential uses; namely for staple food, fruits, vegetables, flavouring, beverages, herbal medicines, timbers, ornamental plants, natural dyes, and other uses. The study has implications for biodiversity conservation and management of Sempu Island. Plant species on the IUCN Red List should receive priority in conservation efforts. Data concerning the potential uses of plants can serve as a basis for biodiversity conservation on Sempu Island.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCycas rumphii 3aMyristica 3abiodiversity conservation 3aconservation areas 3aconservation status 3aepiphytes 3aspecies richness 3astaple foods 3aIndonesia 0abiodiversity 0aconservation status 0aspecies richness 0apotential uses of plants 0asempu island1 aHAPSARI, LIA1 aABYWIJAYA, ILHAM KURNIA0 tBiodiversitas.g2017 Oct., v. 18, no. 4 p.1568-1588dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d1804353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014500168300001800313520147300331592002801804650002301832650002901855650001201884650001501896650001901911650002001930650001701950650001801967650001301985650001101998650001702009650001202026650002802038650002302066650002302089650002502112650001802137650001502155650001002170650001102180700002602191700002202217700003202239700001902271700002002290700002302310700002002333773014202353856008102495852000902576655001202585IND60596427620221120112345.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059642762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-018-3045-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeslić, Nemanja10aUtilization of ‘early green harvest’ and non-Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts as a combined approach to face climate change in winemaking  ap. 1301-1311.  aPresent study aimed to ascertain whether the combination of two factors, i.e., time of harvest and type of yeast, can significantly moderate the effect of climate change on Chardonnay wine composition. In this view, three Chardonnay musts obtained from grapes at different harvest date [technological maturity ‘as control’; delayed harvest; a mixture of ‘early (green) harvest’ with delayed harvest ‘as alternative approach’] and three selected yeast strains [Saccharomyces cerevisiae ‘as control’; hybrid Saccharomyces cerevisiae/Saccharomyces paradoxus; scalar alternative approach with Starmerella bacillaris and hybrid Saccharomyces cerevisiae/Saccharomyces paradoxus] were used to design and compare six different trials, replicated at pilot level (n. total fermentations: 18). Wines were evaluated in terms of sensory and chemical parameters (alcohol, acidity, organic acids, phenolic compounds and glycerol) and results tested by statistical analysis. Although the wine alcohol content decreased at the best by ~ 1.2% v/v, whereas the total acidity increased up to ~ 2.5 g/L, the results from sensory evaluation highlighted that the proposed ‘alternative approach’ may cause excessive acidity and bitterness perception, therefore, further deacidification and fining treatments may be needed. The present approach to reduce the alcohol content of wine and increase its total acidity is simple, inexpensive and applicable in all wineries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida zemplinina 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacidity 3abitterness 3aclimate change 3adeacidification 3afermentation 3afood research 3aglycerol 3agrapes 3aharvest date 3ahybrids 3aorganic acids and salts 3aphenolic compounds 3asensory evaluation 3astatistical analysis 3awine industry 3awinemaking 3awines 3ayeasts1 aPatrignani, Francesca1 aGhidotti, Michele1 aParpinello, GiuseppinaPaola1 aRicci, Arianna1 aTofalo, Rosanna1 aLanciotti, Rosalba1 aVersari, Andrea0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2018 July, v. 244, no. 7 p.1301-1311dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-018-3045-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245025100174300001600425520132600441592002801767650001001795650002801805650001201833650002801845650001001873650001201883650002201895650001301917650001301930650002401943650001701967653001601984653001202000653001102012653001302023653002402036653002602060653002702086653000802113653001002121653001302131653000702144653000702151653001602158653001002174700002402184700002102208700002302229700002502252700002402277700002402301773013902325856008202464852000902546655001202555IND60596984320221119102343.0180622e20180712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059698432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.05.1452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvrova, Stanislava V.14aThe reason for the low Ca2+-sensitivity of thin filaments associated with the Glu41Lys mutation in the TPM2 gene is “freezing” of tropomyosin near the outer domain of actin and inhibition of actin monomer switching off during the ATPase cycle  ap. 209-214.  aThe E41K mutation in TPM2 gene encoding muscle regulatory protein beta-tropomyosin is associated with nemaline myopathy and cap disease. The mutation results in a reduced Ca²⁺-sensitivity of the thin filaments and in muscle weakness. To elucidate the structural basis of the reduced Ca²⁺-sensitivity of the thin filaments, we studied multistep changes in spatial arrangement of tropomyosin (Tpm), actin and myosin heads during the ATPase cycle in reconstituted fibers, using the polarized fluorescence microscopy. The E41K mutation inhibits troponin's ability to shift Tpm to the closed position at high Ca²⁺, thus restraining the transition of the thin filaments from the “off” to the “on” state. The mutation also inhibits the ability of S1 to shift Tpm to the open position, decreases the amount of the myosin heads bound strongly to actin at high Ca²⁺, but increases the number of such heads at low Ca²⁺. These changes may contribute to the low Ca²⁺-sensitivity and muscle weakness. As the mutation has no effect on troponin's ability to switch actin monomers on at high Ca²⁺ and inhibits their switching off at low Ca²⁺, the use of reagents that increase the Ca²⁺-sensitivity of the troponin complex may not be appropriate to restore muscle function in patients with this mutation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acalcium 3afluorescence microscopy 3agenes 3amuscles 3amuscular diseases 3amutation 3apatients 3aregulatory proteins 3atropomyosins 0aTropomyosin 0aF-actin 0aMyosin 0aTroponin 0aGhost muscle fibres 0aCongenital myopathies 0aPolarized fluorescence 0aTpm 0aWTTpm 0aE41K-Tpm 0aTN 0aS1 0a1,5-IAEDANS 0a5-IAF1 aKarpicheva, Olga E.1 aRysev, Nikita A.1 aSimonyan, Armen O.1 aSirenko, Vladimir V.1 aRedwood, Charles S.1 aBorovikov, Yurii S.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 July 12, v. 502 p.209-214dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.05.1453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02226naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002300172245008900195300001400284520079100298592002801089650001201117650001801129650001901147650001701166650002201183650004401205650001001249650004301259650005101302650002701353650002701380650005701407653002301464653001501487653002101502653002701523700002001550700001801570773009501588856008801683852000901771655001201780IND60113561520221120204456.0190318e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011356152DNAL7 a235229332pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2013.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichalska, Klaudia10aSesquiterpene lactones from Lactuca canadensis and their chemotaxonomic significance  ap. 90-94.  aA total of 19 sesquiterpene lactones were isolated from roots of Lactuca canadensis L., of which 10 were reported for the first time from Lactuca species and two were unknown.

Food produced and sold within a certain geographical radius (typically under 400 miles) is considered LSF. Hypothesized was that simply labelling a restaurant as using LSF would create a positive halo effect (a positive perceptual bias) and promote beliefs about the restaurant’s attributes that were unrelated to LSF. The results of an experiment with 313 participants suggest that LSF labeling in restaurants produces a positive halo effect. Participants assumed that a restaurant using LSF was more environmentally friendly, served a healthier/more nutritious menu, was more conveniently located, and was more likely to use natural/organic ingredients than was a similar restaurant that did not use LSF. Additionally, participants’ food-related lifestyles were significant moderators, with those most concerned about (1) the healthiness of the food they eat, and (2) the joy they get from eating and socializing over food, being most strongly influenced by the positive LSF-halo. Overall, the results indicate that restaurants may benefit from the positive glow created from the halo effect of sourcing food locally.  aThis work was supported by the University of Denver [University of Denver Partners in Scholarship (PiNS) Grant].  aPublisher supplied data  aUniversity of Denver Partners in Scholarship (PiNS) GrantcUniversity of Denverdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009938 3afood intake 3aingredients 3alifestyle 3amarkets 3arestaurants 3asocial behavior 0aRestaurant 0alocally-sourced food 0alocal food 0alocally sourced restaurant 0ahalo effect 0afood-related lifestyles 0agreen restaurant practices 0afood labeling1 aYoung, Cheri A.0 tJournal of foodservice business research.g2019 May 4, v. 22, no. 3 p.209-238dRoutledgewJournal:J000000105x1537-80397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15378020.2019.15926543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01500naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009200125300001600217500001500233520058500248650001400833650001500847650001600862650001200878650001400890650001800904653002100922653001700943653001700960653001500977653001700992773008801009852000901097939003301106946001101139655001201150IND9202291820221120160059.0920417s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920229182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeinze, J.10aBiochemical studies on the relationship between socially parasitic ants and their hosts  ap. 195-206.  a2019-12-04  aAnalysis of enzyme patterns suggests close phylogenetic relationships between socially parasitic ants of the genera Harpagoxenus and Doronomyrmex and their Leptothorax hosts.

Indeed, rolC protein expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein hydrolyses cytokinin glucosides, thus liberating free cytokinins. Furthermore, beta-glucosidase activity present in E.coli extracts expressing the rolC protein was inhibited by affinity-purified antibodies specific for the rolC protein. Finally, rolC proteins expressed in transgenic plants were shown to be responsible for cytokinin-beta-glucosidase activity. Morphological and phytohormonal analysis, performed on transgenic plants that are somatic mosaics for the expression of the rolC gene, extend and confirm our interpretation that the developmental, physiological and morphological alterations caused by rolC expression in transgenic plants are primarily due to a modification of the cytokinin balance. These observations shed new light on the control of growth and differentiation in plants by growth factors. 3agenetically modified organisms 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3acytokinins 3acell differentiation 3aoncogenes 3abeta-glucosidase 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBlotting, Western 2aChromatography, Thin Layer 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCytokininsxmetabolism 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGlycosidesxmetabolism 2aOncogenes 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPlasmids 2aRhizobiumxgenetics 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2abeta-Glucosidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aplants 0agrowth1 aChriqui, D.1 aGrossmann, Klaus.1 aSchell, J.1 aSpena, A.0 tEMBO journal.g1991 Oct., v. 10, no. 10 p.2889-2895x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02635naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245013500164300001600299520159100315650001101906650000901917650001001926650000901936650001601945650002401961650002401985700002402009700002002033700001902053700002002072773015202092856004402244852000902288655001202297IND60592509720221120150942.0180405e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059250972DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.79.4.4432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharpe, Emily K.10aEffect of oral administration of robenacoxib on inhibition of paracentesis-induced blood-aqueous barrier breakdown in healthy cats  ap. 443-449.  aOBJECTIVE To determine the effect of oral administration of robenacoxib on inhibition of anterior chamber paracentesis (ACP)-induced breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier (BAB) and assess whether robenacoxib can cross an intact BAB in healthy cats. ANIMALS 12 healthy adult domestic shorthair cats. PROCEDURES Cats received robenacoxib (6-mg tablet in a treat, PO; n = 6) or a control treatment (treat without any drug, PO; 6) once daily for 3 days, beginning 1 day before ACP. One eye of each cat served as an untreated control, whereas the other underwent ACP, during which a 30-gauge needle was used to aspirate 100 μL of aqueous humor for determination of robenacoxib concentration. Both eyes of each cat underwent anterior chamber fluorophotometry at 0 (immediately before), 6, 24, and 48 hours after ACP. Fluorescein concentration and percentage fluorescein increase were used to assess extent of ACP-induced BAB breakdown and compared between cats that did and did not receive robenacoxib. RESULTS Extent of BAB breakdown induced by ACP did not differ significantly between cats that did and did not receive robenacoxib. Low concentrations of robenacoxib were detected in the aqueous humor (mean, 5.32 ng/mL; range, 0.9 to 16 ng/mL) for 5 of the 6 cats that received the drug. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated that oral administration of robenacoxib did not significantly decrease extent of BAB breakdown in healthy cats. Detection of low robenacoxib concentrations in the aqueous humor for most treated cats indicated that the drug can cross an intact BAB. 3aadults 3acats 3adrugs 3aeyes 3afluorescein 3aoral administration 3aveterinary medicine1 aMeekins, Jessica M.1 aRoush, James K.1 aRankin, Amy J.1 aKuKanich, Butch0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2018 Apr., v. 79, no. 4 p.443-449dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.79.4.443  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245009300143300001800236520140800254650001001662650000901672650001801681650002001699650001601719650002001735650001901755650001801774650001601792650001201808650001801820650004201838650004301880650001401923650001101937650001801948650002201966650001101988650000901999650004502008650001602053653001502069700001602084773008602100852000902186939003302195946001302228655001202241IND9202294220221120141103.0920417e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920229422DNAL7 a16670082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyer, R.O.10aFat supplementation of diets containing a high level of oats for growing-finishing swine  ap. 4665-4669.  aTwo 2 X 2 factorial arrangement trials were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of fat supplementation in improving the energy value of diets containing a high level of a fibrous feedstuff (oats) for growing-finishing swine. Corn-soybean meal-based diets were used that contained either 0 or 40% ground oats and either 0 or 3% added fat. Each trial used 120 pigs (27 kg) with each treatment assigned to five pens of six pigs each. Growing diets (.80% lysine for basal diet) were given from 27 to 55 kg live weight and finishing diets (.64% lysine) from 55 to 102 kg. Diets were formulated to a constant calculated ME to lysine ratio within the growing and finishing phases. Apparent digestibilities of DM and energy were determined for the growing and finishing diets by the indigestible marker (chromic oxide) method. The inclusion of oats in the diets resulted in poorer (P < .01) feed conversion efficiency and reduced (P < .01) apparent DM and energy digestibilities. The addition of fat improved (P < .01) feed conversion efficiency but had no effect (P > .10) on DM or energy digestibility. The improvements noted for feed conversion efficiency were similar (P > .10) regardless of the dietary oat content. The 3% dietary fat supplementation was equally effective in improving feed conversion efficiency whether the diets did contain or did not contain ground oats for growing-finishing swine. 3aswine 3aoats 3adigestibility 3afeed conversion 3adietary fat 3aliveweight gain 3aenergy content 3afiber content 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aEdible Grain. 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aDigestion 2aEating 2aEnergy Intake 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aMale 2aSwinexgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aWeight Gain 0aefficiency1 aCombs, G.E.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 Dec., v. 69, no. 12 p.4665-4669x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02515naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245008500146300001400231520058900245650002900834650002100863650002500884650002500909650002300934650001600957650002000973650002400993650001201017650003501029650001801064650002301082650002401105650002301129650002801152650003801180650001801218650001101236650000901247650002801256650003001284650003001314650006201344650000901406650002401415650005201439650003801491650003401529650003601563653001801599653001401617653001401631653002801645653001901673653001901692700002001711773005601731852000901787930003301796945001301829946001101842655001201853IND2040329320221120131217.0940616s1994    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204032932DNAL7 a81125852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahlkvist, A.10aTwo novel deduced serine/threonine protein kinases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 27-33.  aWe have cloned genes for two closely related protein kinase (PK) homologues from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sequence alignment of the kinase domain with previously characterized PK reveals the highest degree of similarity with second messenger-regulated kinases. RCK1 encodes a 58-kDa protein, and is weakly expressed. RCK2 encodes a 65-kDa protein, and transcripts from this gene are readily detected. RCK1 has been mapped to the L arm of chromosome VII. and RCK2 to chromosome XII.

Approximately one quarter of these resulted in inactivation of transposition: these include inactivating insertions in both the TYA and TYB genes, corresponding to retroviral gag and pol genes. Examples of transposition-inactivating mutations map within each of the known or proposed functional domains of TYB, suggesting that these are all required for retrotransposition.

In Exp. 1, the biceps femoris (BF) muscle from the left side of each of 15 bull carcasses was injected within 30 min postexsanguination with .3 M CaCl2 at 10% by weight while either intact (n = 8) on the carcass or after hot boning (n = 7). The right sides served as controls. In Exp. 2, the semimembranosus (SM) muscles from the carcasses of nine steers (castrated at 16 mo of age) were hot-boned within 30 min postexsanguination and one-half were injected with CaCl2 as described above. Hot boning had no effect (P > .05) on shear force values. Calcium chloride injection dramatically reduced shear force requirements at 1, 8, and 14 d postmortem compared with noninjected controls in both experiments. Cooking traits of the SM muscle were not affected (P > .05) by CaCl2 injection. However, BF muscles injected with CaCl2 required more (P <.05) time to cook and had greater (P < .05) cooking losses than BF controls. Calcium chloride injection of prerigor round muscles reduced aging time needed for normal tenderization to 1 d postmortem. Hot boning was successfully used in conjuction with CaCl2 injection to facilitate the injection process. 3azebu 3abeef bulls 3asteers 3abeef quality 3ameat cuts 3amuscles 3acalcium chloride 3ainjection 3ahot boning 3ashear strength 3acooking quality 2aAbattoirs 2aAnimals 2aCalcium Chloridexpharmacology 2aCattle 2aFood Handling 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aMusclesxanatomy & histologyxdrug effects. 0atenderness 0abiceps femoris 0asemimembranosus1 aKoohmaraie, M.1 aCrouse, J.D.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 Dec., v. 69, no. 12 p.4871-4875x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02754naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011500144300001800259520142900277650001101706650001401717650001301731650002201744650001701766650002101783650001901804650001201823650002701835650002601862650001301888650004301901650002101944650001101965650001701976650000901993650001202002650002402014650001202038700001602050700002102066700001502087700001702102773008602119852000902205939003302214946001302247655001202260IND9202295320221120120133.0920417e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920229532DNAL7 a18081722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSacco, R.E.10aHeterosis retention for birth and weaning characters of calves in the third generation of a five-breed diallel  ap. 4754-4762.  aData were 876 birth records and 727 weaning records of straightbred and F3 crossbred calves produced in the third generation of a five-breed diallel. Among straightbreds at birth, Holstein calves were heaviest and widest at the shoulders and hips. Jersey calves were lightest and narrowest at the hips, and Brahman calves were narrowest at the shoulders. Holstein crosses tended to be larger at birth than crosses among other breeds. Among straightbreds at weaning, Holstein calves were heaviest and tallest, and Hereford calves were lightest and shortest. Angus calves had the highest survival to weaning rate, and Holstein calves had the lowest survival rate. Among crossbred calves, Holstein crosses tended to be larger at weaning. Estimates of average heterosis retained for birth characters were not significant. Significant breed mean heterosis retention was observed for birth weight, shoulder width, and hip width of Hereford calves and for shoulder width and hip width of Holstein calves. Estimates of average heterosis retained for weaning weight and height were 6.1 kg (P < .01) and 1.02 cm (P < .05), respectively. In general, estimates of specific and average heterosis retained for survival to weaning were nonsignificant. Significant breed mean heterosis was observed for weaning weight and height of Brahman, Hereford, and Holstein calves and for survival to weaning of Hereford, Holstein, and Jersey calves. 3acalves 3aheterosis 3acrossing 3abody measurements 3abirth weight 3adiallel analysis 3aweaning weight 2aAnimals 2aBirth Weightxgenetics 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aBreeding 2aCattlexanatomy & histologyxgenetics. 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aFemale 2aHybrid Vigor 2aMale 2aSeasons 2aSex Characteristics 2aWeaning1 aBaker, J.F.1 aCartwright, T.C.1 aLong, C.R.1 aSanders, Jo.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 Dec., v. 69, no. 12 p.4754-4762x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03426naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245012700148300001800275520198800293650001602281650002102297650001702318650002002335650002802355650001102383650002402394650002402418650001702442650001902459650001202478650002702490650002602517650004402543650001102587650002702598650001802625650000902643650002302652650002002675650001402695650001202709653001102721700001802732700001702750773008602767852000902853939003302862946001302895655001202908IND9202295220221120120027.0920417e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920229522DNAL7 a18081712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorthcutt, S.L.10aGenetic parameters for nuclear and nonnuclear inheritance in three synthetic lines of beef cattle differing in mature size  ap. 4745-4753.  aGenetic parameters for nuclear and cytoplasmic genetic effects were estimated from preweaning growth data collected on three synthetic lines of beef cattle differing in mature size. Lines of small-, medium-, and large-framed calves were represented in each of two research herds (Rhodes and McNay). Variance components were estimated separately by herd and size line for birth weight and 205-d weight (WW) by REML with an animal mode using an average of 847 and 427 calf records from Rhodes and McNay, respectively. Model 1 included effects of fixed year, sex of calf, age of dam, and random additive direct (a), additive maternal genetic (m), covariance (a,m), permanent environment affecting the dam, and residual error. Model 2 differed from Model 1 by including random cytoplasmic lineage effects and by ignoring permanent environmental effects. Model 1 - direct (maternal) heritability estimates for birth weight at Rhodes were .62(.03) for small, .67(.06) for medium, and .30(.11) for large lines. Genetic correlations between direct and maternal effects for birth weight were .67, -.16, and .48 for the respective size groups. For WW at Rhodes, direct (maternal) heritability estimates were .30(.29), .30(.14), and .10(.16) for small, medium, and large lines, respectively, with genetic correlations of -.34 (small), -.12 (medium), and .17 (large). Heritability estimates at McNay were similar to those at Rhodes, except that maternal genetic heritabilities for WW were smaller (.10, small, .01, medium; .00, large). Model 2 - estimates for nuclear genetic effects were consistent with the estimates from Model 1. Cytoplasmic variance accounted for 0 to 5% of the total random variance in birth weight. For WW, cytoplasmic variance was negligible at Rhodes and accounted for 4% of the total random variance in the large line at McNay, averaging less than the permanent environment. Results failed to indicate that cytoplasmic variance was important for preweaning performance. 3abeef cattle 3aline differences 3aheritability 3amaternal effect 3acytoplasmic inheritance 3acalves 3amathematical models 3agenetic correlation 3abirth weight 3aweaning weight 2aAnimals 2aBirth Weightxgenetics 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aCattlexgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aFemale 2aLeast-Squares Analysis 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Genetic 2aPhenotype 2aWeaning 0agrowth1 aWillham, R.L.1 aWilson, D.E.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 Dec., v. 69, no. 12 p.4745-4753x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02810naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245009800144300001800242520152500260650000901785650002001794650001401814650001601828650003501844650002101879650001201900650002401912650001201936650001601948650001801964650005401982650001102036650004302047650002802090650001202118650002202130653002702152700001702179700001502196773008602211852000902297939003302306946001302339655001202352IND9202296920221120120016.0920417e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920229692DNAL7 a18081872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, C.A.10aEffects of season and estradiol-17 beta on luteinizing hormone release in ovariectomized sows  ap. 4907-4913.  aThis study examined the ability of estradiol-17 beta (E2) to suppress LH release in the sow during different months of the year. Six chronically ovariectomized sows were fitted with vena caval cannulas (d 0) and blood samples were collected at 6-h intervals for 6 d. Sows were treated s.c. with E2 capsules (24 mg of E2/275 kg of BW) at d 3. Additional blood samples were collected at 15-min intervals for 8 h on d 2 and 5. After each 8-h frequent sampling period, sows were treated i.v. with GnRH at .5 Kg/kg of BW, and blood samples were collected at 10-min intervals for 3 h. The protocol was repeated at monthly intervals for 13 mo. Luteinizing hormone concentrations were determined for all serum samples, and E2 concentrations were quantified in samples collected at 6-h intervals. Data were analyzed by split-block analyses of variance. Serum E2 concentrations increased (P < .001) from 5.0 +/- .3 pg/ml before E2 treatment to 26.0 +/- .2 pg/ml after E2 treatment. The interval from GnRH administration to peak LH concentration was shorter (P < .001) before E2 treatment than after F,2 treatment (28.7 +/- 2.2 vs 71.0 +/- 2.2 min). It was evident that baseline LH, mean LH, pulse frequency, and pulse amplitude and LH release after GnRH administration failed to demonstrate seasonal changes. In summary, LH release was suppressed after treatment with E2 and was affected minimally by month of the year. In addition, E2 inhibitory effects of LH release included hypothalamic and anterior pituitary sites of action. 3asows 3abreeding season 3aestradiol 3ablood serum 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3afemale fertility 3aseasons 3aluteinizing hormone 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aDrug Implants 2aEstradiolxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aFemale 2aLuteinizing Hormonexbloodxsecretion. 2aOvariectomyxveterinary 2aSeasons 2aSwinexphysiology 0aovariectomized females1 aAlmond, G.W.1 aDial, G.D.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 Dec., v. 69, no. 12 p.4907-4913x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03123naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100001900165245011000184300002000294500002400314520146500338650002501803650001401828650002001842650002301862650001301885650002001898650002001918650001101938650004201949650004001991650001102031650002402042650004802066650002302114650002502137653001402162700002502176700003002201700002102231700002002252773017602272852000902448856007702457930003302534945002502567946001302592655001202605IND4436872120221120054758.0100511e20100428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443687212DNAL7 a202328912pmid7 a10.1021/jf903835g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT2001 aKaur, Lovedeep10aActinidin Enhances Protein Digestion in the Small Intestine As Assessed Using an in Vitro Digestion Model  ap. 5074–5080.  aIncludes references  aThis paper describes an in vitro study that tests the proposition that actinidin from green kiwifruit influences the digestion of proteins in the small intestine. Different food proteins, from sources including soy, meat, milk, and cereals, were incubated in the presence or absence of green kiwifruit extract (containing actinidin) using a two-stage in vitro digestion system consisting of an incubation with pepsin at stomach pH (simulating gastric digestion) and then with added pancreatin at small intestinal pH, simulating upper tract digestion in humans. The digests from the small intestinal stage (following the gastric digestion phase) were subjected to gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to assess loss of intact protein and development of large peptides during the in vitro simulated digestion. Kiwifruit extract influenced the digestion patterns of all of the proteins to various extents. For some proteins, actinidin had little impact on digestion. However, for other proteins, the presence of kiwifruit extract resulted in a substantially greater loss of intact protein and different peptide patterns from those seen after digestion with pepsin and pancreatin alone. In particular, enhanced digestion of whey protein isolate, zein, gluten, and gliadin was observed. In addition, reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) analysis showed that a 2.5 h incubation of sodium caseinate with kiwifruit extract alone resulted in approximately 45% loss of intact protein. 3acysteine proteinases 3akiwifruit 3asmall intestine 3ain vitro digestion 3aproteins 3aenzyme activity 3adietary protein 3apepsin 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxpharmacology 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aHumans 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aIntestine, Smallxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aModels, Biological 2aProteinsxmetabolism 0aactinidin1 aRutherfurd, Shane M.1 aMoughan, P.

Interception of Capillarity by Soil Sintering  ap. 263-273.  aIncludes references  aIn this paper, a new method is discussed for the soil improvement of salt-affected soils in regions where a sufficient amount of rainfall occurs in summer. The sub-soil is made coarse by soil sintering, and the capillarity from groundwater is cut off. Thus, the rise to the soil surface of salts which are dissolved in the groundwater can be prevented, and even if the groundwater level is high, the evaporation of water from the soil surface can be reduced. Moreover, the salts that accumulate in the topsoil can be washed out by rainfall (leaching) during the summer season. Consequently, this method has the same effect as when the groundwater level is lowered. This paper deals with the determination of the degree of aggregation of the soil particles and the height of water raised by capillarity due to different soil sintering temperatures. The results show that the behaviour caused by sintering was similar for all soils. Sintering creates more and more coarse conditions and black colour. Non-sintered soils were saturated with distilled water and became permanently dispersed. In the soils sintered at more than 800 °C, there was no disaggregation of the soil particles in the water, so it is considered that the sintering temperature should be greater than 800 °C. In the non-sintered soils, the mean diameter of the soil particles was small (0·005-0·013 mm). If these soils were sintered, the soil aggregate size increased sharply. Even at the lowest sintering temperature (600 °C), the mean diameter of the soil aggregate increased to about 4 mm. When the sintering temperature was 1300 °C, the mean diameter of the soil aggregate rose to about 8 mm. The capillary water heights of the non-sintered salt-affected soils were predicted at some metres. With sintering, this water height was less than 0·15 m, even when the sintering temperature was the lowest (600 °C). If the soils were sintered with temperatures higher than 1000 °C, the water height by capillarity was less than 0·09 m. Thus, if about 100 mm thickness of the sub-soil just below the B horizon can be sintered, the capillarity from the groundwater can be intercepted, thus reducing water loss through evaporation and increasing salt removal through leaching during the rainy season. 3asoil pollution 3asaline soils 3asoil temperature 3asoil pH 3acapillarity 3asoil water content 3asoil texture 3aevaporation 3aleaching1 aZhang, H.1 aAraya, K.1 aGuo, G.1 aZhang, Z.1 aOhomiya, K.1 aMatsuda, J.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2006 June, v. 94, no. 2 p.263-273dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2006.01.0133electronic resource  a20070412b20070502c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/04/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02330naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008000127300001600207520119800223650001801421650002801439650002701467650001501494650002101509650001901530650004101549650002401590650002001614650002001634650002001654650002601674650001401700650002101714653001501735653001301750700001901763773006001782852000901842930003301851945001301884946001101897655001201908IND2039660220221120024549.0940520s1993    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203966022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLycett, G.J.10aStable transformation of mosquito cell lines using a hsp70::neo fusion gene  ap. 129-136.  aMosquito cell culture transfection will allow the advancement of genetic studies of these important disease-transmitting insects.

Degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligos) corresponding to the N-terminal amino-acid sequence of MSP4 were used as primers in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify a 65-bp fragment of which the central 32 bp was nondegenerate. The 32-bp probe was hybridized to restriction enzyme-digested, genomic A. marginale DNA in Southern blots, and the hybridizing fragment was size selected from agarose gels and ligated into the Bluescript II SK (+/-) plasmid. The ligation reaction mixture was used as a template for PCR, amplified from the 32-bp oligo or its inverse complement to plasmid sequences. The PCR products were sequenced to obtain the entire msp4 gene and surrounding regions. This method of sequencing a gene without previously obtaining a clone for that gene could be beneficial in situations where conventional cloning and screening strategies are inefficient or ineffective. 3aAnaplasma marginale 3astructural genes 3abacterial proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3asequence analysis 3apolymerase chain reaction 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/l019871 aBarbet, A.F.0 tGene.g1993, v. 136, no. 1/2 p.291-294x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03056naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004500092040001800137072000900155072000900164100001400173245007800187300001400265500002400279520177400303650002002077650001202097650001102109650001102120650001002131650001202141650003602153650002302189650002202212650002602234650002802260651001702288700001702305700001202322700001402334773009302348852000902441856007902450930003302529945002502562946001102587655001202598IND4387021920221123040907.0070122e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438702192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2006.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF130 0aF6001 aDalai, A.10aVolatile Organic Compounds emitted during High-temperature Alfalfa Drying  ap. 57-66.  aIncludes references  aControlled laboratory and field experiments were performed to collect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during drying of alfalfa. Laboratory experiments were conducted using a flow reactor method. Three drying temperatures of 60, 150 and 250 °C with three drying times (5, 20 and 45 min) were used to collect the VOCs. Field experiments were performed to validate the results obtained in the flow reactor method using a small-scale rotary drum dryer (operated at temperatures of 202, 345 and 480 °C) and an industrial dehydration plant operated at temperatures of 800 to 1000 °C. The exhaust gases collected during the drying process were subjected to a gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis and the presence of a total of 48 VOCs was detected. The most common groups detected during alfalfa drying were alcohols, aldehydes, ketone, ester and unsaturated and saturated hydrocarbons. Drying temperature has a predominant effect on the number of VOCs emissions. The number of VOCs emitted increased with an increase in drying temperature. Drying time had an insignificant effect on the number of VOCs emitted, however, the intensity or concentration of compounds increased with an increase in drying time. The studies of different parts of the alfalfa plant revealed that a large group of the compounds present in one part (either leaf or stem) were absent in the other, although some compounds were present in all cases. Volatile organic compounds such as 1-octen-3-ol, (E)-3-hexen-1-ol and (E)-2-hexanal, were the most common compounds present in all parts of alfalfa plant. Sulphur compounds were present only in stems and may cause a potential problem for human health. The VOCs obtained from flowers are rich in alcohols and aldehydes. 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3adrying 3aleaves 3astems 3aflowers 3achemical constituents of plants 3avolatile compounds 3aorganic compounds 3aquantitative analysis 3ahuman health and safety 3aSaskatchewan1 aSchoenau, G.1 aDas, D.1 aAdapa, P.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2006 May, v. 94, no. 1 p.57-66dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2006.02.0023electronic resource  a20070411b20070502c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/04/11  aNon-US 7aarticle01713naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245005700167300001400224520072800238650001200966650001300978650001400991650001201005650000901017650001301026650001101039650001801050650001601068650001601084700001501100700001801115700001801133700002201151773010401173856005301277852000901330655001201339IND60592513420221123040802.0180405s1993    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059251342DNAL7 a10.1080/1065657X.1993.107711252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarugg, C.12aA Kinetic Model of the Yard Waste Composting Process  ap. 38-51.  aA new kinetic concept was applied to the yard waste composting process. Yard waste mixtures with different  fractions of grass clippings were compos ted in pilot-scale vessels. Ammonia emissions were highest with high fractions of grass clippings. Calculation of reaction rate constants was based on heat and  materials  balances. Although the compost mass ratios (a  dimensionless number that  describes how far the process has advanced) of the mixtures after composting were similar, their chemical and  biological analyses reveal differences. A first order reaction model is presented that can be used for plant design.

As a general trend, composts positively affected food quality, improved storage performance and yielded a somewhat superior sensory quality of tomatoes in particular. Composts significantly reduced nitrates and improved the nitrate to vitamin C ratio of vegetables.

However, in the case of ηc of a fogging system, Tdb,i is typically measured at different locations in the greenhouse to obtain an average value. The inside air is sensibly heated mainly by solar energy transmitted into the greenhouse under sunny summer conditions. ThenTdb,i is often higher than Tdb,o, giving negative values of ηc. Even though, Tdb,i is lower than Tdb,o, the current definition of ηc gives unrealistic values due to the latent heat added to the inside air. In this study, ηc of a fogging system was newly defined, taking into consideration the sensible and latent heat added to the greenhouse air. The definition is based on the energy and mass (water vapour) balance of the un-cooled air in the greenhouse during the operation of fogging. The value of ηc was determined for an experimental greenhouse with a floor area of 26 m2 and contained 150 potted tomato plants. The greenhouse was cooled intermittently at a fogging rate of 10 g s-1 for three different fogging times of 30, 60 and 90 s with interval times of 90, 180 and 270 s, respectively. The results showed that a fogging cycle of 60 s on, 180 s off provided a relatively higher value of ηc than other cycles. Under this condition, two approximate expressions of ηc could be used to estimate the ηc value with an error less than ±5%. 3adesign 3aventilation systems 3acooling 3aair temperature 3ameasurement 3aspraying 3agreenhouses 0afans1 aKozai, Toyoki,d1943-0 tBiosystems engineering.g2006 May, v. 94, no. 1 p.97-109dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2006.02.0083electronic resource  a20070411b20070502c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/04/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02190naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245008600142300001600228520101700244650002901261650001501290650001901305650002201324650001301346650004001359650001101399650001501410650002001425650004201445650003201487650002301519650005201542700001701594773011301611852000901724930003301733945001301766946001301779655001201792IND2058983320221123024340.0970814e19970417flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205898332DNAL7 a91445622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViard, B.10aPhase-specific protein expression in the dimorphic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 480-486.  aIn oxygen-limited continuous culture, Saccharomyces cerevisiae formed pseudohyphae by unipolar budding. We developed a continuous cultivation sequence to discriminate phase-specific from metabolically regulated proteins during dimorphism. Computer-aided substractive analysis of 2D-PAGE protein patterns allowed the detection of proteins specifically expressed during yeast and pseudohyphal phases. Image analysis resolved 3 spots that were specific to the pseudohyphal phase and 2 spots that were specific to yeast phase. In addition to phase-specific proteins, important regulation of protein expression took place. A group of 9 proteins was highly over-expressed during the yeast phase when another group of 12 was underexpressed. This phenomenon was reversed during the pseudohyphal phase. These experiments showed that dimorphism in S. cerevisiae is associated with the expression of specific proteins and suggest that yeast phase-specific proteins maintain the yeast form or repress pseudohyphae formation. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3adimorphism 3aimage analysis 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3ayeasts 2aCell Cycle 2aCells, Cultured 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aFungal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexcytologyxmetabolism.1 aKuriyama, H.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g1997 Apr. 17, v. 233, no. 2 p.480-486x0006-291X7nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle01859naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010800174300001400282520090400296650001101200650001501211650001701226650002501243650002601268650001901294650001101313651001001324700001601334700001701350773010401367856005301471852000901524655001201533IND60592513720221123024216.0180405s1993    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059251372DNAL7 a10.1080/1065657X.1993.107711282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiavatta, Claudio10aCharacterization of Organic Matter in Compost Produced with Municipal Solid Wastes: An Italian Approach  ap. 75-81.  aStabilization of the organic matter of a static pile of compost from municipal solid wastes (MSW) under a forced-pressure ventilation composting system was followed for 55 days during winter season.

The stabilization process of the organic matter was monitored using both the degree of humification (DH), i.e. the ratio between the humified fractions (HA + FA) and the total extractable carbon (TEC), and the electrofocusing technique (EF). The DH increased steadily in compost during stabilization process and converged asymptotically at the end of the period of composting. The EF analyses of the organic extracts of compost from MSW showed a definite trend in the humification process and confirmed the actual evolution of the organic matter composted. 3acarbon 3acomposting 3ahumification 3aisoelectric focusing 3amunicipal solid waste 3aorganic matter 3awinter 3aItaly1 aGovi, Marco1 aSequi, Paolo0 tCompost science & utilization.g1993, v. 1, no. 1 p.75-81dJG PresswJournal:19700x2326-23977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1065657X.1993.10771128  aDNAL 7aarticle01466naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245007400175300001300249520052400262650001500786650002600801650001300827650001500840650002300855650001600878700001800894700001800912700002000930700002500950773010300975856005301078852000901131655001201140IND60592513120221123013214.0180405s1993    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059251312DNAL7 a10.1080/1065657X.1993.107711222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacauley, Barry J.10aCompost Research Runs “Hot” and “Cold” at La Trobe University  ap. 6-12.  aCareful monitoring of the composting process — physically, chemically and biologically — enables managers to determine key nutritional and ecological factors vital to production of a quality compost.

Three tests were performed on each seed sample, i.e. (1) the standard germination test; (2) the low temperature and drought stress germination test and (3) the germination test in a salt solution. The effects of the factors of variety, provenance and year on seed vigour were estimated by the analysis of variance and Tukey’s post hoc test. The germination of winter varieties was influenced by provenance, both measures of vigour (2 and 3) by year, and significant differences between varieties were found in all three traits. Spring varieties differed only in germination and vigour (3) in one year when the influence of provenance prevailed. The results show different effects of variety and provenance on seed vigour. This could be promising for the breeding of high vigour barley varieties. Some preliminary results were obtained by using controlled deterioration (CD) as a vigour testing method for barley. The suitable conditions seem to be the combination of 45°C and 24% moisture content for the period of 24 hours. 3aanalysis of variance 3abreeding 3agermination 3aprovenance 3aseed quality 3aspring barley 3atemperature 3avarieties 3avigor 3awater content 3awater stress 3awinter 3awinter barley1 aChloupek, O.1 aBébarová, J.0 tCzech journal of genetics and plant breeding.g2006, v. 42, no. 2 p.44-49dInstitute of Agricultural and Food InformationwJournal:12179x1212-19757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3653-CJGPB  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004500092040001800137072000900155100002100164245008200185300001600267500002400283500001500307520183100322650001602153650001502169650001602184650001702200650003102217653002902248700002002277773009502297852000902392856007902401930003302480945002502513946001102538655001202549IND4387022720221123013040.0070122e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438702272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2006.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ2001 aFooladmand, H.R.10aImproved Estimation of the Soil Particle-size Distribution from Textural Data  ap. 133-138.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIt is possible to estimate the particle-size distribution using textural data with a proposed model by other investigators. The proposed model was based on clay, silt and one sand subclass (i.e. very fine plus fine sand fractions with an extreme radius of 125 μm). This model is easy to use, but requires values of very fine plus fine sand fractions. As for most conditions, only the value of all sand subclasses is available, it is proposed using radius of 999 μm (near radius of 1000 μm corresponded to the extreme value of the radius for sand particle in the United State Department of Agriculture system) instead of 125 μm for the extreme value of fine sand fraction for 50 different soils with various textures. Forty-four soils had silt content less than 60% and six soils had silt content more than 60%. The results indicated that for all soils, prediction of particle-size distribution was much better when using a radius of 999 μm then using a radius of 125 μm. Furthermore, for improving the results of predicted particle-size distribution using the radius of 999 μm, the ratios between the measured and predicted particle-size distribution for each radius of particle-size (1, 1·5, 2·5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 750 and 1000 μm) were used for the soils with less and more than 60% silt content, separately. The results showed that the values of correction coefficients may be used for only the radii less than 25 μm (clay and silt contents). The results indicated that using the correction coefficients for 44 soils with less than 60% silt content tended to better or as well estimation of particle-size distribution for 30 soils (i.e. 68·2%), and tended to give a much better estimation of particle-size distribution in all six soils with more than 60% silt content. 3asandy soils 3aclay soils 3asilty soils 3asoil texture 3aparticle size distribution 0asoil physical properties1 aSepaskhah, A.R.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2006 May, v. 94, no. 1 p.133-138dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2006.02.0093electronic resource  a20070411b20070502c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/04/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02219naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001800177245009000195300001600285500002400301500001500325520107200340650002601412650001301438650002901451653002901480700001801509700002001527700001301547700001401560773009501574852000901669856007401678930003301752945002501785946001101810655001201821IND4387023320221123013249.0070122s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438702332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.08.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX380 0aQ2001 aIbrahim, S.A.10aApplication of caffeine, 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine, to control Escherichia coli O157:H7  ap. 645-650.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this research was to determine the effectiveness of caffeine on inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth. Overnight samples of five E. coli O157:H7 strains of (E0019, F4546, H1730, 944 and Cider) were used in this study. These strains were individually inoculated at an initial inoculum level of 2 log CFU/ml into BHI broth containing caffeine at different concentrations (0.00%, 0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75%, 1.00%, 1.25%, 1.50%, 1.75%, and 2.00%). Samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Bacterial growth was monitored at different time intervals by measuring turbidity at 610 nm using a spectrophotometer. Results revealed that the addition of caffeine inhibited the growth of E. coli O157:H7. Significant growth inhibition was observed with concentration levels of 0.50% and higher. These results indicate that caffeine has potential as an antimicrobial agent for the treatment of E. coli O157:H7 infection and should be investigated further as a food additive to increase biosafety of consumable food products. 3aEscherichia coli O157 3acaffeine 3aantibacterial properties 0aEscherichia coli O157:H71 aSalameh, M.M.1 aPhetsomphou, S.1 aYang, H.1 aSeo, C.W.0 tFood chemistry.g2006, v. 99, no. 4 p.645-650dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.08.0263electronic resource  a20070429b20070502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/03/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02803naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245010500130520144400235650001101679650002101690650002101711650001601732650002601748650001901774650001101793650002201804650001601826650002101842650002001863650001901883650002801902650002601930650001301956650001401969650003901983650001802022650001102040650001002051650001102061700001502072700001402087700001402101700001902115700001602134773016202150852000902312655001202321IND60592512720221122234615.0180405s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059251272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaudet, D. A.10aToxicity of Wheat Non-Specific Lipid Transfer Proteins to Tilletia tritici, the Common Bunt Pathogen  aNon-specific-Lipid Transfer Proteins (ns-LTPs) have the potential to exhibit both lipid transfer activity and antimicrobial  activity.  Eleven  novel  full-length  wheat  ns-LTP1 clones, all  possessing  coding  sequences  of 348 bp, isolated from abiotic- and bunt-stressed cDNA libraries, exhibited highly conserved coding regions with   78–99% and 71–100% identity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. The deduced proteins coded by these cDNAs were characteristic of the ns-LTP1 family. The full-length wheat ns-LTP1 genes were cloned into the expression vector pPICZ  and transformed into Pichia yeast.  SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and in vitro lipid binding activity assay confirmed that the eight ns-LTPs were all successfully expressed and capable of in vitro binding of fatty acids. A large scale comparative study of the toxicity of eight wheat ns-LTPs to growth of mycelium or spores  of  eight  wheat  pathogens  including T. tritici, and  three  non-wheat  pathogens  demonstrated  a differential toxicity among the ns-LTPs. LD  50 values of three selected ns-LTPs against six fungi ranged from 1 to 7 µ  mol/l. In  vitro  lipid  binding  activity  of  ns-LTPs  was not correlated with  their  antifungal  activity. Using  the  fluorescent probe SYTOX Green as an indicator of membrane integrity, the toxicity of wheat ns-LTPs was shown to be associated with an alteration in fungal membrane permeability. 3aPichia 3aTilletia tritici 3aWestern blotting 3aamino acids 3aantifungal properties 3acDNA libraries 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3afatty acids 3afluorescent dyes 3agenetic vectors 3alethal dose 50 3alipid transfer proteins 3amembrane permeability 3amycelium 3apathogens 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asmut diseases 3aspores 3awheat 3ayeasts1 aSun, J.

For this purpose 20 wheat lines of Chinese Spring with consequently substituted chromosome pairs from the cultivar Timstein together with the two parental cultivars were investigated. The regeneration ability of the studied lines was quantified by two parameters: frequency of regenerative calli and coefficient of propagation. The influence of the 5A, 1B and 4D chromosomes on in vitro morphogenesis was determined and the effect of 2A, 3A, 3B, 4B, 6B and 1D chromosomes, reported by other authors, was confirmed. The data indicated that the intervarietal substitutions of certain chromosomes caused significant variation in the number of morphogenic calli and recovered regenerants, in spite of the fact that the two parental cultivars were of similar morphogenic ability. This probably reflects the allele variation in a given locus on these chromosomes and/or background effect. The data suggest that the chromosome substitutions may have different compensatory effects depending on the similarity of the corresponding chromosomes and also on the possibilities of their expression in an alien genetic background. 3aalleles 3acallus 3achromosome substitution 3acultivars 3agenetic background 3agenetic variation 3aloci 3amorphogenesis 3asubstitution lines 3awheat1 aZagorska, N.1 aChardakov, V.1 aDryanova, A.1 aDimitrov, Bozhidar,0 tCzech journal of genetics and plant breeding.g2006, v. 42, no. 1 p.15-19dInstitute of Agricultural and Food InformationwJournal:12179x1212-19757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3658-CJGPB  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245010900143300001500252520085500267650001601122650001301138650001201151650002001163650001001183650001201193650002201205650002601227650001101253650001801264650000901282650001401291650001201305650003101317650003801348650004201386650005601428650001201484650002001496650001501516650001801531650002201549650007101571650003101642650005201673650002701725650001101752650000901763650003201772650003001804650002501834650003301859650000901892650002501901650004101926700002201967700001501989700001702004700001602021773011102037852000902148930003302157945001302190946001302203655001202216IND2061250720221122234512.0980113e19970808flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206125072DNAL7 a92668372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevy, J.R.10aEffect of enteral versus parenteral nutrition on leptin gene expression and release into the circulation  ap. 98-102.  aLeptin, a putative satiety hormone in rodents, is acutely regulated by fasting and refeeding. To determine the role of satiety hormones that are secreted by the gastrointestinal tract on leptin regulation, leptin mRNA and serum concentrations were measured after feeding rats similar calories with standard chow or infusion of total parenteral nutrition into the duodenum or intravenously. We have demonstrated that leptin gene expression and hormone secretion into the circulation are stimulated equally in the three experimental paradigms; it is unlikely that satiety factors secreted by the intestinal tract play a significant role in leptin regulation. Furthermore, intravenous infusion of individual components of TPN demonstrated that intravenous glucose infusion was mostly responsible for stimulation of the leptin gene and hormone secretion. 3ablood serum 3aduodenum 3afasting 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahormone secretion 3aintravenous injection 3aleptin 3amessenger RNA 3arats 3arefeeding 3asatiety 3atotal parenteral nutrition 2aAdipocytesxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aAdipose Tissuexcytologyxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acidsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aCells, Cultured 2aDNA Probes 2aEnergy Intake 2aEnteral Nutrition 2aFat Emulsions, Intravenousxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGlucosexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aInfusions, Intravenous 2aLeptin 2aMale 2aParenteral Nutrition, Total 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesis 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTranscription, Geneticxdrug effects1 aLeGall-Salmon, E.1 aSantos, M.1 aPandak, W.M.1 aStevens, W.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g1997 Aug. 8, v. 237, no. 1 p.98-102x0006-291X7nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle03784naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001500167245008800182300001800270500002400288500001500312520201200327650001602339650001802355650002402373650002302397650001502420650001002435650001702445650001802462650003002480650001602510650001502526650001702541650001102558650002002569650002002589650002302609650002302632650001802655650001502673650001302688650001902701651001202720653001102732653002402743700001802767700001802785700001902803700001502822700001602837700001702853773009702870852000902967856008902976930003303065945002503098946001103123655001203134IND4407394620221122220904.0080701e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440739462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2008.01.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aX3201 aFuka, M.M.10aFactors influencing variability of proteolytic genes and activities in arable soils  ap. 1646-1653.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMicroorganisms, capable of proteolysis, are widely distributed in soil but almost nothing is known about the abundance of genes related to protein degradation and the regulation of their activity in terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, the aim of this study was: (1) to quantify two bacterial genes involved in protein degradation, (2) to investigate factors affecting the abundance of these genes, and (3) to relate this data to potential proteolytic activities. For this purpose, an arable field in southern Germany under integrated management was studied. The uniformly managed field showed pronounced soil heterogeneity with four different soil types. In April, July and October 2003, soil samples were taken from the four soil types at three different depths. We applied a real-time PCR assay for quantification of subtilisin (sub) and neutral metalloprotease (npr) genes, both encoding for extracellular proteases, as well as the 16S rRNA gene representing a rough estimate of the size of the bacterial populations. Potential proteolytic activity was measured using casein as a substrate. Both soil type and time of sampling influenced the size and activity of the bacterial protease genes under investigation. Total nitrogen and carbon availability was, beside soil texture, the main factor responsible for the observed changes in the abundance of proteolytic genes and potential proteolytic activity. Whereas a positive relationship was found between sub and npr gene copy numbers and the number of 16S rRNA gene copies in all cases, a positive relationship between sub and npr coding genes and potential proteolytic activity was only found for sandy soils. This indicates that sandy soils cannot stabilize proteolytic enzymes and the activity of npr and sub genes is strictly dependent on the presence of the corresponding genes. In contrast, in clay soils proteolytic activity was not correlated with the abundance of the genes analyzed, probably due to the stabilization of the proteolytic enzymes. 3asandy soils 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil organic carbon 3ametalloproteinases 3asoil depth 3agenes 3asoil ecology 3asoil bacteria 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aproteolysis 3asubtilisin 3aarable soils 3acasein 3apopulation size 3aenzyme activity 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial genetics 3aclay fraction 3aclay soils 3anitrogen 3agrowing season 3aGermany 0acarbon 0asoil microorganisms1 aEngel, Malka.1 aGattinger, A.1 aBausenwein, U.1 aSommer, M.1 aMunch, J.C.1 aSchloter, M.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2008 July, v. 40, no. 7 p.1646-1653dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2008.01.0283Available from publisher's Web site  a20080717b20080801c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/07/17  aNon-US 7aarticle01272naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245008100131300001800212520031800230650001600548650002200564650002500586650002000611650002100631650002300652651001000675700001800685700001400703700001900717700001400736700002100750700001700771773006900788852000900857939003300866946001100899655001200910IND9103767420221122075702.0911001s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910376742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukhopadhyay, G.10a11-Methoxytetrahydroalstonine, a heteroyohimbinoid alkaloid from Vinca major  ap. 2447-2449.  aThe alkaloid 11-methoxytetrahydroalstonine has been isolated for the first time from a natural source, viz.

The formation of new blood vessels is an important therapeutic target for diseases such as limb ischemia, coronary infarction or stroke. We examined the effect of mango peel and flesh extracts as well as the individual polyphenolic molecules, mangiferin and quercetin, on bovine aortic cell migration using a modified Boyden chamber assay. Our results show that mangiferin, and extracts rich in mangiferin, increase endothelial cell migration. The dose−effect relationship for various extracts further suggests that this action of mangiferin is modulated by other components present in the extracts. The promigratory effect of mango extracts or mangiferin was unrelated to an effect on cell proliferation, and did not involve a change in the production of matrix metalloprotease-2 or -9 by the endothelial cells. Taken together, these results suggest that mangiferin present in mango extracts may have health promoting effects in diseases related to the impaired formation of new blood vessels. 3amangoes 3afruit extracts 3afunctional foods 3aendothelial cells 3acell physiology 3ablood vessels 3avascular diseases 3acell culture 3aangiogenesis 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCell Movementxdrug effects 2aCells, Cultured 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aEndothelium, Vascularxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aMangiferaxchemistry 2aNeovascularization, Physiologicxdrug effects 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aXanthonesxpharmacology 0amangiferin 0acell migration1 aAung, Cho Sanda1 aHewavitharana, Amitha K.1 aWilkinson, Ashley S.1 aPierson, Jean-Thomas1 aRoberts-Thomson, Sarah J.1 aShaw, P.

To investigate the effect of chitosan on drug-metabolizing enzymes and oxidative stress in the liver, male Wistar rats were fed a low- or high-fat diet with cellulose or chitosan for 4 weeks. A significant decrease in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A-catalyzed testosterone 6β-hydroxylation in liver microsomes was observed in rats fed the chitosan with low- and high-fat diets. The expression of CYP 3A1 and 3A2, however, was suppressed by chitosan in rats fed the low-fat diet only. Furthermore, rats fed the low-fat diet with chitosan had lower hepatic glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and superoxide dismutase activity and higher total tissue and microsomal lipid hydroperoxides. Hepatic α-tocopherol was lower in rats fed the chitosan-containing diet. The results suggest that chitosan is likely to modulate CYP 3A activity and protein expression and GST activity partially in a dietary fat-dependent manner. This change may cause a decrease in the metabolism of drugs catalyzed by these enzymes in liver tissues. Moreover, decrease of α-tocopherol level and SOD activity by chitosan partly accounts for the increase of hepatic lipid peroxidation. 3achitosan 3aliver 3aliver function 3aenzymes 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3aanimal models 3aexperimental diets 3alow fat diet 3ahigh fat diet 3adietary fat 3afat intake 3alipid metabolism 2aAnimals 2aChitosanxpharmacology 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxmetabolism 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aLiverxdrug effectsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aRats 0ahepatic drug metabolizing enzymes1 aLii, Chong-Kuei1 aChou, Ruey-Hwang1 aLin, Jia-Hsuan1 aYang, Hui-Ting1 aChiang, Meng-Tsan0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Apr. 28, v. 58, no. 8 p.5187–5193-5187–5193dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf903857m3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/07/25  aOther US 7aarticle02889naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100002300165245009200188300002000280500002400300500001500324520133500339650002301674650002701697650001601724650001201740650001901752650001401771650001401785650001401799650004801813650002401861650003901885653001801924653003601942653004301978700001502021700001202036700001402048773017602062852000902238856007702247930003302324945002502357946001302382655001202395IND4436908120221122051017.0100514e20100428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443690812DNAL7 a202329172pmid7 a10.1021/jf904378e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT2001 aScheffler, Siqi L.10aIn Vitro Digestibility and Emulsification Properties of Phytoglycogen Octenyl Succinate  ap. 5140–5146.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis paper reports our recent studies on the in vitro digestibility and emulsification properties of an amphiphilic carbohydrate nanoparticle, phytoglycogen octenyl succinate (PG-OS). Phytoglycogen (PG), a glycogen-like α-d-glucan isolated from sugary-1 sweet corn endosperms, was subjected to octenyl succinate substitution to prepare PG-OS. Waxy corn starch octenyl succinate (WCS-OS) was also prepared as the reference. The degree of substitution (DS), molecular weight, particle size, dispersed molecular density, and zeta-potential of PG-OS and WCS-OS were determined. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to image PG and its derivatives. In vitro digestibility and emulsification properties of PG-OS and WCS-OS were compared. The results showed that the dispersed molecular density of PG and PG-OS was much greater than that of WCS and WCS-OS. Zeta-potential of PG-OS decreased as the pH of dispersion increased. In general, the digestibility of PG and PG-OS was lower than that of WCS and WCS-OS at equivalent DS, suggesting the effect of glucan structure on glucan digestibility. At equivalent DS, PG-OS showed similar or even greater capability than WCS-OS to physically stabilize fish oil emulsions. This work revealed the potential of amphiphilic carbohydrate nanoparticles in the applications of emulsions. 3ain vitro digestion 3ain vitro digestibility 3aemulsifying 3aglucans 3ananotechnology 3afish oils 3aemulsions 2aEmulsions 2aGlycogenxanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 0acarbohydrates 0aphytoglycogen octenyl succinate 0aamphiphilic carbohydrate nanoparticles1 aHuang, Lei1 aBi, Lin1 aYao, Yuan0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Apr. 28, v. 58, no. 8 p.5140–5146-5140–5146dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf904378e3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/07/25  aOther US 7aarticle03093naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245002700128300001600155500015600171500001500327520186100342650002102203650001902224650002502243650001302268650002902281650002002310650002702330650001802357650002802375653002302403653003102426653001402457653002502471653002202496653002702518773006002545852000902605930003302614945001302647946001102660655001202671IND2039319520221122030857.0940509s1993    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203931952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGehring, W.J.10aExploring the homeobox  ap. 215-221.  aPaper presented at the COGENE Symposium, "From the Double Helix to the Human Genome: 40 Years of Molecular Genetics," April 21-23, 1993, Paris, France.  a2019-12-05  aIn Drosophila, homeotic mutations lead to the transformation of structures of one body segment into the corresponding structures of another segment.

The cloning of the homeotic Antennapedia (Antp) gene led to the discovery of the homeobox, a 180-bp DNA segment characteristic for homeotic genes. It encodes the DNA-binding domain of the respective proteins which was designated as the homeodomain. Homeodomain proteins are transcriptional regulators which specify the body plan by controlling the transcription of their subordinate target genes. By inserting the Antp cDNA into a heatinducible expression vector, the body plan can be altered in a predictable way. Using the homeobox as a probe, homologous Hox genes from vertebrates have been cloned. In the mouse, dominant gain and recessive loss-of-function mutations result in segmental transformations of opposite direction, as in Drosophila. Also, the mouse Hox genes can partially substitute the homologous Drosophila genes in transgenic flies. Therefore, the genetic control of the body plan is much more universal than anticipated. The three-dimensional structure of the Antp homeodomain and its complex with a consensus DNA-binding site was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The homeodomain essentially consists of four alpha-helices a helix-turn-helix motif, and a flexible N-terminal arm. Base-specific contacts are made by both the recognition helix and the N-terminal arm. The essential features of the NMR model are consistent with in vivo data obtained by mutations altering the DNA binding and the functional specificity in transgenic flies. 3astructural genes 3ahomeotic genes 3ahomeodomain proteins 3amutation 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3amolecular conformation 3aembryogenesis 3aDrosophila melanogaster 0agenetic regulation 0atranscriptional regulators 0aantp gene 0aDNA-binding proteins 0aantennapedia gene 0abiological development0 tGene.g1993, v. 135, no. 1/2 p.215-221x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02190naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004500092040001800137072000900155072000900164072000900173100001900182245007100201300001600272500002400288520097500312650001801287650001301305650002101318650001101339650002201350650001601372650001101388650002601399650002401425650001401449700002101463700001901484773009601503852000901599856007901608930003301687945002501720946001101745655001201756IND4387024020221122004707.0070122e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438702402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2006.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX1001 aCordeiro, D.S.10aEquilibrium Moisture Content Models for Maytenus ilicifolia Leaves  ap. 221-228.  aIncludes references  aKnowledge of the relationship between the air relative humidity and moisture content of the test material is essential for the drying and storage process research. The aim of this work was to determine sorption isotherms of Maytenus ilicifolia leaves and to compare the experimental results with mathematical models in the literature. The equilibrium moisture content for M. ilicifolia leaves was measured using the static method, at relative humidities and temperatures ranging from 11% to 85% and from 30 to 60 °C, respectively. The experimental data were compared with five models available in the literature (Chung-Pfost, modified Halsey, modified Oswin, Henderson-Thompson and Guggenheim-Anderson-deBoer). The adsorption data were best described by the Chung-Pfost equation, while the desorption data were best fitted by the Henderson-Thompson equation. Thus, these models can be used for the estimation of the equilibrium moisture content of M. ilicifolia leaves. 3awater content 3aMaytenus 3amedicinal plants 3aleaves 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3adrying 3aprocessing technology 3amathematical models 3aequations1 aRaghavan, G.S.V.1 aOliveira, W.P.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2006 June, v. 94, no. 2 p.221-228dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2006.03.0043electronic resource  a20070411b20070502c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/04/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02125naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245010800171300001600279520112000295650002501415653002001440653001601460653002901476653002501505653002201530773012401552852000901676856009201685930003301777946001301810655001201823IND4397154520221121223309.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439715452DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.04707.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuki, Nobuhiro10aCampylobacter sialyltransferase gene polymorphism directs clinical features of Guillain-Barré syndrome  ap. 150-158.  aProgress has been made in Guillain-Barré syndrome, a post-infectious autoimmune neuropathy, especially on identifying Campylobacter jejuni genes responsible for the development and determinant of clinical features. C. jejuni strains carrying a sialyltransferase gene (cst-II), which is essential for the biosynthesis of ganglioside-like lipo-oligosaccharides (LOSs), are associated with the development of Guillain-Barré syndrome. The C. jejuni sialyltransferase (Cst-II) consists of 291 amino acids, and the 51st determines its enzymatic activity. Strains with cst-II (Thr51) expressed GM1-like and GD1a-like LOS, whereas strains with cst-II (Asn51) expressed GT1a-like and GD1c-like LOS. Patients infected with the cst-II (Thr51) strains had anti-GM1 or anti-GD1a IgG antibodies, and showed limb weakness. Patients infected with the cst-II (Asn51) strains had anti-GQ1b IgG antibodies, and showed ophthalmoplegia and ataxia. The cst-II gene is responsible for the development of Guillain-Barré and Fisher syndromes, and the polymorphism (Thr/Asn51) determines which syndrome develops after C. jejuni enteritis. 3aCampylobacter jejuni 0aFisher syndrome 0aganglioside 0aGuillain-Barré syndrome 0alipo-oligosaccharide 0asialyltransferase0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2007 Nov., v. 103, no. s1 p.150-158dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.04707.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071028b20071102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01785naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012000129300001600249520069300265650001600958650002200974650002400996650001301020650002201033650002101055650001701076650001001093653002001103700001201123700002001135700001801155700002001173700001501193773012501208852000901333930003301342945001301375946001101388655001201399IND2037932120221121173358.0940315e199311  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203793212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJauhiainen, M.10aEffects of milk fat, unhydrogenated and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils on serum lipoproteins in growing pigs  ap. 565-570.  aCrossbred Yorkshire (Yorkshire X Landrace) pigs were fed butter oil, cream, low erucic acid rapeseed oil, sunflower oil and partially hydrogenated sunflower oil in amounts representing 30% of energy for periods of up to 13 weeks.

However, no partitioning studies on afforested organic soil croplands exist. We separated soil respiration originating from the decomposition of peat (SRP), and aboveground litter (SRL) and root respiration (SRR) in six afforested organic soil croplands in Finland with varying tree species and stand ages using the trenching method. Across the sites temporal variation in SR was primarily related to changes in soil surface temperature (-5 cm), which explained 71-96% of variation in SR rates. Decomposition of peat and litter was not related to changes in water table level, whereas a minor increase in root respiration was observed with the increase in water table depth. Temperature sensitivity of SR varied between the different respiration components: SRP was less sensitive to changes in soil surface temperature than SRL or SRR. Factors explaining spatial variation in SR differed between different respiration components. Annual SRP correlated positively with peat ash content while that of SRL was found to correlate positively with the amount of litter on the forest floor, separately for each tree species. Root respiration correlated positively with the biomass of ground vegetation. From the total soil respiration peat decomposition comprised a major share of 42%; the proportion of autotrophic respiration being 41% and aboveground litter 17%. Afforestation lowered peat decomposition rates. Nevertheless the effect of agricultural history can be seen in peat properties for decades and due to high peat decomposition rates these soils still loose carbon to the atmosphere. 3apeat 3aagricultural soils 3asoil temperature 3atrenching 3atrees 3acarbon 3asoil respiration 3aheterotrophs 3aroots 3acarbon dioxide 3arhizosphere 3apeatlands 3aorganic soils 3atemporal variation 3aspatial variation 3abiomass 3aforest litter 3aafforestation 3abiodegradation 3astand characteristics 3avegetation 3awater table 3aFinland 0abiogeochemical cycles 0aplant litter1 aMinkkinen, K.1 aHytönen, J.1 aLaine, J.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2008 July, v. 40, no. 7 p.1592-1600dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2008.01.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20080717b20080801c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/07/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03066naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001500176245007500191300001800266500002400284500001500308520165100323650001701974650001501991650001902006650002502025650001702050650001702067650001302084650003102097650002402128650001902152650001402171650001502185650001202200650001802212650001002230651001802240653001102258700001502269773009702284852000902381856008902390930003302479945002502512946001102537655001202548IND4407394220221121043813.0080701e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440739422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2008.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aW000 0aJ2001 aLeff, J.W.10aVolatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from soil and litter samples  ap. 1629-1636.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe production of nonmethane volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by soil microbes is likely to have an important influence on soil ecology and terrestrial biogeochemistry. However, soil VOC production has received relatively little attention, and we do not know how the emissions of microbially-produced VOCs vary across soil and litter types. We collected 40 root-free soil and litter samples from a diverse array of ecosystem types and conducted laboratory incubations in order to compare the types and quantities of VOCs emitted. VOC production rates were higher in litter samples than in soil samples, and the rates were correlated with microbial biomass and CO2 production levels. On average, the litter samples produced more types of VOCs than the soil samples with litters emitting a number of VOCs (including terpenoids) that were not generally emitted from the soil samples. Across all of the samples, we identified 100 VOCs, and more than 70% of these compounds could not be positively identified by GC/MS analyses. Of those VOCs that could be identified, furfural and similar furan compounds were noteworthy in that they were emitted in large amounts from nearly every sample examined. Other identifiable VOCs produced across a range of soil and litter samples included propanoic and butanoic acids, which are known products of microbial fermentation. Together these results suggest a need for additional research examining the specific factors influencing VOC emissions from soil and the identification of specific VOCs emitted from soil and litter as many of these compounds are likely to have important effects on belowground ecology. 3asoil ecology 3aterpenoids 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical composition 3afermentation 3aplant litter 3afurfural 3avolatile organic compounds 3asoil microorganisms 3apropionic acid 3aemissions 3aecosystems 3abiomass 3aair pollution 3aroots 3aUnited States 0afurans1 aFierer, N.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2008 July, v. 40, no. 7 p.1629-1636dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2008.01.0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20080717b20080801c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/07/17  aNon-US 7aarticle01882naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009300127300001800220500001500238520094200253650002201195650001301217650001701230650002301247650002001270650001701290650002301307650001101330651001001341653001501351700001501366700001701381773006901398852000901467939003301476946001101509655001201520IND9103761420221121024147.0910927s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910376142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujimori, N.10aSeasonal variations in biosynthetic capacity for the synthesis of caffeine in tea leaves  ap. 2245-2248.  a2019-12-04  aSeasonal variations in the metabolic fate of adenine nucleotides prelabelled with [8-14C]adenine were examined in leaf disks prepared at one-month intervals, over the course of one year, from the shoots of tea plants (Camellia sinensis L. cv Yabukita) which were growing under natural field conditions.

Amino-acid composition analysis and N-terminal sequencing have been performed with CP>9.3. The N-terminal sequence shows no homology to any sequence in the protein and nucleic acid data banks. CP>9.3 activity is induced by wounding in carrot leaves and petioles; this activity is also present in carrot roots but is unaltered by wounding. Enhanced CP>9.3 activity is seen at 12 hr postwounding and continues for at least 60 hr in leaves and petioles. Based on studies using cycloheximide, early activation of CP>9.3 is not due to de novo protein synthesis, but rather to enzyme activation. Temperature and pH optima for CP>9.3 using guaiacol as a substrate have been determined to be 32 determined C and 4.9. 3aDaucus carota 3acarrots 3acell walls 3acycloheximide 3adatabases 3aenzyme activation 3aguaiacol 3aisozymes 3amolecular weight 3anucleic acids 3apH 3aperoxidase 3apetioles 3aprotein synthesis 3aroots 3atemperature 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCell Wallxenzymology 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aDaucus carotaxenzymology 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEnzyme Induction 2aIsoelectric Focusing 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aPeroxidasesxbiosynthesisxisolation & purificationxmetabolism.1 aShowalter, A.M.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g1996 Sept. 4, v. 226, no. 1 p.254-260x0006-291X7nnas  aDNAL  a19970401b19970408c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle03404naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245011500170300001400285500001900299520179000318650001702108650001602125650001902141650001902160650001402179650001202193650001802205650001402223650001102237650001602248650001302264650001502277650001302292650002102305650002802326650001702354650001702371650002002388650002002408650002502428650002502453650001202478650001302490650003702503650001302540700001902553700001502572700001802587700001402605773013502619856005402754961000902808852000902817655001202826IND60710468120221121004123.0200910s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071046812DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2020.1268.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRouphael, Y.10aImplications of microbial and non-microbial biostimulatory action on the quality of leafy and fruit vegetables  ap. 13-18.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecently the European Union decided to reshape the existing Fertilizers Regulations, under the new regulation that plant biostimulants “shall be a CE marked fertilising product stimulating plant nutrition processes independently of the product's nutrient content with the sole aim of improving one or more of the following characteristics of the plant and the plant rhizophere or phyllosphere: nutrient use efficiency, abiotic tolerance and product quality”. Plant biostimulants can be divided in two major categories, the non-microbial biostimulants including bioactive substances such as humic acids, protein hydrolysates from vegetal and animal origin as well as seaweed extracts. The second category is the microbial biostimulants including arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria belonging to the genera Azotobacter, Azospirillum and Rhizobium spp. In the present paper several case studies on important greenhouse vegetables such as tomato, spinach, zucchini squash and cucumber were reported in order to demonstrate how the application of non-microbial and microbial plant biostimulants can modulate the quality of the product. The application of protein hydrolysate and seaweed extracts improve the fresh yield of both tomato and spinach but differently modulated the quality characteristics in particular lycopene, total ascorbic acid, phenols and nitrate. The application of microbial biostimulant in particular AMF containing Rhizophagus irregular and Funneliformis mosseae was able to improve the macro- and microminerals profile in zucchini squash and cucumber. The present paper concludes by proposing future research toward enhancing product quality of greenhouse vegetables by optimizing biostimulants application and composition. 3aAzospirillum 3aAzotobacter 3aEuropean Union 3aGlomus mosseae 3aRhizobium 3aanimals 3aascorbic acid 3acucumbers 3afruits 3agreenhouses 3alycopene 3amacroalgae 3anitrates 3anutrient content 3anutrient use efficiency 3aphyllosphere 3aplant growth 3aplant nutrition 3aproduct quality 3aprotein hydrolysates 3arhizosphere bacteria 3aspinach 3atomatoes 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3azucchini1 aCardarelli, M.1 aBonini, P.1 aDe Pascal, S.1 aColla, G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2020, , no. 1268 p.13-18dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2020.1268.2  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245008100147300001600228520090800244650002201152650001601174650000901190650004101199650001001240650001801250650001801268650000901286650002701295650001201322650003901334650006601373650003701439650000901476650005501485650003901540650004601579650000901625650002501634700001501659773011301674852000901787930003301796945001301829946001301842655001201855IND2057355420221120232024.0970529e19970317flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205735542DNAL7 a91251632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChambers, C.M.10aTranslational regulation of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase by dietary cholesterol  ap. 278-281.  aThe question of whether dietary cholesterol exerts feedback regulation on hepatic HMG-CoA reductase at the level of translation was examined by performing polysome profile analysis. Liver polysomes from rats fed 2% cholesterol in their diets for 3 days were compared with those isolated from rate fed a normal chow diet. Northern blotting analysis of the individual fractions revealed that cholesterol feeding reduced the portion of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA associated with translationally active polysomes by over 50% and progressively increased the percentage of reductase mRNA present in the monosomal fractions. In the lightest monosomal fraction over 10 times as much reductase mRNA was present in samples from cholesterol animals as compared to controls. These findings indicate that dietary cholesterol exerts significant feedback regulation on hepatic HMG-CoA reductase at the translational level. 3aNorthern blotting 3acholesterol 3adiet 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductases 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3apolyribosomes 3arats 3atranslation (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aCholesterol, Dietaryxpharmacology 2aHydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductasesxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aLiverxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aMale 2aPolyribosomesxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Biosynthesisxdrug effects 2aRNA, Messengerxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley1 aNess, G.C.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g1997 Mar. 17, v. 232, no. 2 p.278-281x0006-291X7nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle01883naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002800181245013700209300001800346500002400364506007600388520054000464506003701004650003201041650002501073650002101098650003001119650002701149650001901176650001301195650001901208700002101227700002401248773013601272852000901408856008001417655001201497IND4401642820221207123830.0080217e20080215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440164282DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01747-072doi7 aPMC22585882pmcid7 a181563332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimões, Lúcia Chaves.10aIntergeneric Coaggregation among Drinking Water Bacteria: Evidence of a Role for Acinetobacter calcoaceticus as a Bridging Bacterium  ap. 1259-1263.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIntergeneric coaggregation of drinking water bacteria was tested.

Western blot analysis for bAng indicated that the polyclonal antibody recognized bAng specifically, and no cross-reactivity with bovine RNase A, a protein homologous to bAng, was observed. The sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for bang was sensitive to 10 pg of bAng, and this assay was able to quantitate bAng in bovine serum (100-180 ng/mL) and milk (4-8 micrograms/mL). Strong positive immunohistochemical reactions were detected in alveolar cells, the secretion of alveolar cells and excretory ducts in sections of cow mammary gland, epithelial cells of visceral peritoneum and bile-duct in sections of cow liver, and epithelial cells and mucous glands in sections of cow gallbladder.

The activity of PEPC increased by 1.7-fold at 45 °C over 25 °C. Warm temperature also stimulated the photoactivation of PEPC. The activation by light of PEPC was 1.9-fold at 25 °C and increased to 2.2-fold at 45 °C. The sensitivity of PEPC to its inhibitor malate was less and the activation by glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) or inorganic phosphate (Pi) was more at 45 °C than that at 25 °C. These effects of temperature were quite pronounced in light. Similar responses were observed when detached leaves were exposed to varying ambient temperature (dry heat). The activity of PEPC increased by 1.6-fold at 45 °C over 25 °C in the dark. The activation of PEPC by light was 2.1-fold at 25 °C and increased to 2.6-fold at 45 °C. Inhibition by malate was less and activation by G-6-P or Pi was more at 45 °C than that at 25 °C. Thus, there was a marked modulation of not only the activity but also the regulatory properties of the enzyme by temperature and light, independently as well as cooperatively with each other. Further experiments suggested that PEPC was able to memorize to a significant extent the changes induced by warm temperature and that these changes were complemented by subsequent illumination. These effects were not due to changes in PEPC protein levels. We conclude that temperature and light can modulate PEPC activity and regulatory properties not only individually but also in a significantly cooperative manner with each other. As significant increases in temperature are common during daytime in tropical or subtropical conditions, we suggest that the synergistic effects of temperature and light are quite relevant in optimizing the activity of PEPC in leaves of C4 plants. 3aAmaranthus hypochondriacus 3aC4 plants 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3aenzyme activity 3amalic acid 3aglucose 6-phosphate 3aheat stress 3aplant stress 3alight intensity1 aRaghavendra, A.S.0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2008 July 7, v. 165, no. 10 p.1023-1032dUrban & Fischerx0176-16177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2007.09.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080701b20080704c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/07/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03036naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001500182245010800197300001600305500001500321500002400336520136500360650002901725650002301754650002701777650000701804650001601811650001601827650000901843650002801852650004101880650002401921650001701945650003101962650002801993650004102021650002502062653001402087700002302101700001502124700001402139773019002153852000902343856008502352930003302437945002502470946001102495655001202506IND4407384520221120170059.0080630e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440738452DNAL7 a164913592pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-006-0091-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3201 aGraves, T.10aEffect of pH and lactic or acetic acid on ethanol productivity by Saccharomyces cerevisiae in corn mash  ap. 469-474.  aIn process  aIncludes references  aThe effects of lactic and acetic acids on ethanol production by Saccharomyces cerevisiae in corn mash, as influenced by pH and dissolved solids concentration, were examined. The lactic and acetic acid concentrations utilized were 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0% w/v, and 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6% w/v, respectively. Corn mashes (20, 25 and 30% dry solids) were adjusted to the following pH levels after lactic or acetic acid addition: 4.0, 4.5, 5.0 or 5.5 prior to yeast inoculation. Lactic acid did not completely inhibit ethanol production by the yeast. However, lactic acid at 4% w/v decreased (P<0.05) final ethanol concentration in all mashes at all pH levels. In 30% solids mash set at pH <=5, lactic acid at 3% w/v reduced (P<0.05) ethanol production. In contrast, inhibition by acetic acid increased as the concentration of solids in the mash increased and the pH of the medium declined. Ethanol production was completely inhibited in all mashes set at pH 4 in the presence of acetic acid at concentrations >or=0.8% w/v. In 30% solids mash set at pH 4, final ethanol levels decreased (P<0.01) with only 0.1% w/v acetic acid. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of lactic acid and acetic acid on ethanol production in corn mash fermentation when set at a pH of 5.0-5.5 are not as great as that reported thus far using laboratory media. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aethanol production 3aalcoholic fermentation 3apH 3alactic acid 3aacetic acid 3acorn 2aAcetic Acidxmetabolism 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactic Acidxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexmetabolism 2aZea maysxmetabolism 0acorn mash1 aNarendranath, N.V.1 aDawson, K.1 aPower, R.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2006 June, v. 33, no. 6 p.469-474dPublished by Stockton Press on behalf of the Society for Industrial Microbiologyx1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-006-0091-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20080701b20080704c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/07/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02582naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001200149245018900161300001800350520107600368650001301444650002201457650001301479650001601492650001901508650001401527650002401541650001701565650002401582650005001606650003301656650001301689650004101702650001101743650001701754650002901771650001301800650001301813650002601826651001001852651002501862700001801887700001701905773009901922852000902021939003302030946001302063655001202076IND9100213720221120161204.0900111e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910021372DNAL7 a21505852pmid7 aPMC1850582pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Y.10aComparative study on the natural occurrence of Fusarium mycotoxins (trichothecenes and zearalenone) in corn and wheat from high- and low-risk areas for human esophageal cancer in China  ap. 3723-3726.  aA comparative study on the natural occurrence of Fusarium toxins was done with 47 corn and 30 wheat samples collected in 1989 from Linxian and Shangqiu Counties in Henan Province, People's Republic of China, high- and low-risk areas, respectively, for esophageal cancer. Three trichothecenes (deoxynivalenol [DON], 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol [15-ADON], and nivalenol [NIV]) and zearalenone (ZEA) were detected in corn samples, and DON, NIV, and ZEA were found in wheat samples. Compared with Shangqiu corn, the incidence and mean level of DON in Linxian were 2.4 and 5.8 times higher, respectively, and those of 15-ADON were 16.3 and 2.6 times higher, respectively. The incidence and level of trichothecenes in wheat samples were significantly lower than those in corn. However, the level of DON in Linxian wheat was 3.3 times higher than in Shangqiu wheat. This is the first report indicating a significant difference in the natural occurrence of Fusarium toxins in main staple foods between high- and low-risk areas for esophageal cancer in the People's Republic of China. 3aZea mays 3aTriticum aestivum 3aFusarium 3azearalenone 3atrichothecenes 3aneoplasms 3aesophageal diseases 3aepidemiology 2aChromatography, Gas 2aEsophageal Neoplasmsxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFusarium 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHumans 2aRisk Factors 2aTrichothecenesxanalysis 2aTriticum 2aZea mays 2aZearalenonexanalysis 3aChina 0aChinaxepidemiology.1 aYoshizawa, T.1 aKatayama, T.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1990 Dec., v. 56, no. 12 p.3723-3726x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01686naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245007200124300001800196500001500214520051800229650002500747650001700772650001700789650002200806650001500828650002700843651000900870653001800879653001500897653001400912653001600926653001300942653002300955653001800978653002300996700001501019700001501034700002301049700001801072700001601090773006901106852000901175939003301184946001101217655001201228IND9103763720221120131302.0910930s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910376372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruno, M.10aAbietane diterpenoids from Lepechinia meyeni and Lepechinia hastata  ap. 2339-2343.  a2019-12-04  aFrom the aerial parts of Lepechinia meyeni four previously known abietane diterpenes (pisiferol, rosmanol, carnosic acid and salvicanol) were isolated, with two unknown diterpenoids (isosalvicanol and a 12-formyl-abietane derivative).

During the spawning period in at least one of the years there was a decline as much as 20% in average size, 50% in somatic condition, 28-34% in size-at-age, 26-29% in reproductive status, as well as abundance and reproductive output of the stock declining during the spawning season. However, this change was not a function of the population becoming reproductively exhausted, as the aggregation was composed of different individuals with different biological characteristics. In each month the average age of individuals was ca. 6 mo, indicating that squid that had hatched at different times had entered the spawning aggregations, suggesting that the aggregation was made-up of a succession of microcohorts. Currently, management of many squid populations assumes that there is a single cohort in the aggregation. Therefore, estimating stock biomass at the start of the spawning season cannot be used as the population is constantly changing as micro-cohorts move into the aggregation. An instantaneous estimate of the spawning biomass, independent of fishing activity may be obtained by quantifying the density of deposited eggs. The strategy of individuals with a diversity of life history characteristics coming together in a single spawning aggregation may ensure the phenotypic and genetic diversity required to guarantee successful recruitment of this short-lived species. Therefore, temporally structured protection from harvest throughout the spawning season will ensure maintenance of this population diversity. 3abiomass 3aegg production 3aeggs 3agenetic variation 3alife history 3areproductive performance 3aspawning 3asquid 0aSpawning aggregation 0aFishing closures1 aPecl, Gretta T. 0 tReviews in fish biology and fisheries.g2007 Aug., v. 17, no. 2-3 p.183-195dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0960-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-006-9025-73Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070530b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01206naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010600125300001800231500001500249520017400264650001500438650001200453650002600465650002200491650001700513650002700530650002800557653003100585653002000616653002300636700001600659700001900675700001600694773006900710852000900779939003300788946001100821655001200832IND9103761920221120131355.0910927s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910376192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamada, H.10aBiotransformation of testosterone isomers by a green cell suspension culture of Marchantia polymorpha  ap. 2269-2270.  a2019-12-04  aA green cell suspension culture of liverwort, Marchantia polymorpha, converts testosterone to 6 beta-hydroxytestosterone and epitestosterone to androst-4-ene-3,17-dione. 3ametabolism 3aisomers 3aMarchantia polymorpha 3aspectral analysis 3atestosterone 3amolecular conformation 3acell suspension culture 0a6 beta-hydroxytestosterone 0aepitestosterone 0achemical structure1 aKonishi, H.1 aWilliams, H.J.1 aScott, A.I.0 tPhytochemistry.g1991, v. 30, no. 7 p.2269-2270x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01145naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245003300126300001800159520039000177650001000567650001100577650001000588650002200598650002500620650001700645650002300662651001000685700001400695773006900709852000900778939003300787946001100820655001200831IND9103763820221120115433.0910930s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910376382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Z.P.10aTaxanes from Taxus chinensis  ap. 2345-2348.  aFive new taxane diterpenes were isolated from the leaves and stems of Texus chinensis.

Newly-fixed N2 and nitrate were both major sources of N for nodule development and nitrate principally supported early shoot and root growth in Bragg. In the nts mutants, however, all plant parts and nodules in particular, relied more on N stored in the cotyledons. This resulted in later nodule maturity and a period of prolonged N-starvation for the seedlings of the extreme supernodulator, and could be responsible for their subsequently lowered biomass accumulation compared to the parent cultivar. 3aGlycine max 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3anitrogen metabolism 3anitrates 3anutrient uptake 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen content 3acotyledons 3anutrient requirements 3adry matter accumulation 3anodulation 3aroot nodules 3aplant development 3amutants1 aPeoples, M.B.1 aBrown, P.H.1 aCarroll, B.J.1 aGresshoff, P.M.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1990 Oct., v. 41, no. 231 p.1239-1244x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01824naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010900128300001800237500001500255520082000270650002501090650001701115650002501132650004301157650002701200650001901227650002201246650001101268651001201279653001701291653001501308700001701323773006901340852000901409939003301418946001101451655001201462IND9103763020221122145229.0910927s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910376302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuchwaldt, L.10aHPLC purification of destruxins produced by Alternaria brassicae in culture and leaves of Brassica napus  ap. 2311-2316.  a2019-12-04  aReversed-phase chromatography was applied for preparative isolation of destruxins from the plant pathogenic fungus Alternaria brassicae.

Additionally, identification of the two major toxins was, for the first time, made in leaf tissue infected by the fungus. Destruxin B and homodestruxin B were identified by their 1H and 13C NMR spectra, which were assigned by homonuclear and heteronuclear 2D NMR techniques. Based on this, the minor components were identified as destruxin B2 by homonuclear 1D and 2D NMR.

To evaluate epidemiological patterns among human definitive hosts, we assessed genetic diversity and population subdivision of S. mansoni infrapopulations in human hosts from the highly endemic village of Virgem das Graças in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. We believe this is the largest such survey to date. Genetic diversity of parasites, measured over eight polymorphic microsatellite loci, was relatively high and standard measures of inbreeding indicated that the population was panmictic. Furthermore, there was no significant isolation-by-distance of parasite infrapopulations, and measures of population subdivision indicated significant but low to moderate levels of population differentiation. We conclude that patients within this village sample from a broad range of schistosome genetic diversity and effectively act as “genetic mixing bowls” for the parasites. These results contrast with those previously observed in the Brazilian village of Melquiades and thus provide the opportunity for comparisons of environmental and epidemiological differences that are likely to influence host-parasite coevolution and parasite transmission.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3acoevolution 3afounder effect 3agenetic variation 3ahosts 3ahumans 3ainbreeding 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amixing 3aparasites 3apatients 3apeople 3arisk 3aschistosomiasis 3asurveys 3avillages 3aBrazil1 aSorensen, R.E.1 aGazzinelli, A.1 aMinchella, D.J.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2008 Mar., v. 38, no. 3-4 p.389-399d[Oxford; New York]: Elsevier Sciencex0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2007.07.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20080325b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02710naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245016800125300001800293500001500311520142200326650002501748650002201773650001301795650002601808650002601834650002901860650002301889650002301912650002301935650004101958650001601999650002002015650001902035653002802054653002302082700001802105700002002123773009202143852000902235939003302244946001102277655001202288IND9100225620221122080630.0910114e199010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910022562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, F.L.10aEffect of the nitrogen supply on the activities of isoenzymes of NADH-dependent glutamate synthase and glutamine synthetase in root nodules of Phaseolus vulgaris L  ap. 1215-1221.  a2019-12-04  aThis paper has investigated the regulation of the activities of glutamine synthetase (GS) and NADH-dependent glutamate synthase (NADH-GOGAT) of Phaseolus vulgaris in relation to the nitrogen supply. The activity of NADH-GOGAT II, which is the most abundant isoenzyme of glutamate synthase in root nodules of P. vulgaris, was either absent or barely detectable in other organs of this species. Moreover, its activity in roots could not be induced by ammonium. In nodules NADH-GOGAT II activity was detected in nodules grown under an atmosphere of 80% argon: 20% oxygen and in nodules formed with a Fix- Rhizobium mutant. However, in these non-fixing nodules the activity of this isoenzyme attained less than 15% of the activity in fixing nodules and switching argon/oxygen grown nodules to nitrogen/oxygen led to an increase in this isoenzyme within 24 h. This effect could not be mimicked by the addition of exogenous ammonium. Ammonium addition, however, promoted nodule senescence and also led to a decrease in the activities of nitrogenase and plant GS. In particular, the nodule-enhanced GS gamma isoenzyme but not the GS beta isoenzyme was affected by these changes and in a manner similar to the changes in NADH-GOGAT II. The activity of the NADH-GOGAT I isoenzyme was detectable in other organs of P. vulgaris and in nodules its activity also showed some changes in response to the rate of dinitrogen fixation. 3achemical composition 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrient deficiencies 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aammonium compounds 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aRhizobium phaseoli 3aRhizobium leguminosarum bv. phaseoli 3anitrogenase 3aenzyme activity 3aplant proteins 0aRhizobium leguminosarum 0aglutamate synthase1 aBennett, M.J.1 aCullimore, J.V.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1990 Oct., v. 41, no. 231 p.1215-1221x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02759naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245007700146300001400223500001500237520110300252650001801355650001601373650001701389650003001406650001901436650002601455650001801481650001201499650002601511650002801537650005801565650003301623650002401656650002101680650001801701650003101719650004201750650004201792650004701834650003201881653001601913653002901929653001801958653003301976653001902009700001702028773009402045852000902139930003302148945001302181946001102194655001202205IND2051440420221122040444.0960529e199510  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205144042DNAL7 a87192462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButikofer, P.10aGlycosyl inositolphospholipid-anchored structures in Herpetomonas davidi  ap. 65-75.  a2019-12-05  aGlycosyl inositolphospholipid (GPI)-anchored structures in the monogenetic parasite Herpetomonas davidi, were labeled with [13H]myristic acid and [3H]glucosamine, and characterized by enzymatic and chemical treatments that are typical for the identification of GPI anchors. [3HlMyristate incorporated into two different pools of GPI-linked structures that could be separated by chromatography on octyl-Sepharose. One pool consisted of three GPI-anchored proteins with apparent molecular masses of 21, 31 and 45 kDa, and the GPI lipid moieties were identified as alkyl-lyso-glycerols. The label in the other pool associated with lipopeptidophosphoglycan (LPPG)-like structures of approximately 12-kDa molecular mass, containing ceramide-type GPI lipid anchors. While protein GPI anchors could also be labeled using [3H]glucosamine as radiolabeled GPI anchor precursor, hardly any radioactivity was incorporated into the LPPG-like structures.

The genus Strongyloides has both a parasitic and a free-living adult generation. S. ratti infections of its rat host are negatively affected by the host immune response, such that a month after infection, worms are lost from the hosts. Here we have investigated the changes in parasite gene expression that occur as the anti-S. ratti immune pressure increases. Existing S. ratti expressed sequence tags were used to construct a microarray consisting of 2227 putative genes. This was probed with cDNA prepared from parasites subject to low or high immune pressures. There are significant changes in the gene expression of S. ratti when subject to different immune pressures. Most of the genes whose expression changes have no significant alignment to known genes. These data together with previous S. ratti EST data were then used to identify genes that we hypothesise are central to the parasitic life of S. ratti and, perhaps, other parasitic nematodes. These analyses have identified genes likely to play a key role in the parasitic life of S. ratti; these genes should be the priority for further investigation. 3aparasites 3aStrongyloides 3acomplementary DNA 3ahumans 3amicroarray technology 3ahosts 3aexpressed sequence tags 3apathogens 3agene expression 3aimmune response 3arats 3agene expression regulation 3aadults 0agenes1 aBarker, Gary L.A.1 aHughes, Louise1 aViney, Mark E.0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2008 Apr., v. 158, no. 2 p.112-119dAmsterdam: Elsevierx0166-68517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2007.11.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03282naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245015700147300001800304520171600322650001202038650003902050650001602089650001602105650002002121650002302141650000902164650001602173650001202189650007502201650007302276650001102349650001902360650004002379650005002419650001102469650003502480650001402515650002602529650001702555650002402572700001602596700002102612773010002633852000902733939003302742946001302775655001202788IND9006178220221122025619.0901214e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900617822DNAL7 a21227822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrawford, R.P.10aEffect of dose of Brucella abortus strain 19 in yearling heifers on the relative risk of developing brucellosis from challenge exposure with strain 2308  ap. 1837-1840.  aYearling heifers were given SC injections of 10(8) (n = 40), 10(9) (n = 44), or 10(10) (n = 44) colony-forming units of Brucella abortus strain 19 (Sl9). The proportion of heifers with positive serologic test results at 1 month following vaccination increased as the dose of S19 increased. These proportions decreased with time, and all heifers had negative card, rivanol, and complement fixation test results within 4 months. Positive ELISA results persisted beyond 4 months in all three S19 dose groups; however, all heifers were ELISA-negative within 9 months after vaccination. Comparable lymphocyte transformation activity was stimulated by S19 dose of 10(9) or 10(10) and approximately half of the heifers in both groups had a positive stimulation index at 9 months. Immunity of the pregnant heifers was challenged 9 months after vaccination with 10(7) B abortus strain 2308 as follows: diluent controls (n = 69); 10(8) B abortus S19 (n = 40); 10(9) B abortus S19 (n = 39); and 10(10) B abortus S19 (n = 39). Tissue specimens from heifers were obtained at parturition and necropsy for culturing of B abortus. The proportion of heifers that developed brucellosis, ie, had positive culture results, increased as gestation days at challenge exposure increased. The effect of gestational age was controlled in the analysis using logisic regression. The relative risk of brucellosis was reduced to 0.38, 0.15, and 0.06 for B abortus S19 doses of 10(8), 10(9), and 10(10), respectively, compared with diluent controls at 1. Risk of brucellosis in heifers vaccinated with 10(8), 10(9), or 10(10) S19 was, respectively, one-third, one-seventh, or one-seventeenth that of diluent controls or nonvaccinated heifers. 3aheifers 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3abrucellosis 3avaccination 3aimmune response 3adisease prevention 3arisk 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aBrucella abortusximmunologyxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aBrucellosis, Bovineximmunologyxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aCattle 2aCohort Studies 2aColony Count, Microbialxveterinary 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aFemale 2aImmunity, Cellularximmunology 2aPregnancy 2aRetrospective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aSpecies Specificity1 aAdams, L.G.1 aRichardson, B.E.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1990 Nov., v. 51, no. 11 p.1837-1840x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02639naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245010500167300001600272500002400288520152000312650001801832650001001850650001001860650001301870650001101883650001101894650001101905650001501916650000901931650001301940650001501953650001701968650001301985650001501998651001002013700001402023773012802037852000902165856005502174655001202229IND4424769020221122003903.0090821e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442476902DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4549.2008.00287.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJOSE, K.P.10aSolar tunnel drying of turmeric (curcuma longa linn. syn. c. domestica val.) for quality improvement  ap. 121-135.  aIncludes references  aTurmeric is one of the most ancient medicinal spices of the world. As its homeland, India acts as the largest producer, exporter and consumer of turmeric. The value of turmeric is due to its color and flavor, which is being given by curcumin, volatile oil and oleoresin. The end quality of turmeric is very much dependent on its post-harvest methods. Traditionally, open sun drying is the chief method adopted for processing. In the present investigation, freshly harvested turmeric rhizomes were collected from 30 stations and drying experiments were conducted by adopting three methods: (1) solar tunnel drying; (2) conventional drying; and (3) commercial drying. Various pre-drying and post-drying treatments were conducted. The results proved that conventional processing could maintain the intrinsic quality up to a certain level, but extrinsic quality could not be achieved. Solar tunnel drying method is an effective alternative to traditional open sun drying, where retention of curcumin, volatile oil and oleoresin was high, with less drying time. The study also disclosed the importance of pre-drying and post-drying treatments and hygienic practices to be adopted during processing. Solar tunnel dryer can be used to process most of the spices, vegetables, fruits and other perishable crops with maximum retention of intrinsic quality and for better shelf life. Substantial reduction of drying time and physical quality improvement with regard to international quality standards are the other advantages. 3aCurcuma longa 3acolor 3acrops 3acurcumin 3adryers 3aflavor 3afruits 3aharvesting 3aoils 3arhizomes 3ashelf life 3asolar drying 3aturmeric 3avegetables 3aIndia1 aJOY, C.M.0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2009 Aug., v. 33, no. s1 p.121-135dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4549.2008.00287.x 7aarticle02393naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245007500144300001800219520096500237650001001202650002601212650001801238650001301256650002401269650002101293650001101314650001701325650002501342650001201367650006601379650003901445650002901484650001501513650006101528650002901589650001001618650004401628650003501672700001801707700001501725700001601740773010001756852000901856939003301865946001301898655001201911IND9006177920221122025735.0901214e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900617792DNAL7 a22408162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShoop, W.L.10aAnthelmintic activity of the macrocyclic lactone F28249-alpha in sheep  ap. 1873-1874.  aThe macrolytic lactone F28249-alpha was titrated in experimentally infected sheep and found to be highly effective against most of the common gastrointestinal nematodes as a single oral dose, given at a rate of 0.025, 0.05, or 0.1 mg/kg. Specifically, maximal activity was evident at even the lowest dosage against adult Haemonchus contortus, Ostertagia circumcinta, Trichostrongylus axei, and T colubriformis and L4 O circumcinta. Activity against Oesophagostomum columbianum was also high at all dosages, with a calculated ED95 of 0.029 mg/kg. Cooperia curticei was eliminated at 0.1 mg/kg, but control was erratic at the lower dosages. The greatest weakness of this compound was its activity against C oncophora. The activity against this parasite was weak (<less than or equal to 85%) at all dosages, and the dosage-response curve was flat, suggesting dosages substantially higher than those given would be necessary for high-order control of this species. 3asheep 3amacrolide antibiotics 3aanthelmintics 3aNematoda 3anematode infections 3anematode control 3adosage 3adrug therapy 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAntinematodal Agentsxpharmacology 2aHaemonchusxdrug effects 2aMacrolides 2aNematode Infectionsxdrug therapyxetiologyxveterinary. 2aOstertagiaxdrug effects 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxdrug therapyxetiology. 2aTrichostrongylusxdrug effects1 aEgerton, J.R.1 aEary, C.H.1 aSuhayda, D.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1990 Nov., v. 51, no. 11 p.1873-1874x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01371naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001600160245012000176300001400296520032500310650002100635650001000656650001200666650001200678650002100690650002100711650001700732651001200749653001600761700001700777773007200794852000900866856010000875939003300975946001301008655001201021IND9304259920221122003826.0930721e193801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930425992DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1938.00021962003000010003x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, E.V.10aNut grass eradication studies.

A case of selected villages in Morogoro and Dar es Salaam regions, Tanzania  ap. 33-49.  aIncludes references  aIntensification of farm technologies has shown high potential in improving farm production and enhancing rural food and income security. Intensification, however, is commodity-specific with high-value crops intensively produced. Farmed fish is one of the high-value crops introduced in the study area to meet the above ends. The problem, however, is that the level of intensifying fish farming technology has been very low leading to discouraging results. A study was conducted in Morogoro and Dar es Salaam Regions, Tanzania, to identify socio-economic factors that influence the intensification of fish farming technology. Data were collected from 234 respondents randomly sampled from 25 selected villages and were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression model. Results indicated that age, extension education, profitability, marketability, risk, palatability and easiness to obtain farmed fish were significant in explaining the intensification of fish farming technology. Three recommendations emerge from this finding. First, there is need to provide extension education to the practicing farmers on various aspects of fish farming. The probability of intensifying fish farming is higher for knowledgeable farmers. Second, technology developers should strive to reduce the risk of farming fish and improve the profitability and marketability of farmed fish. Finally, any analysis focusing on intensification of a fish farming technology should not confine itself to agronomic and socio-economic characteristics but should also encompass food characteristics of the technology. Food variables such as palatability and easiness to obtain farmed fish have been shown to influence the intensification of fish farming technology. 3aagricultural exhibitions 3aagronomic traits 3acrops 3aextension education 3afarmed fish 3afarmers 3afarms 3afish culture 3afood security 3afoods 3alogit analysis 3apalatability 3aprofitability 3arisk 3asocioeconomic factors 3avillages 3aTanzania0 tAquaculture international.g2011 Feb., v. 19, no. 1 p.33-49dSpringer Netherlandsx0967-61207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-010-9339-2 7aarticle02306naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245012600174300001600300520093800316650002301254650002501277650002501302650001201327650003101339650002601370650002201396650001601418650001701434650002101451650001301472650001501485700001901500700002501519700001901544700002301563700002301586773011801609852000901727856009201736930003301828946001101861655001201872IND4403027720221121224000.0080319e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440302772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molbiopara.2007.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVertommen, Didier10aDifferential expression of glycosomal and mitochondrial proteins in the two major life-cycle stages of Trypanosoma brucei  ap. 189-201.  aLabel-free semi-quantitative differential three-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (3D-LC-MS/MS) was used to compare the glycosomal and mitochondrial proteomes of the bloodstream- and insect-form of Trypanosoma brucei. The abundance of glycosomal marker proteins identified in the two life-cycle stages corresponded well with the relative importance of biochemical pathways present in the glycosomes of the two stages and the peptide spectral count ratios of selected enzymes were in good agreement with published data about their enzymatic specific activities. This approach proved extremely useful for the generation of large scale proteomics data for the comparison of different life-cycle stages. Several proteins involved in oxidative stress protection, sugar-nucleotide synthesis, purine salvage, nucleotide-monophosphate formation and purine-nucleotide cycle were identified as glycosomal proteins. 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3abiochemical pathways 3adevelopmental stages 3aenzymes 3agene expression regulation 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amicrobodies 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3aproteins 3aproteomics1 aVan Roy, Joris1 aSzikora, Jean-Pierre1 aRider, Mark H.1 aMichels, Paul A.M.1 aOpperdoes, Fred R.0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2008 Apr., v. 158, no. 2 p.189-201dAmsterdam: Elsevierx0166-68517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2007.12.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01229naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001800160245005500178300001600233500001500249520029500264650001700559650001300576650001900589650001000608650002600618653002300644773009300667852000900760856010000769939003300869946001300902655001200915IND9304156420221121102049.0930715e193409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930415642DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1934.00021962002600090001x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJenkins, M.T.10aLinkage relations of the A2a2 factor pair in maize  ap. 719-720.  a2019-12-04  aData are presented which indicate that the A2a2 factor pair is located in the Pr - V2 linkage group, with a crossover percentage between bt and a2 of 7.2.

The dissipation rates of hexaflumuron in cabbages and soils fit a first-order decay process very well. The dissipation times for 50% of the hexaflumuron in cabbage and soil were 3.37 and 3.01 days from Hunan province and 5.58 and 3.68 days in Tianjin, respectively, when Chinese cabbage was treated with 180 g of active ingredient (ai)/ha. Hexaflumuron residual times in cabbage and soil were influenced strongly by the application rate and frequency. The application regimen of hexaflumuron in the cabbage field, a rate of 120 g of ai/ha with two applications at a 7 day interval and a 21 day preharvest interval, was recommended from the point of view of ensuring food safety. The residual levels of hexaflumuron in cabbages were lower than the standards of the “Positive List System for Agricultural Chemical Residues in Foods” based on the recommended application regimen. 3ahexaflumuron 3aChinese cabbage 3aBrassica rapa subsp. pekinensis 3afield experimentation 3ainsecticide residues 3afood safety 3apolluted soils 2aBenzamidesxchemistry 2aBrassicaxchemistry 2aCrops, Agriculturalxchemistry 2aPhenylurea Compoundsxchemistry 3aChina 0ainsect growth regulators1 aGuo, Zhengyuan1 aChen, Ling1 aXu, Zhen1 aLiu, Ying1 aYang, Changming0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Apr. 28, v. 58, no. 8 p.4839–4843-4839–4843dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf904358v3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/07/23  aOther US 7aarticle00944naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245003400131300001300165520015800178650001200336650001300348650001500361650001300376650001800389650001300407650001800420650001400438653002000452773008300472852000900555939003300564945000800597946001300605655001200618991607830160742620221121045657.0910913e199001  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910026412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHermann, M.10aEN speaks with obesity expert  ap. 1, 3.  aOpinions from a nutrition expert concerning obesity are discussed.

This test appeared to have possibilities on the basis of the limited trials. Varieties of winter and spring wheat exhibited significant differences. Wider differences were shown by the winter wheat varieties than by the spring wheats. Spring wheat tests exhibited a positive correlation between time of dough ball disintegration and loaf volume and baking strength score as determined by the milling and baking trials. Winter wheat time tests were positively correlated with strength score when the Wiley Mill was used to grind the samples. Spring wheat varieties included in the trials constituted a highly selected group and this probably was an important reason for a narrower range of difference in the number of minutes required for dough ball disintegration than was apparent for the winter sorts. Definite conclusions as to the value of the Arcade mill as a substitute for the Wiley mill cannot be drawn from the present data. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat meal 3acrop quality 3abaking quality 3avariety trials 3asampling 3aprotein content 3aduration 3aanalysis of variance 3alaboratory techniques 0acorrelation analysis 0abaking strength 0awheat meal fermentation time test 0adough ball disintegration 0aloaf volume 0awiley mill 0aarcade mill1 aMarkley, M.C.0 tAgronomy journal.g1934 July, v. 26, no. 7 p.580-586wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1934.00021962002600070006x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02395naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011400124300001400238300001900252500002300271500001500294520102900309650002301338650001901361650002201380650000901402650002001411650003801431650002101469650001901490650002501509650002301534650002501557650003601582650001301618653001901631653002201650653001601672653001201688653001301700653001301713653001801726653001301744700001501757773006401772852000901836939003301845946001101878655001201889IND9103414320221121034659.0910830e199102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910341432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, C.J.14aThe chromosomal location of genes encoding NADH dehydrogenase isozymes in hexaploid wheat and related species  ap. 44-51.  ap. 44-51. ill.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aAnalysis of NADH dehydrogenase isozymes in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) by flat-bed isoelectric focusing revealed a genetic system involving four sets of Ndh loci. The Ndh-A1 locus, previously identified on chromosome arm 4AL, was confirmed. Homoeoloci Ndh-R1 in rye, Ndh-H1 in barley, Ndh-Hch1 in Hordeum chilense, Ndh-Sl1 in Aegilops sharonensis, and Ndh-VI in Dasypyrum villosum were also identified. The Ndh-2 loci, encoding monomeric isozymes, were found in the short arms of homoeologous group 7 chromosomes. Homoeoloci Ndh-A2, Ndh-D2, and Ndh-R2 are described. The Ndh-3 set, encoding multimeric isozymes, were found on each of the homoeologous group 3 chromosome long arms. An Ndh-B3b variant and homoeoloci Ndh-R3 (on chromosome arm 6RL), Ndh-H3, and Ndh-Sl3 are described. The Ndh-4 set, encoding monomeric isozymes for which no varietal variation was found, were identified on the short arms of group 3 chromosomes. Ndh-A4, Ndh-B4, Ndh-H4, Ndh-R4, and Ndh-E4 (Agropyron elongatum) homoeoloci are described. 3aNADH dehydrogenase 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aAegilops tauschii 3aloci 3aHordeum vulgare 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. dicoccon 3aHordeum chilense 3aSecale cereale 3aThinopyrum elongatum 3aDasypyrum villosum 3aAegilops sharonensis 3aTriticum aestivum subsp. spelta 3aisozymes 0atriticum macha 0aTriticum aestivum 0achromosomes 0aHordeum 0andh loci 0aAegilops 0agene location 0aTriticum1 aGale, M.D.0 tGenome =.g1991 Feb., v. 34, no. 1 p.44-51x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03161naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100002100174245007000195300002000265500002400285500001500309520150200324650002501826650001801851650001701869650003001886650001301916650002601929650002101955650001501976650001701991650001202008650001802020650001602038650001502054650002702069650003902096653004002135653001602175653001602191700002002207700002102227700002602248773017602274852000902450856007702459930003302536945002502569946001302594655001202607IND4436861920221121023753.0100511e20100428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443686192DNAL7 a203557212pmid7 a10.1021/jf904018h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ206 0aQ5061 aHerrero, Beatriz10aAuthentication of Atlantic Cod (Gadus morhua) Using Real Time PCR  ap. 4794–4799.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis work describes the development of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) system for the detection and identification of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Among the advantages of this technique, it is worth highlighting that this is reliable in terms of specificity and sensitivity. The TaqMan real-time PCR is the simplest, fastest testing process and has the highest potential for automation, therefore representing the currently most suitable method for screening, allowing the detection of fraudulent or unintentional mislabeling of this species. The method can be applied to all kinds of products, fresh, frozen, and processed products, including those undergoing intensive processes of transformation. The developed methodology using specific primer−probe set was validated and further applied to 40 commercial samples labeled as cod in order to determinate if the species used for their manufacturing corresponded to G. morhua, detecting 20% that were incorrectly labeled. A Ct value of about 19 was obtained when G. morhua was present. In samples with a species mixture, all samples that had a fluorescence signal were positive (Ct < 30) for the presence of G. morhua by conventional end-point RT-PCR, and the estimated limit of detection for these type of samples was of 20 pg of DNA. The methodology herein developed is useful to check the fulfilment of labeling regulations for seafood products and verify the correct traceability in commercial trade and for fisheries control. 3aproduct authenticity 3afood analysis 3aGadus morhua 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseafoods 3aequipment performance 3afood composition 3acod (fish) 3atraceability 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA Probes 2aGadus morhuaxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 0areal-time polymerase chain reaction 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aMadrinan, Maria1 aVieites, Juan M.1 aEspineira, Montserrat0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Apr. 28, v. 58, no. 8 p.4794–4799-4794–4799dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf904018h3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100811b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/07/23  aOther US 7aarticle03510naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245011800145300001800263520202300281650000902304650001802313650001802331650001702349650002302366650001802389650001402407650001702421650002202438650002402460650001202484650001802496650005802514650003302572650002502605650001102630650004202641650003102683650004302714650003602757650003302793650001702826700001802843773010002861852000902961939003302970946001303003655001203016IND9006175120221121023737.0901214e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900617512DNAL7 a22407942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVighio, G.H.10aPlasma hormone concentrations after administration of dexamethasone during the middle of the luteal phase in cows  ap. 1711-1714.  aThe effect of glucocorticoids on gonadal steroid and gonadotropic hormone concentrations and subsequent follicular activity in cows undergoing normal estrous cycles was evaluated by administration of dexamethasone (DXM) during the middle of the luteal phase. Seven cows were given physiologic saline solution twice daily from day 13 to day 17 of the estrous cycle (control experiment). During the next estrous cycle, cows were administered DXM (2 mg, IM) twice daily on days 13 through 17. Plasma specimens obtained twice daily throughout the control and DXM-treatment cycles were assayed for progesterone and estradiol concentrations. The appearance of estrus after DXM treatment was delayed until days 23 to 25 in 3 cows and was not seen by day 35 in the other 4 cows, compared with mean (+/- SD) cycle length of 22.4 +/- 3.2 in cows during the control experiment. Progesterone concentration remained significantly (P < 0.01) high on days 19 to 23, whereas estradiol values failed to increase (P < 0.05) on days 19 and 20 after treatment with DXM. Blood samples were obtained at 15-minute intervals for 12 hours to compare (by analysis of covariance) the effect of DXM treatment on plasma hormone concentrations on day 15 of each cycle with those of day 10. Compared with values during the control experiment, a significant (P < 0.05) decrease was observed in the size of the pulses of luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol, although the number of pulses of each hormone per 12 hours was not affected when cows were given DXM. Baseline concentrations of LH and estradiol were not altered by type of treatment. Change in variables describing progesterone secretion was not seen. Results indicate that high glucocorticoid concentrations in the middle of the cycle may delay the onset of the next estrus. This delay appears to be attributable to prolonged luteal activity that may be associated with reduction in pulsatile estradiol secretion as a consequence of suppressed LH concentration in the middle of the cycle. 3acows 3aestrous cycle 3adexamethasone 3ablood plasma 3aGraafian follicles 3acorpus luteum 3aestradiol 3aprogesterone 3ahormone secretion 3aluteinizing hormone 2aAnimals 2aCattlexblood 2aDexamethasonexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aEstradiolxbloodxsecretion. 2aEstrusxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aInjections, Intramuscularxveterinary 2aLuteal Phasexdrug effects 2aLuteinizing Hormonexbloodxsecretion. 2aProgesteronexbloodxsecretion. 2aRadioimmunoassayxveterinary 2aTime Factors1 aLiptrap, R.M.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1990 Nov., v. 51, no. 11 p.1711-1714x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01782naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001600160245006100176300001600237520070600253650001500959650001000974650002400984650001801008650001301026650001701039651001001056653001501066653001701081653001201098653001201110653001001122700001701132773009201149852000901241856010001250939003301350946001301383655001201396IND9304255420221121023720.0930720e193607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930425542DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1936.00021962002800070006x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, B.N.10aUnit of quantitative study of weed flora on arable lands  ap. 556-561.  aA test was made of the efficiency of the strip and the quadrat form of unit of estimating the weed flora of arable land.

The inhibitory effect of salinity on nodulation of chickpea occurred at 4.0 dS m-1 (34.2 mol m-3 NaCl) and nodulation was completely inhibited at 7 dS m-1 (61.6 mol m-3 NaCl); the plants died at 8 dS m-1 (71.8 mol m-3 NaCl). Chickpea cultivar ILC 482 inoculated with Rhizobium strain Ch191(spcstr) was grown in two pot experiments and irrigated with saline water. Salinity (NaCl equivalent to 1-4 dS m-1) significantly decreased shoot and root dry weight, total nodule number per plant, nodule weight and average nodule weight. The results indicate that Rhizobium strain Ch191 forms an infective and effective symbiosis with chickpea under saline and non-saline conditions; this legume was more salt-sensitive compared to the rhizobia, the roots were more sensitive than the shoots, and N2 fixation was more sensitive to salinity than plant growth. 3anitrogen fixation 3asalinity 3astress response 3aroot nodules 3adry matter accumulation 3aRhizobium 3anodulation 3aCicer arietinum 3ashoots 0asize 0astress 0aroots1 aWood, M.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1990 Oct., v. 41, no. 231 p.1263-1269x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02663naa a2200517 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245009300151300001800244520115900262650001601421650001401437650002001451650001101471650001301482650002001495650001901515650001501534650002001549650002501569650004701594650001101641650001101652650004701663650002001710650002701730650002401757650002101781650002101802650004901823650004701872651001201919653002201931700001901953700001701972773008101989852000902070939003302079945000802112946001302120655001202133991607827630742620221121004921.0910916e199108  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910026702DNAL7 a18611732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNally, M.E.10aContribution of sulfate and sulfoesters to total sulfur intake in infants fed human milk  ap. 1250-1254.  aColostrum (d 2-4) and mature human milk samples (d 23-30) collected from eight mothers giving birth at 31 +/- 7 wk of gestation were analyzed for total sulfur, free inorganic sulfate and acid labile sulfoesters. The data presented are representative of complete 24-h expressions. Total sulfur was measured using a wet digestion procedure in which all forms of sulfur were converted to inorganic sulfate. The sulfate was quantified by a radiometric barium precipitation assay. Total sulfur showed no marked diurnal variation, but the mean concentration in 19 colostrum samples (10.2 +/- 4.2 mmol/L) was significantly higher than in 14 mature milk samples (4.3 +/- 0.8 mmol/L) (P < 0.001). The range of predicted 24-h intakes of sulfur by infants fed colostrum (0.78-3.22 mmol/kg body weight) was slightly higher than those fed mature milk (0.54-1.06 mmol/kg), but it was not significantly different. The combined fractions of free inorganic sulfate and acid-labile sulfoester fractions contribute <5% to the total sulfur content of either colostrum or mature milk. However, the physiological significance of these milk components remains to be determined. 3abreast milk 3acolostrum 3amineral content 3asulfur 3asulfates 3anutrient intake 3ainfant feeding 3aprediction 3alactating women 2aColostrumxchemistry 2aEstersxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMilk, Humanxchemistry 2aPotassiumxanalysis 2aReference Values 2aSodiumxanalysis 2aSulfatesxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aSulfurxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 3aOntario 0asulfites (esters)1 aAtkinson, S.A.1 aCole, D.E.C.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1991 Aug., v. 121, no. 8 p.1250-1254x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle00942naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005500128300001300183520018600196650001500382650002100397650001100418650002500429650001800454650001500472700001300487700001800500773006900518852000900587939003300596946001100629655001200640IND9103766120221120233253.0911001s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910376612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurohit, M.C.12aA betulinic and glycoside from Schefflera venulosa  ap. 2419.  aA new betulinic acid glycoside, lup-20(29)-en-28-oic-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl (2 leads to 1)-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside has been characterized from the leaves of Schefflera venulosa. 3aSchefflera 3amedicinal plants 3aleaves 3achemical composition 3atriterpenoids 3aglycosides1 aPant, G.1 aRawat, M.S.M.0 tPhytochemistry.g1991, v. 30, no. 7 p.2419-2419x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02729naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001800160245009400178300001600272520155300288650001601841650001501857650002001872650001801892650001301910650002101923650002101944650002201965651001401987653001102001653001702012653001802029653002202047700001502069773009202084852000902176856010002185939003302285946001302318655001202331IND9304255320221120233233.0930720e193607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930425532DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1936.00021962002800070005x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmbreit, W.W.14aThe comparative efficiency of free and combined nitrogen for the nutrition of the soybean  ap. 548-555.  aSoybeans have been grown under a variety of conditions which modify the carbohydrate-nitrogen relation of the plants. It is shown that the preferential form of nitrogen for the nutrition of these plants changes with the available carbohydrate present. Four distinct situations are discussed, viz., case I, excessive carbohydrate; case II, optimum carbohydrate-nitrogen relation; case III, near-optimum carbohydrate-nitrogen relation; and case IV, deficient carbohydrate. From the data presented it is concluded that: 1. Under conditions which result in a balanced carbohydrate-nitrogen relation in the soybean plant, free nitrogen is the preferred form of nitrogen nutrition. 2. Under conditions which result in an unbalanced carbohydrate-nitrogen relation in the plant, fixed nitrogen is desirable, since this may enable plants to survive an unfavorable environment. 3. Since the environmental conditions which produce plants with an unbalanced carbohydrate-nitrogen relation (high light intensity, drought, high C02, or low light intensity, low temperature, short days) are the exception rather than the rule, it is probable that under field conditions maximum yields would be obtained with inoculated soybean plants rather than with those dependent on fixed forms of nitrogen for their nutrition. Nevertheless, certain climatic or field conditions are occasionally encountered which produce a plant with an unbalanced (excessive or defiant) carbohydrate-nitrogen relation and the use of combined forms of nitrogen would accordingly be indicated. 3aGlycine max 3acrop yield 3aplant nutrition 3acarbohydrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen balance 3anitrogen fixation 3aWisconsin 0aratios 0agrowth curve 0afree nitrogen 0acombined nitrogen1 aFred, E.B.0 tAgronomy journal.g1936 July, v. 28, no. 7 p.548-555wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1936.00021962002800070005x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02587naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245017400125300001600299500001500315520136900330650001101699650001801710650002601728650002201754650001401776650002701790650001701817650002501834650001301859650001601872653001701888653001301905653002001918653001501938653000801953700001401961700001401975773009801989852000902087930003302096945001302129946001102142655001202153IND2051037520221120223317.0960429e199507  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205103752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArts, G.J.12aA possible role for the guide RNA U-tail as a specificity determinant in formation of guide RNA-messenger RNA chimeras in mitochondrial extracts of Crithidia fasciculata  ap. 211-222.  a2019-12-05  aChimeric g(uide) RNA:pre-mRNA molecules are potential intermediates of the RNA editing process in kinetoplastid mitochondria. We have studied the characteristics of chimeric molecules formed in mitochondrial extracts of the insect trypanosomatid Crithidia fasciculata which had been supplied with synthetic NADH dehydrogenase (ND) subunit-7 gRNA and pre-mRNA variants. The ability of a gRNA to participate in chimera formation in this system depends on the possibility of base pairing with the pre-mRNA via the anchor sequence, but not on the presence of a U-tail or a full-length informational part. Chimeras formed with a specific gRNA:pre-mRNA pair displayed a large variation in length, due to variably sized 3' end truncations of the gRNA moieties and variation in the sites in the pre-mRNA to which the gRNAs were attached. Surprisingly, the presence of a U-tail in the gRNA for a large part determined the specificity of the linkage. In 60% of the cases gRNAs possessing a U-tail of at least one residue were attached to an editing site, whereas 75% of the gRNAs without Us were attached to non-editing sites. Furthermore, the chimera forming activity was greatly stimulated by the addition of ATP but not by AMP-CPP, an ATP-analogue with a non-hydrolyzable alpha-beta phosphate bond. This suggests the involvement in the chimera formation of an RNA ligase. 3auracil 3amessenger RNA 3aCrithidia fasciculata 3amitochondrial DNA 3achimerism 3aadenosine triphosphate 3amitochondria 3anucleotide sequences 3agenomics 3aRNA editing 0achimeric rna 0apre-mrna 0aanchor sequence 0aprecursors 0aRNA1 aSloof, P.1 aBenne, R.0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g1995 July, v. 73, no. 1/2 p.211-222x0166-68517nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02294naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001900160245007700179300001600256500001500272520108600287650001101373650001601384650001201400650002501412650001301437650001001450650002501460650001601485650002301501650002201524651001301546653002201559653001601581653001201597700001601609773009201625852000901717856010001726939003301826946001301859655001201872IND9304254820221120223316.0930720e193606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930425482DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1936.00021962002800060012x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, D.C.10aStudies on Hessian fly infestation and some characters of the wheat culm  ap. 479-483.  a2019-12-04  aStrain determinations on percentage of Hessian fly infestation and field lodging and culm determinations on breaking strength, weight, and diameter were made on 111 strains of soft winter wheat in 1932 and 112 strains in 1933. Differences between strains and the differences between puparia-free and puparia-infested groups within the same strain were studied. There were significant inter-strain differences in fly infestation breaking strength, weight of culm, and diameter of culm, and these differences, according to inter-annual correlations, tended to persist from year to year. There were significant differences in breaking strength, weight, and diameter of culm between the puparia-free and puparia-infested groups within the same strain, but the very low non-significant coefficients of correlation between fly infestation and breaking strength, weight, and diameter of culm indicate that selection for fly resistance by using one of these morphological factors would be ineffective. Hessian fly infestation and field lodging were significantly and positively associated. 3aweight 3acorrelation 3alodging 3aMayetiola destructor 3adiameter 3astems 3alaboratory equipment 3aplant pests 3astrain differences 3aTriticum aestivum 3aMichigan 0abreaking strength 0ainfestation 0astrains1 aBrown, H.M.0 tAgronomy journal.g1936 June, v. 28, no. 6 p.479-483wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1936.00021962002800060012x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02303naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245006800183300001600251520096200267650001001229650002201239650001701261650001301278650001301291650001201304650003001316650002001346650003801366650002801404650001101432650003301443650004001476653001201516653001601528700001901544700001601563700002201579773012201601852000901723856006901732930003301801946001101834655001201845IND4389666420221120202535.0070325e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438966642DNAL7 a171871762pmid7 a10.1007/s00018-006-5592-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColson, N.

There is evidence for a role of genetic factors in migraine, and elucidating the genetic basis of this disabling condition remains the focus of much research. In this review we discuss results of genetic studies to date, from the discovery of the role of neural ion channel gene mutations in familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) to linkage analyses and candidate gene studies in the more common forms of migraine. The success of FHM regarding discovery of genetic defects associated with the disorder remains elusive in common migraine, and causative genes have not yet been identified. Thus we suggest additional approaches for analysing the genetic basis of this disorder. The continuing search for migraine genes may aid in a greater understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the disorder and potentially lead to significant diagnostic and therapeutic applications. 3agenes 3agenetic disorders 3aion channels 3amigraine 3amutation 3asociety 2aBlood Vesselsxmetabolism 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenome, Humanxgenetics 2aHumans 2aMigraine Disordersxgenetics 2aNeurotransmitter Agentsxmetabolism 0alinkage 0aassociation1 aFernández, F.1 aLea, R.

The recently determined three-dimensional structures of the SET domains from chromosomal proteins reveal that the core SET domain structure contains a two-domain architecture, consisting of a conserved anti-parallel β-barrel and a structurally variable insert that surround a unusual knot-like structure that comprises the enzyme active site. These structures of the SET domains, either in the free state or when bound to cofactor S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and/or histone peptide, mimicking an enzyme/cofactor/substrate complex, further yield the structural insights into the molecular basis of the substrate specificity, methylation multiplicity and the catalytic mechanism of histone lysine methylation. 3aactive sites 3acatalytic activity 3aepigenetics 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene activation 3ahistones 3alysine 3amethylation 3amethyltransferases 3asubstrate specificity 0aSET domain 0ahistone lysine methylation 0astructure-function 0achromatin modifications1 aZhou, M. -M. 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2006 Dec., v. 63, no. 23 p.2755-2763dBasel : Birkhäuser-Verlagx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-006-6274-53electronic resource  a20070211b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02480naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245005200182300001600234520107600250650002401326650002301350650002001373650001901393650001201412650005501424650002001479650002001499650002501519650003401544650003201578653002401610653002301634653001901657653003701676653002101713653002901734700001501763773012201778852000901900856006901909930003301978946001102011655001202022IND4389666120221120185411.0070325e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438966612DNAL7 a171871752pmid7 a10.1007/s00018-006-6321-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamoto, H. 14aThe small heat shock proteins and their clients  ap. 294-306.  aSmall heat shock proteins are ubiquitous proteins found throughout all kingdoms. One of the most notable features is their large oligomeric structures with conserved structural organization. It is well documented that small heat shock proteins can capture unfolding proteins to form stable complexes and prevent their irreversible aggregation. In addition, small heat shock proteins coaggregate with aggregation-prone proteins for subsequent, efficient disaggregation of the protein aggregates. The release of substrate proteins from the transient reservoirs, i.e. complexes and aggregates with small heat shock proteins, and their refolding require cooperation with ATP-dependent chaperone systems. The amphitropic small heat shock proteins were shown to associate with membranes, although they do not contain transmembrane domains or signal sequences. Recent studies indicate that small heat shock proteins play an important role in membrane quality control and thereby potentially contribute to the maintenance of membrane integrity especially under stress conditions. 3aheat shock proteins 3aprotein aggregates 3aquality control 3asignal peptide 2aAnimals 2aHeat-Shock Proteins, Smallxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorylation 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Denaturation 2aProtein Structure, Quaternary 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 0aMolecular chaperone 0aheat shock protein 0ainclusion body 0anon-bilayer phase forming lipids 0aheat shock lipid 0amicrodomain organization1 aVígh, L. 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2007 Feb., v. 64, no. 3 p.294-306dBasel : Birkhäuser-Verlagx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-006-6321-23electronic resource  a20070325b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03123naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100001900174245009500193300001600288500002400304520102600328650001701354650003401371650002501405650001901430650002301449650002001472650004101492650001901533650002301552650002801575650001201603650002901615650001101644650004501655650002201700650001301722650005001735650001101785650004701796650006101843650006301904650004201967650001502009650003202024651001402056651002902070700001602099700001802115700001402133700001602147700001902163700001702182773009802199852000902297856008602306930003302392945002502425946001102450655001202461IND4407615720221120185512.0080711e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440761572DNAL7 a180374592pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2007.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aGonzalez, E.T.10aEvidence of bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) infection: Serological survey in Argentina  ap. 353-358.  aIncludes references  aThis is the first report of serological evidence for bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) infection in Argentina. The analysis was performed in 589 dairy bovine sera samples, applying indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (I-ELISA) using a synthetic antigen (transmembrane peptide, TM) and Immunofluorescent assay (IFA). In this study, 9 dairy herds from 4 Argentinian provinces were evaluated and 12% of the animals tested positive for BIV. Seven of the 9 herds tested were BIV seropositive and the percentage of BIV seropositive animals in the herds ranged from 2% to 42%. Direct detection of BIV provirus applying nested PCR was not conclusive. Antibody detection against bovine leukemia virus (BLV) in all sera was also performed applying immunodiffusion (ID) assay and 59% resulted seropositive. Statistical analysis of the results was carried out and possible evidence of association between BIV and BLV infection was considered. Future studies should be performed including local field isolates strains of BIV. 3adairy cattle 3aBovine immunodeficiency virus 3adisease surveillance 3aseroprevalence 3adisease prevalence 3acattle diseases 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3ablood sampling 3aantibody detection 3aepidemiological studies 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aDNA, Viralxblood 2aDairying 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aFemale 2aFluorescent Antibody Techniquexveterinary 2aImmunodeficiency Virus, Bovinexisolation & purification 2aLentivirus Infectionsxepidemiologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aPrevalence 2aSerologic Testsxveterinary 3aArgentina 0aArgentinaxepidemiology.1 aLicursi, M.1 aVila Roza, V.1 aBonzo, E.1 aMortola, E.1 aFrossard, J.P.1 aVenables, C.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2008 Oct., v. 85, no. 2 p.353-358dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2007.10.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20081001b20081011c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/09/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02833naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100001300197245007400210300001800284500002400302520073700326650001401063650002201077650002201099650003301121650003601154650002101190650002301211650002201234650002001256650001801276650002701294650003701321650002201358650002701380650005501407650003801462650003601500650005701536650002401593650002001617651001001637651001001647653002301657653003201680653001801712700001701730700001501747700001301762700001601775700001801791700001501809700001401824700001301838700001301851773009001864852000901954856009101963930003302054945002502087946001102112655001202123IND4407617320221120175154.0080711e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440761732DNAL7 a182342502pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2007.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF300 0aF2001 aTori, M.10aChemical and genetic diversity of Ligularia vellerea in Yunnan, China  ap. 1158-1165.  aIncludes references  aIntra-specific diversity in Liularia vellerea growing in the northwestern to central Yunnan province of China was studied by chemical and genetic approaches.

II. Urinary eicosanoids and sodium, and blood pressure  ap. 322-326.  aDietary fatty acid composition is known to affect various aspects of eicosanoid metabolism. This research was conducted to evaluate effects of a diet similar to the US average consumption in 1974 (40 en% fat, polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio, P/S = 0.3) or a diet modified to contain 30 en% fat, P/S = 1.0, on eicosanoid metabolism in young women. Following a period on self-selected diets, women in Nebraska and Iowa were fed the diets for 28-day periods in a crossover design. Urinary eicosanoids, sodium (Na) excretion, and blood pressure were determined. Diet effects were confounded by carryover effects. For urinary eicosanoids the sequence of higher saturated fat (SFA) followed by lower SFA resulted in significantly greater excretion, whereas the reverse order of diets did not cause significant changes. Diastolic blood pressure was not affected by diet, but systolic pressure was lower with the modified diet in the lower to higher-SFA sequence. The change from self-selected to experimental diets does not seem to account for the carryover effects. The interpretation is that linoleate is depleted from tissues more slowly than it is repleted. Effects upon Na excretion were related to SFA more than to linoleate in the diet. 3adiet 3ablood pressure 3aeicosanoids 3alipid metabolism 3asodium 3asaturated fatty acids 3awomen 2aAdult 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBlood Pressure 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aEicosanoidsxurine 2aFatty Acidsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aNutritive Value 2aProstaglandinsxurine 2aSodiumxurine 2aThromboxane B2xurine 0aurine analysis1 aGarcia, P.A.1 aKies, C.1 aDupont, J.0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g1991 Aug., v. 10, no. 4 p.322-326x0731-57247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02742naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245005000164300001800214520139400232650002201626650002501648650001301673650001601686650002501702650001101727650001201738650001301750650001201763650001501775650004401790650001301834650001101847653002601858653004101884653001201925653002701937653001301964653002901977700001902006773012502025852000902150856006902159930003302228946001102261655001202272IND4387756220221120175323.0070211e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438775622DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-006-6246-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachovič, M. 10aStarch-binding domains in the post-genome era  ap. 2710-2724.  aStarch belongs to the most abundant biopolymers on Earth. As a source of energy, starch is degraded by a large number of various amylolytic enzymes. However, only about 10% of them are capable of binding and degrading raw starch. These enzymes usually possess a distinct sequence-structural module, the so-called starchbinding domain (SBD). In general, all carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) have been classified into the CBM families. In this sequence-based classification the individual types of SBDs have been placed into seven CBM families: CBM20, CBM21, CBM25, CBM26, CBM34, CBM41 and CBM45. The family CBM20, known also as a classical C-terminal SBD of microbial amylases, is the most thoroughly studied. The three-dimensional structures have already been determined by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance for SBDs from five CBM families (20, 25, 26, 34 and 41), and the structure of the CBM21 has been modelled. Despite differences among the amino acid sequences, the fold of a distorted β-barrel seems to be conserved together with a similar way of substrate binding (mainly stacking interactions between aromatic residues and glucose rings). SBDs have recently been discovered in many non-amylolytic proteins. These may, for example, have regulatory functions in starch metabolism in plants or glycogen metabolism in mammals. SBDs have also found practical uses. 3aX-ray diffraction 3aamino acid sequences 3aamylases 3abiopolymers 3acarbohydrate binding 3aenergy 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3amammals 3ametabolism 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aproteins 3astarch 0aStarch-binding domain 0acarbohydrate-binding module families 0aamylase 0araw starch degradation 0aCBM clan 0aevolutionary relatedness1 aJaneček, Š. 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2006 Dec., v. 63, no. 23 p.2710-2724dBasel : Birkhäuser-Verlagx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-006-6246-93electronic resource  a20070211b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02877naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245010100165300001400266520137400280650002601654650001801680650001501698650002501713650001101738650001101749650001901760650001301779650001401792650001101806650002101817650001001838650001601848650001301864650001601877650001401893650001701907700003401924700001701958700003301975700002102008700001702029700002702046700001502073700001502088773010202103852000902205856008902214939003302303946001102336655001202347IND4478760220221120175407.0140321e20031115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447876022DNAL7 a10.1016/S0165-2427(03)00158-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaber, J.R.10aCross-reactivity of human and bovine antibodies in striped dolphin paraffin wax-embedded tissues  ap. 65-72.  aThis study evaluates the cross-reactivity of seven anti-human and one anti-bovine antibodies in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of liver and mesenteric lymph nodes of 13 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba). Four antibodies (CD3, IgG, lysozyme and S100 protein) reacted with striped dolphin lymph nodes in a similar pattern to that observed in the species of origin. The anti-human MHC class II mAb reacted strongly with macrophages and dendritic-like cells of striped dolphins, whereas a small number of lymphocytes were labelled with this antibody. These antibodies were used to study the immunophenotype of the inflammatory infiltrated in non-specific chronic reactive hepatitis (eight cases) and chronic parasite cholangitis (two cases) and normal liver (three cases) of striped dolphins. Non-specific chronic reactive hepatitis was composed of inflammatory infiltration of CD3+ T lymphocytes and IgG+ plasma cells in portal spaces and hepatic sinusoids. Lymphonodular aggregates observed in chronic parasitic cholangitis showed a cellular distribution similar to that found in lymph node cortex, including the presence of S100+ and MHC class II+ dendritic-like cells in lymphoid follicles and interfollicular areas. This result suggests that those inflammatory infiltrates are highly organised to enhance antigen presentation to B and T cells. 3aStenella coeruleoalba 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantibodies 3aantigen presentation 3acattle 3acortex 3across reaction 3adolphins 3ahepatitis 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aliver 3alymph nodes 3alysozyme 3amacrophages 3aparasites 3aplasma cells1 aMartínez Fernández, Ángel.1 aHerráez, P.1 aMonteros, A.

These individuals comprise 16 males, 10 females, and one for which no sex information is available. The diet was found to include fish and crustaceans, but is comprised primarily of cephalopods, with 0-526 lower beaks, representing an estimated maximum of c. 60 kg of cephalopod prey consumed by any one whale. Cephalopod prey is attributed to 23 species from 13 families, and is dominated by juvenile individuals of the families Histioteuthididae and Cranchiidae (adults of which usually occur at depths exceeding 400 m). Perceived threats to this whale, particularly those affecting distribution and abundance of prey species, are also discussed. These are the first data reporting the diet of this whale species in New Zealand waters. A comparison of the diet of K. breviceps is made with that of the sperm whale, Physeter macrocephalus from New Zealand waters, and with the diet of Kogia known elsewhere. 3aCranchiidae 3aPhyseter macrocephalus 3aadults 3abeaches 3adiet 3afemales 3afish 3ajuveniles 3amales 3astomach 3awhales 3aNew Zealand 0aPygmy sperm whale 0aKogia 0aStrandings0 tReviews in fish biology and fisheries.g2007 Aug., v. 17, no. 2-3 p.295-303dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0960-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-007-9039-93Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070530b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02634naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010800127300001600235300002100251500002300272500001500295520155900310650002301869650002401892650002201916650001101938650002501949650001301974650002701987650002502014653002002039653002302059653002502082653002202107773006602129852000902195939003302204946001102237655001202248IND9103415820221120145329.0910830e199102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910341582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, F.N.10aLinear mitochondrial molecules and intraspecific mitochondrial genome stability in a species of Pythium  ap. 156-162.  ap. 156-162. ill.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aRestriction maps of the mitochondrial genomes of 11 isolates of Pythium oligandrum revealed sizes ranging from 69.8 to 72.7 kb. While most isolates had circular genomes, two isolates contained predominantly linear molecules with the position of the ends corresponding to the small unique region of the circular molecules. The termini of these molecules were resistant to Exo III and lambda exonuclease digestion and had hairpin loop structures. Several isolates with circular genomes also appeared to contain what may be a small percentage of linear molecules. The inverted repeat and large unique region were 28.6 and 11.5 kb, respectively, and were equal in size among isolates. The small unique region was the most variable portion of the genome and ranged from 0.98 to 3.92 kb in size. Polymorphisms among isolates were due mainly to insertions-deletions in the small unique region, which not only contributed to size differences but also generated additional unique restriction sites. The only variation detected in the inverted repeat or the large unique region was the addition-loss of several restriction sites in four isolates. Less sequence divergence was observed in the inverted repeat than in the large unique region (maximum of 0.83 compared with 2.50%, respectively). Percent sequence divergence for the entire genome (excluding one arm of the inverted repeat) ranged from 0 to 1.00%. Excluding differences caused by insertions-deletions in the small unique region, 94% or greater of the restriction sites are conserved among all isolates. 3aPythium oligandrum 3arestriction mapping 3amitochondrial DNA 3agenome 3arepetitive sequences 3agenomics 3amolecular conformation 3agenetic polymorphism 0ainverted repeat 0ageographical races 0anucleotide sequences 0arestriction sites0 tGenome =.g1991 Feb., v. 34, no. 1 p.156-162x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03439naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001700160245004300177300001600220520214700236650001202383650001802395650002602413650001002439650002102449650001202470650002202482650001002504650002102514650002002535650001602555650001202571650001502583650001002598650001102608650001202619650001502631650002002646650001102666651001102677653002202688773009202710852000902802856010002811939003302911946001302944655001202957IND9304262620221120125442.0930721e193803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930426262DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1938.00021962003000030009x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAldous, A.E.10aManagement of Kansas bluestem pastures  ap. 244-253.  aThe Kansas bluestem region has been gradually decreasing in carrying capacity, the decrease being most pronounced after extremely dry seasons. To obtain information on methods of grazing management that could be used to maintain the grazing value of this large acreage of grazing land, the Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station initiated grazing experiments in 1916. The earlier experiments of deferring grazing until after seed was mature resulted in a great waste of forage owing to the grasses being tough and unpalatable after they have completed their growth. After four years, the grazing was deferred only until about June 15 when the forage was palatable and nutritious. This period of protection every two or three years was believed to be sufficient to maintain the normal stand and vigor of vegetation. The results of the deferred system of grazing gave an increase of approximately 25% in carrying capacity and 33% increase in the gains in pounds of livestock per acre over that obtained in the pastures grazed the season long. The desirable forage species were maintained equally as well in the deferred as in the pasture grazed the season long. The crude protein and the mineral content of the bluestem grasses are high enough in their leafy stages of growth to provide adequately for the nutritional requirements of the livestock as well as to provide satisfactory gains in weight. Clipping experiments showed the yield of the tops and roots to be inversely proportional to the frequency of clipping. The density of the desirable grasses and their food reserves were approximately in the same proportion. The study indicates that a deferred system of grazing may be used to obtain the highest use of the bluestem pastures with the minimum amount of injury. The application of this system requires the additional fencing or the use of tillable land to grow supplemental pasture crops to provide forage for livestock during the early part of the grazing season when the grazing is deferred. The latter is not practical in a major part of the area because of the very small percentage of tillable land available for this purpose. 3aPoaceae 3aplant density 3aecological succession 3aweeds 3arange management 3agrazing 3acarrying capacity 3aCarex 3anutrient content 3aprotein content 3acrude fiber 3acutting 3acrop yield 3aroots 3astarch 3acalcium 3aphosphorus 3amineral content 3asugars 3aKansas 0acutting frequency0 tAgronomy journal.g1938 Mar., v. 30, no. 3 p.244-253wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1938.00021962003000030009x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02620naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245008900171300001600260520126900276650001101545650001601556650001201572650000901584650002201593650001301615650001401628650001001642650002301652650002201675650002001697650001001717651001601727651001301743653002101756653002101777653001901798653001501817700002201832700002001854773013701874852000902011856008602020930003302106946001102139655001202150IND4391961020221120125506.0070529e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439196102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11160-006-9033-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNatinee Sukramongkol.10aAge and maturation of Loligo duvauceli and L. chinensis from Andaman Sea of Thailand  ap. 237-246.  aEstimated age, hatching date and sexual maturation were investigated for the loliginid squids Loligo duvauceli and L. chinensis, the commercially important neritic species in the Andaman Sea of Thailand.

The length-weight relationships differed among sexes and the sexual dimorphism was expressed as mature females having a greater body weight than males of the same length. Males showed a wide range of maturity size possibly because of the seasonal change in size at maturity. The results of the back calculation for the hatching date of individuals fell between November 2004 and June 2005 which suggests that L. duvauceli and L. chinensis hatch continuously and recruit to the fishing ground for a relatively short period with a shorter lifespan than expected. 3aLoligo 3abody weight 3afemales 3afish 3afishery resources 3ahatching 3alongevity 3amales 3aseasonal variation 3asexual dimorphism 3asexual maturity 3asquid 3aAndaman Sea 3aThailand 0aLoligo duvauceli 0aLoligo chinensis 0aHatching dates 0aMaturation1 aTsuchiya, Kotaro 1 aSegawa, Susumu 0 tReviews in fish biology and fisheries.g2007 Aug., v. 17, no. 2-3 p.237-246dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0960-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-006-9033-73Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070530b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03076naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245013100146300001600277520151700293650001001810650002201820650001701842650001901859650002101878650003901899650001301938650004601951650005601997650001202053650002002065650003202085650001102117650001302128650005702141650002602198650004702224650003502271650001402306650003002320650002902350653002002379653002002399653001302419773008302432852000902515939003302524946001302557655001202570IND9202335720221120125505.0920421e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920233572DNAL7 a13747502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHausman, G.J.10aResponsiveness to adipogenic agents in stromal-vascular cultures derived from lean and preobese pig fetuses: an ontogeny study  ap. 106-114.  aPrimary cultures of stromal-vascular (S-V) cells from adipose tissue were used to evaluate characteristics of preadipocytes from lean and preobese fetuses at several ages (50, 75, and 110 d). In insulin-supplemented (1 micromole) cultures (serum free) there was a significant age X fetal genotype interaction (P < .01) for glycerol-phosphate dehydrogenase specific activity (GPDH); GPDH activity was genotype-dependent at 110 d (preobese > lean). The responses of S-V cultures (preadipocyte development) to 2% pig serum and to insulin (serum free) were similar. Main effects of genotype and age were significant (P < .05) for protein levels in pig serum and insulin-treated cultures. There was a significant genotype X age (P < .05) interaction for GPDH activity and protein levels in cultures treated with dexamethasone + 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (DEX-IBMX). Treatment with DEX-IBMX induced more preadipocyte development in cultures from preobese fetuses than in cultures from lean fetuses at 110 d (P < .05). The responsiveness of S-V cultures to DEX-IBMX (enhanced development) increased considerably between 50 and 75 d regardless of fetal genotype, but there was little response in cultures from 50-d fetuses. Preadipocyte development in lean and preobese fetuses diverged between 75 and 110 d, resulting in many more preadipocytes in preobese fetuses at 110 d. Therefore, S-V cells from preobese fetuses (late term) may be inherently more sensitive to adipogenic agents than S-V cells from lean fetuses. 3aswine 3afetal development 3acell culture 3aadipose tissue 3aline differences 3aglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ahormones 2a1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthinexpharmacology 2aAdipose Tissuexcytologyxdrug effectsxembryology. 2aAnimals 2aCells, Cultured 2aDexamethasonexpharmacology 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aGlycerolphosphate Dehydrogenasexanalysisxgenetics. 2aInsulinxpharmacology 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixpharmacology 2aObesityxgeneticsxveterinary. 2aPregnancy 2aSwinexbloodxembryology. 2aSwine Diseasesxgenetics 0adifferentiation 0aage differences 0aleanness0 tJournal of animal science.g1992 Jan., v. 70, no. 1 p.106-114x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02178naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245006100132300001600193500001500209520094900224650001601173650001301189650002301202650001601225650001801241650001801259650001001277650001301287650000901300650002301309650001501332650001501347650001701362650001901379650003201398650001801430651001201448653002001460653002601480700001701506700001801523773009201541852000901633939003301642945000801675946001301683655001201696991607815890742620221120125600.0910916e199107  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910026752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJensen, C.A.10aIron supplementation and iron status in exercising women  ap. 368-373.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of moderate aerobic exercise training and iron supplementation on iron status was studied in college-age women. Thirteen sedentary women, randomly assigned to a placebo group or an iron treatment group (50 mg iron/day as FeSO4), exercised at least three days per week at 70-80% of maximal heart rate for 12 weeks. Increases in maximal oxygen consumption in both groups indicated improved cardiovascular fitness. Venous blood samples were obtained for hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation, and ferritin determinations at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12. Analysis of covariance using initial baseline values as the covariate showed that ferritin levels between groups were significantly different (P < 0.01), suggesting compromised iron stores in association with moderate exercise. Iron supplementation was beneficial in maintaining or improving the iron stores of moderately exercising women. 3atransferrin 3aexercise 3anutritional status 3ablood serum 3aserum albumin 3aenergy intake 3awomen 3aferritin 3airon 3aoxygen consumption 3ahemoglobin 3ahematocrit 3ayoung adults 3aprotein intake 3adietary mineral supplements 3aascorbic acid 3aIndiana 0anutrient intake 0airon binding capacity1 aWeaver, C.M.1 aSadlock, D.A.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g1991 July, v. 2, no. 7 p.368-373x0955-28637nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02188naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100002400174245013300198300002000331500002400351520049200375650001600867650002700883650001500910650001600925650002700941650004400968650002101012650001701033650002501050650002801075650002001103650001701123650004501140650000901185653004801194653003001242700002101272700002001293700002401313773017601337852000901513856007701522930003301599945002501632946001301657655001201670IND4436870020221120125430.0100511e20100428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443687002DNAL7 a203698062pmid7 a10.1021/jf904442d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ125 0aQ5051 aLopez-Rituerto, Eva10aEvidence of Metabolic Transformations of Amino Acids into Higher Alcohols through 13C NMR Studies of Wine Alcoholic Fermentation  ap. 4923–4927.  aIncludes references  aBecause the metabolite transformations in wine fermentation processes play a crucial role in the organoleptic and hygienic quality of wines, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique is presented as a significant tool to follow metabolic pathways.

Conventional PPEs capable of filtering nanoparticles <300 nm are typically bulky and sacrifice breathability to maximize protection from exposure to harmful nanoparticulate aerosols including viruses ∼20–300 nm from air streams. Here, we show that nanopores introduced into centimeter-scale monolayer graphene supported on polycarbonate track-etched supports via a facile oxygen plasma etch can allow for filtration of aerosolized SiO₂ nanoparticles of ∼5–20 nm from air steams while maintaining air permeance of ∼2.28–7.1 × 10–⁵ mol m–² s–¹ Pa–¹. Furthermore, a systematic increase in oxygen plasma etch time allows for a tunable size-selective filtration of aerosolized nanoparticles. We demonstrate a new route to realize ultra-compact, lightweight, and conformal form-factor filters capable of blocking sub-20 nm aerosolized nanoparticles with particular relevance for biological/viral threat mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data  a1944134cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  aNAcVanderbilt Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006537  aNAcIntellectual Venturesdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aair 3abiomedical research 3aequipment 3afiltration 3agraphene 3ahealth services 3alaw enforcement 3ananoparticles 3ananopores 3aoxygen 0afiltering nanoscale aerosols 0agraphene membranes 0avirus filtration 0ananoporous atomically thin membranes 0apersonal protective equipment1 aEspano, Jeremy1 aHarkaway, Andrew1 aNaclerio, Andrew E.1 aMoehring, Nicole K.1 aBraeuninger-Weimer, Philipp1 aKidambi, Piran R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1546-50140 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Aug. 29, v. 14, no. 36 p.41328-41336dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c108273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01179naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010900168300001600277520038200293592002800675650000900703650001400712650001400726773009500740856008100835852000900916655001200925IND60440052820221118042524.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044005282DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078150501032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartynova, M.

Experiments on isolated ions are useful to establish a proper reference when there are no microenvironmental perturbations. Here, we use action spectroscopy to compare the absorption by the firefly oxyluciferin lumophore isolated in vacuo and complexed with a single water molecule. While the process relevant to bioluminescence within the luciferase cavity is light emission, the absorption data presented here provide a unique insight into how the electronic states of oxyluciferin are altered by microenvironmental perturbations. For the bare ion we observe broad absorption with a maximum at 548 ± 10 nm, and addition of a water molecule is found to blue-shift the absorption by approximately 50 nm (0.23 eV). Test calculations at various levels of theory uniformly predict a blue-shift in absorption caused by a single water molecule, but are only qualitatively in agreement with experiment highlighting limitations in what can be expected from methods commonly used in studies on oxyluciferin. Combined molecular dynamics simulations and time-dependent density functional theory calculations closely reproduce the broad experimental peaks and also indicate that the preferred binding site for the water molecule is the phenolate oxygen of the anion. Predicting the effects of microenvironmental interactions on the electronic structure of the oxyluciferin anion with high accuracy is a nontrivial task for theory, and our experimental results therefore serve as important benchmarks for future calculations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLampyridae 3aabsorption 3aanions 3abinding sites 3abioluminescence 3acolor 3aluciferase 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3aspectroscopy1 aHansen, Christian Nygaard1 aHoumøller, Jørgen1 aNielsen, Lisbeth Munksgaard1 aAnggara, Kelvin1 aLinares, Mathieu1 aNorman, Patrick1 aNogueira, Fernando1 aMaltsev, Oleg V.1 aHintermann, Lukas1 aNielsen, Steen Brøndsted1 aNaumov, Panče1 aMilne, Bruce F.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 May 01, v. 135, no. 17 p.6485-6493dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja311400t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245016200168300001200330500001100342520226100353592002802614650002402642650002102666650002202687650001202709650001802721650002302739650002202762700003302784700005802817773011302875856008302988852000903071655001203080IND60740680620221117230207.0220502e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074068062DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-021-04797-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHawadak, Joseph10aGlobal trend of Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale spp. malaria infections in the last two decades (2000–2020): a systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 297.  aReview  aBACKGROUND: Recent studies indicate that the prevalence of non-falciparum malaria, including Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale spp., is increasing, with some complications in infected individuals. The aim of this review is to provide a better understanding of the malaria prevalence and disease burden due to P. malariae and P. ovale spp. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the Joanna Briggs Institute prevalence study assessment tool were used to select and evaluate the studies, respectively. Six databases: PubMed, WHOLIS, Wiley Library, ScienceDirect, Web of Science and Google Scholar were used to screen articles published during the period January 2000–December 2020. The pooled prevalence estimates for P. malariae and P. ovale spp. were analysed using a random-effects model and the possible sources of heterogeneity were evaluated through subgroup analysis and meta-regression. RESULTS: Out of the 3297 studies screened, only 113 studies were included; among which 51.33% were from the African Region. The P. malariae and P. ovale spp. pooled prevalence were 2.01% (95% CI 1.31–2.85%) and 0.77% (95% CI 0.50–1.10%) respectively, with the highest prevalence in the African Region. P. malariae was equally distributed among adults (2.13%), children (2.90%) and pregnant women (2.77%) (p = 0.862), whereas P. ovale spp. was more prevalent in pregnant women (2.90%) than in children ≤ 15 years (0.97%) and in patients > 15 years old (0.39%) (p = 0.021). In this review, data analysis revealed that P. malariae and P. ovale spp. have decreased in the last 20 years, but not significantly, and these species were more commonly present with other Plasmodium species as co-infections. No difference in prevalence between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was observed for either P. malariae or P. ovale spp. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that knowledge of the worldwide burden of P. malariae and P. ovale spp. is very important for malaria elimination programmes and a particular focus towards improved tools for monitoring transmission for these non-falciparum species should be stressed upon to deal with increased infections in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium malariae 3aPlasmodium ovale 3aburden of disease 3amalaria 3ameta-analysis 3astatistical models 3asystematic review1 aDongang Nana, Rodrigue Roman1 aSingh, Vineeta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0113-73940 tParasites & vectors.g2021 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.297-297dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04797-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011800159300001600277520129800293592002801591650001701619650001401636700002101650773013101671856007401802852000901876655001201885IND60661338220221121015433.0190829e20111205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066133822DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cs15031f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaggini, Laura10aHierarchised luminescent organic architectures: design, synthesis, self-assembly, self-organisation and functions  ap. 211-241.  aThis critical review aims at highlighting the prevailing supramolecular approaches employed nowadays in the preparation of luminescent hierarchised materials. Specifically, it has the ambition to illustrate how progresses in the control of the supramolecular interaction toolbox ultimately led to the development of spectacular luminescent nano- and micro-architectures, through a combination of molecular self-assembly and self-organisation processes involving organic π-conjugated molecules. The reader will be guided through a systematic exploration of the most common avenues to prepare and characterise luminescent self-assembled/self-organised materials embedded into one-, two- or three-dimensional networks, accompanied by a critical discussion of their main advantages and limitations. Key representative examples of this research field will be thoroughly described, with a particular focus on those systems displaying potential on the device application scene. Particular attention will be devoted to the design and synthetic approaches aimed at the preparation of the primary π-conjugated molecular modules, the chemical, structural and electronic properties of which dramatically influence the fate and the features of the self-assembled/self-organised material (215 references).  aPublisher supplied data 3aluminescence 3asynthesis1 aBonifazi, Davide0 tChemical Society reviews.g2011 Dec. 5, v. 41, no. 1 p.211-241dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cs15031f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245007000161300001800231520089800249592002801147650000801175650003201183650002301215650001301238650001601251700002401267700002101291773013101312856007501443852000901518655001201527IND60538825320170628000000.0160815e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053882532DNAL7 a10.1021/ja311434s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGahlon, Hailey
L.10aTolerance of Base Pair Size and Shape in Postlesion DNA Synthesis  ap. 6384-6387.  aThe influence of base pair size and shape on the fidelity of DNA polymerase-mediated extension past lesion-containing mispairs was examined. Primer extension analysis was performed with synthetic nucleosides paired opposite the pro-mutagenic DNA lesion O⁶-benzylguanine (O⁶-BnG). These data indicate that the error-prone DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4) inefficiently extended past the larger Peri:O⁶-BnG base pair, and in contrast, error-free extension was observed for the smaller BIM:O⁶-BnG base pair. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed that Dpo4 catalytic efficiency was strongly influenced by the primer:template base pair. Compared to the C:G pair, a 1.9- and 79 000-fold reduction in Dpo4 efficiency was observed for terminal C:O⁶-BnG and BIM:G base pairs respectively. These results demonstrate the impact of geometrical size and shape on polymerase-mediated mispair extension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3acatalytic activity 3akinetics 3anucleosides1 aSchweizer, W.

However, when host traits and coinfecting parasites are considered separately, relations between either and parasitism by focal species can be spurious—a problem that is addressed when both are considered together. We assessed whether abundances of focal parasites related to host age/sex and coinfecting parasites for three endoparasites and nine ectoparasites of Icelandic Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) collected over 12 yr (2006–2017), and quantified the variation in focal parasitism explained by these predictors. Host traits and coinfecting parasites explained significant variation in abundance of all nine focal parasite species for which models converged, when those models were based on groups of parasites sharing tissue tropism and/or transmission pathways and included year as a random effect. We found a single spurious relation: a host age–sex interaction effect that was removed once concurrent parasitism was considered. When considering focal parasites within groups of coinfecting parasites, we found cases of positive, negative, and lacks of correlations. The amount of variation in focal parasite abundance explained by host traits versus coinfecting parasites depended on the focal parasite and its group. Overall variation explained was both related to the prevalence of the focal parasite, possibly due to underlying parasite aggregation, and similar to variation explained in other models in ecology and evolution. We conclude that host traits and coinfecting parasites often combine to determine infection by focal species. Future studies should also explore the mechanisms underlying parasite–parasite relations and their potential impacts on host demography for this and other study associations, and assess relative effects of host traits and coinfecting parasites on focal parasitism.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Iceland Research Fund  cIcelandic Institute of Natural History  a100118cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  a090207021cIcelandic Research Fund  cHunting Card Fund  cLandsvirkjun Energy Fund 3aLagopus muta 3ademography 3aectoparasites 3aendoparasites 3aevolution 3amixed infection 3aparasitism 3aparasitology 3atissue tropism1 aNielsen, Ó.

KaiA stimulates the KaiC autokinase, and KaiB antagonizes KaiA action. KaiA contacts the intrinsically disordered C-terminal regions of KaiC hexamer to promote phosphorylation across subunit interfaces. The crystal structure of KaiA dimer from Synechococcus elongatus with two KaiC C-terminal 20mer peptides bound reveals that the latter adopt an α-helical conformation and contact KaiA α-helical bundles via mostly hydrophobic interactions. This complex and the crystal structure of KaiC hexamer with truncated C-terminal tails can be fit into the electron microscopy (EM) density of the KaiA:KaiC complex. The hybrid model helps rationalize clock phenotypes of KaiA and KaiC mutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSynechococcus elongatus 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acircadian rhythm 3acrystal structure 3aelectron microscopy 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amodels 3amutants 3apeptides 3aphenotype 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins1 aEgli, Martin0 tBiochemistry.g2015 Aug. 04, v. 54, no. 30 p.4575-4578dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.5b006943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04046naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245014100209300001100350506007600361520207900437592002802516596003802544506003702582650001602619650002002635650002402655650001602679650001602695650001102711650001802722650002002740650002302760650001202783650001802795650000902813650002702822650003202849650002102881650001202902650001902914650001402933650001702947650003902964650002203003650001603025650002303041650002403064650001403088650001403102700002003116700002103136700002503157700001603182773011903198856008203317852000903399655001203408IND60585582320221207074218.0180911e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058558232DNAL7 a10.1186/s13028-017-0347-32doi7 aPMC56807702pmcid7 a291219732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajeed, Muhammad10aIn vitro investigations on extracellular proteins secreted by Aphanomyces invadans, the causative agent of epizootic ulcerative syndrome  ap. 78.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Proteases produced by many microorganisms, including oomycetes, are crucial for their growth and development. They may also play a critical role in disease manifestation. Epizootic ulcerative syndrome is one of the most destructive fish diseases known. It is caused by the oomycete Aphanomyces invadans and leads to mass mortalities of cultured and wild fish in many countries. The areas of concern are Australia, China, Japan, South and Southeast Asian countries and the USA. Extracellular proteases produced by this oomycete are believed to trigger EUS pathogenesis in fish. To address this activity, we collected the extracellular products (ECP) of A. invadans and identified the secreted proteins using SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometery. A. invadans was cultivated in liquid Glucose-Peptone-Yeats media. The culture media was ultra-filtered through 10 kDa filters and analysed using SDS-PAGE. Three prominent protein bands from the SDS gel were excised and identified by mass spectrometery. Furthermore, we assessed their proteolytic effect on casein and immunoglobulin M (IgM) of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and giant gourami (Osphronemus goramy). Antiprotease activity of the fish serum was also investigated. RESULTS: BLASTp analysis revealed that the prominent secreted proteins were proteases, mainly of the serine and cysteine types. Proteins containing fascin-like domain and bromodomain were also identified. We could demonstrate that the secreted proteases showed proteolytic activity against the casein and the IgM of both fish species. The anti-protease activity experiment showed that the percent inhibition of the common carp serum was 94.2% while that of rainbow trout and giant gourami serum was 7.7 and 12.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The identified proteases, especially serine proteases, could be the potential virulence factors in A. invadans and, hence, are candidates for further functional and host–pathogen interaction studies. The role of identified structural proteins in A. invadans also needs to be investigated further.  aPublisher supplied data  aP29294-B25cAustrian Science Fund0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAphanomyces 3aCyprinus carpio 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aOsphronemus 3ablood serum 3acasein 3aculture media 3aenzyme activity 3aepizootic diseases 3afilters 3afish diseases 3agels 3agrowth and development 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aliquids 3amicroorganisms 3amortality 3apathogenesis 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein secretion 3aproteolysis 3aserine proteinases 3astructural proteins 3avirulence 3awild fish1 aKumar, Gokhlesh1 aSchlosser, Sarah1 aEl-Matbouli, Mansour1 aSaleh, Mona0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2017 Dec., v. 59, no. 1 p.78-78dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl16962x1751-01477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13028-017-0347-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03731naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245009500217300001800312520168800330592002802018650002202046650002002068650001102088650001302099650001102112650002502123650001302148650001902161650001302180650002102193650001102214650001602225650001102241653002102252653002902273653000902302653003002311653001002341700003202351700001802383700005802401700001802459700002302477700002502500700006702525700002002592700005702612700001902669700002202688700005602710700006002766700006602826773014302892856008503035852000903120655001203129IND60608193820181025000000.0180807e20180716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060819382DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b007772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDichiarante, Valentina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2977-583312aA Short-Chain Multibranched Perfluoroalkyl Thiol for More Sustainable Hydrophobic Coatings  ap. 9734-9743.  aPerfluorocarbons (PFCs) have proven to be very efficient in building up omniphobic surfaces because of the peculiar properties of fluorine atoms. However, due to their environmental impact and bioaccumulative potential, perfluorinated surfactants with chains longer than six carbon atoms have been banned, and other alternatives had to be found. Herein, we demonstrate the possibility to build omniphobic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) using a multibranched fluorinated thiol (BRFT) bearing ultrashort fluorinated alkyl groups, surrounding a hydrocarbon polar core. This unique design allows us to multiply the number of fluorine atoms in the molecule (27 F atoms per molecule), affording a high fluorine density on the surface and a low surface free energy. Moreover, the presence of four ether bonds in the core may hasten molecular degradation in the environment because of the cleavage of such bonds in physiological conditions, thus overcoming bioaccumulation issues. BRFT may effectively represent a valuable substitute of long-chain perfluoroalkyl thiols. In fact, BRFT SAMs show the same hydrophobic and oleophobic performances of standard linear perfluoroalkyl thiols (such as 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol, PFDT), giving rise to more stable surfaces with a better frictional behavior. Superhydrophobicity was also observed with SAMs grown on nanostructured Cu/Ag surfaces. Our results have proven the ability of short-chain multibranched fluorous molecules to behave as suitable replacements for long-chain perfluoroalkanes in the field of surface coatings. Our molecules may be applied to various surfaces because of the available multiple choice of linker chemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3abioaccumulation 3acarbon 3acoatings 3acopper 3aenvironmental impact 3afluorine 3ahydrophobicity 3amoieties 3aperfluorocarbons 3asilver 3asurfactants 3athiols 0aPerfluorocarbons 0aSelf-assembled monolayer 0aGold 0aSuperhydrophobic surfaces 0aThiol1 aMartinez Espinoza, Maria I.1 aGazzera, Lara1 aVuckovac, Maja1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5895-76121 aLatikka, Mika1 aCavallo, Gabriella1 aRaffaini, Giuseppina1 aOropesa-Nuñez, Reinier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9551-65651 aCanale, Claudio1 aDante, Silvia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6906-84821 aMarras, Sergio1 aCarzino, Riccardo1 aPrato, Mirko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2188-80591 aRas, Robin H.

Yet, it remains unclear how and which plant traits regulate the assembly process and thus affect ecosystem structure and function under climate changes. Here, we selected six steppe sites with snow fences along a precipitation gradient in inner Mongolia. We measured traits including plant height and leaf carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations. We incorporated intraspecific trait variation to quantify the strength of external filters (assembly processes outside the community at a larger spatial scale), the strength of internal filters (assembly processes within the local community), and functional redundancy (the number of species having a similar function to an ecosystem). We applied these assembly rules to explain the changes in biodiversity and productivity in response to changing precipitation. We found that increased rainfall reduced plant carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorous (P) concentrations, but did not affect plant height. High snowfall increased phosphorous concentration, but did not affect other traits. Latent variable models identified climate (rainfall) and soil nutrient conditions (soil total N and P content) were more important than external filtering processes in predicting species richness. However, external filtering processes were the most important predictor of productivity. More specifically, we found with the increase in steppe productivity, the strength of the external filtering on leaf N increased and on plant height decreased, leading to leaf N converging into a small range but broadening the range of plant height. The internal filters had no significant effects on species richness or productivity. Additionally, we found that low precipitation reduced functional redundancy. We emphasize that intraspecific trait‐variation drives plant productivity and richness responses to precipitation changes by regulating community assemblage. Our finding also underlines the importance to separate the contributions of different functional traits in regulating the responses of ecosystem structure and function to climate changes.  aPublisher supplied data  a31700420cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a31670478cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a31988102cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019YFA0607302cthe Chinese National Key Development Program for Basic Research  a2017YFC0503900cthe Chinese National Key Development Program for Basic Research 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3aintraspecific variation 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aplant height 3arain 3asnow 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3aspecies richness 3asteppes 3atotal nitrogen 3aChina1 aLiu, Weixing1 aLi, Ping1 aJiang, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7114-07941 aLi, Shaopeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1730-34331 aJia, Zhou1 aYang, Sen1 aGuo, Lulu1 aWang, Zhenhua1 aLiu, Lingli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5696-31510 tEcosphere.g2021 Aug., v. 12, no. 8 p.e03707-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.37073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013000162300001600292520163800308592002801946650001801974650002101992650001402013650001502027650001302042650001302055651001002068653001302078653001402091700001402105700001902119700001802138700001902156700005402175773012202229856008202351852000902433655001202442IND60749091820221122200843.0220412e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074909182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2021.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Yalu10aMigration and transformation of Sb are affected by Mn(III/IV) associated with lepidocrocite originating from Fe(II) oxidation  ap. 308-318.  aAntimony (Sb) is a recognized priority pollutant with toxicity that is influenced by its migration and transformation processes. Oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) oxides, which is a common phenomenon in the environment, is often accompanied by the formation of Mn(III/IV) and might affect the fate of Sb. In this study, incorporated Mn(III) and sorbed/precipitated Mn(III/IV) associated with lepidocrocite were prepared by adding Mn(II) during and after Fe(II) oxidation, respectively, and the effects of these Mn species on Sb fate were investigated. Our results indicated that the association of these Mn species with lepidocrocite obviously enhanced Sb(III) oxidation to Sb(V), while concomitantly inhibiting Sb sorption due to the lower sorption capacity of lepidocrocite for Sb(V) than Sb(III). Additionally, Mn oxide equivalents increased in the presence of Sb, indicating that Sb oxidation by Mn(III/IV) associated with lepidocrocite was a continuous recycling process in which Mn(II) released from Mn(III/IV) reduction by Sb(III) could be oxidized to Mn(III/IV) again. This recycling process was favorable for effective Sb(III) oxidation. Moreover, Sb(V) generated from Sb(III) oxidation by Mn(III/IV) enhanced Mn(II) sorption at the beginning of the process, and thus favored Mn(III/IV) formation, which could further promote Sb(III) oxidation to Sb(V). Overall, this study elucidated the effects of Mn(III/IV) associated with lepidocrocite arisen from Fe(II) oxidation on Sb migration and transformation and revealed the underlying reaction mechanisms, contributing to a better understanding of the geochemical dynamics of Sb.  aPublisher supplied data 3alepidocrocite 3amanganese oxides 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3asorption 3atoxicity 3aChina 0aAntimony 0aManganese1 aSun, Qian1 aWang, Liangkai1 aZhan, Weiyong1 aZhang, Hongwei1 aZhong, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0565-50090 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2022 May, v. 115 p.308-318dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2021.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010300172300001600275520130000291592002801591650002301619650001501642650000901657650001401666650001801680650002001698650001501718650001601733650002501749700002301774700002301797773009501820856008101915852000901996655001202005IND60440053220221118042549.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044005322DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078150500852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHooshyaripor, Farhad10aEstimation of peak outflow in dam failure using neural network approach under uncertainty analysis  ap. 721-734.  aThis paper presents two Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based models for the prediction of peak outflow from breached embankment dams using two effective parameters including height and volume of water behind the dam at the time of failure. Estimation of optimal weights and biases in the training phase of the ANN is analysed by two different algorithms including Levenberg—Marquardt (LM) as a standard technique used to solve nonlinear least squares problems and Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) as a new evolutionary algorithm in the evolutionary computation field. Comparison of the obtained results with those of the conventional approach based on regression analysis shows a better performance of the ANN model trained with ICA. Investigation on the uncertainty band of the models indicated that LM predictions have the least uncertainty band whilst ICA’s have the lowest mean prediction error. More analysis on the models’ uncertainty is conducted by a Monte Carlo simulation in which 1000 randomly generated sets of input data are sampled from the database of historical dam failures. The result of 1000 ANN models which have been analysed with three statistical measures including p-factor, d-factor, and DDR confirms that LM predictions have more limited uncertainty band.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aalgorithms 3abias 3adatabases 3aleast squares 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis1 aTahershamsi, Ahmad1 aBehzadian, Kourosh0 tWater resources.g2015 Sept., v. 42, no. 5 p.721-734dPleiades Publishingx0097-80787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S00978078150500853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03647naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245008100162300001600243520216900259592002802428650001202456650003002468650001602498650002302514650002002537650001002557650001702567650001102584650003002595650001602625650001602641650004302657650002202700650001702722650001002739650001502749700001802764700001802782700001802800700002002818700001802838700001502856700002302871700002202894773013702916856007903053852000903132655001203141IND60114850620221117212949.0141124e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011485062DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.112.0493792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBode, Lisa M10aIn vivo and in vitro metabolism of trans-resveratrol by human gut microbiota  ap. 295-309.  aBackground: Strong interindividual differences in the microbial conversion of some dietary polyphenols have been reported. In-depth studies of trans-resveratrol metabolism by human gut microbiota, however, are lacking, and only one bacterial metabolite, namely dihydroresveratrol, has been described.Objective: The aim of this study was to elucidate interindividual differences in trans-resveratrol metabolism by human gut microbiota and to identify bacterial strains involved.Design: In the first part of the study, in vitro fermentation experiments were performed with feces samples from 7 healthy volunteers, and metabolite formation was measured by liquid chromatography–ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis)–mass spectrometry (MS)/MS detection. Microbial diversities in 3 feces samples were analyzed by high-throughput pyrosequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. In addition, trans-resveratrol conversion experiments were conducted with selected fecal bacterial strains in pure culture. The second part of the study was a controlled intervention study with 12 healthy volunteers. After a washout period, all of the subjects received a one-time oral dose of 0.5 mg trans-resveratrol/kg body weight in the form of a grapevine-shoot supplement, and 24-h urine samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography–UV/Vis–MS/MS.Results: Besides dihydroresveratrol, 2 previously unknown bacterial trans-resveratrol metabolites were identified in vitro and in vivo: 3,4′-dihydroxy-trans-stilbene and 3,4′-dihydroxybibenzyl (lunularin). Their formation, however, varied among the volunteers. Two strains, Slackia equolifaciens and Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, were identified as dihydroresveratrol producers. Gut bacteria able to produce dehydroxylated metabolites could, however, not be identified.Conclusions: trans-Resveratrol metabolism by human gut microbiota shows pronounced interindividual differences, which should be taken into account during investigation of health-related effects of this stilbene. This trial was registered at the German Clinical Trials Register as DRKS00004311, Universal Trial Number (WHO) UTN: U1111-1133–4621.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSlackia 3aWorld Health Organization 3abody weight 3aclinical nutrition 3aclinical trials 3afeces 3afermentation 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolites 3apolyphenols 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3aspectroscopy 3aurine 3avolunteers1 aBunzel, Diana1 aHuch, Melanie1 aCho, Gyu-Sung1 aRuhland, Denise1 aBunzel, Mirko1 aBub, Achim1 aFranz, Charles MAP1 aKulling, Sabine E0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2013 Feb., v. 97, no. 2 p.295-309dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.112.0493793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01968naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007600164300001300240520106100253592002801314650001701342650002201359650003201381650001901413650000901432650001901441650001801460651001101478773010801489856004801597852000901645655001201654IND50063282120221119132731.0130705e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006328212DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-013-1435-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmuno, S. A.10aPotential Ecological Risk of Heavy Metal Distribution in Cemetery Soils  ap. 1435.  aIn this paper, preliminary investigation was conducted to evaluate the potential ecological risk of heavy metals contamination in cemetery soils. Necrosol samples were collected from within and around the vicinity of the largest mass grave in Rwanda and analyzed for heavy metal concentrations using total digestion–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and instrumental neutron activation analysis. Based on the concentrations of As, Cu, Cr, Pb, and Zn, the overall contamination degree (C dₑg) and potential ecological risks status (RI) of the necrosols were determined. The preliminary results revealed that the associated cemetery soils are only contaminated to a low degree. On the other hand, assessment of the potential ecological risk index (RI) revealed that cumulative heavy metal content of the soil do not pose any significant ecological risks. These findings, therefore, suggest that, while cemetery soils may be toxic due to the accumulation of certain heavy metals, their overall ecological risks may be minimal and insignificant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheavy metals 3amass spectrometry 3aneutron activation analysis 3apolluted soils 3arisk 3asoil pollution 3asoil toxicity 3aRwanda0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2013 Feb., v. 224, no. 2 p.1435-1435dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-013-1435-2  aDNAL 7aarticle01974naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002200176245003500198300001500233520089300248592002801141650001601169650002101185650001201206700001701218700002301235700002001258700002701278773015201305856007001457856006501527990002301592852000901615655001201624IND60608550020221119102510.0190510e20170814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060855002DNAL7 a10.3791/557052doi7 aPMC56142582pmcid7 a288294132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagee, Elliott G.14aThe bionic clicker mark i & ii  ap. e55705.  aIn this manuscript, we present two 'Bionic Clicker' systems, the first designed to demonstrate electromyography (EMG) based control systems for educational purposes and the second for research purposes. EMG based control systems pick up electrical signals generated by muscle activation and use these as inputs for controllers. EMG controllers are widely used in prosthetics to control limbs. The Mark I (MK I) clicker allows the wearer to change the slide of a presentation by raising their index finger. It is built around a microcontroller and a bio-signals shield. It generated a lot of interest from both the public and research community. The Mark II (MK II) device presented here was designed to be a cheaper, sleeker, and more customizable system that can be easily modified and directly transmit EMG data. It is built using a wireless capable microcontroller and a muscle sensor.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontrollers 3aelectromyography 3amuscles1 aOurselin, S.1 aNikitichev, Daniil1 aVercauteren, T.1 aVanhoestenberghe, Anne0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Aug. 14, , no. 126 p.e55705-e55705dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/557053Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/55705/the-bionic-clicker-mark-i-ii  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245013500186300001600321520117900337592002801516650001401544650001401558650002201572650001201594650002601606650001201632650002801644650003101672650003901703650003701742650002001779650001101799650003801810650000901848650002501857700001601882700001701898700001501915700001801930700001701948773011601965856004802081852000902129655001202138IND50059773920221120172029.0121102e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005977392DNAL7 a229763712pmid7 a10.1007/s11626-012-9542-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChlastakova, I.10aDynamics of caspase-3 activation and inhibition in embryonic micromasses evaluated by a photon-counting chemiluminescence approach  ap. 545-549.  aCaspases are key enzymatic components of the intracellular apoptotic machinery, and their role in mammalian systems is often studied using fluoromethylketone (FMK) inhibitors. Despite many advantages of such approach, efficiency of the inhibitor and membrane permeability speed are often questioned. This work therefore focuses on an exact evaluation of caspase-3 FMK inhibition dynamics in camptothecin-induced mesenchymal micromasses. Two parameters of caspase-3 FMK inhibitor were investigated: first, the stability of the inhibitory potential in the time course of cultivation and, simultaneously, the dynamics of caspase-3 FMK inhibition after camptothecin-induced apoptosis peak. A photon-counting chemiluminescence approach was applied for quantification of active caspase-3. The sensitivity of the photon-counting method allowed for evaluation of active caspase-3 concentration in femtogram amounts per cell. The inhibitor penetrated the cells within the first minute after its application, and the peak of caspase-3 started to decline to the blank level after 30 min. The inhibitory effect of the FMK inhibitor was unchanged during the entire 48 h of cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3achemiluminescence 3amammals 3amembrane permeability 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCamptothecinxpharmacology 2aCaspase 3xmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCaspase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aCells, Cultured 2aFemale 2aLuminescent Measurementsxmethods 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred Strains1 aLiskova, M.1 aKudelova, J.1 aDubska, L.1 aKleparnik, K.1 aMatalova, E.0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2012 Oct., v. 48, no. 9 p.545-549dSpringer-Verlagx1071-26907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-012-9542-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006800168300001600236520107900252592002801331650001201359650001501371650001201386650001101398650002501409650001001434650001601444650001301460650002601473651001001499653002501509653001901534653002401553700001601577700001501593700001901608700001801627700001501645700001801660700001401678773011301692856008301805852000901888655001201897IND60534532320221119195641.0190318e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053453232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScaglione, F.E.10aAmeloblastic fibroma in an alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra)  ap. 196-198.  aSpontaneous odontogenic tumors are neoplasms characterized by a mixed odontogenic ectomesenchymal and odontogenic epithelial origin; they are rare in both humans and animals. A 3-year-old male Alpine Chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) was found dead in north-west Italy, and was referred for the necropsy to the Department of Veterinary Sciences of the University of Turin (Italy). At the external examination a 10 × 8 cm, exophytic, red-pink, smooth, firm and ulcerated mass was observed on the inferior lip. Histologically the tumor was characterized by spindle shaped cells arranged in bundles in an abundant hyaline matrix. Multifocal and rare chords of odontogenic epithelium mixed with rare melanocytes that penetrate the neoplasia were visible. Immunohistochemistry showed a clear cytokeratin positivity of epithelial clusters. Macroscopical, histological and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with a diagnosis of locally infiltrative ameloblastic fibroma. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of this tumor in a wild ungulate and in Alpine Chamois.  aPublisher supplied data 3achamois 3aepithelium 3afibroma 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amales 3amelanocytes 3anecropsy 3aodontogenic neoplasms 3aItaly 0aAmeloblastic fibroma 0aAlpine Chamois 0aRupicapra rupicapra1 aIussich, S.1 aGrande, D.1 aCarpignano, M.1 aChiappino, L.1 aSereno, A.1 aFerroglio, E.1 aBollo, E.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2015 Apr., v. 99 p.196-198dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012900173300001600302520095300318592002801271650001501299650001801314650001801332650001701350653001701367653001601384653001301400653001101413653001001424773008801434856008401522852000901606655001201615IND60113864420221118002604.0161019e20131231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011386442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2013.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrippiat, Jean-Pol10aContribution of the urodele amphibian Pleurodeles waltl to the analysis of spaceflight-associated immune system deregulation  ap. 434-441.  aImmune system deregulation has been demonstrated to occur during and immediately following spaceflight.

Here, we review major spaceflight-induced microbial and immunological modifications, some of the existing hardware developed to host amphibians in a space station and immunological information provided by space experiments performed with Pleurodeles waltl as an animal model. These data show that the urodele amphibian P. waltl fulfills many technical requirements associated with spaceflight experimentation and that this model is interesting to improve our understanding of the immunosuppressive effects of spaceflight, data required for the preparation of future deep-space missions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphibians 3aanimal models 3aimmune system 3aspace flight 0aMicrogravity 0aLymphocytes 0aImmunity 0aStress 0aSpace0 tMolecular Immunology.g2013 Dec. 31, v. 56 p.434-441dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2013.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245007700212300001600289520102500305592002801330650001401358650002401372650003101396650001301427650002701440650001601467650003801483650001101521700001601532700002201548700002101570700001501591700002101606700001901627700002301646773008701669856008401756852000901840655001201849IND60590435020221119200939.0180313e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059043502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2016.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarlsson, Linda H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7500-977710aResidue reduction and intersurface interaction on single graphene sheets  ap. 345-350.  aLarge regions of pristine graphene are essential to applications which rely on the ideal graphene properties. Common methods for transferring chemical vapour deposition grown graphene to suitable substrates leaves metal oxide particles and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) residues on opposing surfaces, which degrade the properties. A common method to reduce the residues include annealing in vacuum or in argon, however, residues remain on the graphene sheet. The present investigation reports on the metal oxide particle ripening and PMMA decomposition on a single graphene sheet during in-situ annealing up to 1300 °C in a transmission electron microscope. It is shown that the PMMA residues are increasingly reduced at elevated temperatures although the reduction is strongly correlated to the metal oxide particle coverage on the opposing graphene surface. This is shown to occur as a consequence of an electrostatic interaction between the residues and that this prevents the establishment of large clean areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3aargon (noble gases) 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agraphene 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopes 3avapors1 aBirch, Jens1 aMockute, Aurelija1 aIngason, Arni S.1 aTa, Huy Q.1 aRummeli, Mark H.1 aRosen, Johanna1 aPersson, Per O.Å.0 tCarbon.g2016 Apr., v. 100 p.345-350dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2016.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03748naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012400166300001600290520201900306592002802325650001502353650002502368650002902393650000902422650001302431650001802444650002202462650001502484650002502499650001102524650001202535651001102547653002302558653003702581653004102618653003502659653002702694653002502721700001702746700002302763700006302786700001902849700001802868700001602886700001502902700005802917700001802975773011802993856008603111852000903197655001203206IND60593483520221119133833.0190206e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059348352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.12.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStamou, A.10aDetermination of environmental flows in rivers using an integrated hydrological-hydrodynamic-habitat modelling approach  ap. 273-285.  aWe propose the novel integrated modelling procedure 3H-EMC for the determination of the environmental flow in rivers and streams; 3H-EMC combines Hydrological, Hydrodynamic and Habitat modelling with the use of the Environmental Management Classes (EMCs) that are defined by the Global Environmental Flow Calculator. We apply 3H-EMC in the Sperchios River in Central Greece, in which water abstractions for irrigation cause significant environmental impacts. Calculations of the hydrodynamic-habitat model, in which the large and the small chub are the main fish species, suggest discharge values that range from 1.0 m3/s to 4.0 m3/s. However, hydrological modelling indicates that it is practically difficult to achieve discharges that are higher than approximately 1.0–1.5 m3/s. Furthermore, legislation suggests significantly lower values (0.4–0.5 m3/s) that are unacceptable from the ecological point of view. This behaviour shows that a non-integrated approach, which is based only on hydrodynamic-habitat modelling does not necessarily result in realistic environmental flows, and thus an integrated approach is required. We propose the value of 1.0 m3/s as the “optimum” environmental flow for Sperchios River, because (a) it satisfies the habitat requirements, as expressed by the values of weighted useable area that are equal to 2180 and 1964 m2 for the large and small chub, respectively, and correspond to 82 and 95% of their respective maximum values, (b) it is consistent with the requirements of Environmental Classes A and B, whose percentiles are higher than 75% for discharge (77.2%) and for habitat availability (>83.5% for the large chub and >85.0% for the small chub), (c) it is practically achievable from the hydrological point of view, and (d) it is higher than the value proposed by the Greek legislation. The proposed modelling approach can be applied to any river or stream using the same or similar modelling tools, which should be linked via suitable coupling algorithms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental management 3afish 3ahabitats 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrologic models 3airrigation 3alaws and regulations 3arivers 3astreams 3aGreece 0aEnvironmental flow 0aEnvironmental management classes 0aGlobal environmental flow calculator 0aHydrodynamic-habitat modelling 0aHydrological modelling 0aIntegrated modelling1 aPolydera, A.1 aPapadonikolaki, G.1 aMartínez-Capel, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4991-02511 aMuñoz-Mas, R.1 aPapadaki, Ch.1 aZogaris, S.1 aBui, M.-D.1 aRutschmann, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9903-730X1 aDimitriou, E.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 209 p.273-285dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.12.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03715naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011200170300001600282520218700298592002802485650000802513650001502521650002002536650001802556650001402574650002002588650001102608650001202619650001702631650001602648650001802664650001302682650001402695650001502709650002202724650001702746650002702763653001402790653001602804653002002820653003002840653001302870700002002883700002502903700001602928700002602944700002202970773008802992856008403080852000903164655001203173IND60113864520221118002417.0161019e20131231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011386452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2013.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoitz, David M.10aRegulation of the Hif-system by micro-RNA 17 and 20a – Role during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation  ap. 442-451.  aMiRNAs are a class of endogenous tiny RNAs that act as inhibitors of translation or promote RNA degradation by duplex-formation within the 3′-UTR of target mRNAs. They play an important role during a wide range of cellular processes by fine-tuning of gene expression. The differentiation of monocytes to macrophages plays a pivotal role in physiological as well as pathophysiological processes such as atherosclerosis. Monocytes which can be found in well-oxygenated blood migrate into areas with a high inflammation, such as the atherosclerotic plaque. There, they differentiate into macrophages. Interestingly, macrophages were found mainly at hypoxic sites of the plaque. Key regulators for the adaptation to hypoxia are the hypoxia-inducible factors (Hif). Therefore the aim of the present study was to investigate the regulation of the Hif-system by miRNAs during the process of monocyte differentiation. The present study shows that during the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages a dramatically change in the expression pattern of Hif-1α and Hif-2α took place. This was associated with a downregulation of microRNAs encoded by the miR-17-92 cluster. An in silico analysis of the 3′-UTR of Hif-α subunits for binding sites of miRNAs was performed using different miRNA databases in concert with a secondary structure prediction algorithm. This analysis revealed that both 3′-UTRs contain binding sites for miRNAs of the miR-17-92 cluster. Transfection of HeLa cells with miR-17 and miR-20a led to an inhibition of Hif-1α and -2α mRNA and protein expression and a lowered Hif DNA binding activity. Using a Luciferase-Reporter assay, it could be shown, that both Hif-α subunits are targeted by miR-17 and miR-20a. Furthermore, miR-overexpression in primary human macrophages demonstrates the important role of this microRNA-mediated regulation of the Hif-system for adaption of macrophages to hypoxia.In conclusion, the present study shows that the Hif-system is activated during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. This activation is in part mediated by a miRNA-dependent mechanism, which seems to be crucial for the adaption of macrophages to hypoxia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalgorithms 3aatherosclerosis 3abinding sites 3adatabases 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ahypoxia 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3amonocytes 3aprediction 3aprotein synthesis 3atransfection 3atranslation (genetics) 0aMonocytes 0aMacrophages 0aDifferentiation 0aHypoxia-inducible factors 0aMicroRNA1 aAugstein, Antje1 aGradehand, Christine1 aEnde, Georg1 aSchmeisser, Alexander1 aStrasser, Ruth H.0 tMolecular Immunology.g2013 Dec. 31, v. 56 p.442-451dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2013.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245016700158300001600325520145500341592002801796650002901824650003001853650001601883650001701899650002201916650002701938650001201965650001401977650001401991650001802005650001402023650001302037650001602050650001102066700001802077700002102095700002502116700001802141700002402159773008802183856007202271852000902343655001202352IND60132935120221122230835.0150513e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013293512DNAL7 a10.1002/yea.30622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvan, Branislav10aMdm31 protein mediates sensitivity to potassium ionophores but does not regulate mitochondrial morphology or phospholipid trafficking in Schizosaccharomyces pombe  ap. 345-354.  aMdm31p is an inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) protein with unknown function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutants lacking Mdm31p contain only a few giant spherical mitochondria with disorganized internal structure, altered phospholipid composition and disturbed ion homeostasis, accompanied by increased resistance to the electroneutral K⁺/H⁺ionophore nigericin. These phenotypes are interpreted as resulting from diverse roles of Mdm31p, presumably in linking mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the machinery involved in segregation of mitochondria, in mediating cation transport across IMM and in phospholipid shuttling between mitochondrial membranes. To investigate which of the roles of Mdm31p are conserved in ascomycetous yeasts, we analysed the Mdm31p orthologue in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Our results demonstrate that, similarly to its S. cerevisiae counterpart, SpMdm31 is a mitochondrial protein and its absence results in increased resistance to nigericin. However, in contrast to S. cerevisiae, Sz. pombe cells lacking SpMdm31 are also less sensitive to the electrogenic K⁺ionophore valinomycin. Moreover, mitochondria of the fission yeast mdm31Δ mutant display no changes in morphology or phospholipid composition. Therefore, in terms of function, the two orthologous proteins appear to have considerably diverged between these two evolutionarily distant yeast species, possibly sharing only their participation in ion homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3ahomeostasis 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial membrane 3amutants 3anigericin 3aphenotype 3aphospholipids 3apotassium 3aproteins 3avalinomycin 3ayeasts1 aLajdova, Dana1 aAbelovska, Lenka1 aBalážová, Mária,1 aNosek, Josef,1 aTomáska, Lubomír,0 tYeast.g2015 Mar., v. 32, no. 3 p.345-354dWileywJournal:jnl39201x0749-503X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.30623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03515naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003100149245009900180300001500279500001500294520192700309592002802236650001802264650001502282650001502297650001502312650001202327650001302339650002202352650002502374650001202399650001402411650001902425650002402444650002202468650002702490650001302517650002002530650002102550653001702571700002102588700002602609700002302635700002802658700002302686700002602709700002202735773010102757856008302858990002302941852000902964655001202973IND60098182720221122203649.0141104e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009818272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoureiro, Samanta Oliveira10aCytoskeleton of cortical astrocytes as a target to proline through oxidative stress mechanisms  ap. 89-104.  a2019-12-06  aHyperprolinemia is an inherited disorder of proline (Pro) metabolism and patients affected by this disease may present neurological manifestations. However, the mechanisms of neural excitotoxicity elicited by hyperprolinemia are far from being understood. Considering the pivotal role of cytoskeletal remodeling in several neurodegenerative pathologies and the potential links between cytoskeleton, reactive oxygen species production and cell death, the aim of the present work was to study the effects of Pro on astrocyte and neuron cytoskeletal remodeling and the possible oxidative stress involvement. Pro induced a shift of actin cytoskeleton in stress fibers together with increased RhoA immunocontent and ERK1/2 phosphorylation/activation in cortical astrocytes. Unlike astrocytes, results evidenced little susceptibility of neuron cytoskeleton remodeling, since Pro-treated neurons presented unaltered neuritogenesis. We observed increased hydrogen peroxide production characterizing oxidative stress together with decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in cortical astrocytes after Pro treatment, while glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) activity remained unaltered. However, coincubation with Pro and Trolox/melatonin prevented decreased SOD and CAT activities in Pro-treated astrocytes. Accordingly, these antioxidants were able to prevent the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, RhoA increased levels and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to high Pro exposure. Taken together, these findings indicated that the cytoskeleton of cortical astrocytes, but not of neurons in culture, is a target to Pro and such effects could be mediated, at least in part, by redox imbalance, RhoA and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. The vulnerability of astrocyte cytoskeleton may have important implications for understanding the effects of Pro in the neurotoxicity linked to inborn errors of Pro metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aneurotoxicity 3ametabolism 3acell death 3aastrocytes 3aneurons 3acatalase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aproline 3amelatonin 3amicrofilaments 3asignal transduction 3agenetic disorders 3aglutathione peroxidase 3apatients 3aphosphorylation 3aoxidative stress 0aantioxidants1 aHeimfarth, Luana1 aScherer, Emilene B.S.1 ada Cunha, Maira J.1 ade Lima, Bárbara Ortiz1 aBiasibetti, Helena1 aPessoa-Pureur, Regina1 aWyse, Angela T.S.0 tExperimental cell research.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 319, no. 3 p.89-104dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.11.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245016700163300001600330500001500346520173000361592002802091650001602119650002002135650001202155650001602167650001102183650002502194650001702219650001302236650002302249650002202272650002002294650001102314650003502325653000902360700001902369700002002388700001802408773015502426856007902581852000902660655001202669IND60114850920221117213256.0141124e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011485092DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.112.0464172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yu-Cheng12aA common variant in the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α gene is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in obese children  ap. 326-331.  a2019-12-04  aBackground: The single nucleotide polymorphism in the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ coactivator (PGC)-1α gene (PPARGC1A) was identified to be associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adults. The PPARGC1A gene encodes PGC-1α, which regulates cellular energy metabolism.Objective: We aimed to test the hypothesis that the PPARGC1A rs8192678 risk A allele would influence the risk of NAFLD in obese children.Design: We genotyped PPARGC1A rs8192678 and PNPLA3 rs738409 in 781 obese children aged 7–18 y. NAFLD was determined by ultrasonography. We evaluated the independent influence of the PPARGC1A rs8192678 risk A allele on pediatric NAFLD after control for the effect of the PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism.Results: A total of 23.3% of the recruited obese children had NAFLD. PNPLA3 rs738409 increased the OR of NAFLD by 1.622 (95% CI: 1.071, 2.457; P = 0.023) in subjects with GC alleles and 2.659 (95% CI: 1.509, 4.686; P < 0.001) for GG alleles, as compared with CC alleles. After control for the effects of age- and sex-adjusted BMI, sex, and PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism, the PPARGC1A rs8192678 risk A allele was an independent risk factor for developing NAFLD, with an OR of 1.740 (95% CI: 1.149, 2.637; P = 0.009). Subjects with the PPARGC1A rs8192678 risk A allele had an increase in the mean serum alanine aminotransferase concentration of 5.2 IU/L, as compared with subjects without this allele (P = 0.011).Conclusion: The PPARGC1A rs8192678 risk A allele is associated with an increased risk of NAFLD, independent of the effect of the PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism in our population of obese Taiwanese children.

Street food vending disrupts this idealized order and is therefore denounced by state officials and the bourgeois public. Hamstrung by this hostile discursive field and their own lack of symbolic capital, how do food vendors manage to maneuver their way through an inhospitable city? In this paper, I use ethnographic vignettes from two neighborhoods in Delhi to argue that street vendors and city spaces should not be treated as homogeneous categories; differences among vendors and between urban settings are crucial for explaining heterogeneous survival strategies. These differences relate to ethnic identities derived from diverse histories of migration, as well as to the variegated layout, land use and legal geographies of spaces in the city. I conclude by showing that negotiations over food vending now occur not only on the street, but also through the virtual world of food blogs and videos. By representing street food as a valued part of city culture, the internet has emerged as a new space where the claims of street vendors acquire greater legitimacy in the public sphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aanthropology 3aconception 3aland use 3astreet foods 3aIndia 0aStreet food 0amigration 0aethnicity 0amunicipal regulation 0asocial media 0apublic space 0aDelhi0 tFood, culture, & society.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 24, no. 1 p.142-155dRoutledgewJournal:2182x1751-74437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15528014.2020.18599033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02089naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005600145245010100201300001800302520049400320592002800814596006700842596009800909596010001007650001601107650001101123650002301134650001401157650002201171650002001193650002101213700001301234700001701247700001401264700001301278700001701291700005301308700001501361700005601376773013401432856008001566852000901646655001201655IND60786770720221121124057.0220805e20220722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078677072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.2c008292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8705-569010aDifferent Lewis Acid Promotor-Steered Highly Regioselective Phosphorylation of Tertiary Enamides  ap. 9769-9781.  aDifferent Lewis acid promotor-steered highly regioselective phosphorylation of tertiary enamides with diverse H-phosphonates or H-phosphine oxides was developed.

The immunosuppressive drug Mizoribine (MIZ) was found to increase the antiviral activity of Acyclovir (ACV) against herpesvirus infections, raising interesting perspectives on new combined therapeutic strategies. In this study the anti-CpHV-1 activity in vitro of ACV alone or in combination with MIZ was characterized. When applied alone at non-toxic concentrations, ACV had a slight effect on CpHV-1 replication while in combination with MIZ a dose-dependent inhibition of the virus yield was observed with an IC50 of ACV of 28.5 µM. These findings suggest that combined therapy of ACV and MIZ is potentially exploitable in the treatment of genital infection by herpesviruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aantiviral properties 3adose response 3adrugs 3aimmunosuppression 3agoats 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 2 3atherapeutics 3aCaprine alphaherpesvirus 1 3aviruses 3aHerpesviridae infections 0aHuman herpesvirus 2 0aCpHV-1 0aCaprine herpesvirus 1 0aAcyclovir 0aMizoribine 0aMDBK cells 0aViral titration1 aCamero, M.1 aDecaro, N.1 aLovero, A.1 aMartella, V.1 aTempesta, M.1 aBuonavoglia, C.1 aCrescenzo, G.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2015 Apr., v. 99 p.208-211dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012700171300001600298520158400314592002801898650001601926650001701942650001801959650001301977650001301990650001902003650002502022650001402047700001802061700001902079700001802098700002202116700001902138700002402157700002502181773010202206856008302308990002302391852000902414655001202423IND60098182820221122203714.0141104e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009818282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshikawa, Kyohei10aInvolvement of oncogenic K-ras on cell migration stimulated by lysophosphatidic acid receptor-2 in pancreatic cancer cells  ap. 105-112.  aLysophosphatidic acid (LPA) mediates a variety of cellular responses with atleast six G protein-coupled transmembrane receptors (LPA receptor−1 (LPA₁–LPA₆)). The interaction between LPA receptors and other cellular molecules on the biological function is not fully understood. Recently, we have reported that LPA₁ suppressed and LPA₃ stimulated cell migration of pancreatic cancer cells. In the present study, to evaluate the function of LPA₂ on motile and invasive activities of pancreatic cancer cells, we generated Lpar2 knockdown (HPD-sh2) cells from hamster pancreatic cancer cells and measured their cell migration ability. In cell motility and invasive assays with an uncoated Cell Culture Insert, HPD-sh2 cells showed significantly lower intrinsic activity than control (HPD–GFP) cells. Since K-ras mutations were frequently detected in pancreatic cancer, we next investigated whether oncogenic K-ras is involved in cell migration induced by LPA₂ using K-ras knockdown (HPD-K2) cells. The cell motile ability of HPD-K2 cells was significantly lower than that of control cells. To confirm LPA₂ increases cell migration activity, cells were pretreated with dioctylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP) which is the antagonist of LPA₁/LPA₃. The cell motile and invasive abilities of DGPP -treated HPD–GFP cells were markedly higher than those of untreated cells, but DGPP did not stimulate cell migration of HPD-K2 cells. These results suggest that cell migration activity of pancreatic cancer cells stimulated by LPA₂ may be enhanced by oncogenic K-ras.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3acell culture 3acell movement 3ahamsters 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3apancreatic neoplasms 3areceptors1 aTanabe, Eriko1 aShibata, Ayano1 aInoue, Serina1 aKitayoshi, Misaho1 aOkimoto, Souta1 aFukushima, Nobuyuki1 aTsujiuchi, Toshifumi0 tExperimental cell research.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 319, no. 3 p.105-112dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.09.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245019500167300001400362520114500376592002801521650001401549650000901563650001001572650003501582650002701617650003201644650002401676650001001700650001301710650002201723650003001745650001201775650002501787650002101812653001101833653001901844653001501863653002201878700001501900700001301915700001601928773009301944856008602037852000902123655001202132IND60526126920221120072457.0190403e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052612692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartoň, L.10aAssociations of polymorphisms in bovine DGAT1, FABP4, FASN, and PPARGC1A genes with intramuscular fat content and the fatty acid composition of muscle and subcutaneous fat in Fleckvieh bulls  ap. 18-23.  aAllelic and genotypic distribution of polymorphisms in diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PPARGC1A) genes were assessed in 679 Fleckvieh bulls. Single-locus genotype effects and the combined effect of the two polymorphisms within the FASN gene were evaluated for association with the intramuscular fat content and fatty acid profile determined in muscle and subcutaneous fat. The FASN (g.16024G>A) and FASN (g.17924A>G) polymorphisms were significantly associated mainly with C14:0, C16:0, and C18:1 n-9 concentrations as well as with the atherogenic index. The proportion of explained phenotypic variation markedly increased when the effect of a combination of the two polymorphisms within the FASN gene was tested, with the highest values of 8.6% and 14.8%, respectively, observed for C14:0 in muscle and subcutaneous fat. With a focus on improving the fatty acid composition of beef, the results of this study provide valuable information about the markers applicable in marker-assisted selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSimmental 3abeef 3abulls 3adiacylglycerol acyltransferase 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3afatty-acid synthase 3agenes 3agenotype 3aintramuscular fat 3amarker-assisted selection 3amuscles 3aphenotypic variation 3asubcutaneous fat 0aCattle 0aAdipose tissue 0aFatty acid 0aGene polymorphism1 aBureš, D.1 aKott, T.1 aŘehák, D.0 tMeat science.g2016 Apr., v. 114 p.18-23dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010700176300001500283500001900298520073500317536014901052592002801201596000801229596001201237596000801249650001801257650001901275650001801294650001701312650002201329651001101351653001601362653001301378653001901391773010901410856008501519852000901604655001201613IND60728245220221122125818.0210219e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072824522DNAL7 a10.1080/15528014.2020.18599202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayden, Tiana Bakić10aStreet food as infrastructure: consumer mobility, vendor removability and food security in Mexico City  ap. 98-111.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aStreet food vendors are a ubiquitous but controversial feature of Mexico City’s foodscapes; in the context of urban renewal and modernization projects, vendors are frequently portrayed as backwards, dirty, and undesirable and are targeted for removal. While most studies of such processes focus on the implications for vendors themselves, this article asks about the implications of street vendor removal and removability for those who consume these foods on a regular basis. The article adopts a mobilities framework in order to argue that street food needs to be understood in relation to consumers’ everyday mobilities as part of poor and working class people’s food security, and as an urban infrastructure more broadly.  aThis work was supported by the American Council of Learned Societies [N/A]; National Science Foundation [1426870]; Wenner-Gren Foundation [N/A].  aPublisher supplied data  aN/A  a1426870  aN/A 3afood security 3ainfrastructure 3amodernization 3astreet foods 3aurban development 3aMexico 0aStreet food 0amobility 0agentrification0 tFood, culture, & society.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 24, no. 1 p.98-111dRoutledgewJournal:2182x1751-74437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15528014.2020.18599203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245011900166300001600285520122400301592002801525650001501553650001501568650001701583650001401600650001701614650000901631650001701640650001301657650001301670650001601683650001101699650001601710650000901726650001201735650001301747650001601760650001401776653000901790653002801799653001301827653001601840653002301856700002301879773011001902856007902012852000902091655001202100IND60566253820221121223524.0180620e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056625382DNAL7 a10.1515/euco-2017-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOppeltová, Petra10aWater constructions in countryside – case study of land use on the river Svratka in the village Ujčov (Moravia)  ap. 194-210.  aBuildings and facilities on waterways have significant landscaping, water management and ecological importance. They affect the landscape and create conditions for the emergence of new habitats. Small dams, mills, saws, small hydropower plants, dams and other water objects and structures, which more or less affect the flow of the surrounding countryside, are built and are building in the countryside. Within design and construction of these objects environmental relationships must be respected and in line with the sustainable exploitation of the territory. Many objects built in the past adversely affected the flow and the landscape while make it impossible the migration of fish and amphibians. A series of objects is currently non-functional and have a negative impact on the flow and the surrounding countryside. In such cases the streams are revitalized or inoperative objects are removed, fish ladders are often built. This study evaluates the possibility of using land adjacent to the fixed weir on the Svratka river in the Ujčov village, from the viewpoint of maintaining the existing biodiversity, aesthetic and economic potential of the territory. A study with several options of land use is the result.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3aamphibians 3abiodiversity 3abuildings 3acase studies 3afish 3afish ladders 3ahabitats 3aland use 3alandscaping 3arivers 3arural areas 3asaws 3astreams 3avillages 3awater power 3awaterways 0aweir 0asmall hydropower plants 0aVír dam 0afish ladder 0athe Czech Republic1 aBureš, František0 tEuropean countryside.g2017 Mar. 1, v. 9, no. 1 p.194-210dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:6168x1803-84177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/euco-2017-00123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04600naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245015300165300001600318520187800334592002802212650002102240650002302261650001802284650001102302650002302313650001102336650001202347650001402359650001702373650002702390650001902417650002402436650000902460650001902469650001502488650001002503700002002513700001702533700002502550700001602575700002202591700001702613700003202630700002002662700002202682700001802704700002202722700001902744700002602763700001902789700002302808700001702831700002202848700002102870700002002891700002102911700002102932700002202953700001902975700002902994700002303023700002003046700001603066700001803082700002803100700002403128700001703152700002303169700002303192700001703215700001303232700001803245700002403263700001603287700001603303700001903319700001803338700001803356700002403374700002103398773015503419856007903574852000903653655001203662IND60114851120221117213127.0141124e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011485112DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.112.0340252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrari, Pietro10aDietary fiber intake and risk of hormonal receptor–defined breast cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study  ap. 344-353.  aBackground: Limited scientific evidence has characterized the association between dietary fiber intake and risk of breast cancer (BC) by menopausal status and hormone receptor expression in tumors.Objective: We investigated the relation between total dietary fiber and its main food sources (vegetables, fruit, cereals, and legumes) and BC risk by using data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC).Design: A total of 11,576 invasive BC cases in 334,849 EPIC women mostly aged 35–70 y at baseline were identified over a median follow-up of 11.5 y. Dietary fiber was estimated from country-specific dietary questionnaires. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to quantify the association between dietary variables and BC risk with energy adjustment by using the residual method. Subgroup analyses were performed by menopausal status and estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression in tumors.Results: BC risk was inversely associated with intakes of total dietary fiber [hazard ratio comparing fifth quintile to first quintile (HRQ5-Q1): 0.95; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.01; P-trend = 0.03] and fiber from vegetables (0.90; 0.84, 0.96; P-trend < 0.01) but not with fiber from fruit, cereals, or legumes. Overall, associations were homogeneous by menopausal status and ER and PR expression in tumors. For vegetable fiber, stronger associations were observed for estrogen receptor–negative and progesterone receptor–negative (HRQ5-Q1:0.74; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.93; P-trend = 0.01) than for estrogen receptor–positive and progesterone receptor–positive tumors (0.92: 0.81, 1.03; P-trend = 0.05), with P-heterogeneity = 0.09.Conclusion: Diets rich in dietary fiber and, particularly, fiber from vegetables may be associated with a small reduction in risk of BC, independently of menopausal status.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3aclinical nutrition 3adietary fiber 3aenergy 3aestrogen receptors 3agrains 3alegumes 3amenopause 3aprogesterone 3aprogesterone receptors 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3avegetables 3awomen1 aRinaldi, Sabina1 aJenab, Mazda1 aLukanova, Annekatrin1 aOlsen, Anja1 aTjønneland, Anne1 aOvervad, Kim1 aClavel-Chapelon, Françoise1 aFagherazzi, Guy1 aTouillaud, Marina1 aKaaks, Rudolf1 avon Rüsten, Anne1 aBoeing, Heiner1 aTrichopoulou, Antonia1 aLagiou, Pagona1 aBenetou, Vassiliki1 aGrioni, Sara1 aPanico, Salvatore1 aMasala, Giovanna1 aTumino, Rosario1 aPolidoro, Silvia1 aBakker, Marije F1 avan Gils, Carla H1 aRos, Martine M1 aBueno-de-Mesquita, H Bas1 aKrum-Hansen, Sanda1 aEngeset, Dagrun1 aSkeie, Guri1 aPilar, Amiano1 aSánchez, María José,1 aBuckland, Genevieve1 aArdanaz, Eva1 aChirlaque, Dolores1 aRodriguez, Laudina1 aTravis, Ruth1 aKey, Tim1 aKhaw, Kay-Tee1 aWareham, Nicholas J1 aSund, Malin1 aLenner, Per1 aSlimani, Nadia1 aNorat, Teresa1 aAune, Dagfinn1 aRiboli, E.q(Elio),1 aRomieu, Isabelle0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2013 Feb., v. 97, no. 2 p.344-353dAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:jnl45206x0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.112.0340253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245014500160300002000305520184600325592002802171650004402199650002202243650002202265650001402287650001502301650002102316650001902337650000902356650000902365650002102374650002002395650002302415650001102438650001702449650001802466650002002484650003302504650003202537700002202569700001902591700002202610700001902632773012402651856007402775852000902849655001202858IND60666873220221122210055.0190919e20141020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066687322DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra09468a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMashkour, Mahdi10aOne-dimensional core–shell cellulose-akaganeite hybrid nanocrystals: synthesis, characterization, and magnetic field induced self-assembly  ap. 52542-52549.  aCellulose akaganeite hybrid nanocrystals (CAHNCs) were synthesized in situ from a ferrous chloride aqueous solution in the presence of pre-oxidized cellulose nanocrystals as a reducing agent for the reduction of dissolved ferrous ions under heat treatment and neutral gas flow. The characterization of the produced nanostructures by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) confirmed that the fabricated one-dimensional nanoparticles were composed of rod-like cellulose nanocrystal cores coated by the shells of spherical chloride-containing akaganeite nanoparticles with an average diameter of about 4–6 nm, and they had superparamagnetic properties. To compare the magnetic response of the synthetized CAHNCs with the starting diamagnetic CNCs, the static magnetic fields of 1, 2, 4, and 8 T generated by a superconducting magnet were applied to the suspensions of either material during the dewatering process. In contrast to the CNCs, the CAHNCs were well-aligned under magnetic field intensity of 4 T and above. Moreover, the magnetic susceptibility of the CAHNCs was different from that of the CNCs by exhibiting magnetic field induced self-assembly parallel to the external magnetic field direction. Cellulose akaganeite hybrid microcrystals (CAHMCs) were added to the system as micro-scale models, which also confirmed the magnetic field induced self-assembly. Polarizing optical microscopy, FESEM, and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) strongly confirmed the unidirectional magnetic field induced self-assembly of the CAHNCs parallel to the external magnetic field even under the magnetic intensity of 2 T. The reasons behind these observations are extensively discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaqueous solutions 3acellulose 3adewatering 3aferrous chloride 3aheat treatment 3aions 3airon 3alight microscopy 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic materials 3amodels 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3areducing agents 3ascanning electron microscopy 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aKimura, Tsunehisa1 aKimura, Fumiko1 aMashkour, Mozhdeh1 aTajvidi, Mehdi0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 20, v. 4, no. 94 p.52542-52549dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra09468a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008600174300001400260500001900274520124900293592002801542650001001570650001401580650001501594650001701609653001601626653001601642653001001658653001201668653002001680653002101700653002401721653002401745653002701769653001601796700001601812700001601828773010801844856008501952852000902037655001202046IND60728245420221122130408.0210219e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072824542DNAL7 a10.1080/15528014.2020.18599222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKu, Robert Ji-Song10aBeyond pojangmacha: Edae food carts and the future of Seoul’s social gastronomy  ap. 84-97.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAcross Seoul, Korea, countless tented food stalls called pojangmacha have for generations purveyed cheap, tasty fare from early evening unto the wee hours of the night. The foods sold are familiar nosh that can be washed down with beer or soju. But while these foods are as popular as ever, in recent years, other sorts of street food that are decidedly more “international” have emerged. One such place is Ewhayeodae Street that leads to the front gate of Ewha Womans University, aka Edae. While other places in Seoul are better known for the quality, quantity, and variety of new street foods, it is Edae that helps us to best assess two particular facets of contemporary Korea’s ongoing social, cultural, and economic transformation: first, the status of women, such as those who attend Ewha University, and second, the rise in foreign tourists. Using inter- and multidisciplinary sources and analysis, this speculative, nonempirical essay postulates that the Edae food carts, in offering new and innovative foods that appeal simultaneously to these two groups, anticipate an urgent social reality: the future of Seoul continues to hinge on both the ongoing evolution of the status of women and the internationalization of the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeers 3aevolution 3agastronomy 3astreet foods 0aPojangmacha 0astreet food 0aSeoul 0atourism 0astatus of women 0ainternationalism 0acult of masculinity 0aalcohol consumption 0aEwha Womans University 0aKorean Wave1 aKim, Jungah1 aYu, Hyunjoo0 tFood, culture, & society.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 24, no. 1 p.84-97dRoutledgewJournal:2182x1751-74437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15528014.2020.18599223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245008100167300001600248520179900264592002802063650001402091650002102105650001902126650003102145650002402176650001002200650001602210650001302226650001902239650003702258650002602295650002102321650001702342650002602359700001602385700001902401700001602420700001502436700001802451773010202469856008302571990002302654852000902677655001202686IND60098183120221122203623.0141104e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009818312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wonseok10aProtein kinase B/Akt1 inhibits autophagy by down-regulating UVRAG expression  ap. 122-133.  aAutophagy, or autophagocytosis, is a selective intracellular degradative process involving the cell's own lysosomal apparatus. An essential component in cell development, homeostasis, repair and resistance to stress, autophagy may result in either cell death or survival. The targeted region of the cell is sequestered within a membrane structure, the autophagosome, for regulation of the catabolic process. A key factor in both autophagosome formation and autophagosome maturation is a protein encoded by the ultraviolet irradiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG). Conversely, the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt), which regulates survival in various cancers, inhibits autophagy through mTOR activation. We found that Akt1 may also directly inhibit autophagy by down-regulating UVRAG both in a 293T transient transfection system and breast cancer cells stably expressing Akt1. The UVRAG with mutations at putative Akt1-phosphorylation sites were still inhibited by Akt1, and dominant-negative Akt1 also inhibited UVRAG expression, suggesting that Akt1 down-regulates UVRAG by a kinase activity-independent mechanism. We showed that Akt1 overexpression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells down-regulated UVRAG transcription. Cells over-expressing Akt1 were more resistant than control cells to ultraviolet light-induced autophagy and exhibited the associated reduction in cell viability. Levels of the autophagosome indicator protein LC3B-II and mRFP-GFP-LC3 were reduced in cells that over-expressing Akt1. Inhibiting Akt1 by siRNA or reintroducing UVRAG gene rescued the level of LC3B-II in UV-irradiation. Altogether, these data suggest that Akt1 may inhibit autophagy by decreasing UVRAG expression, which also sensitizes cancer cells to UV irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautophagy 3abreast neoplasms 3acell viability 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3aprotein-serine-threonine kinases 3asmall interfering RNA 3astress tolerance 3atransfection 3aultraviolet radiation1 aJu, Ji-hyun1 aLee, Kyung-min1 aNam, KeeSoo1 aOh, Sunhwa1 aShin, Incheol0 tExperimental cell research.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 319, no. 3 p.122-133dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.11.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024002200120024001900142040001800161100002800179245011500207300001600322506007600338520125600414592002801670506003701698650001401735650002901749650001501778650003001793650001201823650001301835650001901848650001301867650001101880700002001891700002301911700002401934700002001958773008801978856007202066852000902138655001202147IND60132935520221207120601.0150513e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013293552DNAL7 a10.1002/yea.30652doi7 aPMC43904712pmcid7 a256122422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlubowski, Christian J.10aPlasmids for C‐terminal tagging in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that contain improved GFP proteins, Envy and Ivy  ap. 379-387.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGreen fluorescent protein (GFP) has become an invaluable tool in biological research. Many GFP variants have been created that differ in brightness, photostability, and folding robustness. We have created two hybrid GFP variants, Envy and Ivy, which we placed in a vector for the C‐terminal tagging of yeast proteins by PCR‐mediated recombination. The Envy GFP variant combines mutations found in the robustly folding SuperfolderGFP and GFPγ, while the Ivy GFP variant is a hybrid of GFPγ and the yellow‐green GFP variant, Clover. We compared Envy and Ivy to EGFP, SuperfolderGFP and GFPγ and found that Envy is brighter than the other GFP variants at both 30°C and 37°C, while Ivy is the most photostable. Envy and Ivy are recognized by a commonly used anti‐GFP antibody, and both variants can be immunoprecipitated using the GFP TRAP Camelidae antibody nanotrap technology. Because Envy is brighter than the other GFP variants and is as photostable as GFPγ, we suggest that Envy should be the preferred GFP variant, while Ivy may be used in cases where photostability is of the utmost importance. The GenBank Accession No. for Envy is KM891731, for Ivy is KM891732 and for the yeast optimized GFPγ described in this paper is KM891733.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCamelidae 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aantibodies 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahybrids 3amutation 3aphotostability 3aplasmids 3ayeasts1 aFunk, Alyssa D.1 aRoesner, Joseph M.1 aPaulissen, Scott M.1 aHuang, Linda S.0 tYeast.g2015 Apr., v. 32, no. 4 p.379-387dWileywJournal:jnl39201x0749-503X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.30653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01830naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009400171300001400265500001900279520075500298592002801053650001401081650001001095650001901105653001701124653001501141653001901156653001701175653002201192653001501214653002001229653001701249773010801266856008501374852000901459655001201468IND60728245520221122130402.0210219e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072824552DNAL7 a10.1080/15528014.2020.18599232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Jayeeta10aFood cries, historical city sounds, and the twentieth century silencing of street vendors  ap. 16-30.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis article explores historical street cries, the sounds, calls, and music of peddlers, hawkers, and vendors who sold food, provisions and services, and their changes within global soundscapes and urban communities.

It examines how and why from the mid-nineteenth century, such cries were perceived negatively by many urban residents and how the sounds of selling food that were historically integral to culinary provisioning systems were portrayed as an undesirable and backward aspect of urban life and virtually relegated to the realm of nostalgia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3amusic 3asocioeconomics 0aStreet cries 0afood cries 0astreet vendors 0astreet foods 0aurban soundscapes 0anoise laws 0asound histories 0afood systems0 tFood, culture, & society.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 24, no. 1 p.16-30dRoutledgewJournal:2182x1751-74437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15528014.2020.18599233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009600172300001600268520146300284592002801747650002101775650001301796650001201809650002301821650001101844650000801855650002501863650000901888650002401897650002001921650002501941650001901966650001001985651001001995700001302005700001802018700001702036700002202053700001402075700001902089773011002108856008502218852000902303655001202312IND60090592620221118221959.0141102e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009059262DNAL7 a10.3967/0895-3988.2013.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dong Mei,10aSocio-economic and Psychosocial Determinants of Smoking and Passive Smoking in Older Adults  ap. 453-467.  aOBJECTIVE: To determine the associations of socio-economic and psychosocial factors with active and passive smoking in older adults. METHODS: Using a standard interview method, we examined random samples of 6071 people aged ≥ 60 years in 5 provinces of China during 2007–2009. RESULTS: World age-standardised prevalence for current and former smoking in men was 45.6% and 20.5%, and in women 11.1% and 4.5%. Current smoking reduced with older age but increased with men, low socioeconomic status (SES), alcohol drinking, being never-married, pessimistic and depressive syndromes. Former smoking was associated with men, secondary school education, a middle-high income, being a businessman, being widowed, less frequencies of visiting children/relatives and friends, and worrying about children. Among 3774 never-smokers, the prevalence of passive smoking was 31.5%, and the risk increased with women, low SES, alcohol drinking, being married, having a religious believe, and daily visiting children/relatives. There were sex differences in the associations, and an interaction effect of education and income on smoking and passive smoking. CONCLUSION: Older Chinese had a higher level of smoking and passive smoking than those in high income countries, reflecting China's failures in controlling smoking. The associations with low SES and different psychosocial aspects and sex differences suggest preventative strategies for active and passive smoking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol drinking 3achildren 3aelderly 3agender differences 3aincome 3amen 3apsychosocial factors 3arisk 3asecondary education 3asmoking (habit) 3asocioeconomic status 3asocioeconomics 3awomen 3aChina1 aHu, Zhi,1 aORTON, Sophie1 aWANG, Jia Ji1 aZHENG, Jian Zhong1 aQin, Xia,1 aCHEN, Ruo Ling0 tBiomedical and environmental sciences.g2013 June, v. 26, no. 6 p.453-467dElsevier B.V.x0895-39887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3967/0895-3988.2013.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002700142245012400169500002000293520156200313592002801875650001601903650001301919650001501932650001501947700002301962700002001985700002002005700001802025773012502043856007602168852000902244655001202253IND60792801920221123042418.0220909e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079280192DNAL7 a10.1029/2008JB0058022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaberlandt, Christian,10aStructure of the seismogenic zone of the southcentral Chilean margin revealed by local earthquake traveltime tomography  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe use traveltime data of local earthquakes and controlled sources observed by a large, temporary, amphibious seismic network to reveal the anatomy of the southcentral Chilean subduction zone (37–39°S) between the trench and the magmatic arc. At this location the giant 1960 earthquake (M = 9.5) nucleated and ruptured almost 1000 km of the subduction megathrust. For the three‐dimensional tomographic inversion we used 17,148 P wave and 10,049 S wave arrival time readings from 439 local earthquakes and 94 shots. The resolution of the tomographic images was explored by analyzing the model resolution matrix and conducting extensive numerical tests. The downgoing lithosphere is delineated by high seismic P wave velocities. High vₚ/vₛ ratio in the subducting slab reflects hydrated oceanic crust and serpentinized uppermost oceanic mantle. The subducting oceanic crust can be traced down to a depth of 80 km, as indicated by a low velocity channel. The continental crust extends to approximately a 50‐km depth near the intersection with the subducting plate. This suggests a wide contact zone between continental and oceanic crust of about 150 km, potentially supporting the development of large asperities. Eastward the crustal thickness decreases again to a minimum of about a 30‐km depth. Relatively low vₚ/vₛ at the base of the forearc does not support a large‐scale serpentinization of the mantle wedge. Offshore, low vₚ and high vₚ/vₛ reflect young, fluid‐saturated sediments of forearc basins and the accretionary prism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aearthquakes 3aresearch 3asubduction 3atomography1 aRietbrock, Andreas1 aLange, Dietrich1 aBataille, Klaus1 aDahm, Torsten0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2009 Jan., v. 114, no.

L. plantarum AA1-2 and L. plantarum AB20-961 were identified as potential strains for CLA production. Optimum conditions for these strains to produce high levels of CLA were determined by evaluating the amount of added hydrolyzed sunflower oil (HSO) and initial pH levels in a nutrient medium. The highest CLA production was obtained in medium with pH6.0 and 2% HSO (P<0.05). Those strains were then used as starter culture in sucuk fermentation. Five sucuk treatments included a control (no starter culture), two sucuk groups with L. plantarum AA1-2 at the initial pH of 5.8 or 6.0 and two sucuk groups with L. plantarum AB20-961 at the initial pH of 5.8 or 6.0. Results indicate that L. plantarum AB20-961 produced higher amount of CLA in sucuk at initial pH of 5.8 and 6.0 levels during first 24h of fermentation compared with other groups. CLA isomer concentration decreased in all sucuk groups during the rest of the fermentation period (P<0.05) and remained quite stable during the storage. This study demonstrated that probiotic L. plantarum AB20-961 can be used in sucuk manufacturing without posing any quality problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3afermentation 3ahydrolysis 3aisomers 3amanufacturing 3anutrient content 3apH 3aprobiotics 3astarter cultures 3asunflower oil 0aConjugated linoleic acid 0aLactobacillus plantarum 0aProbiotic 0aSucuk1 aKılıç, Birol,1 aKılıç, Gülden Başyiğit0 tMeat science.g2016 Apr., v. 114 p.24-31dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02054naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245008000157300001600237520097900253592002801232653002401260653001401284653001401298653002401312653002001336653001601356700001701372700001901389700001401408700001401422700001801436700001801454773013401472856007701606852000901683655001201692IND60681696520221120133619.0200226e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068169652DNAL7 a10.3920/WMJ2012.14042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikula, H.10aFast and reproducible chemical synthesis of zearalenone-14-β,D-glucuronide  ap. 289-296.  aThe Fusarium mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEA) is mainly converted to the conjugate zearalenone-14-β,D-glucuronide (ZEA-14-GlcA) during phase II detoxification in humans and animals. This metabolite - previously described as zearalenone-4-O-β,D-glucuronide - is excreted via urine and could therefore serve as possible biomarker for ZEA exposure to estimate its intake. Direct determination of this substance is limited by the availability of a reference substance. So far, only the production of small amounts by enzymatic synthesis has been described. In this work, a fast and reproducible protocol for the chemical synthesis of ZEA-14-GlcA was developed, using substituted β-resorcylic acid esters as mycotoxin mimics and different glucuronyl donors for optimising the glycosylation (Königs-Knorr, trifluoroacetimidate method) and the deprotection step. This cost-effective procedure should be easily reproducible in other labs using standard equipment and common reagents.  aPublisher supplied data 0amycotoxin conjugate 0abiomarker 0asynthesis 0aphase II metabolite 0aglucuronidation 0aZEA-14-GlcA1 aHametner, C.1 aBerthiller, F.1 aWarth, B.1 aKrska, R.1 aAdam, Gilles,1 aFröhlich, J.0 tWorld mycotoxin journal.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 5, no. 3 p.289-296dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl4395724x1875-07967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/WMJ2012.14043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03679naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245010200205300001600307506007600323520176400399592002802163506003702191650001702228650002302245650001002268650001802278650000902296650003402305650000902339650002502348650001102373650000902384650001502393650001302408650001302421650001202434650003302446650001902479650001402498650001902512650002802531650001202559650001602571650002202587700002402609700001902633700002202652700001702674700002302691700002202714700002302736700002002759700001902779773015502798856007902953852000903032655001203041IND60114851320221207125546.0141124e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011485132DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.112.0448592doi7 aPMC35456832pmcid7 a232698142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArthur, Anna E10aPretreatment dietary patterns, weight status, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma prognosis  ap. 360-368.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Few studies have evaluated the association of diet and weight status with head and neck cancer outcomes.Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether pretreatment dietary patterns and weight status are associated with head and neck cancer prognosis.Design: This was a longitudinal study of 542 patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancer who completed food-frequency questionnaires and health surveys before treatment. Clinical data were abstracted from medical records and the Social Security Death Index. Dietary patterns were identified by using principal component analysis. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association of derived dietary patterns (fit by quintiles of exposure) and weight status with time to recurrence and survival, with control for covariates.Results: During the study period, there were 229 deaths and 184 recurrences. Two dietary patterns were identified: a whole-foods pattern (characterized by high intakes of vegetables, fruit, fish, poultry, and whole grains) and a Western pattern (characterized by high intakes of red and processed meats, refined grains, potatoes, and French fries). In multivariable analyses, significantly fewer deaths were observed in subjects most adherent to the whole-foods pattern (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.92; P-trend = 0.01). Subjects classified as overweight or obese had significantly fewer deaths (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.85; P = 0.001) and recurrences (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.95; P = 0.02) than did normal-weight or underweight subjects.Conclusion: Consumption of a diet rich in vegetables, fruit, fish, poultry, and whole grains and being overweight before diagnosis with head and neck cancer are associated with a better prognosis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFrench fries 3aclinical nutrition 3adeath 3aeating habits 3afish 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ahead 3alongitudinal studies 3amodels 3aneck 3aoverweight 3apatients 3apotatoes 3apoultry 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprocessed meat 3aprognosis 3arefined grains 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3asurveys 3aunderweight 3awhole grain foods1 aPeterson, Karen E.,1 aRozek, Laura S1 aTaylor, Jeremy MG1 aLight, Emily1 aChepeha, Douglas B1 aHebert, James R.,1 aTerrell, Jeffrey E1 aWolf, Gregory T1 aDuffy, Sonia A0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2013 Feb., v. 97, no. 2 p.360-368dAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:jnl45206x0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.112.0448593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010500158520116800263592002801431650002301459650001401482650001101496650001301507650001401520650001301534650001501547650001901562650002501581650001601606650001401622650001001636700002001646773012601666856007301792852000901865655001201874IND60651913120221120135453.0190712e20170320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065191312DNAL7 a10.3390/su90304602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xiao-Jian10aImpacts of Global Warming and Sea Level Rise on Service Life of Chloride-Exposed Concrete Structures  aGlobal warming will increase the rate of chloride ingress and the rate of steel corrosion of concrete structures. Furthermore, in coastal (atmospheric marine) zones, sea level rise will reduce the distance of concrete structures from the coast and increase the surface chloride content. This study proposes a probabilistic model for analyzing the effects of global warming and sea level rise on the service life of coastal concrete structures. First, in the corrosion initiation stage, an improved chloride diffusion model is proposed to determine chloride concentration. The Monte Carlo method is employed to calculate the service life in the corrosion initiation stage; Second, in the corrosion propagation stage, a numerical model is proposed to calculate the rate of corrosion, probability of corrosion cracking, and service life. Third, overall service life is determined as the sum of service life in the corrosion initiation and corrosion propagation stages. After considering the impacts of global warming and sea level rise, the analysis results show that for concrete structures having a service life of 50 years, the service life decreases by about 5%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3achlorides 3acoasts 3aconcrete 3acorrosion 3acracking 3adurability 3aglobal warming 3aprobabilistic models 3aprobability 3asea level 3asteel1 aWang, Xiao-Yong0 tSustainability.g2017 Mar. 20, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90304603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01749naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245006900172300001600241520085300257592002801110650002501138650001401163650001301177650001801190700002101208700001901229700001901248773008701267856008401354852000901438655001201447IND60590435720221119200839.0180313e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059043572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2016.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajbanshi, Biplab10aEnergetic and electronic structure of penta-graphene nanoribbons  ap. 118-125.  aInspired by a very recent theoretical work on penta-graphene, a two dimensional (2D) carbon sheet [Proc. Nat. Acad.

Our first principle calculations predict that, pentaGNR is dynamically stable; it is mechanically flexible tolerating upto 11.5% of axial strain. We have also explored the electronic properties of the nanoribbons with different widths which show interesting charge separation for wider ribbons. The band gap of wider ribbons changes only marginally with further increasing the ribbon width which opens up the possibility of a stable nanoribbon with large band gap which is very useful for designing optoelectronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectrons 3agraphene 3ananomaterials1 aSarkar, Sunandan1 aMandal, Bikash1 aSarkar, Pranab0 tCarbon.g2016 Apr., v. 100 p.118-125dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2016.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01452naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245005800174300001600232500001900248520055000267592002800817650001100845650001400856650001100870653001100881653001200892653001700904653001300921773011000934856008501044852000901129655001201138IND60728245620221122125842.0210219e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072824562DNAL7 a10.1080/15528014.2020.18599242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrane, Jonathan K.10a“Eating Ethics”: cooking up a storm, academically  ap. 156-164.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTeaching about the ethical features of food and eating is perhaps best done through integrating experience and reflection.

We evaluated Agrotis ipsilon nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgipMNPV) for suppressing black cutworms, Agrotis ipsilon Hufnagel (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), in turf representative of golf course habitats and on whole tees under actual play. In independent trials on sand- or soil-based putting greens and surrounds, or fairway-height creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.), ≤1-wk-old AgipMNPV residues (10 × 108 occlusion bodies [OBs] per m2) typically gave 50–60% lethal infection of introduced third instars. In most cases, however, there was no residual control beyond 2–4 wk. Spraying fairway-height bentgrass with AgipMNPV alone (10 × 109 OBs per m2) gave 90, 85, and 7% infection of second instars introduced 4 d, 3 wk, or 5 wk later, but adjuvants (optical brightener, lignin, or both) intended to synergize and protect the virus from UV degradation did not extend infectivity. Fresh (<1-wk-old) AgipMNPV residues killed 76–86% of neonates hatching from eggs on tees under play, but levels of control plummeted within a few weeks. Three species of braconids, an encyrtid Copidosoma bakeri (Howard), and a tachinid, Bonnetia comta (Fallen) collectively killed 24–31% of larvae recovered from those tees. AgipMNPV seems better suited for targeted control of early instars than for season-long control.

Whereas arsenolite (As2O3) was the major host for As and Sb, other contaminants were bound in sulfides, arsenates, alloys and slag-like particles. The EU regulatory leaching test (EN 12457-2) indicated that leached As, Cd, Sb and Zn significantly exceeded the limit values for landfills accepting hazardous waste. The pH-dependent leaching test (CEN/TS 14997) revealed that As, Sb and Pb exhibited the greatest leaching at pH 11–12, whereas Cd, Cu and Zn were leached most under acidic condition (pH 3) and Bi leaching was pH-independent. Mineralogical investigation of leached residue coupled with geochemical modeling confirmed that newly formed Ca, Pb and Ca-Pb arsenates (mimetite, Pb5(AsO4)3Cl) partly control the release of As and other contaminants under circumneutral and alkaline conditions and will be of key importance for the fate of smelter-derived contamination in soils or when stabilization technology is employed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aalloys 3aantimony 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3aarsenic oxide 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acopper 3adust 3ahazardous waste 3alandfills 3aleaching 3alead 3amineralogy 3amodels 3apH 3asoil 3asolubility 3asulfides 3azinc 0aFlue dust 0aArsenic trioxide 0aCopper smelting 0aLeaching 0aControls1 aEttler, Vojtéch,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0151-00241 aMihaljevič, Martin1 aDrahota, Petr1 aCulka, Adam1 aRacek, Martin0 tJournal of environmental management.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 209 p.71-80dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.12.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002100094024002700115024001100142040001800153100003000171245013800201300001800339506017300357520103100530650002401561650001701585650001701602650001901619650001401638650002501652650001701677650002101694650001301715650001801728650001201746650001401758650004401772650001901816650001401835650001401849650001301863650001201876700002101888700002001909700002201929773012001951856011202071856007302183956009402256961000902350852000902359655001202368IND60006163120221117065153.0151027e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000616312DNAL7 a10113/616312hdl7 a10.1021/jf501653h2doi8 ans8597  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe la Cruz, Florentino B.10aChemical Changes during Anaerobic Decomposition of Hardwood, Softwood, and Old Newsprint under Mesophilic and Thermophilic Conditions  ap. 6362-6374.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe anaerobic decomposition of plant biomass is an important aspect of global organic carbon cycling. While the anaerobic metabolism of cellulose and hemicelluloses to methane and carbon dioxide are well-understood, evidence for the initial stages of lignin decomposition if fragmentary. The objective of this study was to look for evidence of chemical transformations of lignin in woody tissues [hardwood (HW), softwood (SW), and old newsprint (ONP)] after anaerobic decomposition using Klason and acid-soluble lignin, CuO oxidation, and 2D NMR. Tests were conducted under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, and lignin associations with structural carbohydrates are retained. For HW and ONP, the carbon losses could be attributed to cellulose and hemicelluloses, while carbon loss in SW was attributable to an uncharacterized fraction (e.g., extractives, etc.). The 2d NMR and chemical degradation methods revealed slight reductions in β-O-4 linkages for HW and ONP, with no depolymerization of lignin in any substrate. 3aacid soluble lignin 3aanaerobiosis 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3acellulose 3achemical degradation 3acupric oxide 3adepolymerization 3ahardwood 3ahemicellulose 3amethane 3anewsprint 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic carbon 3aoxidation 3aphytomass 3asoftwood 3atissues1 aYelle, Daniel J.1 aGracz, Hanna S.1 aBarlaz, Morton A.0 tJournal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.g2014 July 9, v. 62, no. 27 p.6362-6374wJournal:12177x0021-85617nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/616313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf501653h3Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/20151026132644.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011900161300002000280520089600300592002801196650001501224650001501239650000901254650002101263650001101284650001401295650001401309650001901323650001201342650001601354650002001370650002301390700002101413700002601434700003001460700002301490700002401513773012501537856007401662852000901736655001201745IND60666873520221122210144.0190919e20141104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066687352DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra09472g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvatori, Paolo10aStability of ruthenium/organic dye co-sensitized solar cells: a joint experimental and computational investigation  ap. 57620-57628.  aWe carried out a joint experimental and theoretical study of the stability of dye-sensitized solar cells using a mixture of black dye (N749) and a Y1 organic co-adsorbent. The aim of this work was to investigate the stability of these highly efficient sensitizers. The co-sensitized device showed remarkable stability under the conditions investigated (1100 h of about 1 Sun light soaking at 55 °C). The partial desorption of the organic co-adsorbent was identified as a possible cause of the slight reduction in the photocurrent value. Theoretical investigations on the dye-sensitized semiconductor surface using DFT methods showed a considerably lower adsorption energy for Y1 compared with N749, in particular upon oxidation, possibly leading to desorption of the dye under working conditions. The devices using only the Y1 organic dye consistently showed a considerably lower stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3adyes 3aelectric current 3aenergy 3aoxidation 3aruthenium 3asemiconductors 3asoaking 3asolar cells 3asolar radiation 3aworking conditions1 aAgrawal, Saurabh1 aBarreddi, Chiranjeevi1 aMalapaka, Chandrasekharam1 ade Borniol, Mervyn1 aDe Angelis, Filippo0 tRSC advances.g2014 Nov. 04, v. 4, no. 101 p.57620-57628dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra09472g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245009600176300001600272520167600288592002801964650001901992650001202011650002002023650001402043650001802057650001702075650002402092650001802116650001802134650001402152651001202166651001002178651001102188651001102199653001402210653001702224653001502241653001802256700002102274700002502295700002002320700002002340700002102360773011902381856008802500852000902588655001202597IND60606640420221120161513.0220124e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060664042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.11.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaniewski, Michał10a90Sr in King Bolete Boletus edulis and certain other mushrooms consumed in Europe and China  ap. 287-294.  aThe ⁹⁰Sr activity concentrations released from a radioactive fallout have been determined in a range of samples of mushrooms collected in Poland, Belarus, China, and Sweden in 1996–2013. Measurement of ⁹⁰Sr in pooled samples of mushrooms was carried out with radiochemical procedure aimed to pre-isolate the analyte from the fungal materials before it was determined using the Low-Level Beta Counter. Interestingly, the Purple Bolete Imperator rhodopurpureus collected from Yunnan in south-western China in 2012 showed ⁹⁰Sr activity concentration at around 10Bqkg⁻¹ dry biomass, which was greater when compared to other mushrooms in this study. The King Bolete Boletus edulis from China showed the ⁹⁰Sr activity in caps at around 1.5Bqkg⁻¹ dry biomass (whole fruiting bodies) in 2012 and for specimens from Poland activity was well lower than 1.0Bqkg⁻¹ dry biomass in 1998–2010. A sample of Sarcodonimbricatus collected in 1998 from the north-eastern region of Poland impacted by Chernobyl fallout showed ⁹⁰Sr in caps at around 5Bqkg⁻¹ dry biomass. Concentration of ⁹⁰Sr in Bay Bolete Royoporus (Xerocomus or Boletus) badius from affected region of Gomel in Belarus was in 2010 at 2.1Bqkg⁻¹ dry biomass. In several other species from Poland ⁹⁰Sr was at <0.5 to around 1.0Bqkg⁻¹ dry biomass. Activity concentrations of ⁹⁰Sr in popular B. edulis and some other mushrooms collected from wild in Poland were very low (<1Bqkg⁻¹ dry biomass), and values noted showed on persistence of this type of radioactivity in mushrooms over time passing from nuclear weapons tests and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant catastrophe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBoletus edulis 3abiomass 3afruiting bodies 3amushrooms 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3aradioactive fallout 3aradioactivity 3aradionuclides 3astrontium 3aBelarus 3aChina 3aPoland 3aSweden 0aMushrooms 0aOrganic food 0aWild foods 0aRadioactivity1 aZalewska, Tamara1 aKrasińska, Grażyna1 aSzylke, Natalia1 aWang, Yuanzhong1 aFalandysz, Jerzy0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 543 p.287-294dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.11.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013800173300001400311520133200325592002801657650001401685650001901699650001601718650001101734650001801745650001401763650001701777650002201794650000901816650001401825650002101839653001901860653002001879653002001899653001901919653002201938653001801960653002601978700002102004773011602025856008602141852000902227655001202236IND60593484120221119133801.0190206e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059348412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.12.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrăvălie, Remus10aNuclear energy: Between global electricity demand, worldwide decarbonisation imperativeness, and planetary environmental implications  ap. 81-92.  aFor decades, nuclear energy has been considered an important option for ensuring global energy security, and it has recently started being promoted as a solution for climate change mitigation. However, nuclear power remains highly controversial due to its associated risks – nuclear accidents and problematic radioactive waste management. This review aims to assess the viability of global nuclear energy economically (energy-wise), climatically and environmentally. To this end, the nuclear sector's energy- and climate-related advantages were explored alongside the downsides that mainly relate to radioactive pollution. Economically, it was found that nuclear energy is still an important power source in many countries around the world. Climatically, nuclear power is a low-carbon technology and can therefore be a viable option for the decarbonization of the world's major economies over the following decades, if coupled with other large-scale strategies such as renewable energies. These benefits are however outweighed by the radioactive danger associated to nuclear power plants, either in the context of the nuclear accidents that have already occurred or in that of the large amounts of long-lived nuclear waste that have been growing for decades and that represent a significant environmental and societal threat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aclimate change 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3anuclear power 3apollution 3apower plants 3aradioactive waste 3arisk 3aviability 3awaste management 0aNuclear energy 0aEnergy security 0aDecarbonisation 0aClimate change 0aNuclear accidents 0aNuclear waste 0aRadioactive pollution1 aBandoc, Georgeta0 tJournal of environmental management.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 209 p.81-92dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.12.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015200172300001800324520163300342592002801975650001302003650000902016650002802025650002302053650002102076650001302097650001502110650002502125650002502150653002302175653002902198653002802227653002502255700002202280700002902302773012402331856008502455852000902540655001202549IND60687161320221122105351.0200326e20200527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068716132DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2020.17298022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuʼmin, ʻAlī,10aAnalysis of the variations in dry matter yield and resource use efficiency of maize under different rates of nitrogen, phosphorous and water supply  ap. 1306-1319.  aIncreasing resources use efficiency in intensive cultivation systems of maize (Zea mays L.) can play an important role in increasing the production and sustainability of agricultural systems. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate DM yield and the efficiency of inputs uses under different levels of water, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in maize. Therefore, three levels of irrigation including 80 (ETc₈₀), 100 (ETc₁₀₀) and 120% (ETc₁₂₀) of crop evapotranspiration were considered as the main plots, and the factorial combination of three levels of zero (N₀), 200 (N₂₀₀) and 400 (N₄₀₀) kg N ha⁻¹ with three levels of zero (P₀), 100(P₁₀₀) and 200 (P₂₀₀) kg P ha⁻¹ was considered as the sub plots. The results showed that increasing the consumption of water and P was led to the reduction of N and P utilization efficiency, while RUE increased. WUE was also increased in response to application of N and P, but decreased when ETC increased. DM yield under ETc₈₀ treatment reduced by 11 and 12%, respectively, compared to ETc₁₀₀ and ETc₁₂₀ which was due to reduction of cumulative absorbed radiation (Rₐbₛ(cum)) and RUE. Under these conditions, changes of stomatal conductance (gs) had little effect on DM yield. It was also found that N limitation caused 11 and 20% reduction in DM yield compared to N₂₀₀ and N₄₀₀, respectively. This yield reduction was mainly the result of decrease in RUE. By decreasing Rₐbₛ(cum), P deficiency also reduced DM yield by 5 and 9%, respectively, relative to P₁₀₀ and P₂₀₀ treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3adry matter accumulation 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation rates 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3astomatal conductance 3awater use efficiency 0ahigh input systems 0anitrogen nutrition index 0aresource use efficiency 0aresources limitation1 aKoocheki, Alireza1 aMahallati, Mehdi Nassiri0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2020 May 27, v. 43, no. 9 p.1306-1319dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43215x1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2020.17298023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245012800173300001600301520158000317592002801897650002601925650001501951650001501966650001601981650002301997650002302020650003802043650001102081650001602092650002202108700002902130700002202159700002202181700002002203773013202223856008202355852000902437655001202446IND60616320120221119030208.0181016e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061632012DNAL7 a10.1177/1040638704016006022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaherchandani, Sunil14aThe Effect of Pooling Sera on the Detection of Avian Pneumovirus Antibodies using an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Test  ap. 497-502.  aPooling of samples is a cost-effective approach to estimate disease prevalence and to identify infected individuals. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of serum pools for the detection of avian pneumovirus infection in turkey flocks by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, so that a minimum number of tests can be performed without compromising the sensitivity and specificity of the test. A total of 900 field samples were tested; 20 samples from each of 45 flocks. All samples were tested individually followed by pool testing in groups of 3, 4, 5, and 7 samples each. The number of positive pools for a given pool size was positively associated with the number of positive samples. In a separate experiment, the effect of dilution was examined by pooling 1 positive sample with different numbers of negative samples to form pools of sizes 2–7. These laboratory results were analyzed and integrated into a simulation model aimed at evaluating cost-efficient testing procedures. The probability of detecting an infected flock depended on prevalence of infection, size of serum pool, and the cutoff value used for optical density difference. At a theoretical prevalence of 20%, the probability of detecting an infected flock was 0.93 and 0.86 for a pool of 2 and 7, respectively. The probability of detecting positive flocks increased with increased prevalence and decreased cutoff. Pooling of samples represented a significant reduction in the cost of testing, suggesting that pooling is more advantageous and cost effective than testing individual samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvian metapneumovirus 3aabsorbance 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3acost effectiveness 3adisease prevalence 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflocks 3aprobability 3asimulation models1 aMuñoz-Zanzi, Claudia A.1 aPatnayak, Devi P.1 aMalik, Yashpal S.1 aGoyal, Sagar M.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 16, no. 6 p.497-502dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638704016006023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012000168300001400288520103100302592002801333650002701361650001801388650001501406650001301421650001901434650002401453650001001477650001801487650001701505650001901522650001401541650001001555651001101565653001801576653001501594653000901609653001301618700002401631700002101655700002301676700002101699700002301720700002401743700002701767700002401794700002301818700002301841700002201864700002801886773011101914856008302025852000902108655001202117IND60534533020221119193733.0190318e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053453302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTopazio, Josué10aAntibodies to Leptospira interrogans in goats and risk factors of the disease in Santa Catarina (West side), Brazil  ap. 53-57.  aLeptospirosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Leptospira spp. In goats, the productive impact of leptospirosis is not well known and totally unknown in Santa Catarina (SC), Brazil. This study aimed to investigate leptospirosis seroprevalence and its risk factors in goats in the west side of SC. A total of 654 blood samples were analyzed using the microscopic agglutination technique and 35.47% (232) of the animals were seropositives. Except for serogroup Autumnalis, positive samples for all other serogroups were found as follows: Sejroe (Hardjo, Wolffi), Grippotyphosa (Grippotyphosa), Canicola (Canicola), Icterohaemorrhagiae (Icterohaemorrhagiae, Copenhageni), Australis (Australis, Bratislava) and Pomona (Pomona). The contact among sheep and goats, and the addition of concentrate as food supplement were found to be risk factors for leptospirosis. Based on these results, we conclude that there is a high occurrence of anti-Leptospira antibodies in goats in the Western part of Santa Catarina State.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptospira interrogans 3aagglutination 3aantibodies 3abacteria 3ablood sampling 3adietary supplements 3agoats 3aleptospirosis 3arisk factors 3aseroprevalence 3aserotypes 3asheep 3aBrazil 0aLeptospirosis 0aPrevalence 0aGoat 0aZoonosis1 aTonin, Alexandre A.1 aMachado, Gustavo1 aNoll, Jessica C.G.1 aRibeiro, André,1 aMoura, Anderson B.1 aCarmo, Guilherme M.1 aGrosskopf, Hyolanda M.1 aMartins, Jorge L.R.1 aBadke, Manoel R.T.1 aStefani, Lenita M.1 aLopes, Leandro S.1 aDa Silva, Aleksandro S.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2015 Apr., v. 99 p.53-57dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245011900164300001600283520168600299592002801985653002602013653001202039653001602051653002002067653001502087700001302102700001902115700001702134700001802151700001802169773013402187856007702321852000902398655001202407IND60681696820221120143802.0200226e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068169682DNAL7 a10.3920/WMJ2012.14112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeršilovskis, A.10aSimultaneous determination of masked forms of deoxynivalenol and zearalenone after oral dosing in rats by LC-MS/MS  ap. 303-318.  aIn vivo metabolism of masked or conjugated mycotoxins is poorly documented as standards are not commercially available and indirect analysis using hydrolytic enzymes is difficult to validate and cumbersome. We synthesised zearalenone-14-glucoside (ZEA-14G) chemically. Deoxynivalenol-3-glucuronide (DON-3GlcA) and glucuronides of 3- and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3- and 15-ADON-GlcAs), de-epoxydeoxynivalenol, zearalenone (ZEA), α- and β-zearalenol (α- and β-ZOL) were synthesised using rat microsomes. For the first time three ADON-GlcAs were synthesised: two 3-ADON-GlcAs and one 15-ADON-GlcA. After purification, the masked mycotoxin and the metabolites were characterised by NMR (DON-3GlcA, ZEA-14G) or by full scan MS, MS/MS fragmentation, UV-spectra, β-glucosidase and β-glucuronidase treatment. In a first experiment, rats were fed orally DON-3-glucoside (DON-3G) and ZEA-14G, together with ¹³C-DON and ¹³C-ZEA and were sacrificed after 55 minutes. A total of 21 masked metabolites, metabolites and parent mycotoxins were quantified in rat organs. Whereas DON-3G was hardly hydrolysed in the stomach, ZEA was clearly formed from ZEA-14G. In a second experiment, 3- and 15-ADON were given orally to rats. The acetylated forms of DON were hydrolysed in the stomach, in contrast to DON-3G. Rats can directly glucuronidate ADONs without deacetylation. Neither DOM, α- or β-ZOL nor their glucuronides could be quantified. Glucuronidated 3-ADON accumulated in the small intestines, together with DON-3GlcA in rats fed orally with 3- and 15-ADON. These differences in masked mycotoxins metabolism can be important in risk analysis of masked mycotoxins in food and feed.  aPublisher supplied data 0aconjugated mycotoxins 0ain vivo 0aglucuronide 0abioavailability 0aacetylated1 aGeys, J.1 aHuybrechts, B.1 aGoossens, E.1 aDe Saeger, S.1 aCallebaut, A.0 tWorld mycotoxin journal.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 5, no. 3 p.303-318dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl4395724x1875-07967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/WMJ2012.14113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245013600207300001400343500001900357520097700376592002801353650001501381650001101396650002101407650001301428650001701441650000901458650002301467650001301490653003501503653001801538653003001556653004301586653002601629700001301655700005601668700005401724700001801778773008801796856008501884852000901969655001201978IND60728902920221117160713.0210415e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072890292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2021.02.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yixing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9676-299510aEvolutionary optimization design of honeycomb metastructure with effective mechanical resistance and broadband microwave absorption  ap. 79-89.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicrowave absorbing materials are of great importance on stealth technology, electromagnetic compatibility and radiation protection. The narrow absorption bandwidth restricts its further applications. Herein, the glass fiber (GF)/carbon fiber (CF) reinforced honeycomb metastructure (HM) consisting of carbonyl iron (CI) particles, multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and epoxy resin (EP) is designed by the evolutionary optimization (EO) program based on the proposed large mutation genetic algorithms (LMGA) and fabricated by vacuum bag techniques. The HM with and without GF achieves −10dB absorption bandwidth in 2–20.37 GHz and 2.76–40 GHz respectively. Wide-angle absorption in 0°–45° is realized. The GF/CF reinforced HM exhibits tensile and three-point flexural strength of 80.03 MPa and 34.66 MPa respectively. The integration of electromagnetic absorption and mechanical resistance is successful with the proposed design and fabrication methodology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aepoxides 3aglass fibers 3airon 3amodulus of rupture 3amutation 0aBroadband microwave absorption 0aMetastructure 0aEvolutionary optimization 0aMechanical-electromagnetic integration 0aNano lossy composites1 aWu, Dong1 aChen, Mingji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4337-95191 aZhang, Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5225-24191 aFang, Daining0 tCarbon.g2021 June 15, v. 177 p.79-89dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.02.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002900169245016300198300001800361520071000379592002801089650001701117650001601134650001801150650000701168650002901175650004101204650002001245650007201265650002201337650002701359650003101386650003101417650001801448650002301466700001301489700002101502700002101523700002201544700002001566700002001586700002101606773009101627856008401718990002301802852000901825655001201834IND60087434020221122031645.0141102e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008743402DNAL7 a232074342pmid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2012.11.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Montferrand, Caroline10aIron oxide nanoparticles with sizes, shapes and compositions resulting in different magnetization signatures as potential labels for multiparametric detection  ap. 6150-6157.  aMagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles differing in their size, shape (spherical, hexagonal, rods, cubes) and composition have been synthesized and modified using caffeic acid for transfer to aqueous media and stabilization of the particle suspensions at physiological pH.

Focusing specifically on the mobilization of urban space for food provisioning and microenterprise, we theorize markets beyond the singular narrative of capital accumulation. Given the particular moment of its publication – which comes almost one year after the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus to be a pandemic in March 2020 – our introduction probes the impact of COVID-19 on food vendors as well as on the cities that sustain them. Drawing on examples from cities such as New Delhi, New York City, Los Angeles and beyond, we comment on how the pandemic has unleashed threats to livelihoods and liveliness, and we also draw attention to the possibility of new social and economic opportunities in this moment of crisis, including innovative uses of urban space.  aThis work was supported by the NYU Provost’s Global Seed Grant for Collaborative Research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aWorld Health Organization 3acapital 3apandemic 3astreet foods 3aIndia 3aNew York 0aStreet vending 0amarkets 0afood 0ainformal labor 0alivelihood 0aglobal South 0aCOVID-19 0amigration1 aRay, Krishnendu1 aRohel, Jaclyn0 tFood, culture, & society.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 24, no. 1 p.2-15dRoutledgewJournal:2182x1751-74437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15528014.2020.18604543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245012900157500002000286520178600306592002802092650001602120650001302136650001502149650001102164650001302175700001902188773012502207856007602332852000902408655001202417IND60792802120221120132244.0220909e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079280212DNAL7 a10.1029/2008JB0057492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ting10aScaling of small repeating earthquakes explained by interaction of seismic and aseismic slip in a rate and state fault model  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBecause of short recurrence times and known locations, small repeating earthquakes present a rare predictable opportunity for detailed field observations. They are used to study fault creeping velocities, earthquake nucleation, stress drops, and other aspects of tectonophysics, earthquake mechanics, and seismology. An intriguing observation about repeating earthquakes is their scaling of recurrence time with seismic moment, which is significantly different from the scaling based on a simple conceptual model of circular ruptures with stress drop independent of seismic moment and no aseismic slip. Here we show that a model of repeating earthquakes based on laboratory‐derived rate and state friction laws reproduces the observed scaling. In the model, a small fault patch governed by steady state velocity‐weakening friction is surrounded by a much larger velocity‐strengthening region. Long‐term slip behavior of the fault is simulated using a methodology that fully accounts for both aseismic slip and inertial effects of occasional seismic events. The model results in repeating earthquakes with typical stress drops and sizes comparable with observations. For a fixed set of friction parameters, the observed scaling is reproduced by varying the size of the velocity‐weakening patch. In simulations, a significant part of slip on the velocity‐weakening patches is accumulated aseismically, even though the patches also produce seismic events. The proposed model supplies a laboratory‐based framework for interpreting the wealth of observations about repeating earthquakes, provides indirect evidence that rate and state friction acts on natural faults, and has important implications for possible scenarios of slip partition into seismic and aseismic parts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aearthquakes 3afriction 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch1 aLapusta, Nadia0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2009 Jan., v. 114, no.

Subsequently, we used Cox proportional models that included the same confounders to evaluate the associations between specific amino acid intake and hypertension incidence.Results: Glutamic acid contributed most to protein intake (21% of protein), whereas lysine provided 7%, arginine 5%, tyrosine 4%, and cysteine 1.5%. A higher intake of tyrosine (∼0.3% of protein) was significantly related to a 2.4-mm Hg lower systolic BP (P-trend = 0.05) but not to diastolic BP (P = 0.35). The other amino acids were not significantly associated with BP levels in a cross-sectional analysis. During 6 y of follow-up (7292 person-years), 873 cases of hypertension developed. None of the amino acids were significantly associated with incident hypertension (HR: 0.81–1.18; P-trend > 0.2).Conclusion: Our data do not suggest a major role for glutamic acid, arginine, lysine, tyrosine, or cysteine intake (as % of protein intake) in determining population BP or risk of hypertension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol drinking 3aarginine 3ablood pressure 3abody mass index 3aclinical nutrition 3acysteine 3adietary protein 3aeducation 3aglutamic acid 3ahypertension 3alysine 3amodels 3aprotein intake 3arisk 3atyrosine1 aEngberink, Marielle F1 aDe Neve, Melissa1 avan Rooij, Frank JA1 aHofman, A.,1 avan't Veer, Pieter1 aWitteman, Jacqueline CM1 aFranco, Oscar H1 aGeleijnse, Johanna M0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2013 Feb., v. 97, no. 2 p.403-410dAmerican Society for Clinical NutritionwJournal:jnl45206x0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.112.0387373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245011700171300001600288520135600304592002801660650001501688650001501703650001401718650001101732650002301743650000901766650001101775650001501786650002101801650002601822650002801848650001201876650001401888650002901902700002201931700002701953700001901980700001801999700002202017700002402039773010202063856008302165990002302248852000902271655001202280IND60098183520221123041903.0141104e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009818352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElmehdawi, Fatima10aHuman Homolog of Drosophila Ariadne (HHARI) is a marker of cellular proliferation associated with nuclear bodies  ap. 161-172.  aHHARI (also known as ARIH1) is an ubiquitin-protein ligase and is the cognate of the E2, UbcH7 (UBE2L3). To establish a functional role for HHARI in cellular proliferation processes, we performed a reverse genetics screen that identified n=86/522 (16.5%) ubiquitin conjugation components that have a statistically significant effect on cell proliferation, which included HHARI as a strong hit. We then produced and validated a panel of specific antibodies that establish HHARI as both a nuclear and cytoplasmic protein that is expressed in all cell types studied. HHARI was expressed at higher levels in nuclei, and co-localized with nuclear bodies including Cajal bodies (p80 coilin, NOPP140), PML and SC35 bodies. We confirmed reduced cellular proliferation after ARIH1 knockdown with individual siRNA duplexes, in addition to significantly increased levels of apoptosis, an increased proportion of cells in G2 phase of the cell cycle, and significant reductions in total cellular RNA levels. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma biopsies, there are higher levels of HHARI expression associated with increased levels of proliferation, compared to healthy control tissues. We demonstrate that HHARI is associated with cellular proliferation, which may be mediated through its interaction with UbcH7 and modification of proteins in nuclear bodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aantibodies 3aapoptosis 3abiopsy 3acell proliferation 3ahead 3ahumans 3ainterphase 3anuclear proteins 3asmall interfering RNA 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3atissues 3aubiquitin 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aWheway, Gabrielle1 aSzymańska, Katarzyna,1 aAdams, Matthew1 aHigh, Alec S.1 aJohnson, Colin A.1 aRobinson, Philip A.0 tExperimental cell research.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 319, no. 3 p.161-172dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.10.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012100159300002000280520102900300592002801329650001601357650001901373650001001392650001201402650001401414650001301428650001901441650002101460650001301481650002101494650002001515700002301535700002401558700002001582773012501602856007401727852000901801655001201810IND60666873920221122210103.0190919e20141107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066687392DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra09481f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAjish, Juby K.10ad-Glucose based bisacrylamide crosslinker: synthesis and study of homogeneous biocompatible glycopolymeric hydrogels  ap. 59370-59378.  aThe ability of sugar pendants in glycopolymers to mimic that on the cell surface can be used as a reliable method for the site specific delivery of drugs.

The Glc-gel was subjected to swelling studies, viscoelastic, and thermal analysis. The in vitro cytotoxicity test revealed that the constituents (Glc-acryl and Glc-bis) as well as the Glc-gel were non toxic to the cells and the cells grew normally in their presence.

The quasi‐two‐dimensional analogue model features rate‐ and state‐dependent elastic‐frictional plastic and viscoelastic material properties and is scaled for gravity, inertia, elasticity, friction, and viscosity. The experiments are monitored with a high‐resolution strain analysis tool based on digital image correlation (particle imaging velocimetry, PIV), providing deformation time series comparable to seismologic, geodetic, and geologic observations. In order to separate elastic and nonelastic effects inherent the experimental deformation patterns, we integrate elastic dislocation modeling (EDM) into a hybrid approach: we use the analogue earthquake slip and interseismic locking distribution as EDM dislocation input and forward model the coseismic and interseismic elastic response. The residual, which remains when the EDM prediction is subtracted from the experimental deformation pattern, highlights the accumulation of permanent deformation in the model. The setup generates analogue earthquake sequences with realistic source mechanisms and elastic forearc response and recurrence patterns and reproduces principal earthquake scaling relations. By applying the model to an accretionary‐type plate margin, we demonstrate how strain localization at the rupture peripheries may lead to a seismotectonically segmented forearc, including a tectonically stable shelf and coastal high (<20% plate convergence accommodated by internal shortening) overlying the area of large megathrust earthquake slip. Fifty to 75% of plate convergence is accommodated by internal shortening in the slope region where earthquake slip tapers out toward the trench. The inner forearc region remains undeformed and represents a basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adeformation 3adigital images 3aearthquakes 3aevolution 3afriction 3ageodesy 3ageophysics 3agravity 3amodels 3aplastics 3aprediction 3aresearch 3asubduction 3atime series analysis 3avelocimetry 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscosity1 aLohrmann, Jo1 aOncken, O.,0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2009 Jan., v. 114, no.

The role of the oxygen-containing functional group on the surface of GO with different oxidation degrees have been studied for obtaining MoSx/GO with excellent electrochemical activity for HER. The electrochemical measurements show that MoSx/GO using the medium degree of oxidation of GO as matrix exhibits best electrocatalytic activity for HER with a small overpotential of ∼195 mV at the current density of 20 mA cm⁻². A tafel slope of ∼47.7 mV per decade is obtained for MoSx/GO modified electrode. The turnover frequency per active site is calculated. Both the amount of active sites for HER and conductivity of the electrocatalyst have been greatly improved owing to the good dispersion and conductivity provided by GO matrix. Therefore, this work suggested that choosing GO with suitable oxidation degree as support is the key for synthesizing MoSx based electrocatalysts with enhanced HER activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen production 3amoieties 3aoxidation1 aShang, Xiao1 aHan, Guan-Qun1 aDong, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4817-62891 aLiu, Yan-Ru1 aLi, Xiao1 aChai, Yong-Ming1 aLiu, Yun-Qi1 aLiu, Chen-Guang0 tCarbon.g2016 Apr., v. 100 p.236-242dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2016.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245009600161300001800257500001900275520131200294592002801606650002401634650001401658650001301672650001701685650002301702650001901725650001901744700001701763700001301780700001901793700001301812700005301825700001701878700005901895700005601954773013602010856008002146852000902226655001202235IND60733732020221116211527.0210411e20210324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073373202DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c014632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Gang10aTailored Electronic Band Gap and Valance Band Edge of Nickel Oxide via p-Type Incorporation  ap. 7495-7501.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA p-type semiconductor candidate of nickel oxide (NiO) desires longer carrier lifetimes with suitable conduction band edge, which holds a unique advantage to drive the hydrogen evolution toward efficient water splitting. However, a relatively large band gap (∼4 eV) greatly hinders its practical applications. We thus theoretically explore the band edge tailoring of NiO by doping electron-poor S on the sites of O. With the increase of incorporated S density, the electronic band gap (Eg) of p-type-doped NiO is reduced with the improved valance band maximum (VBM), which is dominated by the emerged S 3p orbital hybridized with Ni t₂g states. Accordingly, the hole transportation might be enhanced due to the enlarged VBM offset between the active layer and NiO₁–ₓSₓ. Furthermore, the magnetic momentum per Ni atom increases with the increase of S densities, owing to the p-type-doping-induced majority and minority spin mismatch. It is confirmed that the VBM of NiO with S density lower than 2.08% consists of S 3p and Ni t₂g states with majority spin. Moreover, as a turning point, the special quasirandom structure (SQS) with S density as high as 2.78% shows a balanced spin feature, while the states with minority spin play a predominant role in the VBM with S density higher than 8.33%.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrogen production 3amagnetism 3amomentum 3anickel oxide 3aphysical chemistry 3asemiconductors 3atransportation1 aZheng, Jinju1 aXu, Boyi1 aZhang, Chaonan1 aZhu, Yue1 aFang, Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7312-71311 aYang, Zuobao1 aShang, Ming-Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9808-21791 aYang, Weiyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3607-35140 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 24, v. 125, no. 13 p.7495-7501dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c014633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003000138245018700168300001800355500001900373500002000392520122600412592002801638596009801666650001901764650002101783650001801804650001401822650004101836650001001877650003301887650002501920650001901945650001301964700002901977700002602006700002502032700006202057773013602119856007202255852000902327655001202336IND60739329720221122033639.0210527e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073932972DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.50202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalgıç Bozyiğit, Gamze10aAccurate Quantification of Nervous System Drugs in Aqueous Samples at Trace Levels by Binary Solvent Dispersive Liquid–Liquid Microextraction‐Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry  ap. 1570-1575.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPharmaceutical products are widely consumed globally and are commonly found in wastewaters as a result of constant excretion and disposal into sewers. The present study proposes an efficient binary solvent dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (BS‐DLLME) method that was developed for preconcentration of 7 nervous system drug active compounds from aqueous media for their determination at trace levels by gas chromatography‐mass spectrometry. The drug analytes included 3 antidepressants, 2 antipsychotics, 1 antiepileptic, and 1 antidementia. Optimum conditions of the BS‐DLLME method were acquired by univariate optimization of parameters including type of binary solvents, ratio of binary solvents, type of disperser solvent, volume of binary solvents, and volume of disperser solvent. Detection and quantification limits were calculated in the range of 0.28 to 6.5 µg/L. Municipal wastewater, medical wastewater, synthetic domestic wastewater, and lake water were utilized as real samples in spike recovery experiments; and the results (94–106%) indicated the method's applicability and accuracy at quantifying the analytes in complex matrices.

Among all soy isoflavones and their metabolites, (S)-equol is known for having the strongest estrogenic activity. Equol is a metabolite of the soy isoflavone daidzein produced through intestinal bacterial metabolism. However, more than half of the human population is not able to produce equol due to the lack of equol-producing bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract. The interpersonal variations in the gut microbiome complicate the interpretation of data collected from humans. Furthermore, because rodents are efficient equol-producers, translatability between rodent models and humans is challenging. Herein, we first summarized the current knowledge of the microbial conversion of daidzein to equol, its relation to health, and proposed the need for developing model systems by which equol production can be manipulated while controlling other known confounding factors. Determining the necessity of equol-producing capacity within a gut microbial community when consuming soy as a functional ingredient, and identifying strategies to maximize equol production by modulating the gut microbiome, may provide future therapeutic approaches to improve the health of postmenopausal women.  aPublisher supplied data 3adaidzein 3adigestive tract 3aestrogenic properties 3aestrogens 3ahuman population 3aingredients 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amicrobial communities 3apostmenopause 3arodents 3atherapeutics1 aChoi, Mun Sun1 aCross, Tzu-Wen L.0 tNutrients.g2022 Jan. 27, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140305533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245008300164300001800247500001900265520127100284592002801555650002401583650001901607650002301626650001901649650002301668650002601691700001401717700001601731700001901747700001901766700004001785700001801825700001201843700002001855700005401875773013601929856008002065852000902145655001202154IND60733732220221116211221.0210411e20210330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073373222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c017572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Qinchao10aAg@MIL-101(Cr) Film Substrate with High SERS Enhancement Effect and Uniformity  ap. 7297-7304.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSurface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), owing to its high sensitivity and rapid response, has been widely used in various fields. However, it is still a challenge to prepare SERS substrates with high stability and reproducibility. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), with excellent enrichment capacity and stability, provide a new material for high-performance SERS substrates. In this paper, we prepare a MIL-101(Cr) film via a secondary growth method, and Ag⁺ is reduced to Ag NPs by UV irradiation and attach to the film to synthesize the Ag@MIL-101(Cr) film SERS substrate. Then, we change the time of UV light illumination and the amount of silver nitrate in order to obtain the optimal substrate. The detection capability of this sample can be up to 10–¹¹ M for 4-ATP, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) is only about 5%, which demonstrates that the substrate has excellent SERS effect and reproducibility. Finally, the prepared substrate has been applied for the determination of nitrofurantoin, with its detection capability up to 10–⁷ M. This work proposes a simple method to synthesize MOF-based film substrate with high SERS performance and uniformity and provides potential for the sensitive detection of chemical or antibiotic residue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic residues 3anitrofurantoin 3aphysical chemistry 3asilver nitrate 3astandard deviation 3aultraviolet radiation1 aZhang, De1 aWang, Cai-e1 aTang, Zhexiang1 aZou, Mingqiang1 aYang, Shelby X.q(Shelby Xiaobing),1 aGong, Huaping1 aYu, Zhi1 aJin, Shangzhong1 aLiang, Pei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2493-22380 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 30, v. 125, no. 13 p.7297-7304dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c017573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011900155300001600274500001400290520148600304592002801790650000801818650002101826650002801847650001401875650001401889650002401903650001701927650002601944650003101970650001002001650002502011650001302036650001502049650001702064650001302081650002202094700002102116700001602137700001802153700001602171700001202187700002002199700001802219773012202237856007402359852000902433655001202442IND60726246520221121055655.0210203e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072624652DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo02265a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Fan10aMulti-omics reveals the anticancer mechanism of asparagus saponin-asparanin A on endometrial cancer Ishikawa cells  ap. 614-632.  aNAL-light  aEndometrial cancer (EC) is a malignancy that severely threatens women's health and there is an urgent need to find novel natural compounds as effective treatment drugs. At the same time, multi-omics analysis of cells has been widely used in basic research to find new pathogenesis and mechanisms. Due to the lack of data on the functional importance of mRNAs and miRNAs in plant-derived asparanin A (AA) induced cancer cells, the underlying mechanisms of AA on endometrial cancer (EC) Ishikawa cells were investigated using mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq, qRT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. The combined analysis of 37 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and 489 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with negative regulatory relationships revealed that AA not only induced apoptosis, but also triggered autophagy through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and DNA damage-related pathways. 23 DEMs and 39 DEGs participated in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (PPER) and p53 signaling pathways, as shown by miRNA–target gene network analyses. Among them, we concluded that miR-6236-p5, miR-1246-p5, miR-11987_L-1, PC-5p-21544, and miR-5100-p3_1ss17TC function as hub miRNAs, and their regulation may be essential for the anti-cancer activity of AA. This study may provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential anticancer regulation of AA on EC, suggesting AA as a potential candidate for dietary supplementation in cancer medication and prevention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aWestern blotting 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3adietary supplements 3adrug therapy 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amicroRNA 3amultiomics 3apathogenesis 3aresearch 3auterine neoplasms1 aZhang, Yuan-Yuan1 aMa, Run-Hui1 aThakur, Kiran1 aHan, Jinzhi1 aHu, Fei1 aZhang, Jian-Guo1 aWei, Zhao-Jun0 tFood & function.g2021 Feb. 1, v. 12, no. 2 p.614-632dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo02265a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011000165300001600275500001900291520149600310592002801806650000801834650002501842650002601867650001701893650001401910650001001924650001401934650001601948650001401964650001701978651001201995700001902007700001702026700002102043700001902064700001902083700001802102700001802120773011602138856008102254852000902335655001202344IND60740678220221116234620.0210604e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074067822DNAL7 a10.3103/S00954527210300752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPirko, Ya.

(synonym P. glumarum Erikss. et Henn.) is a dangerous factor contributing to significantly lower yields of common wheat grain and its poor quality. Recent studies indicate that highly virulent strains of yellow rust expand their range from the near-Himalayan region and replace less pathogenic European races of P. striiformis, posing a real danger to the agricultural sector in Europe, including Ukraine, since most wheat varieties resistant to local races of P. striiformis are susceptible to these new highly virulent strains. In this regard, we assessed resistance to the yellow rust pathogen in 558 cultivars and lines of winter common wheat, in particular, 171 in the infection background and 387 in the natural background. Winter wheat samples in the collection variety trials originated from 17 countries, although most of them were of Ukrainian breeding. Screening of winter wheat cultivars and lines for yellow rust resistance showed that only 19 (or 3%) samples exhibited appropriate resistance. Analysis of the yellow rust-resistant wheat specimens using molecular markers for the Yr10 and Yr36 genes did not reveal samples containing either of these genes. At the same time, screening using molecular markers Xbarc8, S23M41-310, S23M41-140, and dp269 indicated the presence of DNA fragments of various lengths associated with resistance alleles of the genes Yr5, Yr15, and YrSp in four cultivars of Ukrainian breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPuccinia striiformis 3aagricultural industry 3acell biology 3acultivars 3afungi 3apathogens 3astripe rust 3avirulence 3awinter wheat 3aUkraine1 aKarelov, A.

With this aim, we have selected the imine-linked 3D COFs COF-300 and LZU-111 as examples of flexible and rigid frameworks, respectively. Optimized syntheses at room temperature or in solvothermal conditions enabled us to selectively isolate the narrow-pore form of COF-300 (COF-300-rt) or a mixture of the narrow-pore and a larger-pore form (COF-300-st), respectively, with different textural properties (BET specific surface area = 39 or 1270 m²/g, respectively, from N₂ adsorption at 77 K). In the case of LZU-111, only the room temperature route was successful, leading to the known microporous framework. COF-300-rt, COF-300-st, and LZU-111 were studied for benzene and cyclohexane adsorption and separation in static and dynamic conditions. At 298 K and 1 bar, these COFs adsorb more benzene (251, 221, and 214 cm³/g STP, respectively) than cyclohexane (175, 133, and 164 cm³/g STP, respectively). Moreover, the benzene and cyclohexane isotherms of COF-300-rt and COF-300-st are characterized by steps, as expected with a flexible material. Indeed, in situ powder X-ray diffraction experiments on benzene- and cyclohexane-impregnated batches enabled us to trap, for the first time, a sequence of forms of COF-300 with different pore aperture, rationalizing the stepped hysteretic isotherms. Finally, benzene/cyclohexane separation was evaluated using a benzene/cyclohexane 50:50 v/v flow at different temperatures (T = 298, 323, and 348 K): LZU-111 does not selectively retain any of the two components, while COF-300 exhibits stronger benzene–COF interactions also in dynamic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aMS2021-190cEuropean Commissiondhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000780  aNAcUniversit? degli Studi dell'Insubriadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005389  a5834cUniversidad de Granadadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006393  aP18-RT-618cConsejer?a de Conocimiento, Investigaci?n y Universidad, Junta de Andaluc?adhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018943  aFJC2020-045043-IcAgencia Estatal de Investigaci?n,Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovaci?n y Universidadesdhttps://doi.org/NA  aGo4ITc, Fondazione CRUIdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3abenzene 3acyclohexanes 3aporous media 3asurface area 0acovalent organic frameworks 0aCOF-300 0aLZU-111 0aliquid organic hydrogen carriers 0agas separation1 aRoldan-Molina, Esther1 aVismara, Rebecca1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9474-76711 aGalli, Simona1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0335-57071 aNavarro, Jorge A.

Solute binding proteins (SBPs) facilitate the transport of the first reactant in a metabolic pathway, thereby constraining the regions of chemical space and the chemistries that must be considered for pathway reconstruction. We describe high-throughput protein production and differential scanning fluorimetry platforms, which enabled the screening of 158 SBPs against a 189 component library specifically tailored for this class of proteins. Like all screening efforts, this approach is limited by the practical constraints imposed by construction of the library, i.e., we can study only those metabolites that are known to exist and which can be made in sufficient quantities for experimentation. To move beyond these inherent limitations, we illustrate the promise of crystallographic- and mass spectrometric-based approaches for the unbiased use of entire metabolomes as screening libraries. Together, our approaches identified 40 new SBP ligands, generated experiment-based annotations for 2084 SBPs in 71 isofunctional clusters, and defined numerous metabolic pathways, including novel catabolic pathways for the utilization of ethanolamine as sole nitrogen source and the use of d-Ala-d-Ala as sole carbon source. These efforts begin to define an integrated strategy for realizing the full value of amassing genome sequence data.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding proteins 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon 3aethanolamine 3afluorometry 3aligands 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3anitrogen 3anucleotide sequences 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 3asolutes1 aAl-Obaidi, Nawar1 aZhao, Suwen1 aSan Francisco, Brian1 aKim, Jungwook1 aWichelecki, Daniel

Super-filling prevents amorphization of the host material up to at least 60 GPa, which is a record pressure for zeolites and also for any group IV element being in full 4-fold coordination, except for carbon. We find that the inserted H₂ forms an exotic topologically constrained glassy-like form, otherwise unattainable in pure hydrogen. Raman spectroscopy on confined H₂ shows that the microporosity of the zeolite is retained over the entire investigated pressure range (up to 80 GPa) and that intermolecular interactions share common aspects with bulk hydrogen, while they are also affected by the zeolite framework.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon 3ahydrogen 3azeolites1 aLiu, Xiao-Di1 aPeña-Alvarez, Miriam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7056-71581 aJiang, Hua-Chao1 aDalladay-Simpson, Philip1 aCoasne, Benoit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3933-97441 aHaines, Julien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7030-32131 aGregoryanz, Eugene1 aSantoro, Mario1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5693-46360 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 29, v. 125, no. 13 p.7511-7517dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c021773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245008100176300001600257520136400273592002801637650002501665650001101690650001201701650001901713650001501732650002301747650001601770650002601786650001701812650002901829650002101858650001101879650001101890650001201901651001001913700001901923700002201942773008601964856008802050990002302138852000902161655001202170IND60099387520221123025934.0141105e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009938752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoy, Lennon H.T.10aToward a low carbon Hong Kong: A proposal from the institutional perspective  ap. 124-129.  aClimate change adversely affects people’s life in many aspects all over the world. While it is a natural phenomenon, it is also induced by human activities that include the use of fossil fuels for combustion in daily life, emitting greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As the balance of climate system has been disturbed, it is not surprising that extreme weather events, such as very hot days and flooding, occur more frequently and more intensive than ever. Hong Kong, as an international city, should shoulder its responsibility of controlling the emissions of greenhouse gases. Using the Hong Kong annual data from 1990 to 2008, this article estimates a simple econometric model to demonstrate that electricity consumption is the major factor contributing to the variations in CO₂ emissions. To complement the traditional ways to reduce CO₂ emissions by restricting the consumption of electricity and other fuel, we propose two alternative methods to reduce electricity consumption by: (1) charging the supply of electricity at progressive rates for commercial and industrial end-users; and (2) setting up a cap and trade market for greenhouse gas emissions by local electricity companies. Both methods offer incentives to electricity users to self-discipline themselves to restrict the demand for electricity, hence reducing CO₂ emissions in turn.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acombustion 3aeconometric models 3aelectricity 3aenvironmental markets 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahumans 3apeople 3aweather 3aChina1 aHo, Winky K.O.1 aMak, Stephen W.K.0 tHabitat international.g2013 Jan., v. 37 p.124-129dElsevier Ltdx0197-39757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2011.12.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007900166300001600245520106100261592002801322650002201350650001101372650001601383650001701399650001201416653003101428653003901459653004201498653002301540700002201563700001601585700001601601773009701617856008501714852000901799655001201808IND60749089420221121163211.0211017e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074908942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2021.08.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbón, A.12aA comparative study between racking systems for photovoltaic power systems  ap. 424-437.  aWe present a comparative study of the different racking systems used in photovoltaic power systems, with a new methodology for determining the total energy produced by each one under usual weather conditions (not clear-skies). In systems without solar tracker, the tilt angle is a major factor contributing to the energy production, and its optimization is essential. We study the effect of tilt update frequency (daily, monthly, or constant) on the total irradiation received by a plane surface, and present a method for computing the optimal tilt angle, which we validate using previous studies. This method is easily implemented, accurate, and valid for any location. We compare all the systems with the most energy-productive one, the dual-axis tracker, in two ways: with respect to energy production, and to levelized cost of energy, both in 39 cities around the World. The results provide a new insight on the relative and objective value of trackerless systems, and some remarkable properties arise, which may be relevant in budgetary consideration.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomparative study 3aenergy 3airradiation 3asolar energy 3aweather 0aPhotovoltaic power systems 0aRacking systems with solar tracker 0aRacking systems without solar tracker 0aOptimum tilt angle1 aAyuso, P.

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study was designed for elementary schoolchildren, grades 1 to 3, in Vietnam. LC-Plasma or a control were administered to schoolchildren as a beverage (1.0 × 10¹¹ count LC-Plasma/day/person). The primary endpoint was to determine the efficacy of LC-Plasma in reducing the cumulative days absent from school due to upper respiratory disease (URID) and gastrointestinal disease (GID), and the secondary endpoint was to evaluate the potency of LC-Plasma on URID/GID symptoms and general well-being scores. LC-Plasma intake significantly reduced the cumulative days absent from school due to URID/GID (Odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, p = 0.004) and URID alone (OR = 0.56, p = 0.005); LC-Plasma also significantly reduced the number of cumulative fever positive days during the first 4 weeks of intervention (OR = 0.58, p = 0.001) and cumulative days with diarrhea during the last 4 weeks of the intervention period (OR = 0.78, p = 0.01). The number of positive general wellbeing days was significantly improved in the LC-Plasma group compared with the control throughout the intervention period (OR = 0.93, 0.93, p = 0.03, 0.04 in the first and last 4 weeks of the intervention, respectively). These data suggest that LC-Plasma seems to improve the health condition of elementary schoolchildren and reduces school absenteeism due to infectious disease, especially URID.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactococcus lactis 3abeverages 3adiarrhea 3afever 3agastrointestinal diseases 3ainfectious diseases 3aodds ratio 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aVietnam1 aMai, Truong Tuyet1 aTrang, Tran Thị Thu1 aNguyen, Anh Tuan,1 aQuyen, Tran Chau1 aHanh, Nguyen Lien1 aHoan, Nguyen Huu1 aLan, Bui Thi Huong1 aHau, Phung Thi1 aTue, Ha Huy1 aDung, Truong Viet1 aTsuji, Ryohei 1 aWatanabe, Yuta 1 aYamamoto, Naoki 1 aKanauchi, Osamu 0 tNutrients.g2022 Jan. 27, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140305523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005900144245009600203300002000299500001900319520179900338592002802137650001502165650001202180650003002192650001302222650000902235650001602244650001602260650001302276653000802289653003302297653002302330653002802353653003202381653002302413700005802436700005602494700002102550700001302571700001602584700002502600700005602625773014202681856007802823852000902901655001202910IND60715823320221121054659.0201104e20201020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071582332DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c145952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aʻAlī, Roshan,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7948-083310aCompositional Engineering Study of Lead-Free Hybrid Perovskites for Solar Cell Applications  ap. 49636-49647.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (HOIPs), especially CH₃NH₃PbI₃ (MAPbI₃), have received tremendous attention due to their excellent power conversion efficiency (25.2%). However, two fundamental hurdles, long-term stability and lead (Pb) toxicity, prevent HOIPs from practical applications in the solar industry. To overcome these issues, compositional engineering has been used to modify cations at A- and B-sites and anions at the X-site in the general form ABX₃. In this work, we used the density functional theory (DFT) to incorporate Rb, Cs, and FA at the A-site to minimize the volatile nature of MA, while the highly stable Ca²⁺ and Sr²⁺ were mixed with the less stable Ge²⁺ and Sn²⁺ at the B-site to obtain a Pb-free perovskite. To further enhance the stability, we mixed the X-site anions (I/Br). Through this approach, we introduced 20 new perovskite species to the lead-free perovskite family and 7 to the lead-containing perovskite family. The molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, enthalpy formation, and tolerance and octahedral factor study confirm that all of the perovskite alloys we introduced here are as stable as pristine MAPbI₃. All Pb-free perovskites have suitable and direct band gaps (1.42–1.77 eV) at the Γ-point, which are highly desirable for solar cell applications. Most of our Pb-free perovskites have smaller effective masses and exciton binding energies. Finally, we show that the introduced perovskites have high absorption coefficients (10⁵ cm–¹) and strong absorption efficiencies (above 90%) in a wide spectral range (300–1200 nm), reinforcing their significant potential applications. This study provides a new way of searching for stable lead-free perovskites for sustainable and green energy applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acalcium 3adensity functional theory 3aenthalpy 3alead 3asolar cells 3asolar farms 3atoxicity 0aDFT 0alead-free hybrid perovskites 0aoptical properties 0aabsorption efficiencies 0asingle-junction solar cells 0atandem solar cells1 aZhu, Zhen-Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2837-60721 aYan, Qing-Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1001-13901 aZheng, Qing-Rong1 aSu, Gang1 aLaref, Amel1 aSaraj, Chaudry Sajed1 aGuo, Chunlei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8525-63010 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Oct. 20, v. 12, no. 44 p.49636-49647dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c145953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245014700206300001200353520167300365592002802038650002102066650001702087650001202104650001302116650002102129650001502150650001602165650001102181650002702192650002002219650002302239650001502262700005602277773013602333856008302469852000902552655001202561IND60750544120221119130515.0211130e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075054412DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-021-09935-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKale, M.

These dams store not only water in their reservoirs but the sediments that come with the water as it flows into the reservoir. The water is then released without its sediment load to downstream areas with a new and increased potential energy, which induces changes to the geometry of the riverbed. In this study, we investigated the vertical traces of clean-water erosion of the riverbed at the historical Çarşamba Bridge in the Yeşilırmak River, Turkey, after the construction and operation of dams. Cross-sections at the historical Çarşamba Bridge for 1980, 1989, 1996 and 2019, 14 km north of the Suat Uğurlu Dam, were investigated. Using long-term flow rate regimes and suspended sediment data, changes were determined in the riverbed before and after the dams were present. After construction of the dams, a decrease in the differences of monthly flow rates was observed. With the newly acquired potential energy resulting from the release of water from the dam reservoir, we found that the river flow eroded the riverbed up to 5.9 m in a vertical direction over the 39-year period between 1980 and 2019. This illustrated that according to these measurements, the river flow scoured the riverbed at a rate of 15 cm/year. The results of this study indicated that river degradation is a major environmental problem at the historical Çarşamba Bridge and also along the riverbed of the Yeşilırmak River after dam construction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTurkey (country) 3acase studies 3aclimate 3ageometry 3apotential energy 3ariver flow 3ariver water 3arivers 3asediment contamination 3astream channels 3asuspended sediment 3awatersheds1 aAtaol, Murat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3213-09720 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2021 Sept., v. 80, no. 18 p.624-624dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-021-09935-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008200156300001800238520138500256592002801641650001601669650001901685650002101704650001101725650001301736650001901749650001701768650002401785650001601809650001301825650001301838650001501851650001401866650001701880650002001897653001601917653000901933653001901942653002401961653002801985653001002013653001602023653001002039700001602049700001202065700001502077700001502092700001202107700001702119700001802136700001502154700001602169700001702185700001802202700001902220700001502239773011802254856007502372852000902447655001202456IND60568800620221118113945.0170517e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056880062DNAL7 a10.1021/pr40128482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Donghua10aImportant Role of SUMOylation of Spliceosome Factors in Prostate Cancer Cells  ap. 3571-3582.  aSentrin/SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier)-specific proteases (SENPs) have been implicated in the development of prostate cancer. However, due to the low abundance of SUMO-modified proteins and high activity of SENPs, the SUMO substrates affected by SENPs in prostate cancer cells are largely unknown. Here, we identified SI2, a novel cell-permeable SENP-specific inhibitor, by high-throughput screening. Using SI2 as a way of inhibiting the activity of SENPs and the SUMO stably transfected PC3 cells as a prostate cancer model, in combination with the stable isotope labeling with amino acids (SILAC) quantitative proteomic technique, we identified more than 900 putative target proteins of SUMO, in which 231 proteins were further subjected to bioinformatic analysis. In the highly enriched spliceosome pathway, we validated that USP39, HSPA1A, and HSPA2 were novel target proteins of SUMO. Furthermore, we demonstrated that K6, K16, K29, K51, and K73 were the SUMOylation sites of USP39. Mutation of these SUMO modification sites of USP39 further promoted the proliferation-enhancing effect of USP39 on prostate cancer cells. This study provides the SUMOproteome of PC3 cells and reveals that SUMOylation of spliceosome factors may be implicated in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. Optimization of SI2 for isotype-specific SENP inhibitors warrants further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abioinformatics 3aisotope labeling 3amodels 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3apathogenesis 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3ascreening 3aspliceosomes 3astable isotopes 0aSUMOylation 0aSENP 0aSENP inhibitor 0achemical proteomics 0aquantitative proteomics 0aSILAC 0aspliceosome 0aUSP391 aXu, Zhijian1 aXia, Li1 aLiu, Xinyi1 aTu, Yaoyao1 aLei, Hu1 aWang, Weiwei1 aWang, Tongdan1 aSong, Lili1 aMa, Chunmin1 aXu, Hanzhang1 aZhu, Weiliang1 aChen, Guoqiang1 aWu, Yingli0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2014 Aug. 01, v. 13, no. 8 p.3571-3582dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fpr40128483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012200166300001800288520187900306592002802185650001502213650000802228650003502236650002302271650001902294650001302313650000902326650003202335650002702367650001602394700002602410700002102436700005802457700006202515700006302577773011402640856008402754852000902838655001202847IND60608191720221117030019.0180807e20180712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060819172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b016862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Zengyi10aComparing Surfactant Structures at “Soft” and “Hard” Hydrophobic Materials: Not All Interfaces Are Equivalent  ap. 9141-9152.  aThe interfacial structures of a range of amphiphilic molecules are studied with both “soft” and “hard” hydrophobic substrates. Neutron reflection and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation measurements highlight the differences between the adsorbed structures adopted by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C₁₆TAB), and the “AM1” surface active peptide. At the soft siloxane/water interface, small molecular surfactants form loosely packed layers, with the hydrophobic tails penetrating into the oily layer, and an area per surfactant molecule that is significantly less than previously reported for the air/water interface. Neutron reflection measurements, supported by quartz crystal microbalance studies, indicate that for C₁₆TAB, approximately 30 ± 8% of the alkyl tail penetrates into the poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) layer, whereas 20 ± 5% of the alkyl tail of SDS is located in the PDMS. For the engineered peptide surfactant AM1 (21 residues), it was found that one face of the α helix penetrated into the PDMS film. In contrast, penetration of the surfactant tails was not observed against hard solidlike hydrophobic surfaces made from octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) for any of the molecular species studied. At the OTS/water interface, C₁₆TAB and SDS were seen to adsorb as larger aggregates and not as monolayers. Amphiphilic adsorption (amount, structural conformation) at the PDMS/water interface is shown to be different from that at both the air/water interface and the hard OTS/water interface, illustrating that interfacial structures cannot be predicted by the surfactant packing parameter alone. The bound PDMS layer is shown to be a useful proxy for the oil/water interface in surface and stabilization studies, with hydrophobic components of the molecules able to penetrate into the oily PDMS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3achemical structure 3ahydrophobicity 3aneutrons 3aoils 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asurfactants1 aPiantavigna, Stefania1 aHolt, Stephen A.1 aNelson, Andrew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4548-35581 aSpicer, Patrick T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8562-39061 aPrescott, Stuart W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5639-96880 tLangmuir.g2018 July 12, v. 34, no. 31 p.9141-9152dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b016863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245007900175300001800254520107500272592002801347650001601375650001801391650001101409650001501420650004301435650002401478650001501502650001201517650003901529650002201568650001701590650001301607650001401620650002001634650003901654650001101693650003601704650004601740650002001786650005901806653002601865653002301891653001101914653001501925653002601940700001701966700002301983773013302006852000902139856007502148655001202223IND4463699820221122142605.0160905e20120418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446369982DNAL7 a224400162pmid7 a10.1021/jf30027472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, Susana10aCarbohydrates Inhibit Salivary Proteins Precipitation by Condensed Tannins  ap. 3966-3972.  aCondensed tannins are a group of polyphenols that are associated with the astringency sensation, as they readily interact and precipitate salivary proteins. As this interaction is affected by carbohydrates, the aim of this work was to study the effect of some carbohydrates used in the food industry [arabic gum (AG), pectin, and poligalacturonic acid (PGA)] on the salivary proteins/grape seed procyanidins interaction. This was assessed monitoring the salivary proteins that remain soluble in the presence of condensed tannins with the addition of carbohydrates (HPLC) and analysis of the respective precipitates (SDS-PAGE). The results show that pectin was the most efficient in inhibiting protein/tannin precipitation, followed by AG and PGA. The results suggest that pectin and PGA exert their effect by formation of a ternary complex protein/polyphenol/carbohydrate, while AG competes with proteins for tannin binding (competition mechanism). The results also point out that both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions are important for the carbohydrate effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aastringency 3afood industry 3agrapes 3agum arabic 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amonitoring 3apectins 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproanthocyanidins 3aprocyanidins 3aproteins 3asensation 2aDown-Regulation 2aGum Arabicxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aPectinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProanthocyanidinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aSalivary Proteins and Peptidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aproline-rich proteins 0agrape seed tannins 0apectin 0aarabic gum 0apolygalacturonic acid1 aMateus, Nuno1 ade Freitas, Victor0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 Apr. 18, v. 60, no. 15 p.3966-3972dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf30027473Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03310naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245008900201300001600290506007600306520187800382592002802260506003702288650001702325650002102342650002502363650001602388650001202404650002802416650004702444650001102491650001702502650002302519650002602542650001502568700002202583700002402605700002402629700001502653773010002668856007502768852000902843655001202852IND60532191720221207134028.0160728e20150127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053219172DNAL7 a10.1021/bi501480d2doi7 aPMC56789272pmcid7 a255408292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKyoung, Minjoung10aDynamic Architecture of the Purinosome Involved in Human De Novo Purine Biosynthesis  ap. 870-880.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnzymes in human de novo purine biosynthesis have been demonstrated to form a reversible, transient multienzyme complex, the purinosome, upon purine starvation. However, characterization of purinosomes has been limited to HeLa cells and has heavily relied on qualitative examination of their subcellular localization and reversibility under wide-field fluorescence microscopy. Quantitative approaches, which are particularly compatible with human disease-relevant cell lines, are necessary to explicitly understand the purinosome in live cells. In this work, human breast carcinoma Hs578T cells have been utilized to demonstrate the preferential utilization of the purinosome under purine-depleted conditions. In addition, we have employed a confocal microscopy-based biophysical technique, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, to characterize kinetic properties of the purinosome in live Hs578T cells. Quantitative characterization of the diffusion coefficients of all de novo purine biosynthetic enzymes reveals the significant reduction of their mobile kinetics upon purinosome formation, the dynamic partitioning of each enzyme into the purinosome, and the existence of three intermediate species in purinosome assembly under purine starvation. We also demonstrate that the diffusion coefficient of the purine salvage enzyme, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1, is not sensitive to purine starvation, indicating exclusion of the salvage pathway from the purinosome. Furthermore, our biophysical characterization of nonmetabolic enzymes clarifies that purinosomes are spatiotemporally different cellular bodies from stress granules and cytoplasmic protein aggregates in both Hs578T and HeLa cells. Collectively, quantitative analyses of the purinosome in Hs578T cells led us to provide novel insights for the dynamic architecture of the purinosome assembly.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiosynthesis 3abreast neoplasms 3acytoplasmic granules 3adiffusivity 3aenzymes 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescence recovery after photobleaching 3ahumans 3ahypoxanthine 3aprotein aggregates 3aquantitative analysis 3astarvation1 aRussell, Sarah J.1 aKohnhorst, Casey L.1 aEsemoto, Nopondo N.1 aAn, Songon0 tBiochemistry.g2015 Jan. 27, v. 54, no. 3 p.870-880dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi501480d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01930naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245003600170300001600206520106200222592002801284650001501312650001901327650001901346650001201365650002101377650001801398700002801416773009401444856008101538852000901619655001201628IND60440051120221118042707.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044005112DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078150401202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRozental’, O.

Algorithms are proposed for determining the chosen characteristics. It is shown that, in addition to the well-known reliability characteristics, such as the error of the first kind and the error of the second kind, which are required for testing statistical hypotheses, the constructive dialogue between the participants of water relationships gains from taking into account the error of statistical decision, which is also referred to as differential threshold.

However, low patient response rates and dose-limiting toxicity are the major limitations of immunotherapy. Nanoparticle-based photothermal immunotherapy can amplify antitumor immune responses, although poor tumor penetration depth of near-infrared radiation (NIR) and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment significantly dampen its effects. We designed a nanoplatform based on gold nanorods for NIR-II-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) combined with N⁶-methyladenosine (m⁶A) demethylase inhibition to achieve enhanced photothermal immunotherapy against prostate cancer. The GNRs were assembled layer by layer with polystyrenesulfonate as the interconnecting layer and then coated with a cationic polymer of γ-cyclodextrin (CD)-cross-linked low-molecular-weight polyethylenimine that was conjugated to an 8-mer peptide targeting the prostate tumor-specific gastrin-releasing peptide receptor. The m⁶A RNA demethylase inhibitor meclofenamic acid (MA) was then loaded into the CD cavity through hydrophobic interactions. GNR-CDP8MA specifically targeted the prostate tumor cells and selectively accumulated at the tumor site in vivo. In addition, GNR-CDP8MA almost completely ablated prostate cancer cell-derived tumors upon 1208 nm laser irradiation. Mechanistically, NIR-II triggered the release of MA from GNR-CDP8MA, which increased global mRNA m⁶A methylation and decreased the stability of PDL1 transcripts. Furthermore, GNR-CDP8MA-mediated PTT-induced immunogenic cell death in the primary tumor and consequently enhanced antitumor immunity by activating the antigen-presenting dendritic cells and tumor-specific effector T cells in the metastatic tumors. This study offers insights into synergistic m⁶A RNA methylation and PTT as an effective strategy for cancer immunotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data  a81870117cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a82170154cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a91959201cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aRNA 3acell death 3agastrin-releasing peptide 3agold 3ahydrophobicity 3aimmunosuppression 3aimmunotherapy 3airradiation 3ametastasis 3amethylation 3ananorods 3anear infrared radiation 3apatients 3apeptide receptors 3apeptides 3aphotothermotherapy 3apolyethyleneimine 3aprostatic neoplasms 3atoxicity 0aN6-methyladenosine 0aRNA methylation 0agold nanorods 0aphotothermal therapy1 aSong, Yue1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4649-09841 aWang, Yiqiao1 aHan, Mingda1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2254-428X1 aWang, Chunxi1 aYan, Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4750-12000 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Sept. 02, v. 14, no. 36 p.40612-40623dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c099783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245011800166500001400284520178200298592002802080650003002108650001802138650001202156650002202168650001102190650001802201650001102219650001502230650002102245650000902266650001102275650002002286650001502306650002002321650001502341650000902356650001102365650001102376650001102387650000902398651001102407700002402418700002302442700002202465773012302487856007402610852000902684655001202693IND60711798220221121064634.0200928e20200916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071179822DNAL7 a10.3390/nu120928292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKosendiak, Aureliusz 10aGluten-Free Diet in Prisons in Poland: Nutrient Contents and Implementation of Dietary Reference Intake Standards  aNAL-light  aThe gluten-free diet (GFD) requires special attention from nutritionists due to the potential risk of nutrient deficiencies in its users. This risk may be greater when this type of nutrition is implemented in prisons due to the limited possibilities of external control, a low catering budget for meals, and insufficiently defined recommendations regulating nutrition for prisoners. The aim of the present study was to assess the nutritional value of GFD and regular diet meals served in some Polish prisons and to compare the values to the dietary reference intake (DRI) standards. Using a specialized computer program, 7-day menus of both types of diet provided in 10 prisons were analyzed. The percentage coverage of the DRI was calculated based on the recommendations of the Polish National Food and Nutrition Institute. GFD was characterized by lower average contents of energy and 11 out of 14 essential nutrients, i.e., protein, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, starch, ash, sodium, calcium, iron, zinc, folate, and vitamin B₁₂. The average content of phosphorus, niacin, and riboflavin in the gluten-free diet was higher than that in the regular diet. It was shown that the meals in GFD and the regular diet did not provide the recommended amounts of calcium (38 and 44% DRI, respectively), vitamin D (29 and 30% DRI), vitamin C (86 and 76% DRI), and folate (51 and 56% DRI). In turn, the supply of sodium, phosphorus, copper, and vitamins A and B₆ substantially exceeded the recommended levels. The results indicate a need for greater quality control of GFD meals served in catering facilities. It is also necessary to develop legal provisions that will regulate more specifically the nutrition for prisoners in terms of an adequate supply of minerals and vitamins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDietary Reference Intakes 3aascorbic acid 3acalcium 3acomputer software 3acopper 3adietary fiber 3aenergy 3afolic acid 3agluten-free diet 3airon 3aniacin 3anutritive value 3aphosphorus 3aquality control 3ariboflavin 3arisk 3asodium 3astarch 3asupply 3azinc 3aPoland1 aStanikowski, Piotr 1 aDomagała, Dorota 1 aGustaw, Waldemar 0 tNutrients.g2020 Sept. 16, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120928293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245010000160300002000260520129500280592002801575596009801603596010801701650002401809650001401833650001301847650001701860650001101877650001201888650001801900653001401918653002801932653002401960653002801984653002902012700001602041700002002057700001602077700001702093700005502110700001402165700005902179773014302238856007902381852000902460655001202469IND60793366420221116185305.0220914e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079336642DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c100272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Zhiwei10aGrain Boundary Engineering in Ta-Doped Garnet-Type Electrolyte for Lithium Dendrite Suppression  ap. 40959-40966.  aSolid-state lithium batteries (SSLBs) based on Ta-doped Li₆.₅La₃Zr₁.₅Ta₀.₅O₁₂ (LLZTO) suffer from lithium dendrite growth, which hinders their practical application. Herein, first principles simulations indicate that the Ta element prefers to segregate along grain boundaries in the form of Ta₂O₅ precipitates due to a high energy difference induced by Ta doping. Grain boundary engineering is employed to regulate the distribution of the Ta element and enhance the density of LLZTO by introducing the La₂O₃ additive. The sufficient La₂O₃ additive reacts with the Ta₂O₅ precipitates, while the residual La₂O₃ nanoparticles fill up void defects, promoting the homogeneous distribution of the Ta element and improving the relative density to ∼98%. Critical current density of the symmetric Li battery reaches 2.12 mA·cm–² at room temperature with the solid-state electrolyte (LLZTO + 5 wt % La₂O₃), which increases by 41% compared to pure LLZTO. SSLBs with the LiFePO₄ cathode achieve a stable cycling performance with a discharge capacity of 138.6 mA·h·g–¹ after 400 cycles at 0.2 C. This work provides theoretical insights into the distribution of Ta-doped LLZTO and inhibits lithium dendrite growth through grain boundary engineering.  aPublisher supplied data  a52175301cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aBX20220384cNational Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talentsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100012152 3aambient temperature 3abatteries 3acathodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3alithium 3ananoparticles 0aLi-garnet 0asolid-state electrolyte 0asolid-state battery 0alithium dendrite growth 0acritical current density1 aXie, Yuming1 aMeng, Xiangchen1 aQian, Delai1 aMao, Dongxin1 aZheng, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5343-28221 aWan, Long1 aHuang, Yongxian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0682-53210 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 14, no. 36 p.40959-40966dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c100273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245011800210300001200328500001900340520137700359592002801736650003001764650000901794650001001803650001101813650001601824651001401840700006701854700007501921700006601996773013502062856008302197852000902280655001202289IND60740679020221117230200.0210624e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074067902DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-021-09721-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrelli, Federico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5623-892910aWarming signals emerging from the analysis of daily changes in extreme temperature events over Pampas (Argentina)  ap. 422.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGlobal warming and the intensification of extreme temperature events have been significant issues around the world in recent decades. The Pampas region in Argentina is one of the essential areas worldwide because of its agricultural productivity. Therefore, this study aimed to assess daily temperature events trends to identify warming signals during the last 6 decades. Thus, climatic information from 50 weather stations was analyzed to calculate cold and hot extreme events. Trends analysis was carried out with a Mann–Kendall test. As a result, we identified that maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures increased more than 1 °C in most of the Pampas from 1960 to 2018. The hot and cold extreme events demonstrated the existence of warming signals since warm days, warm nights, summer days, tropical nights, and both the coldest days and nights presented a significantly positive trend (2.3 °C, 0.7 °C, 43.6 days, 17.1 days, 0.9 °C, and 1.9 °C in the 59 years, respectively). Contrarily, frost days and cold nights and days had negative trends (12.3 days, 3.2 °C, and 2.4 °C in the 59 years, respectively). The results allow us to conclude that a high daily temperature variability characterizes the region. This knowledge is crucial for generating management policies focused on the sustainability of agricultural economic activities in Pampas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural productivity 3acold 3afrost 3asummer 3atemperature 3aArgentina1 aBrendel, Andrea Soledad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0909-46941 aPerillo, Gerardo Miguel Eduardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1200-51381 aPiccolo, María Cintia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5184-91490 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2021 June, v. 80, no. 12 p.422-422dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-021-09721-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245009500169300001600264500001400280520205700294592002802351650001802379650001302397650002502410650001802435650001402453650001002467650001002477650002102487650001002508650002802518650001102546650001602557650000702573650001202580650001402592700002302606773012202629856007402751852000902825655001202834IND60726247120221121051058.0210203e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072624712DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo02415e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMennah-Govela, Yamile A.10aFood buffering capacity: quantification methods and its importance in digestion and health  ap. 543-563.  aNAL-light  aThe complex relationship between food properties and their behavior during human digestion is not well understood. During gastric digestion, food chemical and physical breakdown occurs as a result of gastric secretions and peristaltic contractions, respectively. Food breakdown is modulated through food properties such as physicochemical composition and macro-structure, including texture and viscosity. Another food property that may play a crucial role in food chemical breakdown and gastric secretions, but has been largely disregarded in previous studies, is food buffering capacity. Buffering capacity is a characteristic of foods due to the presence of acid/base groups, which causes a resistance to change pH after additions of acid or alkali. Buffering capacity of food has been studied in different applications, including for production of human food and animal feed, as well as for human health applications, including gastric digestion, gastroesophageal reflux disease, development of drugs and pharmaceuticals, food allergenicity, and dental health. However, a limitation for widespread adoption of buffering capacity measurements is a standard method, as results from many previous studies are not directly comparable and use different measurement and quantification methods. The relationship between food composition and physical properties with buffering capacity as well as how food buffering capacity may influence gastric secretions and gastric emptying during digestion are not well-characterized. The development of a fundamental understanding of the influence of food properties on buffering capacity and its impact on gastric secretions and breakdown during digestion are needed for improvement of future digestion studies and for optimization of functional foods. The importance of buffering capacity in food digestion processes, such as gastric secretions and food breakdown, is described in this review, as well as a description of methods previously used to quantify buffering capacity during in vitro and in vivo digestion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergenicity 3abehavior 3achemical degradation 3adental health 3adigestion 3adrugs 3afeeds 3afood composition 3afoods 3agastroesophageal reflux 3ahumans 3ameasurement 3apH 3atexture 3aviscosity1 aBornhorst, Gail M.0 tFood & function.g2021 Feb. 1, v. 12, no. 2 p.543-563dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo02415e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008700164300001200251520128900263592002801552650003501580650003001615651002101645651001001666700001801676700001501694700002001709700001601729773013501745856008201880852000901962655001201971IND60585580620221120150033.0180619e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058558062DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-017-7091-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiddique, T.10aStability assessment of Himalayan road cut slopes along National Highway 58, India  ap. 759.  aHimalaya is one of the most tectonically and seismically active mountain chains in the world having complex geological and geotechnical conditions. The Himalayan region experiences frequent slope failure posed due to various natural and anthropogenic causes. Slope instability issues have consequent effects on the socio-economic development of the people and the region in a large scale. In the present study, stability analysis of vulnerable road cut slopes along NH-58 from Rishikesh to Devprayag in the Lesser Himalayas has been conducted. Critical slopes were identified by considering the geological and the geotechnical complexities within the region. Rock mass characterisation techniques have been employed for slope stability assessment. Rock mass rating (RMR), slope mass rating (SMR) and continuous slope mass rating (CSMR) methods have been applied to evaluate different stability levels of rock mass along the highway. Spatial variation of stability classes using RMR, SMR and CSMR techniques has been analysed on geographic information system (GIS) tool. Kinematic analysis technique was also employed to identify the different modes of structurally controlled failures in jointed rock mass. Accordingly remedial measures have been suggested to improve slope stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographic information systems 3asocioeconomic development 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia1 aPradhan, S.P.1 aVishal, V.1 aMondal, M.E.

Temperature-responsive poly (N-isopropyl acrylamide) (pNIPAM) template and anisotropic Au nanorods (NRs) were synthesized to prepare pNIPAM @ Au NRs nano-hybrids with dynamically optical and SERS properties and high stability. Results showed that excitation wavelength-dependent SERS efficiency could be tailored by temperature-induced swelling and collapse of the nano-hybrids, thus anticipated optical and SERS properties of the composites could be obtained. Furthermore, the SERS performance, uniformity, long-term stability analysis, and MG in fish evaluation showed that the detection of MG in fish tissues was realized with a limit of detection of 1.58 × 10⁻⁹ M (0.73 ng/g), and the pNIPAM @ Au NRs composites could serve as effective SERS substrates allowing trace level detection of contaminants for the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aacrylamides 3aanisotropy 3adetection limit 3afish 3afish fillets 3afood industry 3afungicides 3amalachite green 3ananogold 3ananohybrids 3ananorods 0aGold nanorods 0aThermo-responsive microgels 0aSERS and SERRS 0aSynergetic and competitive mechanism 0aMalachite green1 aSun, Da-Wen1 aPu, Hongbin1 aWei, Qingyi0 tTalanta.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 218 p.121188-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1211883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245006900203300001800272506007600290520142400366592002801790506003701818650003601855650001301891650001901904650001801923650004401941650001301985650001201998650002202010650001602032700002102048700002702069773013202096856007502228852000902303655001202312IND60538823920221207140519.0160815e20130424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053882392DNAL7 a10.1021/ja402187t2doi7 aPMC36630772pmcid7 a235742862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJalan, Abhishek
A.10aHydroxyproline-Free Single Composition ABC Collagen Heterotrimer  ap. 6014-6017.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHydroxyproline plays a major role in stabilizing collagenous domains in eukaryotic organisms. Lack of this modification is associated with significant lowering in the thermal stability of the collagen triple helix and may also affect fibrillogenesis and folding of the peptide chains. In contrast, even though bacterial collagens lack hydroxyproline, their thermal stability is comparable to that of fibrillar collagen. This has been attributed to the high frequency of charged amino acids found in bacterial collagen. Here we report a thermally stable hydroxyproline-free ABC heterotrimeric collagen mimetic system composed of decapositive and decanegative peptides and a zwitterionic peptide. None of the peptides contain hydroxyproline, and furthermore the zwitterionic peptide does not even contain proline. The heterotrimer is electrostatically stabilized via multiple interpeptide lysine-aspartate and lysine-glutamate salt bridges and maintains good thermal stability with a melting temperature of 37 °C. The ternary peptide mixture also populates a single composition ABC heterotrimer as confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This system illustrates the power of axial salt bridges to direct and stabilize the self-assembly of a triple helix and may be useful in analogous designs in expression systems where the incorporation of hydroxyproline is challenging.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acollagen 3ahydroxyproline 3amelting point 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apeptides 3aproline 3athermal stability 3azwitterions1 aDemeler, Borries1 aHartgerink, Jeffrey D.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Apr. 24, v. 135, no. 16 p.6014-6017dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja402187t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006100138245010400199300001800303500001900321500002000340520164600360592002802006596005002034650001602084650002502100650001702125650001902142650001402161650001602175650002802191650002202219650001802241650001002259650000902269650001002278650001502288650000902303650001602312650001402328650001802342650002002360700005802380700002102438700002102459700001302480700001902493700002002512773013602532856007202668852000902740655001202749IND60739330820221122130357.0210527e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073933082DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.50022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGruer, Victoria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3570-581210aEffects of Phenanthrene Exposure on Cholesterol Homeostasis and Cardiotoxicity in Zebrafish Embryos  ap. 1586-1595.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are pervasive pollutants in aquatic ecosystems, and developing fish embryos are especially sensitive to PAH exposure. Exposure to crude oil or phenanthrene (a reference PAH found in oil) produces an array of gross morphological abnormalities in developing fish embryos, including cardiotoxicity. Recently, studies utilizing transcriptomic analyses in several oil‐exposed fish embryos found significant changes in the abundance of transcripts involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Given the vital role of cholesterol availability in embryonic heart development, we hypothesized that cholesterol dysregulation in early development contributes to phenanthrene‐induced cardiotoxicity. We exposed zebrafish embryos to 12 or 15 µM phenanthrene from 6 to 72 h post fertilization (hpf) and demonstrated that, in conjunction with pericardial edema and bradycardia, several genes (fdft1 and hmgcra) in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway were significantly altered. When embryos were pretreated with a cholesterol solution from 6 to 24 hpf followed by exposure to phenanthrene from 24 to 48 hpf, the effects of phenanthrene on heart rate were partially mitigated. Despite changes in gene expression, whole‐mount in situ staining of cholesterol was not significantly affected in embryos exposed to phenanthrene ranging in stage from 24 to 72 hpf. However, the 2‐dimensional yolk area was significantly increased with phenanthrene exposure at 72 hpf, suggesting that lipid transport from the yolk to the developing embryo was impaired.

First, based on random utility maximization theory, the Cross-Nested Logit model and traditional NL models are formulated respectively. House price, travel time, travel cost, and factors depicting the individual socio-economic characteristics are defined as exogenous variables, and the model choice sets are the combination of residential location subset, departure time subset, and travel mode choice subset. Second, using Beijing traffic survey data of 2005, the model parameters are estimated, and the direct and cross elasticity are calculated to analyze the change of alternatives probability brought by factors variation. Estimation results show the Cross-Nested Logit model outperforms the three kinds of NL model. It is also found by estimation results that decision makers will change first their departure times, then their travel modes, and finally their residential locations, when exogenous variables alter. Moreover, elasticity analysis results suggest that, for long-distance commuting, it is difficult to decrease car travels even if additional charges are imposed on car users. The effect on choice probability by variations in travel time of other travel mode can be considered as negligible for alternatives within 5km commuting distance, and this effect are greatest for alternatives between 10 and 20km commuting distance. These findings have important implications for transport demand management and residence planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3aplanning 3aprices 3aprobability 3asocioeconomics 3asurveys 3atraffic 3atravel 3aChina1 aZheng, Guo1 aZhu, Xiaoning0 tHabitat international.g2013 Apr., v. 38 p.157-166dElsevier Ltdx0197-39757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2012.06.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015600156300002000312520141500332592002801747650001301775650001301788650001601801650001301817650001101830650002801841650001301869650001501882650001301897700001501910700001501925700001601940700001901956700001701975773012401992856007402116852000902190655001202199IND60667291620221119105001.0190919e20150312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066729162DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra00103j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Aili12aA hybrid aerogel of Co–Al layered double hydroxide/graphene with three-dimensional porous structure as a novel electrode material for supercapacitors  ap. 26017-26026.  aA three-dimensional (3D) porous hybrid aerogel with a robust interconnected network, which is constructed from cobalt–aluminum layered double hydroxide (Co–Al LDH) nanosheets and graphene, is reported here. The unique character of this hybrid aerogel is that the 3D graphene aerogel (GA) skeleton is incorporated with two-dimensional (2D) Co–Al LDH nanosheets to assemble macroscopic graphene monoliths. Furthermore, the 3D GA in the hybrid aerogel is a scaffold and support for the dispersion of the Co–Al LDH nanosheets, resulting in a relatively loose and open structure within the electrode matrix. When used as a cathode material for supercapacitors, the as-obtained porous Co–Al LDH/graphene hybrid aerogel (Co–Al LDH/GHA) exhibits favorable capacitance and excellent cycling performance, and demonstrates a maximum specific capacitance of 640 F g⁻¹ at a low current density of 1 A g⁻¹. This remains at 530 F g⁻¹ when the current density is increased to 10 A g⁻¹, and even remains at 305 F g⁻¹ at a much higher current density of 20 A g⁻¹. The capacitance keeps at around 97% after 10 000 cycles, demonstrating that the hybrid aerogel has excellent high-current capacitive properties. The enhanced high-current capacitance of this composite benefits from its unique nano-scaled Co–Al LDH with a short diffusion pathway and the excellent electrical conductivity of 3D GA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3aaluminum 3acapacitance 3acathodes 3acobalt 3aelectrical conductivity 3agraphene 3ananosheets 3aporosity1 aWang, Cong1 aXu, Qunjie1 aLiu, Haimei1 aWang, Yonggang1 aXia, Yongyao0 tRSC advances.g2015 Mar. 12, v. 5, no. 33 p.26017-26026dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra00103j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245015500163300001800318520146300336592002801799650001301827650001801840650001001858650001801868650001901886650001701905650001101922650001701933650001601950650000901966650001201975650001401987650001302001650001302014650004302027650001202070650001402082650001402096650001602110650001802126653001702144653005202161653002202213653004202235653001802277700002002295700002002315700002102335700002102356700002602377700002002403700002102423773011802444856007502562852000902637655001202646IND60568801120221118114021.0170517e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056880112DNAL7 a10.1021/pr500158r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurvey, Michelle
E.10aQuantitative Proteome Profiling of CNS-Infiltrating Autoreactive CD4+ Cells Reveals Selective Changes during Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis  ap. 3655-3670.  aExperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a murine model of multiple sclerosis, a chronic neurodegenerative and inflammatory autoimmune condition of the central nervous system (CNS). Pathology is driven by the infiltration of autoreactive CD4⁺ lymphocytes into the CNS, where they attack neuronal sheaths causing ascending paralysis. We used an isotope-coded protein labeling approach to investigate the proteome of CD4⁺ cells isolated from the spinal cord and brain of mice at various stages of EAE progression in two EAE disease models: PLP₁₃₉–₁₅₁-induced relapsing-remitting EAE and MOG₃₅–₅₅-induced chronic EAE, which emulate the two forms of human multiple sclerosis. A total of 1120 proteins were quantified across disease onset, peak-disease, and remission phases of disease, and of these 13 up-regulated proteins of interest were identified with functions relating to the regulation of inflammation, leukocyte adhesion and migration, tissue repair, and the regulation of transcription/translation. Proteins implicated in processes such as inflammation (S100A4 and S100A9) and tissue repair (annexin A1), which represent key events during EAE progression, were validated by quantitative PCR. This is the first targeted analysis of autoreactive cells purified from the CNS during EAE, highlighting fundamental CD4⁺ cell-driven processes that occur during the initiation of relapse and remission stages of disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aanimal models 3abrain 3acell adhesion 3adisease models 3aencephalitis 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3alymphocytes 3amice 3aneurons 3aparalysis 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arelapse 3aremission 3asclerosis 3aspinal cord 3atissue repair 0aautoimmunity 0aexperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) 0aCD4+ T lymphocyte 0aisotope-coded protein labeling (ICPL) 0aMALDI-TOF/TOF1 aKoudelka, Tomas1 aComerford, Iain1 aGreer, Judith

Because competition theoretically results in lower prices and improved service, water consumers will subsequently reap the benefits. There is, however, little documentation supporting this claim in practice. Based on field research in Maputo, Mozambique in 2009, we analyze the degree and nature of competition between these providers. We show that the idea of ‘healthy competition’ with ‘free market entry’ is an oversimplification of the function of the market, and in particular the complexities of service provision in this specific sector.

We chose 0.96(Na₀.₆₀K₀.₄₀)(Nb₀.₉₅₅Sb₀.₀₄₅)O₃–0.04(Bi₀.₅Na₀.₅)ZrO₃ ceramics as an already-built MPC and replaced (Bi₀.₅Na₀.₅)²⁺ with Ba²⁺ to tune the covalency of A–O bonds. Thus, we synthesized 0.96(Na₀.₆₀K₀.₄₀)(Nb₀.₉₅₅Sb₀.₀₄₅)O₃–0.04(Bi₀.₅Na₀.₅)₁–ₓBaₓZrO₃ ceramics. We not only improved d₃₃ values from 450 pC/N (at x = 0) to 500–505 pC/N (at x = 0.05–0.10) but also obtained the enhanced temperature stability for strain at x = 0.10, outperforming that of samples with x = 0 and other KNN-based ceramics. The increased d₃₃ is attributed to the well-preserved MPC and the repaired long-range ordering, and the improved temperature stability of strain is due to shifting the MPC to a slightly higher temperature than room temperature. Therefore, the new route is useful to further improve the performance of an already-built MPC, benefiting to the future design of MPC and the practical application of KNN-based ceramics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3apotassium 3asodium 0aKNN 0anew route 0apiezoelectricity 0atemperature stability 0acovalency of A−O bonds1 aWu, Jiagang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9960-92751 aZhang, Xi-Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3478-64140 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Oct. 21, v. 12, no. 44 p.49795-49804dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c149103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01361naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010800157300001800265520048300283592002800766650001200794700002700806700002000833700002500853773013400878856007401012852000901086655001201095IND60661336920221122042534.0190829e20110620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066133692DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cs15018a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz, Miriam10aDomino reactions for the synthesis of bridged bicyclic frameworks: fast access to bicyclo[n.3.1]alkanes  ap. 3445-3454.  aIn the current bid for synthetic efficiency, multiple bond-forming transformations are becoming a key concept in organic synthesis.

An extensive body of literature solidifies the plethora of ergogenic benefits gained following dietary creatine supplementation; however, recent findings have further indicated a potential therapeutic role for creatine in several pathologies such as myopathies, neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic disturbances, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, creatine has been found to exhibit non-energy-related properties, such as serving as a potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. Despite the therapeutic success of creatine supplementation in varying clinical populations, there is scarce information regarding the potential application of creatine for combatting the current leading cause of mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD). Taking into consideration the broad ergogenic and non-energy-related actions of creatine, we hypothesize that creatine supplementation may be a potential therapeutic strategy for improving vascular health in at-risk populations such as older adults or those with CVD. With an extensive literature search, we have found only four clinical studies that have investigated the direct effect of creatine on vascular health and function. In this review, we aim to give a short background on the pleiotropic applications of creatine, and to then summarize the current literature surrounding creatine and vascular health. Furthermore, we discuss the varying mechanisms by which creatine could benefit vascular health and function, such as the impact of creatine supplementation upon inflammation and oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3acardiovascular diseases 3acreatine 3acreatine kinase 3aenergy 3ainflammation 3ainformation 3akidney diseases 3aliterature 3amortality 3aoxidative stress 3atherapeutics1 aKim, Do-Houn 1 aMeza, Cesar A.1 aOrmsbee, Michael J.1 aHickner, Robert C.0 tNutrients.g2020 Sept. 16, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu120928343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245012300175500001900298520147100317592002801788650002301816650002201839650002201861650002801883700002401911773012601935856008302061852000902144655001202153IND60711658620221116222706.0200928e20200910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071165862DNAL7 a10.3390/environments70900702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSöderholm, Kristina 10aIndustrial Energy Transitions and the Dynamics of Innovation Systems: The Swedish Pulp and Paper Industry, 1970–2010  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis article provides a sectoral innovation system perspective of the development of energy efficient and clean process technologies in the Swedish pulp and paper industry. Specifically, the analysis elaborates the importance of knowledge development, actor networks, and institutions (including policy) for progressing and diffusing novel technologies related to energy use. The empirical analysis also sheds light on how significant changes in the sectoral innovation system have influenced the relevant research, development and demonstration activities in the Swedish pulp and paper industry over the period 1970–2010. The results are based on various sources—e.g., industry magazines, reports from industrial consultants and associations, minutes from meetings—and illustrate the importance of well-functioning innovation systems for successful technological development and diffusion processes. They display, in particular, the importance of joint, industry-wide R&D activities, trust-based state—industry relationships, government R&D expenditures, and intense information sharing. One important implication is that the role of policy stretches beyond the funding of basic R&D. Policy also involves measures that strengthen existing actor networks, build competence, and secure the existence of research institutes that provide a bridge between basic knowledge generation (at the universities) on the one hand, and industrial application on the other.  aPublisher supplied data 3aempirical research 3aenergy efficiency 3aissues and policy 3apulp and paper industry1 aSöderholm, Patrik 0 tEnvironments.g2020 Sept. 10, v. 7, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27132x2076-32987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments70900703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03318naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001900192100001700211245009400228300001800322506007600340520187100416592002802287596009802315506003702413650000802450650003202458650001902490650001702509650001202526650000902538650001602547650002202563650002602585650002002611700002102631700001702652773012102669856008502790852000902875655001202884IND60672684920221207115805.0191017e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067268492DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bty8862doi7 aPMC65461302pmcid7 a303760612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawamura, Yumi1 aBirol, Inanc10aStatistical inference of the rate of RNA polymerase II elongation by total RNA sequencing  ap. 1877-1884.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSequencing total RNA without poly-A selection enables us to obtain a transcriptomic profile of nascent RNAs undergoing transcription with co-transcriptional splicing. In general, the RNA-seq reads exhibit a sawtooth pattern in a gene, which is characterized by a monotonically decreasing gradient across introns in the 5’–3’ direction, and by substantially higher levels of RNA-seq reads present in exonic regions. Such patterns result from the process of underlying transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II, which traverses the DNA strand in a 5’–3’ direction as it performs a complex series of mRNA synthesis and processing. Therefore, data of sequenced total RNAs could be utilized to infer the rate of transcription elongation by solving the inverse problem. Though solving the inverse problem in total RNA-seq has the great potential, statistical methods have not yet been fully developed. We demonstrate what extent the newly developed method can be useful. The objective is to reconstruct the spatial distribution of transcription elongation rates in a gene from a given noisy, sawtooth-like profile. It is necessary to recover the signal source of the elongation rates separately from several types of nuisance factors, such as unobserved modes of co-transcriptionally occurring mRNA splicing, which exert significant influences on the sawtooth shape. The present method was tested using published total RNA-seq data derived from mouse embryonic stem cells. We investigated the spatial characteristics of the estimated elongation rates, focusing especially on the relation to promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II, nucleosome occupancy and histone modification patterns.

The microalga Chlorella vulgaris in three concentrated forms (suspended, entrapped in Ca-alginate gel beads and as a biofilm on supports and the macroalga Oedogonium cardiacum were compared for treating secondary effluent containing 15 mg/L of ammonium (N-NH₄⁺), 6 mg/L of nitrate (N-NO₃⁻), and 7 mg/L of total phosphorus (TP) with a hydraulic retention time of 12 h. Identical conditions and reaction vessels enabled a direct comparison of growth systems. The biofilm system was the most effective of the microalgal systems, decreasing concentrations to 1.9 mg/L TP and 0.5 mg/L N-NO₃⁻ on average from day 3 to 24, and like the other microalgal systems, was not as effective for N-NH₄⁺ removal (average of 9.0 mg/L). The macroalgal system decreased TP to 1.3 mg/L and N-NH₄⁺ to ≤0.5 mg/L on average from day 16 to 30 and operated for longer than the other systems, but was not effective for N-NO₃⁻ removal (average of 4.8 mg/L). Hence the minimum TN concentration of the effluent from the macroalgal system (7.1 mg/L) was lower than for the biofilm system (10.6 mg/L) from the feed of 24 mg/L. The biofilm system produced 56 mg/L/d and the macroalgae 102 mg/L/d of biomass. The production of the highest quality effluent for longer and of more biomass than the microalgal systems, combined with their larger cell size which facilitates reactor operation, demonstrates that macroalgae can compete with microalgae for wastewater remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aOedogonium 3aammonium 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3agels 3amacroalgae 3amicroalgae 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aremediation 3aresearch 3atotal phosphorus 3awastewater 0aMicroalgae 0aMacroalgae 0aBiofilm 0aImmobilisation 0aWastewater treatment 0aBiomass production1 aFan, Linhua1 aRoddick, Felicity1 aWhitton, Rachel1 aPidou, Marc1 aJefferson, Bruce0 tAlgal research.g2022 June, v. 65 p.102754-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2022.1027543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04002naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245017500160300001800335520249400353592002802847650001302875650001702888650002202905650001202927650001602939650001802955650001802973650002302991650002003014650001003034650000703044650001503051650001703066650001203083650001603095650001603111650001003127650002403137650001103161653001003172653001103182653001303193653001103206700001503217700001303232773015203245856007803397852000903475655001203484IND60539488120221119183050.0190318e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053948812DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2013-75862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWindle, M.C.10aEffects of an exogenous protease on the fermentation and nutritive value of corn silage harvested at different dry matter contents and ensiled for various lengths of time  ap. 3053-3060.  aThe objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of adding an experimental protease to corn plants harvested at different maturities on silage fermentation and in vitro ruminal starch digestibility (IVSD). Corn plants were harvested at maturities resulting in plants with 31 or 40% dry matter (DM). Plants were chopped, kernel processed, and treated with (1) only a 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 5.5, 5% vol/wt of fresh forage), (2) buffer with protease to obtain a final concentration of 20mg of protease/kg of wet forage, and (3) buffer with protease to obtain a final concentration of 2,000mg of protease/kg of wet forage. Treated forages (about 500g) were ensiled in nylon-polyethylene pouches and stored between 21 and 23°C for 0, 45, 90, and 150d. Data were analyzed as a 2×3×4 factorial arrangement of treatments, with the main effects of harvest DM, dose of protease, days of ensiling, and their interactions. The treatment with the highest dose of protease resulted in more robust fermentations across harvest DM with higher concentrations of lactic and acetic acids compared with untreated silage. Concentrations of soluble protein (% of crude protein) increased with time of ensiling, regardless of DM content at harvest. However, averaged over both harvest DM contents, it increased by 37% for silages treated with the high dose of protease compared with an average 11% increase for untreated silages and silage treated with the low dose of protease, between d 0 and 45. Averaged over both harvest DM contents, the concentration of soluble protein peaked in silages treated with the high dose of protease after 45d of ensiling, whereas it peaked at d 90 in untreated silages and silage treated with the low dose of protease. Similar changes occurred in the concentration of NH3-N due to length of ensiling and treatment with protease. In fresh forages, the concentration of starch for early- and late-harvested forages was similar, but IVSD was lower in the latter. After 45d of ensiling, IVSD was highest in both early- and late-harvested silages that were treated with the high level of protease. After 150d of ensiling, IVSD was similar among silages treated with protease, regardless of DM at harvest. Treating corn plants with a high dose of an experimental protease at harvest accelerated proteolysis during ensiling, resulting in corn silages with levels of IVSD after 45d of ensiling that were only obtained in untreated corn silages after 150d of ensiling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aacetic acids 3aammonium nitrogen 3abuffers 3acorn silage 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3adry matter content 3anutritive value 3anylon 3apH 3aphosphates 3apolyethylene 3apouches 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3aseeds 3asilage fermentation 3astarch 0arumen 0astarch 0aprotease 0asilage1 aWalker, N.1 aKung, L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 May, v. 97, no. 5 p.3053-3060dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-75863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013500170300001400305520145600319592002801775650001601803650001301819650001701832650001701849650001501866650002601881650001001907650001201917650001501929650001401944650000901958650001901967653005601986653003602042653001002078653001102088653002402099700002602123700002202149700002702171700002202198700001902220700002102239773010602260856008602366852000902452655001202461IND60525118620221122193312.0190318e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052511862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarsen, Thomas10aSubstantial nutritional contribution of bacterial amino acids to earthworms and enchytraeids: A case study from organic grasslands  ap. 21-27.  aMany aspects of the feeding ecology of terrestrial oligochaetes are poorly understood despite the essential role of these soil and detritus feeders for maintaining soil fertility. To investigate dietary contributions of various soil components to two ecological groups of worms, anecic and endogeic species, we employed δ13C fingerprinting of essential amino acids (EAA) for distinguishing between bacterial, fungal, and plant derived food sources. We collected earthworms and enchytraeids from organic grasslands with grass, clover, and mixtures of these two plants. Our results showed that the worms either relied on plants or bacteria as their primary EAA source, but not on fungi, and that EAA targets were unaffected by crop type. Two anecic species received 60–75% of their EAA from plant sources with bacterial contributions ranging from 18 to 23%. In contrast, both enchytraeids and an endogeic worms relied equally on bacterial and plant derived EAA. Our study provides answers to some of the long-standing questions in regards to the role of bacteria for earthworm nutrition. While bacterial EAA contribution to anecic worms was relatively modest, less than one-quarter, bacterial contribution to endogeic and enchytraeid worms was substantial comprising almost half of their EAA. Our findings are important for understanding how different ecological groups of terrestrial oligochaetes meet nutritional needs and partition food resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOligochaeta 3abacteria 3acase studies 3adetritivores 3aearthworms 3aessential amino acids 3afungi 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3anutrition 3asoil 3asoil fertility 0aStable carbon isotope fingerprinting of amino acids 0aBacterially derived amino acids 0aGrass 0aClover 0aOrganic agriculture1 aPollierer, Melanie M.1 aHolmstrup, Martin1 aD'Annibale, Alessandra1 aMaraldo, Kristine1 aAndersen, Nils1 aEriksen, Jørgen0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2016 Aug., v. 99 p.21-27dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151100002200166245008700188300001800275520145600293592002801749596004001777650001901817650002201836650002001858650002301878650002201901700001301923700002201936700002601958700001801984700001502002773012102017856008502138852000902223655001202232IND60672685020221118012344.0191017e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067268502DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bty8872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Wei1 aValencia, Alfonso10aSENSE: Siamese neural network for sequence embedding and alignment-free comparison  ap. 1820-1828.  aSequence analysis is arguably a foundation of modern biology. Classic approaches to sequence analysis are based on sequence alignment, which is limited when dealing with large-scale sequence data. A dozen of alignment-free approaches have been developed to provide computationally efficient alternatives to alignment-based approaches. However, existing methods define sequence similarity based on various heuristics and can only provide rough approximations to alignment distances. In this article, we developed a new approach, referred to as SENSE (SiamEse Neural network for Sequence Embedding), for efficient and accurate alignment-free sequence comparison. The basic idea is to use a deep neural network to learn an explicit embedding function based on a small training dataset to project sequences into an embedding space so that the mean square error between alignment distances and pairwise distances defined in the embedding space is minimized. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use deep learning for alignment-free sequence analysis. A large-scale experiment was performed that demonstrated that our method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art alignment-free methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Open-source software for the proposed method is developed and freely available at https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/∼yijunsun/lab/SENSE.html.

These peatlands store large quantities of carbon (C), and are currently under severe threat from climate change. The aim of this study was to determine the size and organic chemistry of the easily degradable C pool in permafrost peatlands and link the functional organic chemistry to temperature and moisture controls of greenhouse gas emissions. First, we used a combination of field measurements and laboratory experiments to assess the influence of increased temperature and flooding on CO2 and CH4 emissions from sixteen permafrost peatlands in subarctic Sweden and Canada. Second, we determined the variation in organic matter chemistry and the associated microbial community composition of the peat active layer, with depth using quantitative 13C solid-state NMR and molecular biomarkers respectively. We demonstrate that the peat organic chemistry strongly controls CO2 release from peat and that ca. 35 and 26% of the peat organic matter, at the Swedish and Canadian peatlands sites, respectively, is easily degradable by heterotrophic microorganisms. In contrast to CO2, CH4 emissions were decoupled from peat functional organic chemistry. We show a strong relationship between the microbial community structure and the peat organic chemistry suggesting that substrate type and abundance is an important driver of microbial composition in sub-arctic peatlands. Despite considerable variation in peat chemistry and microbial community composition with depth the temperature sensitivity was comparable throughout the active layer. Our study shows that functional organic chemistry controls both soil respiration rates and the composition of the microbial community. Furthermore, if these peatlands collapse and flood on thawing, they are unlikely to become large emitters of CH4 without additional input of labile substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheterotrophs 3alaboratory experimentation 3amethane 3amicrobial communities 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic matter 3apeat 3apeatlands 3apermafrost 3asoil respiration 3atemperature 3athawing 3aCanada 3aSweden 0a13C solid state NMR 0aCarbon dioxide 0aClimate change 0aMethane 0aMicrobial 0aPermafrost peatland1 aCaul, S.1 aDaniell, T.J.1 aJurd, A.P.S.1 aO'Sullivan, O.S.1 aStapleton, C.S.1 aTitman, J.J.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2016 July, v. 98 p.42-53dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002000167245011400187300001600301520108100317592002801398653003201426653003101458653001301489653001001502653001101512653001901523653001701542653001801559653003401577700002401611773011801635856010101753852000901854655001201863IND60130868420221120233941.0151127e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013086842DNAL7 a10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[293:SLEOFM]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFantz, Debby K.10aShort-term landscape-scale effects of forest management on Peromyscus spp. mice within Missouri Ozark forests  ap. 293-301.  aWe conducted a capture––recapture study within Ozark forests in south-central Missouri to evaluate the short-term (2––5 years after timber removal) effects of even-and uneven-aged forest management on Peromyscus spp. mice inhabiting north-and east-facing slopes of forest compartments. This study was part of the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project, a 100-year experiment investigating landscape-scale impacts of forest management on forest flora and fauna. Changes between pretreatment (1994––1995) and post-treatment (1998––2001) numbers indicated that forest management had a short-term effect on mice. Even-aged management, and to a lesser extent uneven-aged management, appeared to dampen a natural decline in mouse abundance observed on no-harvest sites. Numbers on even-aged sites were greater than those on uneven-aged sites, which were greater than numbers on no-harvest sites following treatment. Both even-and uneven-aged forest management may positively affect Peromyscus spp. numbers, but this trend may change as additional trees are removed.  aPublisher supplied data 0aeven-aged forest management 0alandscape-level experiment 0aMissouri 0aMOFEP 0aOzarks 0aPeromyscus spp 0asilviculture 0asmall mammals 0auneven-aged forest management1 aRenken, Rochelle B.0 tWildlife Society bulletin.g2005 Apr., v. 33, no. 1 p.293-301dWildlife SocietywJournal:jnl9749x0091-76487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[293:SLEOFM]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012400154520131500278592002801593650001101621650001901632650002201651650001901673650002201692650001901714650001001733650001401743650001201757650001601769651001001785700001501795700001501810700001701825700001601842773012901858856007401987852000902061655001202070IND60652652720221120060753.0190713e20180923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065265272DNAL7 a10.3390/su101033942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jiali10aEvaluating the Effect of Policies and the Development of Charging Infrastructure on Electric Vehicle Diffusion in China  aChina has been one of the most aggressive countries in electric vehicle (EV) promotion. However, private EV sales fail to achieve the government&rsquo;s target. In particular, cutting purchase subsidies poses great uncertainty in relation to EV diffusion. In this research, a system dynamics model aims to investigate the influence of government policies, infrastructure development plans, the duration of policies, and the phase out strategy of policies. Parameters relating to consumers&rsquo; preferences are drawn from a questionnaire survey, which is conducted in Shenzhen, the pioneer city in China&rsquo;s EV promotion. The result of a scenario analysis shows that purchase subsidies, purchase restrictions and driving restrictions are the most effective policies for EV promotion. Driving restrictions are more effective but less easy to enforce than purchase restrictions. The number and location of charging piles are much more important than large charging stations. Moreover, EV diffusion can be self-sufficient after current policies have been maintained for 11 years. We find that the gradual removal of subsidies will cause a four-year delay in EV sales entering rapid growth in Shenzhen. However, cutting subsidies in cities without purchase restrictions will cause the failure of EV promotion.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adynamic models 3aelectric vehicles 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3aquestionnaires 3asales 3asubsidies 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3aChina1 aYang, Peng1 aZhang, Kai1 aWang, Faping1 aMiao, Lixin0 tSustainability.g2018 Sept. 23, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101033943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245010900163300001600272520115700288592002801445650001201473650001101485650001601496650001201512650001601524650001001540650001601550650001301566650001501579650001801594650000901612650001201621650000901633650001101642650001501653650001201668650001801680650001101698651001301709700002301722773011601745856007801861852000901939655001201948IND60129216620221119225119.0151124e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012921662DNAL7 a10.1656/045.021.02042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwinton, Mark W.10aPhytoplankton and Macrophyte Response to Increased Phosphorus Availability Enhanced by Rainfall Quantity  ap. 234-246.  aRainfall patterns are becoming more extreme in the northeastern US and are expected to intensify with an increase in extreme precipitation events and a greater frequency of short-term drought. In Northwest Bay, an undeveloped, primarily forested sub-watershed of Lake George, NY, stream discharge and phosphorus loading in 2006 exceeded that of 2007 by more than 3-fold due to unusually heavy rainfall in 2006 and below average rainfall in 2007. The additional phosphorus loading to the open water positively influenced chlorophyll concentrations in 2006, while porewater soluble phosphorus significantly correlated to precipitation in both 2006 and 2007. The elevated porewater concentrations in early summer of 2006 provided a nutrient advantage that resulted in tissue phosphorus in 3 macrophyte species to more than double while no change in nitrogen or carbon was detected. It is believed that the heavy late spring/early summer rainfall in 2006 saturated soils creating additional stormwater run-off and increasing groundwater seepage that supplied ample phosphorus resulting in enhanced phytoplankton biomass and macrophyte uptake of phosphorus.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3agroundwater 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3arain 3aseepage 3asoil 3aspring 3astormwater 3astreams 3asubwatersheds 3asummer 3aNew York1 aBoylen, Charles W,0 tNortheastern naturalist.g2014 June, v. 21, no. 2 p.234-246dHumboldt Field Research Institutex1092-61947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1656%2F045.021.02043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006800146245010100214300001800315520128800333592002801621650001501649650002001664650001101684650001401695650001801709650002501727650002101752650001101773650002301784650001901807650001601826700005501842773013601897856008002033852000902113655001202122IND60691538620221119020954.0200430e20200327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069153862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b119762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarayanaswamy, Nagarajan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4408-017210aArea Occupied by a Water Molecule Adsorbed on Silica at 298 K: Zeta Adsorption Isotherm Approach  ap. 9269-9280.  aThe zeta adsorption isotherm, ZAI, is used with heterogeneity-free adsorption measurements, reported by Baker and Sing, to determine the area of a water molecule adsorbed on TK 800 silica at 298 K. We examine this value by using measured water vapor adsorption isotherms of three non-TK 800 silicas, convert them to thermodynamic adsorption isotherms, and show that they coincide. Then, all four water adsorption measurements are pooled to form a single data set and used to formulate a thermodynamic isotherm for water vapor on silica. We then examine the stability of the adsorbate as a function of the vapor-phase pressure, Pⱽ. This analysis indicates that a phase change occurs for silica when Pⱽ reaches the value of a ZAI constant and this is interpreted as the wetting transition, which is assumed to transform the solid–vapor surface energy to that of the liquid–vapor interface. These assumptions are examined using the ZAI thermodynamic isotherm and the Gibbs adsorption equation to predict the surface energy of any fully hydroxylated silica in the absence of adsorption. Further examination showed that the number of adsorption sites determined by the ZAI corresponds to the surface concentration of silanol groups, which act as centers of water vapor adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adata collection 3aenergy 3aequations 3ahydroxylation 3aliquid-air interface 3aphase transition 3asilica 3asorption isotherms 3athermodynamics 3awater vapor1 aWard, C.

To determine how additional moisture affects red koji preparation as per quality, we compared the growth of Monascus purpureus, enzyme and pigment production, and related gene expressions using our findings. We considered two kinds of red koji: one prepared with additional moisture at the middle part of the preparation and the other prepared without additional moisture. Our results showed that additional moisture did not promote the growth of M. purpureus, but it was significantly increased the pigment (red and yellow) and tended to increase the α‐amylase level and saccharification power. Although adding a high amount of moisture (approximately 60% moisture content) promoted pigment production, it slightly repressed enzyme production. In contrast, adding approximately 50% moisture content promoted enzyme production. These findings showed that the additional moisture can affect the quality of red koji on the purpose. The expression of 10 pigment biosynthetic gene clusters and two glycohydrolase genes in red koji after adding moisture was analyzed through real‐time qPCR. Eight genes were upregulated within 1 hr after adding water, with mppR2 being the first upregulated gene within 30 min. The expression of genes as per pigment production quickly responded to additional moisture during solid‐state fermentation. Moreover, acetyl‐CoA, which is a starting substrate for pigment content in red koji was increased within 3 hr after adding water. This study first described the relationship between additional moisture and expression of pigment biosynthetic genes by Monascus spp. during red koji preparation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonascus purpureus 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aalpha-amylase 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression 3akoji 3ared yeast rice 3asaccharification 3asolid state fermentation 3awater content1 aYoshizaki, Yumiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9582-77501 aYin, Xuan1 aWang, Zitai1 aOkutsu, Kayu1 aFutagami, Taiki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4613-13001 aTamaki, Hisanori1 aTakamine, Kazunori0 tJournal of food science.g2021 Mar., v. 86, no. 3 p.969-976dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.156103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01612naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002200167245007800189300001600267520064500283592002800928653003600956653000800992653002701000653002501027653001801052700002401070773011801094856010101212852000901313655001201322IND60130868520221120223214.0151127e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013086852DNAL7 a10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[307:FTFASF]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeške, Lubomír,12aA system for locating satellite-received transmitters (PTTs) in the field  ap. 307-312.  aWe describe a simple, inexpensive system for locating satellite-received transmitters (PTTs) in the field using a rotating antenna, programmable radio receiver, signal mixer, and a laptop computer with audio and spreadsheet software.

Selection of wheat (Triticum aestivum) lines for the high altitude of Indonesia based on single- and multi-character adaptation. Biodiversitas 22: 5530-5535. The high demand for wheat in Indonesia encourages the assembly of wheat varieties adaptive to the tropical environment. The increase in wheat diversity has been carried out through the crossing process, and it is necessary to evaluate the adaptability of the genotypes resulting from the cross. This study aims to obtain information on the adaptation classes of the F5 population and the differential of agronomic character selection in single and multi-character selection. The study was conducted at the BB Biogen Experimental Garden, Ciwalen (925 masl), in August-December 2020. The F5 of HP1744/Selayar population was used as genetic material with two comparison varieties, namely Guri 1 and Guri 3. The adaptation class for a single character was determined based on seed weight per plant, while for multi-character based on the characters with a wedge between the high category heritability value and the correlation coefficient ?0.5. The result showed that the number of florets, seed weight per plant, number of tillers, number of productive tillers, and weight of seeds in the main panicle were selected as a reference for multi-character selection. The t-test showed that the adaptive and highly adaptive classes genotypes had higher yields than the comparison varieties. The selection differential shows an increase in the mean value for all reference characters. The adaptation class based on a single character resulted in a higher average value of seed weight in all classes compared to selection based on multi-character.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomic traits 3aaltitude 3aflorets 3agardens 3aheritability 3apanicles 3aseed weight 3at-test 3atropics 3awheat 3aIndonesia1 aNURAENI, ELIS 1 aTRIKOESOEMANINGTYAS0 tBiodiversitas.g2021 Nov., v. 22, no. 12dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2212363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002400167245012300191300001600314520126800330592002801598653001801626653001701644653002701661653002201688653002101710653002201731700002001753773011801773856010101891852000901992655001202001IND60130868620221120223210.0151127e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013086862DNAL7 a10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[317:FTFTAS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotvin, Franççois10aTesting 2 aerial survey techniques on deer in fenced enclosures——visual double-counts and thermal infrared sensing  ap. 317-325.  aWe evaluated the accuracy of 2 aerial survey techniques over 4 large enclosures (6.0––29.4 km²) where the deer (Odocoileus virginianus) population was reconstructed using hunting harvest and winter mortality data. We conducted surveys (n == 8) along equally spaced parallel lines. Six surveys using the double-count technique involved 2 independent observers located on the same side of a helicopter who simultaneously counted animals over narrow plots (60-m width). Four of these surveys yielded deer densities 64––83%% of assumed densities (based on the reconstructed population). The 2 other surveys had accuracies of 37 and 46%%, respectively, and were judged unreliable because the sighting probability of the front observer was <0.40. We conducted 2 surveys with a thermal infrared sensor. One survey had the highest accuracy (89%%) among all surveys while the other gave poor results (54%% accuracy). We concluded that when sighting probabilities of observers exceed 0.45 of deer groups, double-count surveys provided valid estimations of densities for management purposes, although 1 deer out of 4 was missed on average. Because of closed forest canopy, thermal infrared sensing of deer along systematic survey lines was not a reliable technique.  aPublisher supplied data 0aaerial survey 0adouble count 0aOdocoileus virginianus 0aPetersen estimate 0athermal infrared 0awhite-tailed deer1 aBreton, Laurier0 tWildlife Society bulletin.g2005 Apr., v. 33, no. 1 p.317-325dWildlife SocietywJournal:jnl9749x0091-76487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[317:FTFTAS]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245012200208246003300330506007600363520173800439592002802177506003702205650002102242650002002263650001302283650001802296650001902314650001102333650000902344650001902353650002802372650001302400650002502413650000902438650001402447650001602461700001902477700001802496700001902514700001802533700001902551700002202570700002102592700001802613700001802631700002902649700002002678700001902698700002102717773007302738856008402811961001502895852000902910655001202919IND60121589720221207105001.0150316e20080618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012158972DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00024322doi7 aPMC26570012pmcid7 a192939442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, Cheeni,10aMultivalent HA DNA Vaccination Protects against Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza Infection in Chickens and Mice3 aMultiple H5N1 Animal Vaccine  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSustained outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in avian species increase the risk of reassortment and adaptation to humans. The ability to contain its spread in chickens would reduce this threat and help maintain the capacity for egg-based vaccine production. While vaccines offer the potential to control avian disease, a major concern of current vaccines is their potency and inability to protect against evolving avian influenza viruses. The ability of DNA vaccines encoding hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from different HPAI H5N1 serotypes was evaluated for its ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies and to protect against homologous and heterologous HPAI H5N1 strain challenge in mice and chickens after DNA immunization by needle and syringe or with a pressure injection device. These vaccines elicited antibodies that neutralized multiple strains of HPAI H5N1 when given in combinations containing up to 10 HAs. The response was dose-dependent, and breadth was determined by the choice of the influenza virus HA in the vaccine. Monovalent and trivalent HA vaccines were tested first in mice and conferred protection against lethal H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 challenge 68 weeks after vaccination. In chickens, protection was observed against heterologous strains of HPAI H5N1 after vaccination with a trivalent H5 serotype DNA vaccine with doses as low as 5 µg DNA given twice either by intramuscular needle injection or with a needle-free device. DNA vaccines offer a generic approach to influenza virus immunization applicable to multiple animal species. In addition, the ability to substitute plasmids encoding different strains enables rapid adaptation of the vaccine to newly evolving field isolates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOrthomyxoviridae 3aavian influenza 3achickens 3adose response 3ahemagglutinins 3ahumans 3amice 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aplasmids 3arecombinant vaccines 3arisk 3aserotypes 3avaccination1 aKong, Wing-Pui1 aWei, Chih-Jen1 aYang, Zhi-Yong1 aNason, Martha1 aStyles, Darrel1 aDeTolla, Louis J.1 aSorrell, Erin M.1 aSong, Haichen1 aWan, Hongquan1 aRamirez-Nieto, Gloria C.1 aPérez, Daniel,1 aNabel, Gary J.1 aOjcius, David M.0 tPloS one.g, v. 3, no. 6dPublic Library of Sciencex1932-62037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00024323Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/APHIS  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001700192100001700209245005900226300001800285506007600303520094200379592002801321596008201349596008301431506003701514650001301551650001901564650003101583650001001614650002201624700001801646773012101664856008501785852000901870655001201879IND60672685320221207103436.0191017e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067268532DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/bty8902doi7 aPMC65461552pmcid7 a303464882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Ashish1 aKelso, Janet10aTissueEnrich: Tissue-specific gene enrichment analysis  ap. 1966-1967.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRNA-Seq data analysis results in lists of genes that may have a similar function, based on differential gene expression analysis or co-expression network analysis.

The annual mode of primary and secondary flight feather replacement was incomplete, resulting in a pattern of varying age feathers that, along with other plumage characteristics, can be used to separate sandhill cranes into juvenile and 3 post-juvenile age groups. Juvenile cranes had even-age flight feathers and juvenile primary and secondary coverts. First-year subadults had even-aged primaries, and only the most distal primary coverts were still juvenile. Also, distal and most of the proximal secondaries were even-aged. Second-year subadults had even-aged distal primaries with a mixture of ages in the proximal primaries and had replaced more than half of all the secondaries. Adults had replaced some of both the distal and proximal primaries, giving the outer flight feathers a mixture of feather ages, and they had mixed-age distal and proximal secondaries. When used as an aging tool in the field, 92.6%% of 109 recaptured post-juvenile aged cranes could be accurately assigned into one of the older age classes.  aPublisher supplied data 0aaging technique 0aFlorida sandhill crane 0agreater sandhill crane 0aGrus canadensis pratensis 0aGrus canadensis tabida 0amolt1 aSchwikert, Stephen T.0 tWildlife Society bulletin.g2005 Apr., v. 33, no. 1 p.326-331dWildlife SocietywJournal:jnl9749x0091-76487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[326:FTFWPK]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245015000178300001600328520150900344592002801853650002301881650001001904650001801914650001301932650002301945650001001968650001801978650001101996650001402007650002002021650001302041650000902054650002402063650002202087650002302109650003302132650002002165650003802185650001702223650003302240650002802273650003402301650004702335650001402382650003302396650004202429650007002471650003302541650003202574650002702606651001002633700001502643700001702658700001502675700001702690700001802707773010802725856004802833852000902881655001202890IND4482582820221122054521.0120529e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448258282DNAL7 a225926582pmid7 a10.1007/s10142-012-0284-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Alok12aA novel blast resistance gene, Pi54rh cloned from wild species of rice, Oryza rhizomatis confers broad spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae   ap. 215-228.  aThe dominant rice blast resistance gene, Pi54 confers resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in different parts of India. In our effort to identify more effective forms of this gene, we isolated an orthologue of Pi54 named as Pi54rh from the blast-resistant wild species of rice, Oryza rhizomatis, using allele mining approach and validated by complementation. The Pi54rh belongs to CC-NBS-LRR family of disease resistance genes with a unique Zinc finger (C3H type) domain. The 1,447 bp Pi54rh transcript comprises of 101 bp 5′-UTR, 1,083 bp coding region and 263 bp 3′-UTR, driven by pathogen inducible promoter. We showed the extracellular localization of Pi54rh protein and the presence of glycosylation, myristoylation and phosphorylation sites which implicates its role in signal transduction process. This is in contrast to other blast resistance genes that are predicted to be intracellular NBS-LRR-type resistance proteins. The Pi54rh was found to express constitutively at basal level in the leaves, but upregulates 3.8-fold at 96 h post-inoculation with the pathogen. Functional validation of cloned Pi54rh gene using complementation test showed high degree of resistance to seven isolates of M. oryzae collected from different geographical locations of India. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrated that a rice blast resistance gene Pi54rh cloned from wild species of rice provides broad spectrum resistance to M. oryzae hence can be used in rice improvement breeding programme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aOryza 3ablast disease 3abreeding 3adisease resistance 3agenes 3aglycosylation 3aleaves 3apathogens 3aphosphorylation 3aproteins 3arice 3asignal transduction 3azinc finger motif 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDisease Resistancexgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMagnaporthexphysiology 2aMolecular Sequence Annotation 2aOryzaxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aIndia1 aSoubam, D.1 aSingh, P.

Bioactive compounds from seaweed’s currently receive major attention from pharmaceutical companies as they express several interesting biological activities which are beneficial for humans. The structural diversity of seaweed metabolites provides diverse biological activities which are expressed through diverse mechanisms of actions. This review mainly focuses on the antiviral activity of seaweed’s extracts, highlighting the mechanisms of actions of some seaweed molecules against infection caused by different types of enveloped viruses: influenza, Lentivirus (HIV-1), Herpes viruses, and coronaviruses. Seaweed metabolites with antiviral properties can act trough different pathways by increasing the host’s defense system or through targeting and blocking virus replication before it enters host cells. Several studies have already established the large antiviral spectrum of seaweed’s bioactive compounds. Throughout this review, antiviral mechanisms and medical applications of seaweed’s bioactive compounds are analyzed, suggesting seaweed’s potential source of antiviral compounds for the formulation of novel and natural antiviral drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthocoronavirinae 3aantiviral properties 3ainfluenza 3amacroalgae 3ametabolites 3avirus replication1 aGonçalves, Ana M.

Extracts from incense and western redcedar exhibited the strongest activity, followed by yellow-cedar, western juniper, and Port-Orford-cedar with moderate activity, and no activity for Douglas-fir and redwood extracts. Chemical composition of the extracts varied both qualitatively and quantitatively among the species with a total of 37 compounds identified by mass spectrometry. Of the 13 individual heartwood compounds bioassayed, three showed strong activity with a Log₁₀ EC₅₀ less than or equal to 1.0 ppm (hinokitiol, thymoquinone, and nootkatin), three expressed moderate activity ranging from 1.0–2.0 ppm (nootkatol, carvacrol, and valencene-11,12-diol), four compounds had weak activity at 2.0–3.0 ppm [α-terpineol, valencene-13-ol, (+)-β-cedrene, (−)-thujopsene], and three had no activity [(+)-cedrol, δ-cadinene, and methyl carvacrol]. All of the most active compounds contained a free hydroxyl group, except thymoquinone. The importance of a free hydroxyl was demonstrated by the tremendous difference in activity between carvacrol (Log₁₀ EC₅₀ 1.81 ± 0.08 ppm) and methyl carvacrol (Log₁₀ EC₅₀ >3.0 ppm). A field trial in California, showed that heartwood chips from redcedar placed on the forest floor for 4 months under Umbellularia californica (California bay laurel) with symptoms of P. ramorum leaf blight significantly limited the accumulation of P. ramorum DNA in the litter layer, compared with heartwood chips from redwood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora ramorum 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aconifers 3aheartwood 3awood extractives 3avolatile compounds 3amonoterpenoids 3asesquiterpenoids 3aantifungal properties 3awood chips 3aUmbellularia californica 3aleaf blight 3adisease control 3afungicides 2aAntifungal Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aTracheophytaxchemistry. 2aPhytophthoraxdrug effects 2aWoodxchemistry 3aCalifornia1 aKelsey, Rick G.1 aKarchesy, Joseph J.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2007 Nov., v. 33, no. 11 p.2133-2147dSpringer-Verlagx0098-03317nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/121583Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-007-9368-03Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01289naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245005800161300001800219520037700237592002800614650001800642650001200660650002700672650002300699650001100722650001200733700002400745773013400769856007500903852000900978655001200987IND60659174420221123044521.0190827e20120112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065917442DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc16431k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrimmin, Mark R.10aWittig-olefination via an yttrium-coordinated betaine  ap. 1745-1747.  aWe report the synthesis of an yttrium phosphonium methylide complex and its reaction with benzophenone to form an excedingly rare hydrocarbon soluble metal-coordinated betaine.

Here we use transects across forested to open bog ecotones at three Russian peatland complexes to assess potential changes in the most abundant group of peatland protists – the testate amoebae. We show that the testate amoeba communities of forested and open bog are markedly different with a very abrupt boundary at, or near, the vegetation ecotone. Changes along our transects suggest that tree encroachment may reduce the trophic level of testate amoeba communities and reduce the contribution of mixotrophic testate amoebae to primary production. Our study strongly suggests that increased tree recruitment on open peatlands will have important consequences for both microbial biodiversity and microbially-mediated ecosystem processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aecotones 3apeatlands 3aprimary productivity 3aprotists 3aspecies recruitment 3atrees 3avegetation 0aPeatland 0aForest 0aTree 0aProtist 0aClimate 0aCarbon1 aCreevy, Angela1 aMalysheva, Elena1 aRatcliffe, Joshua1 aAndersen, Roxane1 aTsyganov, Andrey N.1 aRowson, James G.1 aMarcisz, Katarzyna1 aZielińska, Małgorzata1 aLamentowicz, Mariusz1 aLapshina, Elena D.1 aMazei, Yuri0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2016 July, v. 98 p.18-21dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008600162300001600248520108600264592002801350650001301378650001101391650001501402650001701417650001401434650003301448650001101481650000901492650001801501650001501519650000901534651001001543700001501553700001701568700001401585700001401599773012601613856008101739852000901820655001201829IND60579579520221120232203.0170823e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057957952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-017-2142-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Kan10aHeavy metal concentrations in water and soil along the Hun River, Liaoning, China  ap. 391-398.  aWater and soil samples were collected along the Hun River to study the concentrations of Cr, Cu and Zn during the dry season, medium season and wet season in 2013.

According to the pollution characteristics of heavy metals along the Hun River, a treatment strategy was formulated to provide a scientific basis for the prevention and control of heavy metal pollution along the Hun River.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromium 3acopper 3adry season 3aheavy metals 3apollution 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3awet season 3azinc 3aChina1 aSu, Fangli1 aLiu, Xianmin1 aSong, Zhi1 aFeng, Xue0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2017 Sept., v. 99, no. 3 p.391-398dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-017-2142-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01448naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011400158300001800272520022500290592002800515650002700543650002300570650000900593650001900602650001900621650001500640650002100655650000900676650001700685650001500702700001400717700001500731700001800746700002000764700002000784700001700804773013400821856007400955852000901029655001201038IND60659174520221123044518.0190819e20120220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065917452DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc16434e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Chungui10aCost-effective large-scale synthesis of ZnO photocatalyst with excellent performance for dye photodegradation  ap. 2858-2860.  aZinc oxide with excellent photocatalytic performance for the photodegradation of dyes (superior to Degussa P25 TiO₂) could be easily prepared in large quantity by direct calcination of zinc acetate (Zn(Ac)₂·2H₂O).  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3acost effectiveness 3adyes 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3atitanium dioxide 3azinc 3azinc acetate 3azinc oxide1 aZhang, Qi1 aWu, Aiping1 aJiang, Meijia1 aLiang, Zhenglan1 aJiang, Baojiang1 aFu, Honggang0 tChemical communications.g2012 Feb. 20, v. 48, no. 23 p.2858-2860dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2cc16434e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03438naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245008000167300001600247520198900263592002802252650001702280650001402297650002702311650003902338650001702377650001002394650001602404650001202420650002202432650002302454650002302477650002102500650002102521650002502542650002202567650002402589650001402613650000902627650002002636650001002656650001702666650001502683651001302698700002302711773011102734856007802845852000902923655001202932IND60129217320221119222744.0151124s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012921732DNAL7 a10.1656/045.021.02112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandis, Catherine L.10aNatural Plant Establishment along an Urban Stream, Onondaga Creek, New York  ap. 303-322.  aUrbanization results in a suite of harmful effects to streams, including removal or degradation of riparian vegetation. Many stream-restoration programs address this by adding plants, with limited quantitative knowledge about vegetation dynamics already occurring within the stream corridor. This project examined natural plant establishment along an urbanized stream channel in Syracuse, NY. It had three objectives: first, to relate plant establishment along an urban stream gradient to substrate condition; second, to quantify seeds dormant in the soil at those same sites; and third, to indicate what passive revegetation responses might occur to various treatments along a rural-to-urban gradient. Three sites were selected along such a gradient on Onondaga Creek, near Syracuse, NY. Vegetation plots were established at each site to assess plant germination and establishment under substrate conditions designed to mimic restoration interventions. We also conducted a seedbank study using soil cores collected from these sites. Plant communities were dominated by grasses and forbs. Numbers of alien species increased from 34% at more rural sites to 51% at more urban sites. Seedlings of native riparian trees nonetheless germinated at all three sites along the gradient. Recruitment of native riparian trees (especially Populus deltoides [Eastern Cottonwood], Fraxinus pennsylvanica [Green Ash], and Acer negundo [Boxelder]) exceeded non-native and invasive ones. The riparian seedbank showed disproportionate dominance by herbaceous plants (95.5% of individuals) at all locations surveyed, and invasive species were common (about 25% of all germinants). This study shows some potential for natural regeneration of native trees, but also found a significant source of invasive plants in the soil seedbank that could reduce restoration success. Notably, the study recorded the presence of 16 bryophyte taxa, and the common ones were those typically associated with disturbances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer negundo 3aBryophyta 3aFraxinus pennsylvanica 3aPopulus deltoides subsp. deltoides 3aburied seeds 3aforbs 3agermination 3agrasses 3aherbaceous plants 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3aland restoration 3anatural regeneration 3aplant communities 3aplant establishment 3aseedlings 3asoil 3astream channels 3atrees 3aurbanization 3avegetation 3aNew York1 aLeopold, Donald J.0 tNortheastern naturalist.g2014, v. 21, no. 2 p.303-322dHumboldt Field Research Institutex1092-61947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1656%2F045.021.02113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01602naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015600159300001800315520037000333592002800703650001200731650001400743650002100757650002700778650001200805650001800817650001400835650001800849650001100867650001300878650001100891700002300902700002300925700002000948700001900968773013300987856007501120852000901195655001201204IND60659174620221123044708.0190827e20120305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065917462DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc16438h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHudson, Reuben10aIron-iron oxide core–shell nanoparticles are active and magnetically recyclable olefin and alkyne hydrogenation catalysts in protic and aqueous media  ap. 3360-3362.  aWe report for the first time the use of iron-iron oxide core–shell nanoparticles for the hydrogenation of olefins and alkynes under mild conditions in ethanol and in an aqueous medium.

The Role of Perceived Trust, Knowledge, and Risk  aUntil today, inadequate food supply, malnutrition, food adulteration, etc., are still the key concern in developing economies. In order to address these issues of food security crisis, and to stimulate a sustainable supply of liquid milk (LM), a consumer behavior model was created, in which consumers&rsquo; perceived knowledge, trust and risk were the major catalysts. To shed light on this context, the study examined the effect of consumers&rsquo; perceived knowledge (PK) on their perceived risk (PR) and trust (in information sources and in the product). Further, the influence of consumers&rsquo; perceived knowledge, risk, and trust on their attitude and purchase intention (PI) were investigated via an exclusive survey design. The survey was conducted in the urban area of Dhaka and Chittagong, Bangladesh. The sample of 712 households was selected randomly and interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The data were analyzed employing descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modelling. The results show that during a food security crisis, consumers&rsquo; perceived knowledge amplifies their perceived risk and their trust in information sources (ISs). During such a period, their perceived knowledge does not induce purchase intention but trust in ISs does. Again, consumers&rsquo; perceived risk leads to reduced trust in products, and hence in LM, but not reduced trust in ISs. Moreover, a paradoxical influence was found, where consumers&rsquo; perceived risks had no significant effect on the PI, meaning that they underestimate the risk of purchasing LM. The results also show that when explaining the purchase intention of LM, the effect of &lsquo;trust in ISs&rsquo; was higher than that of their perceived &lsquo;trust in the product (LM)&rsquo; and perceived knowledge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulterated foods 3aconsumer behavior 3adata analysis 3adescriptive statistics 3afactor analysis 3afood availability 3afood security 3ahouseholds 3ainformation sources 3ainterviews 3aliquids 3amalnutrition 3amilk 3amodels 3apurchasing 3aquestionnaires 3arisk perception 3astructural equation modeling 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3aBangladesh1 aAlam, Md.

Thickening liquids facilitates safe swallowing, however, low treatment compliance is a major issue, due to patients’ dislike of thickened liquids. Some studies suggest a negative impact of gum‐based thickeners, currently most used in clinical practice, on sensory properties compared to starch‐based thickeners. This has not yet been investigated in PD. This study's aim was to compare taste, texture, and aroma of gum‐based and starch‐based thickened soups in participants with PD. Gum‐based resource thicken up clear (RTUC) and starch‐based kitchen products potato starch (PS) and quinoa flour (QF) were evaluated in broccoli soup. Texture, aroma, and taste were characterized by rheology, volatile, and sensory profiling. Thickened soups were evaluated in participants with PD and controls through a paired comparison test. Reduced release of 61.4%, 46.2%, and 38.5% of volatiles was observed after thickening with RTUC, PS, and QF, respectively. Overall taste intensity was reduced in RTUC‐ and PS‐thickened soup, respectively. Taste and aroma of PS‐thickened soup were considered more intense by 70.3% and 63.8% of all participants, respectively (n = 36 PD, n = 41 controls), 56.3% preferred the PS‐thickened soup's texture . Taste and aroma of QF‐thickened soup were considered more intense by 68.1% and 65.6% of all participants, respectively (n = 47 PD, n = 31 controls), 58.0% preferred the QF‐thickened soup's texture. Starch‐based thickeners demonstrated higher taste and aroma intensity. However, volatile and sensory profiling demonstrated reduced taste and aroma in all thickeners. Combining kitchen products with flavor enhancers may increase palatability of thickened beverages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3abroccoli 3acompliance 3adysphagia 3aflavor 3aodors 3apalatability 3apotato starch 3aquinoa flour 3arheology 3asoups 3ataste 3atexture1 aVlaemynck, Geertrui1 aBeeckman, Anne‐Sophie1 aVan Weyenberg, Stephanie1 aMatthys, Christophe0 tJournal of food science.g2021 Mar., v. 86, no. 3 p.1039-1047dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.155953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002800142245006800170300001600238520149600254592002801750650001301778650001701791650001201808650002401820650001301844650001701857650001001874650002201884650001101906650000901917650001401926650001401940650001401954650003501968650002002003650000902023650001802032650001802050700001902068773011102087856007802198852000902276655001202285IND60129217420221119222713.0151124s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012921742DNAL7 a10.1656/045.021.02132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollins, Christopher R.10aPatterns of Mortality in a Wild Population of White-Footed Mice  ap. 323-336.  aUnderstanding causes of mortality in a population provides information about the selection pressures acting on individuals in that population. To obtain unbiased estimates of mortality, researchers must track individual animals until they die, retrieve dead animals, and make a forensic estimation to determine the cause. Given the limitations of traditional radio-tracking technology and the biases inherent in other methods of estimating mortality causes, little is known about causes of mortality in small mammals (<1 kg). Here we used an automated radio telemetry system to record activity patterns and detect mortality events in a wild population of Peromyscus leucopus (White-footed Mouse). Mice (n = 32) were fitted with small (1 g) radio-collars. Daily survival rate was 0.98 ± 0.01, which translates to a 50% chance of survival over a 29-day period. Although the species is well known as a vector for various diseases, we found only one death attributable to disease. Most mouse mortality (93%) was caused by predators, primarily Mustela spp. (weasels). We found a significant relationship between Borrelia infection (the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in humans), and increased mortality (χ² = 6.92, df = 1, P = 0.008); there was no detectable effect of sex on survival. Our results suggest that, to the extent that predation risk is dependent on heritable phenotypes, predation risk is the most important evolutionary force acting on mortality in the population we studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorrelia 3aLyme disease 3aMustela 3aPeromyscus leucopus 3abacteria 3adead animals 3adeath 3aforensic sciences 3ahumans 3amice 3aphenotype 3apredation 3apredators 3aradio frequency identification 3aradio telemetry 3arisk 3asmall mammals 3asurvival rate1 aKays, Roland W0 tNortheastern naturalist.g2014, v. 21, no. 2 p.323-336dHumboldt Field Research Institutex1092-61947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1656%2F045.021.02133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014600164506010400310506007600414506011700490520143600607592002802043506003702071650001102108650001202119650002302131650002002154650002002174650001902194650001702213650002102230650001802251651001002269653001002279653002302289653001802312653001802330653003202348653001702380700001802397700001502415700001402430700001902444700001702463773010102480856008302581852000902664655001202673IND60778840520221207121229.0220914e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077884052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.1011242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, C.I.10aImpact of meteorological conditions on water resources in the Upper East Region of Ghana using remotely-sensed and modelled hydrological data  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aThe Upper East Region, Ghana, West Africa, lies within the Volta Basin, floods annually, and contributes substantially to Ghana’s food production. We assessed precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), and total water storage anomalies from GRACE (TWSA) and GLDAS-Noah (TWCA) to study the influence of the UER’s climate on water availability between 2002 and 2017. We analysed (1) the relative uncertainties of the data sets using the triple-cornered hat method, (2) the terrestrial water budget to validate TWSA/TWCA and (3) cross- and multi-correlation analyses to study the relationship between water storage (or availability) and meteorological variables. We found strong correlations between the different P products (r > 0.96), between the different GRACE products (r > 0.95), but not between the different ET products. The hybrid P, TWSA from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and ET from ERA-5 had the smallest relative uncertainties. TWSA increased by 9.8 ± 0.8 mm yr⁻¹ while TWCA decreased. P and ET showed no evidence of a trend and were similarly influenced by the other meteorological variables. However, 93 of 183 months had water surplus and mean net P was positive – indicating the UER received more water than it lost. These agree with the increasing TWSA trend. The water budget validation also confirmed that GRACE can be used for water management; GLDAS-Noah underestimates storage in the UER.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abasins 3aclimate 3aevapotranspiration 3afood production 3ahydrologic data 3aremote sensing 3awater budget 3awater management 3awater storage 3aGhana 0aGRACE 0aEvapotranspiration 0aWater storage 0aPrecipitation 0aGhana’s Upper East Region 0aWater budget1 aHancock, C.M.1 aGrebby, S.1 aMarsh, S.1 aFerreira, V.G.1 aHamm, N.A.S.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 Aug., v. 42 p.101124-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.1011243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245012000160300001800280520162200298592002801920650002701948650001301975650001501988650001802003650002202021650000902043650001602052650001302068650001402081650001602095650000902111650001002120653002702130653002102157653001202178700001702190700001602207773015202223856007802375852000902453655001202462IND60539488920221119182943.0190318e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053948892DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2013-78142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSorter, D.E.10aShort communication: Bacterial counts in recycled manure solids bedding replaced daily or deep packed in freestalls  ap. 2965-2968.  aAn experiment was conducted to compare bacterial counts of mastitis pathogens in deep-packed manure solids bedding with those in manure solids bedding replaced daily from mattresses. Eighteen Holstein cows were housed in 1 pen with 18 stalls. One row of 9 stalls was equipped with mattresses topped with bedding. The back one-third of these stalls toward the alleyway was covered in 25mm of recycled manure solids, which was removed daily for the next 6 d and replaced with bedding from the brisket board and lunge space areas of stalls. The second row of 9 stalls was bedded for 3 wk with 100 to 150mm of deep-pack recycled manure bedding from which only fecal matter was removed daily. After 3 wk, bedding treatments were changed between rows in a switchback design. Mean total gram-negative bacterial counts did not differ between treatments throughout the experiment. Coliform and Klebsiella spp. bacterial counts were lower in daily replaced bedding compared with deep pack across the experiment and on each of d 0, 1, 2, and 6. Streptococcal counts were reduced in daily replacement stalls compared with deep-pack stalls on d 0 and greater in daily replacement stalls compared with deep-pack stalls on d 1, 2, and 6. Daily replacement of recycled manure bedding from the back one-third of the stalls appeared to be an effective approach to reducing exposure to coliforms, specifically Klebsiella, but not streptococci. However, bacterial counts in bedding from both treatments were elevated throughout the trial and resulted in considerable risk for exposure to teats and development of intramammary infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aHolstein 3aKlebsiella 3aStreptococcus 3acoliform bacteria 3acows 3afree stalls 3amastitis 3apathogens 3aplate count 3arisk 3ateats 0arecycled manure solids 0abacterial counts 0abedding1 aKester, H.J.1 aHogan, J.S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 May, v. 97, no. 5 p.2965-2968dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-78143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245005300176500001900229520100800248592002801256650002501284650001401309650002001323650001301343650001301356650002901369700001901398773012301417856008101540852000901621655001201630IND60711659720221116222032.0200928e20200817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071165972DNAL7 a10.3390/epigenomes40300172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiner-Laguarda, Natalia 10aFunctions of Polycomb Proteins on Active Targets  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChromatin regulators of the Polycomb group of genes are well-known by their activities as transcriptional repressors. Characteristically, their presence at genomic sites occurs with specific histone modifications and sometimes high-order chromatin structures correlated with silencing of genes involved in cell differentiation. However, evidence gathered in recent years, on flies and mammals, shows that in addition to these sites, Polycomb products bind to a large number of active regulatory regions. Occupied sites include promoters and also intergenic regions, containing enhancers and super-enhancers. Contrasting with occupancies at repressed targets, characteristic histone modifications are low or undetectable. Functions on active targets are dual, restraining gene expression at some targets while promoting activity at others. Our aim here is to summarize the evidence available and discuss the convenience of broadening the scope of research to include Polycomb functions on active targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell differentiation 3achromatin 3agene expression 3agenomics 3ahistones 3atranscription (genetics)1 aVidal, Miguel 0 tEpigenomes.g2020 Aug. 17, v. 4, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27133x2075-46557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/epigenomes40300173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03687naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002300191245008100214246003200295506007600327520212000403592002802523506003702551650002802588650001602616650001402632650001602646650001002662650003502672650001302707650001902720650001802739650000902757650002502766650001602791700001902807700001902826700002002845700001802865700002102883700002002904700001502924700002202939700002102961773007302982856008403055961000903139852000903148655001203157IND60121590920221207095420.0150316e20090304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012159092DNAL7 a10.1371/journal.pone.00046882doi7 aPMC26500942pmcid7 a192592742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, Brant K.10aBig Genomes Facilitate the Comparative Identification of Regulatory Elements3 aEnhancer ID and Genome Size  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe identification of regulatory sequences in animal genomes remains a significant challenge. Comparative genomic methods that use patterns of evolutionary conservation to identify non-coding sequences with regulatory function have yielded many new vertebrate enhancers. However, these methods have not contributed significantly to the identification of regulatory sequences in sequenced invertebrate taxa. We demonstrate here that this differential success, which is often attributed to fundamental differences in the nature of vertebrate and invertebrate regulatory sequences, is instead primarily a product of the relatively small size of sequenced invertebrate genomes. We sequenced and compared loci involved in early embryonic patterning from four species of true fruit flies (family Tephritidae) that have genomes four to six times larger than those of Drosophila melanogaster . Unlike in Drosophila , where virtually all non-coding DNA is highly conserved, blocks of conserved non-coding sequence in tephritids are flanked by large stretches of poorly conserved sequence, similar to what is observed in vertebrate genomes. We tested the activities of nine conserved non-coding sequences flanking the even-skipped gene of the teprhitid Ceratis capitata in transgenic D. melanogaster embryos, six of which drove patterns that recapitulate those of known D. melanogaster enhancers. In contrast, none of the three non-conserved tephritid non-coding sequences that we tested drove expression in D. melanogaster embryos. Based on the landscape of non-coding conservation in tephritids, and our initial success in using conservation in tephritids to identify D. melanogaster regulatory sequences, we suggest that comparison of tephritid genomes may provide a systematic means to annotate the non-coding portion of the D. melanogaster genome. We also propose that large genomes be given more consideration in the selection of species for comparative genomics projects, to provide increased power to detect functional non-coding DNAs and to provide a less biased view of the evolution and function of animal genomes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aTephritidae 3aevolution 3afruit flies 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenomics 3aintergenic DNA 3ainvertebrates 3aloci 3aregulatory sequences 3avertebrates1 aHare, Emily E.1 aIyer, Venky N.1 aStorage, Steven1 aConner, Laura1 aPapaj, Daniel R.1 aKurashima, Rick1 aJang, Eric1 aEisen, Michael B.1 aHahn, Matthew W.0 tPloS one.g, v. 4, no. 3dPublic Library of Sciencex1932-62037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00046883Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01411naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010900160300001800269520031900287592002800606650001600634650001300650650001400663650002300677650002700700650002300727650001300750650002300763700002000786700001900806700001800825773013400843856007500977852000901052655001201061IND60659174720221123044515.0190827e20120126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065917472DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc16447g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRueping, Magnus10aAsymmetric oxidative Lewis base catalysis—unifying iminium and enamine organocatalysis with oxidations  ap. 2201-2203.  aEnantioselective oxidative domino reactions of allylic alcohols to functionalized aldehydes have been developed.

Using a mouse model, our laboratory previously reported that a paternal history of in utero exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) increased his offspring’s risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Additionally, our group and others have found that formula supplementation also increases the risk of NEC in both humans and mice. Our murine studies revealed that intervening with a paternal fish oil diet preconception eliminated the TCDD-associated outcomes that are risk factors for NEC (e.g., intrauterine growth restriction, delayed postnatal growth, and preterm birth). However, the efficacy of a paternal fish oil diet in eliminating the risk of disease development in his offspring was not investigated. Herein, reproductive-age male mice exposed to TCDD in utero were weaned to a standard or fish oil diet for one full cycle of spermatogenesis, then mated to age-matched unexposed females. Their offspring were randomized to a strict maternal milk diet or a supplemental formula diet from postnatal days 7–10. Offspring colon contents and intestines were collected to determine the onset of gut dysbiosis and NEC. We found that a paternal fish oil diet preconception reduced his offspring’s risk of toxicant-driven NEC, which was associated with a decrease in the relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum, but an increase in the relative abundance of the Negativicutes class.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNegativicutes 3acolon 3adiet 3adysbiosis 3aenterocolitis 3aepidemiology 3afish oils 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amales 3amaternal exposure 3amaternal milk 3amice 3apremature birth 3aprogeny 3aspermatogenesis 3atetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin1 aStephens, Victoria R.1 aAmeli, Sharareh 1 aGaines, Philip N.1 aOsteen, Kevin G.1 aBruner-Tran, Kaylon L.1 aNde, Pius N.0 tMarine drugs.g2022 June 13, v. 20, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md200603903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003100145245018400176506002800360520190100388592002802289506003702317650002102354650000902375650002902384650002402413650004802437650003702485650002902522650001802551650001802569651001402587653002702601653000802628653001602636653001502652653001002667773009402677856008002771852000902851655001202860IND60780021720221207074002.0220530e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078002172DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2210282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrastiyanto, Muhammad Evy 10aSeeds extract of three Artocarpus species: Their in-vitro antibacterial activities against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli isolates from urinary tract infections (UTIs)  aResource is Open Access  aPrastiyanto ME. 2021. Seeds extract of three Artocarpus species: Their in-vitro antibacterial activities against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli isolates from urinary tract infections (UTIs). Biodiversitas 22: 4362-4368. Multidrug-resistant (MDR)-E. coli is a major cause and has become a very serious problem in urinary tract infections (UTIs). As a result, it requires an antibacterial agent derived from biological materials. It has been reported that the seeds of three species of Artocarpus (A. heterophyllous, A. champeden, and A. camansi) have antibacterial properties against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, there are three other Artocarpus species in Indonesia, i.e., keledang (A. lanceipolius), tarra (A. elasticus), and terap (A. Odoratissimus) whose antibacterial property has not been investigated. To minimize the research gap, this study aims to determine the antibacterial activity of seed extracts of A. lanceipolius, A. elasticus, and A. odoratissimus against MDR-E. coli isolates of UTIs. Antibacterial activity was evaluated using the agar well diffusion assay. The microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values. The results revealed that the seed extracts of A. lanceipolius, A. elasticus, and A. odoratissimus have the potential as antibacterial agents against MDR-E. coli isolate of UTIs. A. elasticus seed extract shows the widest zone of inhibition in the range of 7.0-13.3 mm and the smallest MIC and MBC values ??of 6.25-12.5 mg/mL and 12.5-25 mg/mL, respectively. In conclusion, A. lanceipolius, A. elasticus, and A. odoratissimus seed extracts have the potential to be developed as antibacterial agents against UTI-causing MDR-E. coli. Further in vivo research and determining the mode of action of antibacterial activity are needed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aagar 3aantibacterial properties 3amechanism of action 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amultiple drug resistance 3aseed extracts 3aurinary tract 3aIndonesia 0aantibacterial activity 0auti 0amdr-e. coli 0aartocarpus 0aseeds0 tBiodiversitas.g2021 Sept., v. 22, no. 10dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2210283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01466naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245008500164300001600249520050800265592002800773650001400801650001500815650001400830650001100844650001400855650001500869650001300884651001800897700002100915773011700936856007801053852000901131655001201140IND60129217720221119223032.0151124e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012921772DNAL7 a10.1656/045.021.03032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlowers, James R.10aNotes on the Fish Parasite Nitzschia (Monogenoidea: Capsalidae) in North America  ap.

To better understand the relationships between the key abiotic and biotic factors and cyanobacterial blooms, we measured the abundance and diversity of prokaryotic organisms by high-throughput sequencing, the abundance of key genes involved in microcystin production and nitrogen fixation or loss as well as several physicochemical parameters at several stations in Lake Taihu during a cyanobacterial bloom of Microcystis sp.. Measurements of the copy number of denitrification-related genes and 16S rRNA analyses show that denitrification potential and denitrifying bacteria abundance increased in concert with non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria (Microcystis sp.), suggesting limited competition between cyanobacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers for nutrients, although potential bacteria-mediated N loss may hamper Microcystis growth. The present study provides insight into the importance of different abiotic and biotic factors in controlling cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria spatial variability in Lake Taihu.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrocystis 3abiotic factors 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying bacteria 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicrocystins 3anitrogen fixation 3anutrients 3aphysicochemical properties 3aribosomal RNA 3aChina1 aLu, Tao1 aSong Hào,1 aLavoie, Michel1 aChui, Kawai,1 aFan, Xiaoji1 aPan, Xiangliang0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2017 Sept., v. 99, no. 3 p.380-384dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-017-2149-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04887naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245014200196300001600338500002000354520299600374592002803370650002103398650002503419650001603444650001303460650001503473650001403488650003303502650002703535650003503562650002203597650001703619650002403636650002003660650002303680650002703703650001703730650002003747650001803767650001903785650002403804650002503828650001703853650001403870700001303884700001603897700001803913700002503931700001803956700002103974700002503995700001704020700002104037773013204058856007404190852000904264655001204273IND60782564220221122140107.0220710e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078256422DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.141112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Guodong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2403-576410aEffect of L‐citrulline supplementation on sperm characteristics and hormonal and antioxidant levels in blood and seminal plasma of rams  ap. 722-733.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWith the aim of providing a theoretical basis for the application of L‐citrulline (L‐Cit) in animal husbandry, the effects of L‐Cit on reproductive hormone levels, antioxidant capacity and semen quality of rams were studied by feeding them varying doses of L‐Cit. A total of 32 rams were randomly divided into four groups with eight rams each. After all rams were trained to donate sperm normally, the control group was fed a basic diet, whereas the experimental groups I, II and III were provided with feed supplemented with 4, 8 and 12 g/d of L‐Cit respectively. The experiment was conducted for 70 days, during which blood samples were collected from the jugular vein on days 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60, and semen samples were collected on days 0, 20, 40 and 60. In the same group, 100 µl of semen was used to test for quality, The rest of the semen sample and blood samples were centrifuged at 600 g for 15 min, and the supernatant and serum, respectively, were used to determine the levels reproductive hormones and antioxidant indices. Ram semen samples were also collected on day 70 and used to study sperm plasma membrane, substitution and mitochondrial membrane potential. Compared with the control group, the groups receiving L‐Cit showed an increase in sperm concentration and number of linear motile sperm (p < .01); a decrease in the number of dead sperm (p < .01); an increase in sperm viability, particularly in groups II and III (p < .01); and an increase in sperm mitochondrial membrane potential (p < .01). Moreover, groups I, II and III showed significantly higher levels of serum gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH‐Px) and nitric oxide (NO) (p < .01). Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH) levels increased in groups I (p < .05), II (p < .05) and III (p < .01), whereas testosterone (T), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels increased in groups I and II (p < .01). Serum total antioxidant capacity (T‐A) increased (p < .05), whereas both hydroxyl radical (·OH) and peroxy radical (O2·‐) levels decreased (p < .01). Compared with the control, all groups had significantly higher SOD and GSH‐Px in their seminal plasma (p < .01), and groups I, II (p < .05 for both) and III (p < .01) had higher levels of GnRH and FSH. LH, CAT and NO levels increased in group I (p < .05), II and III (p < .01 for both); malondialdehyde levels decreased in groups I, II (p < .05 for both) and group III (p < .01); and O2·‐ levels decreased in groups I, II and III (p < .01). Under our experimental conditions, GnRH, FSH, LH, T, CAT, SOD, T‐A, GSH‐PX and NO levels in the serum and seminal plasma of rams receiving L‐Cit increased, whereas Oestradiol (E₂), O2·‐ and ·OH levels in the seminal plasma decreased; this improved the semen quality of rams supplemented with L‐Cit. Moreover, supplementation with 12 g/d gave the best results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal husbandry 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3acitrulline 3aestradiol 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ajugular vein 3aluteinizing hormone 3amalondialdehyde 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3anitric oxide 3aplasma membrane 3asemen quality 3aseminal plasma 3asperm concentration 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atestosterone 3aviability1 aZhao, Xi1 aSong, Yukun1 aHaire, Aerman1 aDilixiati, Airixiati1 aLiu, Zhiqiang1 aZhao, Shangshang1 aAihemaiti, Aikebaier1 aFu, Xiangwei1 aWusiman, Abulizi0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2022 July, v. 57, no. 7 p.722-733dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.141113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03597naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245011200180300001800292506011700310506007600427520173200503592002802235506003702263650001802300650002002318650001102338650001202349650002902361650002102390650001802411650003002429650001002459650001202469650001002481650002402491650002602515650000902541650001502550653000802565653000802573653000902581653000902590653000902599653001102608653000902619653000802628653001502636653001802651653001302669653001002682653003102692700002102723700002002744700001802764773009502782856008502877852000902962655001202971IND60778840920221207121221.0220606s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077884092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoech, Peter Kiplang’at10aEffects of dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans arctigenin and trachelogenin on the motility of isolated rat ileum  ap. 1222-1232.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDibenzylbutyrolactone-type lignans are phenolic compounds of medical importance. The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of two such lignans, arctigenin and trachelogenin on the motility of isolated rat ileum and obtain indications on their mechanism of action. They were isolated from Arctium lappa and Cirsium arvense, respectively, which have been used traditionally to treat gastrointestinal disorders. 1–1.5 cm long segments of distal ileum were obtained from adult male Wistar rats. The intestinal segments were suspended vertically in a well-aerated organ-bath according to Magnus mounting method. The intestinal motility was monitored for 30 min before treatment to obtain the baseline, followed by treatment with 1 µM, 10 µM, 20 µM and 40 µM concentrations of arctigenin and 0.5 µM, 1 µM, 10 µM and 20 µM of trachelogenin concentrations. The amplitude, tone, and period of spontaneous contractions were measured after 15 and 30 min of treatment. To investigate their mechanism of action, cholinergic, glutamatergic, adrenergic antagonists and compounds inhibiting nitric oxide synthase and L-type calcium channels were also tested. Arctigenin and trachelogenin decreased the frequency of contractions in a dose-dependent manner. At the concentration of 20 µM and 40 µM of trachelogenin and arctigenin, respectively, there was a marked alteration in spontaneous contraction pattern with an observable increase in the period time. This activity was comparable to 0.5 µM nifedipine (L-type calcium channel blocker) treatment. Our results demonstrate relaxant effect of arctigenin and trachelogenin on the ileum motility that may be mediated by L-type calcium ion channel blockade.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArctium lappa 3aCirsium arvense 3aadults 3acalcium 3acalcium channel blockers 3acalcium channels 3adose response 3agastrointestinal motility 3aileum 3alignans 3amales 3amechanism of action 3anitric oxide synthase 3arats 3atoxicology 0aAP5 0aATG 0aCNQX 0aDMSO 0aHPLC 0aL-NAME 0aNMDA 0aTGN 0aArctigenin 0aTrachelogenin 0aMotility 0aIleum 0aL-type calcium ion channel1 aBoldizsár, Imre1 aDobolyi, Arpád1 aVarró, Petra0 tToxicology reports.g2022, v. 9 p.1222-1232dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245009200164520147100256592002801727650001801755650001101773650001801784650001901802650002001821650001501841650001701856650001901873650001701892650001801909650001501927650001701942650001601959650001301975650000901988650001301997650001102010650001102021700002502032700002102057700001902078700002502097700002202122700002202144700002602166700002402192773012602216856007502342852000902417655001202426IND60781013220221120200130.0220623e20220614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078101322DNAL7 a10.3390/md200603922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoyanova, Emiliya 10aAntitumor Properties of Epitope-Specific Engineered Vaccine in Murine Model of Melanoma  aFinding new effective compounds of natural origin for composing anti-tumor vaccines is one of the main goals of antitumor research. Promising anti-cancer agents are the gastropodan hemocyanins–multimeric copper-containing glycoproteins used so far for therapy of different tumors. The properties of hemocyanins isolated from the marine snail Rapana thomasiana (RtH) and the terrestrial snail Helix aspersa (HaH) upon their use as carrier-proteins in conjugated vaccines, containing ganglioside mimotope GD3P4 peptide, were studied in the developed murine melanoma model. Murine melanoma cell line B16F10 was used for solid tumor establishment in C57BL/6 mice using various schemes of therapy. Protein engineering, flow cytometry, and cytotoxicity assays were also performed. The administration of the protein-engineered vaccines RtH-GD3P4 or HaH-GD3P4 under the three different regimens of therapy in the B16F10 murine melanoma model suppressed tumor growth, decreased tumor incidence, and prolonged the survival of treated animals. The immunization of experimental mice induced an infiltration of immunocompetent cells into the tumors and generated cytotoxic tumor-specific T cells in the spleen. The treatment also generates significantly higher levels of tumor-infiltrated M1 macrophages, compared to untreated tumor-bearing control mice. This study demonstrated a promising approach for cancer therapy having potential applications for cancer vaccine research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelix aspersa 3aRapana 3aanimal models 3acancer therapy 3acancer vaccines 3acell lines 3acytotoxicity 3aflow cytometry 3agangliosides 3aglycoproteins 3ahemocyanin 3aimmunization 3amacrophages 3amelanoma 3amice 3apeptides 3asnails 3aspleen1 aMihaylova, Nikolina 1 aRalchev, Nikola 1 aGanova, Petya 1 aBradyanova, Silviya 1 aManoylov, Iliyan 1 aRaynova, Yuliana 1 aIdakieva, Krassimira 1 aTchorbanov, Andrey 0 tMarine drugs.g2022 June 14, v. 20, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md200603923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03734naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245011400167300001800281520225500299592002802554650002602582650004402608650001202652650001002664650001602674650002802690650001502718650001602733650002102749650001902770650001802789650000902807650001302816650001102829650001502840650001502855653001902870653000902889653002802898653002302926700001402949700001702963700002002980773015303000856007803153852000903231655001203240IND60539489220221119183051.0190318e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053948922DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2013-67442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenis-Robichaud, J.10aAccuracy of milk ketone bodies from flow-injection analysis for the diagnosis of hyperketonemia in dairy cows  ap. 3364-3370.  aThe objectives of this study were (1) to determine the correlations between blood β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) and milk components [BHBA, acetone, fat, protein, and fat:protein (F:P) ratio], and (2) to establish optimal thresholds for milk components to predict hyperketonemia in dairy cows. Data on 163 cows from 37 herds were used in this cross-sectional study. Herds were visited once during the study period, and cows between 2 and 90 d in milk were blood sampled within 4h of milk sampling for the Dairy Herd Improvement test. Blood BHBA concentrations were measured using a cow-side electronic meter, Precision Xtra, which was considered the gold standard test in this study. Milk BHBA and acetone concentrations were measured in Dairy Herd Improvement milk samples by flow-injection analysis; whereas, milk fat and protein were tested using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Hyperketonemia was defined by a blood BHBA concentration ≥1.4mmol/L. The prevalence of hyperketonemia (based on blood BHBA values) in this study population was 21.0%. Pearson correlation coefficients between blood BHBA and milk BHBA, acetone, fat, protein, and F:P ratio were 0.89, 0.73, 0.21, 0.04, and 0.17, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated and thresholds for each individual milk component were determined based on the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity. Optimal threshold values for hyperketonemia were milk BHBA ≥0.20mmol/L, acetone ≥0.08mmol/L, fat ≥4.2%, and F:P ratio ≥1.3. Based on these thresholds, milk BHBA and acetone had greater sensitivity (84 and 87%, respectively) and greater specificity (96 and 95%, respectively) than the other milk components (fat, protein, and F:P). Series and parallel testing slightly improved the accuracy of milk BHBA and acetone values to predict hyperketonemia. A multivariable model that accounted for milk BHBA and milk acetone values simultaneously had the highest accuracy of all tested models for predicting hyperketonemia. These results support that milk BHBA and milk acetone values from flow-injection analysis are accurate diagnostic tools for hyperketonemia in dairy cows and could potentially be used for herd-level hyperketonemia surveillance programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetone 3ablood 3acorrelation 3across-sectional studies 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3aherd improvement 3ahyperketonemia 3aketone bodies 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprediction 0ahyperketonemia 0amilk 0aflow-injection analysis 0aβ-hydroxybutyrate1 aDubuc, J.1 aLefebvre, D.1 aDesCôteaux, L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 June, v. 97, no. 6 p.3364-3370dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-67443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245013600166500001400302520135600316592002801672650002501700650001401725650002501739650001501764650001101779650001201790650001601802650001601818650001801834650001101852700002301863700002101886700002001907700002301927700002401950700002001974700002101994773012002015856007902135852000902214655001202223IND60724487620221120204441.0210122e20210111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072448762DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120100522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBedini, Stefano 10aBioactivity of Different Chemotypes of Oregano Essential Oil against the Blowfly Calliphora vomitoria Vector of Foodborne Pathogens  aNAL-light  aBlowflies play a substantial role as vectors of microorganisms, including human pathogens. The control of these insect pests is an important aspect of the prevention of foodborne diseases, which represent a significant public health threat worldwide. Among aromatic plants, spices essential oils (EOs) are the most suitable to protect food from insect pests. In this study, we determined the chemical composition of three oregano EOs and assessed their toxicity and deterrence to oviposition against the blowfly Calliphora vomitoria L. The chemical analyses showed that the EOs belonged to three chemotypes: one with a prevalence of carvacrol, the carvacrol chemotype (CC; carvacrol, 81.5%), and two with a prevalence of thymol, the thymol/p-cymene and thymol/γ-terpinene chemotypes (TCC and TTC; thymol, 43.8, and 36.7%, respectively). The bioassays showed that although all the three EOs chemotypes are able to exert a toxic activity against C. vomitoria adults (LD₅₀ from 0.14 to 0.31 μL insect⁻¹) and eggs (LC₅₀ from 0.008 to 0.038 μL cm⁻²) as well as deter the oviposition (Oviposition Activity Index, OAI, from 0.40 ± 0.04 to 0.87 ± 0.02), the bioactivity of oregano EOs significantly varies among the chemotypes, with the thymol-rich EOs (TCC and TTC) overall demonstrating more effectiveness than the carvacrol-rich (CC) EO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalliphora vomitoria 3acarvacrol 3achemical composition 3achemotypes 3ahumans 3aoregano 3aoregano oil 3aoviposition 3apublic health 3athymol1 aFarina, Priscilla 1 aNapoli, Edoardo 1 aFlamini, Guido 1 aAscrizzi, Roberta 1 aVerzera, Antonella 1 aConti, Barbara 1 aZappalà, Lucia 0 tInsects.g2021 Jan. 11, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120100523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011200172300001800284520138400302592002801686650001701714650001301731650001001744650002801754650002101782650002301803650001001826650000701836650002401843650001701867650002101884653001701905653002301922653002601945653001701971653001801988700002102006700002002027700002302047700002302070700002502093773011302118856008602231852000902317655001202326IND60587160020221120050317.0191126e20171003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058716002DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2016.12698072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamzehloo, Majid12aA new blend of polymeric encapsulation of azithromycin by spray-drying with a pH responsive in drug release  ap. 1688-1695.  aThe microencapsulation of macrolides with polymers has been reported to retard the release of the drug in oral cavity. However, these methods are unable to control drug release in gastrointestinal tract. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of formulation of a new polymeric encapsulation of azithromycin which is suitable for both masking and sustained release usage. Eudragit E100 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 were chosen as the barrier coatings. The spray drying technique was used to obtain the microcapsules containing azithromycin. To obtain the initial results, the effects of several parameters were evaluated. A 3:2:1 ratio of E100:PEG 4000:azithromycin at pH 6 gave the best coating condition. Thermogravimetric analysis and IR analysis data confirmed the encapsulation of azithromycin inside polymers. The encapsulated drug was released in different rates from the particles by changing the pH (1.7 and 7.4). An analysis of the kinetic release properties indicates that the release of the drug is a combination of swelling and diffusion mechanism. The synergistic cooperation between polymers and drug due to the existence of several hydrogen bonding is supposed to influence the pH-responsive property of the encapsulated drug. Moreover, the use of mixtures of E100 and PEG 4000 appears to offer a good balance between cost and efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazithromycin 3acoatings 3adrugs 3agastrointestinal system 3ahydrogen bonding 3amicroencapsulation 3amouth 3apH 3apolyethylene glycol 3aspray drying 3athermogravimetry 0aAzithromycin 0acontrolled-release 0apolymer encapsulation 0aspray-drying 0ataste-masking1 aKarimi, Jahangir1 aEghbali, Narges1 aMirzakhani, Mohsen1 aAghapoor, Kioumars1 aDarabi, Hossein Reza0 tDrying technology.g2017 Oct. 3, v. 35, no. 14 p.1688-1695dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12238x1532-23007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2016.12698073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245010900158300001600267520132300283592002801606650001401634650001901648650001801667650002201685650002001707650002301727650001401750650001101764650002101775650002101796650001401817650003801831650001401869650001101883650002501894650002501919651001001944700001401954700001401968700001601982773014601998856008102144852000902225655001202234IND60439904520221121035242.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043990452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11099-015-0125-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, F.10aResponses of two endemic species of Hippophae at the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to elevated CO2 concentration  ap. 395-402.  aThe responses of photosynthesis and growth to increasing CO₂ concentration ([CO₂]) were investigated in Hippophae gyantsensis and H. rhamnoides subsp. yunnanensis, which are endemic at the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and phylogenetically related, but distributed parapatrically in divergent regions. Seedlings of the two species were grown at ambient [AC; 360 μmol(CO₂) mol⁻¹] and elevated [EC; 720 μmol(CO₂) mol⁻¹] [CO₂] in growth chambers. The responses to EC were significantly different between the two species. EC induced an increase in photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, intrinsic water-use efficiency, apparent quantum efficiency, total dry mass, and a decrease in photorespiration rate, maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco, and maximum electron transport rate in H. gyantsensis compared to those in H. rhamnoides subsp. yunnanensis. Moreover, a significant increase in leaf nitrogen content and a decrease in root/shoot ratio was also observed in H. gyantsensis. H. gyantsensis showed a significantly higher specific leaf area than that of H. rhamnoides through treatments. Relative to H. rhamnoides subsp. yunnanensis, H. gyantsensis showed a greater potential to increase photosynthesis and growth to cope with the increasing [CO₂] and it might expand its distribution range in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHippophae 3acarbon dioxide 3acarboxylation 3aelectron transfer 3agrowth chambers 3aindigenous species 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3anitrogen content 3aphotorespiration 3aphylogeny 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3astomatal conductance 3awater use efficiency 3aChina1 aXu, T.

Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix, the dried rhizomes and roots of Notopterygium incisum Ting et H.T. Chang or Notopterygium forbesii Boiss (family: Umbelliferae), are well-known traditional Chinese medicines. These all herbal medicines were named kangwhoal in China, Japan and Korea. However no discrimination methods for the origin and no simultaneous analysis methods for bioactive components are currently available. We developed simultaneous analysis of six biomarkers including nodakenin (1), oxypeucedanin (2), bisabolangelone (3), notopterol (4), imperatorin (5), and isoimperatorin (6) using HPLC method. HPLC chromatographic separation was conducted with C18 column and mobile phase of acetonitrile (A) — water (B) (gradient, (A) 35%–65% (30 min)). The analytical condition was validated with specificity, selectivity, linearity (correlation coefficients of all bio marker were more than 0.999.), recovery (94.9–106.8%), precision and accuracy (intra and inter RSD < 2.99%). In addition, principal component analysis and cluster analysis was performed on analytical data of 38 commercial kangwhoal samples from different places. We confirmed to classify kangwhoal origins and this study was applied to quality evaluation and chemotaxonomy of medicinal herbs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHansenia forbesii 3aHansenia weberbaueriana 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aacetonitrile 3abioactive properties 3abiomarkers 3achemotaxonomy 3acluster analysis 3acold 3acorrelation 3aheadache 3aherbal medicines 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amedicinal plants 3aprincipal component analysis 3arhizomes 3aroots1 aKim, Kyoung Young1 aHan, Chi Soo1 aKi, Kim Sool1 aMin, Kim Ji1 aZhang, Xiaodan1 aWhang, Wan Kyunn0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2012 Apr., v. 35, no. 4 p.691-699dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:J000001242x0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12272-012-0413-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245009100175300001800266520117900284592002801463650001001491650001901501650001601520650001501536650002301551700002101574700001201595700001501607700002401622773008701646856009001733852000901823655001201832IND60090337620221116234719.0141102e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009033762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.04.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrlova, Yuliya10aElectrospun nanofibers as a tool for architecture control in engineered cardiac tissue  ap. 5615-5624.  aThis paper presents an in vitro system for cardiac tissue engineering based on cardiomyocytes cultured on electrospun polymethylglutarimide (PMGI) nanofibrous meshes either imprinted on solid substrate or suspended in space. Special care was taken over the ability to control the tissue architecture. The electrospinning process allowed nano-scale diameter PMGI fibers with different positioning density to be collected in a random or in an aligned way that defines the general configuration of the mesh. Micro-imprinted on solid substrate nanofibers guarantee aligned cell growth, when the distance between them is 30 μm or less. Suspended in 3D space, nanofibers define the overall architecture of the tissue, depending on orientation and positioning density of the nanofibers. As a result, cardiac cells proliferated into contractile tissue filaments, open-worked tissue meshes and continuous anisotropic cell sheets. Alignment of the cells was characterized by elongation of the cell shape and orientation of the α-actin filaments supported by the FFT data. The advantage of this method is its ability to maintain both three-dimensionality and structural anisotropy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3acardiomyocytes 3acell growth 3ananofibers 3atissue engineering1 aMagome, Nobuyuki1 aLiu, Li1 aChen, Yong1 aAgladze, Konstantin0 tBiomaterials.g2011 Aug., v. 32, no. 24 p.5615-5624dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.04.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245008900208520207200297592002802369650001602397650002702413650002602440650001502466650001202481650002302493650001302516650002602529650002002555650002202575650002302597650002602620650001902646650000702665650001602672650001402688650001102702650002602713650002002739650001702759653001302776653001402789653001202803653002602815653002502841653002002866700001902886700006002905773010902965856008603074852000903160655001203169IND60661513420221119081312.0200210e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066151342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.1075782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Trang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4526-687910aContribution of different catalytic types of peptidases to soil proteolytic activity  aSoil organic nitrogen is largely composed of proteinaceous material, hence, the extracellular peptidases that are widely produced by microorganisms play a critical role in the recycling of soil organic nitrogen. But why do microbes produce such a variety of functionally different peptidases? In theory, this could be an adaptation to substrate heterogeneity, but it may also be an adaptation to variable soil conditions. Here we characterized the contribution of different catalytic types, or classes, of peptidases present in soil with the intent to determine if their relative contributions would vary as a function of soil properties. We screened specific peptidase inhibitors and optimized their concentrations to work effectively in soil. Total potential proteolytic activity was partitioned among several peptidase classes by adding class-specific inhibitors to the peptidase assay. Using Pepstatin A, EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and E64 (epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido (4-guanidino) butane), we were able to discriminate among aspartic, metallo-, serine, and cysteine peptidases, respectively. We found that diverse peptidases were active and contributed to the proteolytic activity in soil. Extracellular peptidase profiles varied among different soils and were associated with soil chemical and microbial properties. Metallopeptidases contributed 30–50% of the soil proteolytic activity in all soils. A higher relative contribution of metallopeptidase activity was found in less acidic soils, reflecting its neutral pH optimum. Serine peptidases were only detected in soil from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands (10–20% of total proteolytic activity) but not in soils under red alder (Alnus rubra). The relative activity of aspartic peptidase correlated positively with the fungal:bacterial ratios of the soils. Our results lend support to the view that microbial communities might modify their peptidase profile to optimize protein utilization in response to soil and other environmental factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlnus rubra 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aacid soils 3abutanes 3acatalytic activity 3acysteine 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibitors 3ametalloproteinases 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms 3apH 3aproteolysis 3arecycling 3aserine 3asoil organic nitrogen 3asoil properties 3asoil quality 0aProtease 0aPeptidase 0aProtein 0aExtracellular enzymes 0aPeptidase inhibitors 0aPeptidase assay1 aKleber, Markus1 aMyrold, David D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6418-226X0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2019 Nov., v. 138 p.107578-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.1075783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245008000168300001600248520151500264592002801779650002301807650001801830650002001848650002101868653002001889653001801909653001001927653001601937653001801953653002201971700001501993700001502008700001702023700001602040700001702056700001902073700001702092700001802109700001602127700001502143700001502158700001902173700001402192700002202206700001802228700001602246700001702262700001702279773009502296856008902391852000902480655001202489IND60525716120221121070224.0190401e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052571612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, L.10aStocks and flows of natural and human-derived capital in ecosystem services  ap. 151-162.  aThere is growing interest in the role that natural capital plays in underpinning ecosystem services. Yet, there remain differences and inconsistencies in the conceptualisation of capital and ecosystem services and the role that humans play in their delivery. Using worked examples in a stocks and flows systems approach, we show that both natural capital (NC) and human-derived (produced, human, social, cultural, financial) capital (HDC) are necessary to create ecosystem services at many levels. HDC plays a role at three stages of ecosystem service delivery. Firstly, as essential elements of a combined social-ecological system to create a potential ecosystem service. Secondly, through the beneficiaries in shaping the demand for that service. Thirdly, in the form of additional capital required to realise the ecosystem service flow. We show that it is possible, although not always easy, to separately identify how these forms of capital contribute to ecosystem service flow. We discuss how applying a systems approach can help identify critical natural capital and critical human-derived capital to guide sustainable management of the stocks and flows of all forms of capital which underpin provision of multiple ecosystem services. The amount of realised ecosystem service can be managed in several ways: via the NC & HDC which govern the potential service, and via factors which govern both the demand from the beneficiaries, and the efficiency of use of the potential service by those beneficiaries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem services 3ahuman capital 3anatural capital 3asystems analysis 0aNatural capital 0aHuman capital 0aScale 0aSustainable 0aBeneficiaries 0aPotential service1 aNorton, L.1 aAustin, Z.1 aBrowne, A.L.1 aDonovan, D.1 aEmmett, B.A.1 aGrabowski, Z.J1 aHoward, D.C.1 aJones, J.P.G.1 aKenter, J.O1 aManley, W.1 aMorris, C.1 aRobinson, D.A.1 aShort, C.1 aSiriwardena, G.M.1 aStevens, C.J.1 aStorkey, J.1 aWaters, R.D.1 aWillis, G.F.0 tLand use policy.g2016 Mar., v. 52 p.151-162dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245005600154300001800210520110600228592002801334650001201362650001301374650001601387650001801403650001701421650001301438700001701451700002301468700002301491773009801514856007501612852000901687655001201696IND60577036120171220000000.0170806e20140520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057703612DNAL7 a10.1021/la50052272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yan10aPoly(N-isopropylacrylamide)/Poly(dopamine) Capsules  ap. 5592-5598.  aPolymer capsules are an interesting concept considered in nanobiotechnology. Approaches that facilitate their assembly remain sought after. Poly(dopamine) (PDA) has been considered and successfully applied in this context. We recently demonstrated that PDA could be copolymerized with different types of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNiPAAm) to assemble mixed films on planar substrates. Herein, we transferred this approach onto colloidal substrates and characterized the film thickness depending on the film composition and template particles size. While the membrane of capsules assembled using 5 μm template particles exhibited strong dependency on the film composition, smaller templates led to capsules with similar membrane thickness. We then compared the permeability of different capsules using fluorescently labeled dextran and fluorescein. We found that the permeability of capsules was heavily dependent on the polymer composition and the template particle size. These fundamental findings contribute to the potential of these capsules, assembled in one-step, for biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3adextran 3adopamine 3afluorescein 3aparticle size 3apermeability 3apolymers1 aTeo, Boon M.1 aGoldie, Kenneth

We perform an integrated assessment of different mitigation policies for Switzerland focusing on the residential sector. We analyze the case of pure incentive taxes and technical regulations. For our analysis, we have coupled a general equilibrium model with a Swiss residential energy model. We find that a progressive GHG tax of more than 200 USD2000/tCO2Â eq is necessary to reach a target of 50% reduction of GHG emissions in 2050.

Male moths from the population in the San Gabriel Mountains of southern California are attracted optimally to a blend ofE10,Z12‐hexadeca‐10,12‐dien‐1‐yl acetate (acetate);E10,Z12‐hexadeca‐10,12‐dien‐1‐ol (alcohol); andE10,Z12‐hexadeca‐10,12‐dienal (aldehyde), whereas males from the population at Robinson Summit, northwest of Ely, Nevada, are attracted to the two‐component blend of alcohol and aldehyde. Populations along the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada Mountains are composed of individuals of both pheromone types and a type intermediate between the two. Antennae from male moths from the different pheromone types give distinctly different electroantennographic responses when challenged with blends of the pheromone components, with San Gabriel Mountains males showing a large response to acetate and lesser responses to alcohol and aldehyde. In contrast, antennae from Robinson Summit males, which are attracted to lures containing only alcohol and aldehyde, exhibit a large response to alcohol, a smaller response to aldehyde, and minimal or no response to acetate. Male moths from the eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains give antennal responses similar to those of either San Gabriel Mountains or Robinson Summit males. However, eastern Sierra populations also contain an intermediate type that does not occur in areas where the major pheromone types do not occur together. This third type may be a hybrid between the two other pheromone types, and it is attracted in approximately equal numbers to synthetic pheromone lures with and without acetate. The antennae of male moths in all populations tested responded toE10,E12‐16:Ac, a major pheromone component of the congenerH. nuttalli, which is sympatric with someH. eglanterina populations, and in mostH. eglanterina populations tested, the addition ofE10,E12‐16:Ac antagonized responses to otherwise attractive lure blends. Overall, the existence of different pheromone types in the differentH. eglanterina populations may represent a case of reproductive character displacement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3aantennae 3aelectroantennography 3ageographical variation 3ahybrids 3amales 3amoths 3amountains 3apheromone traps 3asheep 3asympatry 3asynthetic pheromones 3aCalifornia 3aNevada1 aMillar, Jocelyn G.0 tEcology.g2001 Dec., v. 82, no. 12 p.3505-3518dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082%5B3505:GVITPS%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01624naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245016700159300002000326520045500346592002800801650001400829650001300843650001600856650002200872700001800894700005900912700005300971700006201024773013601086856007901222852000901301655001201310IND60746856520221122002737.0210806e20210709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074685652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c008992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lei10aAromatic C–H Methylation and Other Functionalizations via the Rh(III)-Catalyzed Migratory Insertion of Bis(phenylsulfonyl)carbene and Subsequent Transformations  ap. 10177-10189.  aThe Rh(III)-catalyzed migratory insertion of bis(phenylsulfonyl)carbene into aromatic C–H bonds has been developed.

HAT rates, site-selectivities for C–H bond oxidation, and DFT computations provide quantitative information and theoretical models to explain the observed patterns. Cyclopentanes functionalize predominantly at C-1, and tertiary C–H bond activation barriers decrease on going from methyl- and tert-butylcyclopentane to phenylcyclopentane, in line with the computed C–H BDEs. With cyclohexanes, the relative importance of HAT from C-1 decreases on going from methyl- and phenylcyclohexane to ethyl-, isopropyl-, and tert-butylcyclohexane. Deactivation is also observed at C-2 with site-selectivity that progressively shifts to C-3 and C-4 with increasing substituent steric bulk. The site-selectivities observed in the corresponding oxidations promoted by ethyl(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane support this mechanistic picture. Comparison of these results with those obtained previously for C–H bond azidation and functionalizations promoted by the PINO radical of phenyl and tert-butylcyclohexane, together with new calculations, provides a mechanistic framework for understanding C–H bond functionalization of cycloalkanes. The nature of the HAT reagent, C–H bond strengths, and torsional effects are important determinants of site-selectivity, with the latter effects that play a major role in the reactions of oxygen-centered HAT reagents with monosubstituted cyclohexanes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acyclohexanes 3aorganic chemistry 3aoxidation1 aGaleotti, Marco1 aSalamone, Michela1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3501-34961 aLiu, Fengjiao1 aYu, Yanmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4219-46111 aDuan, Meng1 aHouk, K.

The as-synthesized Co@CNTs is provided with the nanopores, a large specific surface area, and strong magnetic response. The obtained Co@CNTs was used as magnetic solid-phase extraction adsorbents to extract two profens including flurbiprofen and ketoprofen. The parameters of extraction efficiency, involving extraction time, sample solution volume, ionic strength, pH and the conditions of desorption efficiency, were optimized in detail. After determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet (HPLC-UV), the results evinced that Co@CNTs showed a high extraction efficiency with high enrichment factors of 832 and 672. The good linear range of both flurbiprofen and ketoprofen were all 5.0–1000 ng L−1, with the limit of detection were 0.60 ng L−1 and 0.70 ng L−1, respectively. Furthermore, a valid method for the extraction of flurbiprofen and ketoprofen from human serum was established. The spiking recoveries of two profens were between 86.74% and 97.22%, and the relative standard deviation was less than 6.55%. Co@CNTs can be repeatedly used at least 10 times, indicating its excellent regeneration and reusability. The results demonstrated that the Co@CNTs materials exhibits high enrichment ability and extraction efficiency, playing great promise in MSPE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3ablood serum 3acarbon nanotubes 3acobalt 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3aencapsulation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aionic strength 3aketoprofen 3amagnetism 3ananoparticles 3ananopores 3apH 3apyrolysis 3asolid phase extraction 3astandard deviation 3asurface area 0aMagnetic solid-phase extraction 0aMetal-organic frameworks 0aProfens1 aLin, Feng1 aYang, Xiaohan1 aWang, Bin1 aLu, Xin1 aChen, Qiuxia1 aYe, Fanggui1 aZhao, Shulin0 tTalanta.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 207dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.1202843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010400172300001800276520116200294536011901456592002801575650002401603650002601627650000801653650001101661650002301672650001601695650001501711650001001726650001101736650001601747650002201763653003101785653002101816653002601837653002201863653002701885653002301912700001801935700001701953700001901970700001701989700002702006700001902033700001902052700002002071700002002091773011302111856008602224852000902310655001202319IND60587160320221120050404.0191126e20171003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058716032DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2016.12719842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTham, Thing Chai10aEffect of ambient conditions on drying of herbs in solar greenhouse dryer with integrated heat pump  ap. 1721-1732.  aAn even span solar greenhouse dryer was built and applied to dry Java tea (Orthosiphon aristatus) and Sabah snake grass (Clinacanthus nutans Lindau). Findings showed that the solar greenhouse dryer performs satisfactorily during clear weather except at nighttime and rainy day due to product rehydration which is heavily influenced by high relative humidity from ambient air. Integrating of heat pump into the solar greenhouse dryer has successfully reduced the room relative humidity by 10–15%. Also, heat pump has mitigated the product rehydration issue by maintaining room relative humidity at maximum of 65% throughout the drying period. The drying rate of Java tea was improved three to fourfold, i.e., from 0.004–0.008 to 0.018–0.025 g H₂O/g DM min, whereas 10% of drying time was saved for both Java tea leaf and Sabah snake grass leaf with the assistance of heat pump system. Meanwhile, the supply of dry air from the heat pump system with a magnitude of 0.25–0.50 m/s helps in enhancing the drying rate of the herbs as well as minimizing the nonuniformity of drying temperature and relative humidity inside the solar greenhouse dryer.  aThe authors wish to express their sincere thanks to Ministry of Agriculture, Malaysia for their grant and support.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClinacanthus nutans 3aOrthosiphon aristatus 3aair 3adrying 3adrying temperature 3agreenhouses 3aheat pumps 3aherbs 3aleaves 3arehydration 3arelative humidity 0aClinacanthus nutans Lindau 0aheat pump drying 0aOrthosiphon aristatus 0arelative humidity 0asolar greenhouse dryer 0aweather conditions1 aNg, Mei Xiang1 aGan, Shu Hui1 aChua, Lee Suan1 aAziz, Ramlan1 aChuah, Luqman Abdullah1 aHii, Ching Lik1 aOng, Sze Pheng1 aChin, Nyuk Ling1 aLaw, Chung-Lim,0 tDrying technology.g2017 Oct. 3, v. 35, no. 14 p.1721-1732dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12238x1532-23007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2016.12719843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01934naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010100167300001800268520101600286592002801302650001401330650000901344650002001353650001101373650001101384650001501395700001801410700001901428773008001447856008401527852000901611655001201620IND60095346220221119213228.0141104e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009534622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2011.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Seungro10aPerformances of a heat exchanger and pilot boiler for the development of a condensing gas boiler  ap. 3945-3951.  aIn this research, design factors for a heat exchanger and boiler were investigated using a simplified model of a heat exchanger and pilot condensing boiler, respectively. Specifications of each heat exchanger component (e.g., upper heat exchanger (UHE) and lower heat exchanger (LHE); coil heat exchanger (CHE); baffles) were investigated using a model apparatus, and the comprehensive performance of the pilot gas boiler was examined experimentally. The heating efficiency of the boiler developed was about 90% when using the optimal designed heat exchangers. Compared to a conventional Bunsen-type boiler, the heating efficiency was improved about 10%. Additionally, NOₓ and CO emissions were about 30ppm and 160ppm, respectively, based on a 0% O₂ basis at an equivalence ratio of 0.70, which is an appropriate operating condition. However, the pollutant emission of the boiler developed is satisfactory considering the emission performance of a condensing boiler, even though CO emission must be reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3aheat 3aheat exchangers 3amodels 3aoxygen 3apollutants1 aKum, Sung-Min1 aLee, Chang-Eon0 tEnergy.g2011 July, v. 36, no. 7 p.3945-3951dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2011.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245012700165520171800292592002802010650001802038650001602056650001202072650002602084650001102110650001402121650001102135650001302146650001702159650001702176650001102193650001102204650001302215650001102228650001102239651001002250651001802260653001002278653001402288653002302302700001302325700001502338700001402353700001802367700001902385773010702404856008702511852000902598655001202607IND60654511520221117203742.0190725e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065451152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.1168562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Rong10aStudy on the contribution of transport to PM2.5 in typical regions of China using the regional air quality model RAMS-CMAQ  aRegional transport plays a significant role in the air pollution in China, which is characterized by diverse emission sources and distinct distributions. To improve the understanding of factors determining the PM2.5 level in China, a source apportionment tool coupled with the RAMS-CMAQ model (CMAQ-ISAM) was used to quantify the contribution of transport to PM2.5 and its major components during 2017 in the North China Plain (NCP), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Pearl River Delta (PRD), and Chengyu area. It is found that transport accounts for a predominant fraction of the PM2.5 in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai with relatively low PM2.5 levels. Transport in the NCP is mainly at intraregional scale and comparable to local emissions. In contrast, the contributions of interregional transport from the NCP to the YRD (~10–25%) and from NCP and YRD to PRD and Chengyu (~5–25%) is at similar level to those of intraregional transport and local emissions in winter and fall, but are lower in spring and summer. It is worth noting that particle components have very different transport capabilities. Nitrate exhibits much stronger intraregional transport than other components in the NCP, and much higher concentration than other components during winter. In contrast, the concentration of sulfate is higher than that of nitrate during spring and summer in most provinces. In addition, the transport potential of primary OC, EC, and ammonia are relatively weaker, but these compounds can still have considerable contributions. Our results reveal that the notable contributions of regional transport to PM2.5 should be addressed according to targeted emission sources in order to improve air quality efficiently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aammonia 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aautumn 3aemissions 3amodels 3anitrates 3aparticulates 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3aspring 3asulfates 3asummer 3awinter 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aPM2.5 0aCMAQ-ISAM 0aRegional transport1 aMei, Xin1 aWei, Lifei1 aHan, Xiao1 aZhang, Meigen1 aJing, Yingying0 tAtmospheric environment.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 214 p.116856-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.1168563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245013200175300001600307520137200323592002801695650001701723650001101740650002001751650002801771650002201799650001301821650001201834650001201846651001601858653002201874653002601896653001601922653001701938653001801955653002401973773009501997856008902092852000902181655001202190IND60525716420221121095043.0190401e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052571642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolsink, Maarten10a‘Sustainable City’ requires ‘recognition’—The example of environmental education under pressure from the compact city  ap. 174-180.  aThe compact city is advocated as a key strategy to establish sustainable cities. Compact city policy implies urban densification, sometimes with elimination of green space. Citizen’s valuable arguments in urban densification developments in green space are easily ignored, as is explored in a case study in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Place making decisions are more often legitimized with sustainability claims, and arguments from less convinced residents are denied or remain unexamined. About green space these also concern environmental qualities significant for long term sustainability of cities. This is illustrated by presenting empirical evidence about environmental education, an argument emerging from the explorative study. Environmental education should be seen as an important element in longterm sustainability, but the educational relevance of proximity of green space to schools had remained unknown. Empirical evidence of the negative effect of larger distances to green space on environmental education is presented in a geographical survey. The results suggest that close proximity to urban green space also reinforces fieldwork activities further away. As the validity of this argument was denied in the case study, this illustrates the need to establish frameworks that foster recognition and learning in open processes in urban densification.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3adecision making 3aenvironmental education 3aissues and policy 3alearning 3aschools 3asurveys 3aNetherlands 0aUrban Green space 0aEnvironmental justice 0aRecognition 0aCompact City 0aDensification 0aEducation fieldwork0 tLand use policy.g2016 Mar., v. 52 p.174-180dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245016600176300001500342520154900357592002801906650001401934650002201948650002301970650002101993650002102014650002302035650002102058650004402079650002702123650001902150650002102169700001602190700001602206700002002222773009502242856008502337852000902422655001202431IND60087915120221120190643.0141102e20120317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008791512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.11.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhareeb, Hewa Othman10aMolar mass characterization of cellulose acetates over a wide range of high DS by size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle laser light scattering detection  ap. 96-102.  aA series of cellulose acetate (CA) samples with an average degree of substitution (DS) ranging from DS=1.5 to DS=2.3 was synthesized by partial saponification of a high DS sample (DS=2.6). The comparison of the theoretical DS-values with ones determined by ¹H NMR showed that the deacetylation reaction can be well controlled by the amount of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) added. The average molar masses of the samples and their molar mass distributions were characterized by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) detection in N,N-dimethyl acetamide (DMAc) containing 250mmol/L lithium chloride (LiCl) in order to effectively suppress aggregation of the samples. The dependences of molar mass versus elution volume for samples of different DS can be well described by a common calibration curve. This allows using the same calibration curve for determination of molar masses of unknown samples, irrespective of their DS. A comparison of the absolute molar masses determined by light scattering with the molar masses obtained using a poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) calibration curve revealed that the PMMA equivalent molar masses overestimated the absolute molar masses by a factor of approximately 3. Correction factors were determined making it possible to convert a PMMA calibration curve into a CA calibration curve. This procedure allows determination of correct CA molar masses based on commercially available PMMA-standards without using a LS instrument for samples in the DS range investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3acellulose acetate 3agel chromatography 3alight scattering 3alithium chloride 3amethylmethacrylate 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3asaponification 3asodium hydroxide1 aMalz, Frank1 aKilz, Peter1 aRadke, Wolfgang0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2012 Mar. 17, v. 88, no. 1 p.96-102dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.11.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245013800173300001800311520161000329592002801939650003101967650001701998650001902015650001302034650001302047650001002060650001602070650001702086650001402103650002202117650001102139650001902150650001702169650001802186650001402204650001702218650003802235700001902273700001302292700001702305700001902322700001702341700002002358700001802378700001902396773008802415856009002503852000902593655001202602IND60090338020221116235452.0141102e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009033802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Chia-Che10aRegenerative potentials of platelet-rich plasma enhanced by collagen in retrieving pro-inflammatory cytokine-inhibited chondrogenesis  ap. 5847-5854.  aThis study was undertaken to evaluate the role of collagen matrix to enhance platelet-rich plasma (PRP) effects on pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced arthritic model. We have previously demonstrated the highly regenerative roles of PRP to restore disc degeneration and osteoporosis. In this study, PRP modulated by collagen matrix was used as a regenerative and anti-inflammatory mediator to rescue the chondrocyte degeneration induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β (10 ng/ml)+TNF-α (20 ng/ml). First, the MTT result indicated that 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 in PRP showed an optimal dosage for chondrocytes proliferation. The chondrogenic-specific gene expressions were rescued by PRP from the inhibition of IL-1β+TNF-α, especially under the modulation of collagen matrix. The inflammatory molecules activated by IL-1β+TNF-α were also significantly diminished by PRP with collagen matrix. The membrane receptors integrin α1β1 and CD44 were strongly inhibited by IL-1β+TNF-α, while this inhibition was then recovered by PRP in collagen coating condition. In a 3D model encapsulated with collagen, PRP-induced chondrogenesis were highly enhanced, such as strong restoration of type II collagen and proteoglycan from the inhibition of IL-1β+TNF-α. The result indicated that collagen matrix enhances the effect of PRP on chondrogenesis in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. The combination of PRP and collagen matrix might facilitate a physiological microenvironment beneficial for maintaining chondrocyte homeostasis and represents an advanced osteoarthritis therapy for clinical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3achondrocytes 3achondrogenesis 3acoatings 3acollagen 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3aintegrins 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amodels 3aosteoarthritis 3aosteoporosis 3aproteoglycans 3areceptors 3atherapeutics 3atransforming growth factor beta 11 aChen, Wei-Hong1 aZao, Bin1 aLai, Pei-Lun1 aLin, Tzu-Chieh1 aLo, Hung-Yao1 aShieh, Ying-Hua1 aWu, Zhixiong,1 aDeng, Win-Ping0 tBiomaterials.g2011 Sept., v. 32, no. 25 p.5847-5854dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245010700179300001800286520125800304592002801562650002001590650001801610650002001628650001201648653000801660653002401668653002401692653002001716700002701736773011301763856008601876852000901962655001201971IND60587160520221120050326.0191126e20171003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058716052DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2016.12756722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadiyala, Phani Krishna10aNumerical simulation of transport phenomena due to array of round jets impinging on hot moving surface  ap. 1742-1754.  aAn attempt has been made to numerically evaluate the heat transfer from a moving surface due to impingement of array of round jets. This paper reports the effect of surface velocity on heat transfer. Transition SST model has been used for simulation to predict heat transfer under laminar, transition, and turbulent regimes. This model has been used as it bridges all flow conditions seamlessly. The computational domain considered in this study is a 3D model with symmetric planes on two sides and periodic interface on two sides, so as to represent an array of round jets. The range of Reynolds number adopted here is 100–5,000. Results were first validated with the correlation given by Martin[¹] for array of round nozzles with stationary isothermal surface under turbulent conditions with an average error of 5.88%. It is observed that at higher surface velocities, the heat transfer from the moving surface is more than the case of heat transfer from a stationary surface. The value of surface velocity at which the heat transfers from moving surface is minimum decreases with increase in Reynolds number. An artificial neural network has been trained to accurately predict the Nusselt number for the given Reynolds number and surface velocity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aheat transfer 3aneural networks 3anozzles 0aANN 0aarray of round jets 0aimpingement of jets 0atransition flow1 aChattopadhyay, Himadri0 tDrying technology.g2017 Oct. 3, v. 35, no. 14 p.1742-1754dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12238x1532-23007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2016.12756723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01487naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245006000169500001900229520034400248592002800592650002500620650002500645650002400670650001100694650001600705650001600721653001600737653001600753653001000769700002300779700002500802700002300827700002300850700002000873773011500893856008401008852000901092655001201101IND60707466420221120190931.0201023e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070746642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2020.1060252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeale, Helen C.13aAn improved conjugation method for Pseudomonas syringae  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn order to achieve saturating transposon mutagenesis of the genome of plant pathogenic strains of Pseudomonas syringae we needed to improve plasmid conjugation frequency.

However, in facilities where ovum pick-up (OPU) and ICSI are performed in situ, direct in vitro maturation (IVM) can be performed. In a recent study, holding of oocytes followed by extended IVM (36h) resulted in increased embryo development compared to direct IVM for 26 to 28h. Nevertheless, the effect of holding was not evaluated separately in a clinical ovum pick-up (OPU)-ICSI program. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine whether holding oocytes prior IVM could affect their developmental competence. Data from 253 OPU-ICSI sessions at Ghent University (136 mares and 54 stallions) were analysed retrospectively. Collected oocytes were submitted to direct IVM (DM:1152) (TCM-199 Earl's salts (Gibco) containing 10% (v/v) FBS (Gibco), 9.4 µg/mL follicle-stimulating hormone, and 1.88 µg/mL luteinizing hormone (Stimufol, Reprobiol, Ouffet, Belgium)) or kept in commercial holding medium (HM:1371) (Emcare, Agtech, Zulte, Belgium) at room temperature for 17–24 h in a 5 mL Falcon® Test Tube (Corning Europe, Lasne, Belgium) prior to IVM. After an average of 28.4 h of IVM (DM: 28.2; HM: 28.6), oocytes with a polar body werefertilized by piezo-drill ICSI. The zygotes were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Gibco) with 10% (v/v) FBS under oil (38.2°C, 5% O₂, 5% CO₂, and 90% N₂). Cleavage was evaluated 2 or 3 days after ICSI, and blastocyst development was monitored daily from day six up to day 13. For statistical analysis, generalized linear model were used to test the effect of holding on maturation, cleavage, and blastocyst rate. Always, the oocyte/ zygote was considered as the unit of interest, and results are expressed as least square means ± standard error. No significant differences were observed between treatments for maturation (DM: 64.9±1.4%; HM: 67.0±1.3; p=0.3), cleavage (DM: 62.7±1.9%; HM: 66.8±1.6; p=0.1), and blastocyst rates (DM: 19.0±1.4%; HM: 17.0±1.2; p=0.3). Likewise, comparable kinetics of embryo development were obtained with 9.08 days in average for DM and 9.33 for HM (p = 0.08). In conclusion, oocyte holding prior to IVM did not affect developmental competence when an average IVM duration of 28h was maintained. Therefore, the observed increased embryo development rates in HM vs DM reported previously primarily resulted from an extended maturation time rather than from the inclusion of an oocyte holding step. Other variables, such as the type of sperm, the effect of the mare, the time of the year could be included in further analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3ablastocyst 3acarbon dioxide 3aembryogenesis 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3aintracytoplasmic sperm injection 3alinear models 3aluteinizing hormone 3amares 3aoils 3aoocytes 3aretrospective studies 3aspermatozoa 3astatistical analysis 3aveterinary medicine 3azygote 3aBelgium1 aDe Coster, T1 aHedia, M1 aGerits, I1 aPeere, S1 aPapas, M1 aVan den Branden, E1 aGovaere, J1 aVan Soom, A1 aSmits, K0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2022 June, v. 113 p.103984-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2022.1039843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100009400152245012400246500002200370520121400392592002801606650001301634650000801647650001801655650002601673650002001699650002001719650002501739650001701764650002001781650001901801650001101820650002101831651001401852653002601866653002501892653002301917653002001940700001701960700008901977700001702066700008902083700001302172700001502185773010102200856008702301852000902388655001202397IND60654511720221117203725.0190725e20190721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065451172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.1168582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyakawa, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5529-2627 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5529-262710aCharacterization of carbonaceous aerosols in Asian outflow in the spring of 2015: Importance of non-fossil fuel sources  aPre-press version  aThe sources of elemental (EC) and organic carbon (OC) aerosols in Asian outflow were investigated in the spring of 2015 in terms of radiocarbon (14C) and molecular marker analyses. The contribution of fossil fuel (FF) sources to carbonaceous aerosols (TC) significantly increased in polluted air masses with enhancements in the concentrations of carbon monoxide. For EC, FF sources dominated in the polluted air masses. For OC, the contributions of non-FF sources other than biomass burning (BB) were found to be significant (comparable to or higher than those of FF sources), especially in air masses with higher values of the water-soluble fraction of OC (fWSOC) and 14C concentrations (F14C). Positive correlations between fWSOC and F14C indicate that the origins of TC (mainly OC) have great impacts on the water solubility variability and the subsequent cloud formation processes of OC during transport. We found the importance of natural sources as possible origins of OC in non-polluted (i.e., background) air. This study raises the need to further investigate the source apportionment of OC, especially its natural origins, for more accurately assessing the climatic impacts of EC and OC in East Asia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair pollution 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abiomass burning 3acarbon monoxide 3acarbon radioisotopes 3afossil fuels 3agenetic markers 3aorganic carbon 3aspring 3awater solubility 3aEast Asia 0aCarbonaceous aerosols 0aRadiocarbon analysis 0aSource attribution 0aNatural sources1 aKomazaki, Y.1 aZhu, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0399-7398 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0399-73981 aTaketani, F.1 aPan, X.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4499-9322 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4499-93221 aWang, Z.1 aKanaya, Y.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2019 July 21,  p.116858-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2019.1168583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001400144245013200158300001800290520103300308592002801341650001201369650002101381650001201402650002601414650001701440650002101457650000901478650001001487653002401497653003101521653001301552653004101565700001401606700001901620773012201639856008101761852000901842655001201851IND6020969620221116141723.0181018e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND602096962DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175114101032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhao,10aFuzzy-integrative judgment on the end-use performance of knitted fabrics made with polytrimethylene terephthalate blended yarns  ap. 1739-1747.  aPolytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) fiber is a new kind of synthetic fiber that has outstanding thermal, chemical, and mechanical properties and has widely been used in leisure wear, underwear, sportswear, and other textile products in the recent years. In this study, five different PTT blended yarns were used for the development of weft knitted fabrics for sweaters, which are traditionally produced with wool and acrylic fiber yarns. Three fuzzy-integrative judgment methods, that is, the fuzzy Borda method, osculating value method, and fuzzy clustering analysis, were used to evaluate the end-use performance of these fabrics. The results have shown that the fuzzy-integrative judgment is an effective way for the evaluation of this kind of fabric product and that the fabrics with the best end-use performance among the five fabrics developed are those knitted with PTT/wool/Tencel and PTT/bamboo blended yarns. These results can be used to help knitting companies for the development of new products using PTT material.  aPublisher supplied data 3abamboos 3acluster analysis 3afabrics 3amechanical properties 3anew products 3asynthetic fibers 3awool 3ayarns 0aend-use performance 0afuzzy-integrative judgment 0aknitting 0apolytrimethylene terephthalate fiber1 aHong, Hu,1 aWang, Shao-hui0 tTextile research journal.g2011 Oct., v. 81, no. 17 p.1739-1747dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175114101033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010600166300001200272520174100284592002802025650001102053650001202064650002702076650001402103650001202117650002202129650001402151650002202165650001302187650001402200650001602214650001402230650002802244650001202272650001102284650002902295650001302324700001702337773014602354856008102500852000902581655001202590IND60548302320221120193527.0160903e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054830232DNAL7 a10.1007/s13580-011-0023-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jong Suk,10aPropagation, nutrition managements, and controlled flowering of Correa ‘Mannii’ as a potted plant  ap. 357.  aAustralian natives Correa ‘Mannii’ and C. reflexa (Rutaceae) have been considered suitable as a flowering potted plant. However, comprehensive information on the most effective propagation method, nutrition management, and their impact on propagation and flowering is unavailable. The influence of temperature and photoperiod treatments to control flowering have not been determined. This study was initiated to propagate Correa ‘Mannii’ by the rooting of cuttings and evaluate the effects of rooting hormone treatment, and single node location on the shoot. Treatment methods such as dipping vs. spray application of the rooting hormone were evaluated. The growth and flowering responses of C. ‘Mannii’ and C. reflexa as they may be influenced by fertilizer treatments, the interaction of photoperiod, temperature were also evaluated. The rooting of cuttings in C. ‘Mannii’ was promoted by spraying stock plants with IBA-K and applying 1 g per pot of slow release fertilizer (SRL). Correa does not require high levels of nitrogen (N), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), or several other macro- and micro-elements for normal growth, suggesting that Correa may not require high levels of nutrition during it’s culture or to induce flowering. The total numbers of flowers and shoots with flowers were not affected when plants received 2 g per pot of SRL. Correa ‘Mannii’ flowered freely as compared to C. reflexa which indicates that there is significant genetic variation with respect to environmental and nutritional factors affacting flowering. Our results indicate that C. ‘Mannii’ is a long day plant, requiring only 30 days of 21/18 (day/night temperature) and long day (LD) treatments to accelerate flowering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorrea 3adipping 3afertilizer application 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agenetic variation 3amagnesium 3anight temperature 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3aphotoperiod 3apotassium 3apotted flowering plants 3arooting 3ashoots 3aslow-release fertilizers 3aspraying1 aRoh, Mark S.0 tHorticulture, environment and biotechnology.g2011 Aug., v. 52, no. 4 p.357-357dKorean Society for Horticulture and Sciencex2211-34527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13580-011-0023-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02186naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245009500179300001600274520107600290592002801366650001901394650001401413650002801427650002101455650001201476651001201488700002701500700002801527700002701555700002801582700003301610773009501643856008901738852000901827655001201836IND60525716720221121054219.0190401e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052571672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.12.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyes-Bueno, Fabián10aFactors influencing land fractioning in the context of land market deregulation in Ecuador  ap. 144-150.  aLand fractioning is a continuous process that could lead to land abandonment. In this work, the relationship between the speed of land market dynamics and land fractioning were studied and compared in two rural parishes of Ecuador. For this study, a database with relevant information extracted from land property deeds was generated for both study areas. Additionally, 193 land buyers and sellers were surveyed to determine the factors influencing/motivating land transactions. We observed a gradual increment of land fractioning with the mean ‘fractionated parcel surface’ independent of the speed of land market dynamics. Instead, the purpose assigned to the land by the actors involved in the land market seems to be the factor influencing the mean fractionated parcel surface and average parcel surface the most. The similarities of the studied areas with others inside and outside Ecuador makes the study relevant in a wider context. Our results could aid local governments in improving their land administration strategies in a deregulated land market context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabandoned land 3adatabases 3agovernment deregulation 3alocal government 3amarkets 3aEcuador1 aTubío Sánchez, José1 aGracía Samaniego, Juan1 aMiranda Barrós, David1 aCrecente Maseda, Rafael1 aSánchez-Rodríguez, Aminael0 tLand use policy.g2016 Mar., v. 52 p.144-150dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03615naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100002200151245016200173300001600335520231900351592002802670650001502698650000902713650002002722650002102742650001802763650001502781650001902796650002202815650001502837650002502852650001902877650001002896651001002906700001902916700002302935700002102958700002102979773009703000856008703097852000903184655001203193IND4475757620221120123520.0150808e20110224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447575762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2010.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Traglia, Mario10aIs cellular automata algorithm able to predict the future dynamical shifts of tree species in Italy under climate change scenarios? A methodological approach  ap. 925-934.  aIn this paper is presented a methodological approach which integrates statistic modelling and 2-D cellular automata (CA) in order to describe tree species shifts responding to the climate changes foreseen for Italy in the 21st century. Five Italian tree species populations of Abies alba, Pinus sylvestris, Fagus sylvatica, Acer campestris and Quercus suber and their actual potential distributions (PDs) – represented by Importance Value (IV), have been considered. Environmental and climatic relationships have been modelled through application of a new statistical methodology called extreme discretization, where the PD of a species was considered as a random field. The IV-based PD has been spatialized through a probability function π(A,S), which represented the spatio-temporal relationships between IV values and climatic (A) and geo-morphological (S) variables. For each tree species π=(A,S) has been estimated and inserted as rule in the 2-D cellular automata. The latter, acting by a Moore neighbouring, took in consideration also the suitability map for tree species, which has been obtained by land cover map. Two time frames (2050 and 2080) and two climatic scenarios (A2 and B1) have been considered. Results described a general reduction of the IV values and their distribution for A. alba, P. sylvestris and F. sylvatica, in both climatic scenarios, whereas an increase of IVs and distribution for Q. suber and only a slight increment of distribution for A. campestris was mainly observed under the B1 scenario, but not for the more limiting A2 scenario. Convergent results have been obtained with respect to other simulation systems concerning the shift of tree species responding to different climatic change scenarios but lacking of the description of dynamical paths. Our approach seems natural and practical to describe such phenomena. The transition rules for the CA and the parameters taken into account for the construction of the probabilistic models can be surely improved to obtain a more realistic pattern of tree species shifts. Future efforts should be made to take in account the inter-specific relationships inside the Italian forest ecosystems, in order to also consider the competiveness for resources that exert some effects on the plant distribution both in time and space.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies alba 3aAcer 3aFagus sylvatica 3aPinus sylvestris 3aQuercus suber 3aalgorithms 3aclimate change 3aforest ecosystems 3aland cover 3aprobabilistic models 3aspace and time 3atrees 3aItaly1 aAttorre, Fabio1 aFrancesconi, Fabio1 aValenti, Roberto1 aVitale, Marcello0 tEcological modelling.g2011 Feb. 24, v. 222, no. 4 p.925-934dElsevier B.V.x0304-38007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2010.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01945naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245011800179300001400297520072800311592002801039650002601067650001301093650001401106650002501120650001201145650001601157650001401173650001401187650001801201650002001219651001101239700003101250700003101281700003201312773012301344856008301467852000901550655001201559IND60113481020221119143047.0190405e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011348102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2013.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHúngaro, Humberto Moreira10aHearts of palms preserves and botulism in Brazil: An overview of outbreaks, causes and risk management strategies  ap. 80-95.  aBotulism is a serious disease that causes paralysis or weakness of the muscles, including those needed for breathing.

The specific conductivity values of SDBS in the presence of PQ-10 were higher than that of pure SDBS over the whole concentration range under current experimental conditions. The aggregation number of SDBS kept constant in the flat region of the micropolarity curve (0.86mM–1.43mM). The structural transformation of the mixtures was monitored visually by TEM.

Clothianidin is a novel neonicotinoid insecticide with a thiazolyl ring that exhibits excellent biological efficacy against a variety of pests. In the present study, the oxidative stress and genotoxicity of clothianidin on earthworms were evaluated. Moreover, the effective concentrations of clothianidin in artificial soil were monitored during the whole exposure period. The results showed that clothianidin was stable in artificial soil and that the residue concentrations were 0.094, 0.476, and 0.941mg/kg after 28 d of exposure, which represented changes no more than 10% compared to the concentrations on the 0th day. Additionally, both the concentration of and exposure time to clothianidin had a substantial influence on biomarkers in earthworms. At 0.5mg/kg and 1.0mg/kg, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were greatly enhanced, causing changes in antioxidant enzyme activities, damage to biological macromolecules and abnormal expression of functional genes. Additionally, the present results showed that superoxide dismutase (SOD), DNA damage and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) may be good indicators for environmental risk assessment of clothianidin to earthworms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3agenotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3aEisenia fetida 3abiomarkers 3aexposure duration 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asoil 3arisk assessment 3agene expression 3agenes 3apests 3aearthworms 3aclothianidin 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenzyme activity 3aheat-shock protein 70 0aTCTP 0aPCO 0aHSP70 0aROS 0aANN 0aantioxidants 0aHPLC-MS/MS1 aWang, Xiuguo1 aYou, Xiangwei1 aChen, Dan1 aLi, Yiqiang1 aWang, Fenglong0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2017 Aug., v. 142 p.489-496dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008900172300001200261520125300273592002801526650001501554650001901569650001601588650001501604650001701619650001301636650001001649650001401659650001201673700001701685700001901702700002301721773010301744856008601847990002301933852000901956655001201965IND60113251820221120165040.0141111e20130515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011325182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2013.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAoki, Koichi J.10aVoltammetry in low concentration of electrolyte supported by ionic latex suspensions  ap. 5-9.  aSince ionic conductivity has a linear relation with the square of the number of charge, ionic latex particles with a huge number of the charge could provide high conductance. It is expected that addition of only a small amount of latex particles into voltammetric solution enhances the conductance so much that voltammograms can be measured, overcoming ohmic drop. Conductivity of latex suspensions of polystyrene–polystyrenesulfonic acid with volume fractions less than 0.02, which were well deionized by centrifugation, was determined by ac-impedance at two parallel wire electrodes. Since the resistance was determined by the dependence of the in-phase component on the electrode distance, it did not include participation of electric double layers or adsorption of latex. The relationship between conductivity and a diffusion coefficient stated that the conductivity of the suspension was provided mainly by diffusion of latex particles with multiple charges rather than that of the counterion. The suspension with [H⁺]=10⁻⁵M, corresponding to 8.9×10⁵ number mm⁻³, including hydrogen gas showed a voltammetric oxidation peak of hydrogen, whereas hydrochloric acid with [HCl]=10⁻⁵M showed a resistive current–potential curve.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acentrifugation 3adiffusivity 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3ahydrogen 3alatex 3aoxidation 3aprotons1 aZhao, Xiaoyu1 aChen, Jingyuan1 aNishiumi, Toyohiko0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2013 May 15, v. 697 p.5-9dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2013.03.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01750naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245008900172300001500261500001500276520068700291592002800978650002401006650001301030650000901043650001901052650001701071650001901088650002601107650001001133653002501143700001601168773012401184856008301308852000901391655001201400IND60113481120221119142848.0190405e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011348112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2013.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayasena, Dinesh D.10aEssential oils as potential antimicrobial agents in meat and meat products: A review  ap. 96-108.  a2019-12-04  aProduction of safe and high quality meat and meat products along with recent consumer's demand for all-natural and clean-label is challenging. Plant-derived essential oils (EOs) have shown remarkable antimicrobial potency against spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in meat and meat products. In this review, basics of microbial deterioration of meat and meat products and traditional preservation methods used are first discussed followed by mode of action and scope of application of EOs for these products. Application of EOs is partially limited due to their intense aroma but advanced technologies can be combined to improve both the microbial stability and sensory quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3amechanism of action 3aspoilage 3ameat 3aessential oils 3ameat quality 3amicroorganisms 3aanti-infective agents 3aodors 0aantimicrobial agents1 aJo, Cheorun0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2013 Dec., v. 34, no. 2 p.96-108dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2013.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008900157300001800246520161500264592002801879650001701907650001301924650001401937650002601951650000901977650001601986650001802002650002602020700001902046700001902065700002202084700002002106700001902126773009802145856007502243852000902318655001202327IND60577036820221118224038.0170806e20140520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057703682DNAL7 a10.1021/la50076922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Ju Hyeon10aOrdered Packing of Emulsion Droplets toward the Preparation of Adjustable Photomasks  ap. 5404-5411.  aMonodisperse emulsion droplets with a high volume fraction form crystalline phases that can potentially serve as adjustable photomasks in photolithography. Such photomasks were prepared using a microfluidic device in which a flow-focusing junction, side channels, and a reservoir were connected in series. Transparent oil droplets were generated in a dye-containing continuous water phase at the flow-focusing junction. The droplets were then concentrated through the selective removal of the continuous phase using the side channels. This process led to the formation of a regular array of droplets in the reservoir with a configuration that depended on the relative height of the reservoir to the droplet diameter. The configurations could be selected among a single-layered hexagonal array, a bilayered square array, and a bilayered hexagonal array. The droplet arrays were used as a photomask to create hexagonal or square arrays of microdots. The transmittance profile of the ultraviolet (UV) light from each droplet was parabolic, which enabled the dot size to be tuned by controlling the UV irradiation time. This mask effect is otherwise difficult to achieve using conventional photomasks. The dot size and array periodicity could be adjusted by the in-situ control of the droplet size at the flow-focusing droplet maker. The combination of droplet size adjustments and the UV irradiation time provided independent control over the dot size and array periodicity to enable the preparation of a series of hexagonal microarrays with a wide spectrum of array parameters using a single microfluidic device.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3amicroarray technology 3aoils 3aperiodicity 3atransmittance 3aultraviolet radiation1 aChoi, Jae-Hoon1 aSim, Jae Young1 aJeong, Woong

The present study aimed to determine if vitrified-warmed ICSI blastocysts could be loaded in 0,25 ml straws in a buffered, commercial media (GMOPS Plus, Vitrolife, Sweden) and transported in a versatile shipping incubator (26237, WTA), at 38°C for up to 5 hours driving by car without affecting the pregnancy rate. Blastocysts were produced by conventional ICSI with oocytes recovered from immature follicles by transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte pick up in a clinical commercial program in Denmark. This study was performed in the transfer season 2021 (March to August) and included 90 embryos from different breeds, mainly Warmblood mares. The blastocysts were vitrified on days 7-10 after ICSI using commercial vitrification media (VitriFreeze, FertiPro, Belgium), and an open vitrification device (VitriFit, CooperSurgical, Denmark). On the day before the transfer, blastocysts were warmed in commercial warming media (VitriThaw, FertiPro) and incubated overnight in EQ-IVC2 (IVF Bioscience, UK), 6% CO₂, 38.2°C. On the day of transfer, embryos going to be transferred at the client's place were loaded in 0,25 ml straws with warm GMOPS Plus and placed in the WTA shipping incubator at 38°C. All embryos were transferred by manual and transcervical method to recipient mares being 4 to 5days after ovulation. In total 90 embryos were transferred; 39 embryos were transported in straws and 51 embryos were transferred directly at the clinic, and no significant difference in the pregnancy rate was observed between transported embryos (26/39, 67%) and directly transferred embryos (33/51, 65%) 7-10 days after transfer. When checking for the heartbeat (∼day 30 after ovulation), also no significant difference in the heartbeat pregnancy rate was observed between the transported embryos (24/39, 62%) and directly transferred embryos (29/51, 57%). In conclusion, these data show that equine ICSI blastocysts can be transported in straws at 38°C for up to 5 hours by car in a commercial medium, without affecting the heartbeat pregnancy rate. For future studies, it would be interesting to investigate if vitrified-warmed ICSI blastocysts can be transported in straws for more than 5 hours without affecting the pregnancy rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablastocyst 3acarbon dioxide 3aheart rate 3amares 3aoocytes 3aovulation 3apregnancy rate 3aultrasonography 3aveterinary medicine 3avitrification 3aBelgium 3aDenmark 3aSweden1 aPedersen, J1 aLorenzen, E0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2022 June, v. 113 p.103986-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2022.1039863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03706naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008400170300001600254520191700270592002802187650002402215650002502239650003202264650002402296650002402320650003102344650001302375650002502388650002002413650001802433650003502451650002202486650002302508650002202531650002202553650002202575650002502597650002402622650001802646650001402664650001702678650001902695650002102714650001002735650001302745650002302758650002502781650001102806650002002817650001002837650002602847650001202873650001502885773010202900856008103002852000903083655001203092IND60439905320221121013051.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043990532DNAL7 a10.1007/s11101-015-9394-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMroczek, Agnieszka10aPhytochemistry and bioactivity of triterpene saponins from Amaranthaceae family  ap. 577-605.  aThe family Amaranthaceae comprises more than 175 genera and 2,000 species of herbs, shrubs, subshrubs and small trees. It is a widespread and cosmopolitan family that can be found from the tropics to cool temperate regions. Some of the Amaranthaceae plants have economic importance and are used as herbal medicines or vegetables in various parts of the globe. The phytochemical profile of Amaranthaceae plants comprises essential oils, betalains, phenolic compounds and terpenoids. This review focuses on distribution, structure and pharmacological properties of triterpene saponins present in Amaranthaceae plants. These include oleanane-, ursane- and lupane-type of compounds possessing a very broad array of structures. Different pattern of triterpene saponin occurrence was characterised in almost 30 species belonging to Amaranthaceae family, i.e. Achyranthes bidendata Blume, Achyranthes faureri Léveille. & Vahiot., Amaranthus caudatus L., Amaranthus cruentus L., Amaranthus hypochondriacus L., Alternanthera philoxeroides Griseb., Alternanthera repens L., Anabasis articulata Moq, Anabasis setifera Moq, Atriplex glauca L., Atriplex semibaccata R.

For this purpose, two lab-scale single spray dryers in milk drying with different evaporative capacities have been used as example. The values of the absolute humidity, mass and energy losses, energetic specific consumption (ESC), and the efficiency of the process were obtained by calculations developed in this work. The mathematical model was valid for the evaluation of mass and energy losses, and it allowed us to compare the efficiencies of spray dryers with different designs.

A primary prediction of this hypothesis is that the strength of competition for pollination, mediated by variation in plant abundance, should directly influence the strength of selection on floral traits. To test this prediction, I examined the relationships between multiple components of plant abundance and pollination, reproductive success, and phenotypic selection via female fitness on four floral traits in artificial and natural populations of the hummingbird‐pollinated Ipomopsis aggregata. In the artificial arrays, I manipulated the absolute density and interspersion of neighboring I. aggregata and a competitor for pollination (Castilleja linariaefolia). I also measured natural variation in the absolute and relative density of these two species within a 2.5‐m radius of focal I. aggregata plants in three natural populations. The strength of competition for pollination in the I. aggregata–C. linariaefolia system was only weakly influenced by local plant abundance. Both the absolute density and interspersion of plants in the arrays significantly influenced at least one component of I. aggregata's pollination and reproductive success, but the effects were not consistent across these components. For example, the treatment groups that received more conspecific pollen were not the same ones that set more seeds/fruit. Within the natural populations, variation in relative and absolute plant density influenced two components of I. aggregata's pollination and reproductive success, but only in one to two populations per component. As would be expected from these inconsistent effects of plant abundance on pollination and reproduction, the strength of selection on floral traits of I. aggregata in both the arrays and natural populations was also only weakly dependent on abundance. Previous studies have indicated (1) that self‐incompatible species such as I. aggregata should experience strong, abundance‐dependent effects on pollination, and (2) that variation in plant abundance at a local scale should have a stronger effect on pollination than variation at a larger spatial scale.

Polysaccharides that are precisely activated by the physiological environment of the colon hold great promise, as they provide improved site specificity and meet the desired therapeutic needs. The colon specific delivery systems based on a single polysaccharide do not efficiently permit targeted release. The pH and transit time can vary depending on the individual and the particular disease state. The conventional approaches give rise to premature drug release. The combination/chemically modified forms of polysaccharides eliminated the drawbacks associated with the use of single polysaccharide. This review focus on approaches to emerging discipline, revisits the existing technologies and future development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrohn disease 3aamebiasis 3acoatings 3acolitis 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3apH 3apolymers 3apolysaccharides1 aTiwari, Akanksha0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2012 Apr. 2, v. 88, no. 2 p.399-416dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011200169300001600281520108000297592002801377650002501405650002301430650001101453650001901464650002101483650002001504650002001524650002201544650001301566650001701579700001301596700001401609700001601623700001501639700001501654773009501669856008501764852000901849655001201858IND60087915720221120195911.0141102e20120402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008791572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wenjian10aPurification, characterization and anti-proliferation activity of polysaccharides from Flammulina velutipes  ap. 474-480.  aA polysaccharide was isolated from Flammulina velutipes (FVP) using ultrasonic-assisted extraction, and then further purified by DEAE cellulose-52 chromatography and Sephadex G-100 size-exclusion chromatography to afford FVP-1 and FVP-2. Structural characteristics of FVP-1 and FVP-2 (including molecular weight, monosaccharides composition, sulfate and uronic acid contents, triple helical structures, ultraviolet spectrum, and infrared spectrum) were investigated, and their anti-proliferation activities against human gastric cancer BGC-823 cells and lung cancer A549 cells were researched in vitro. Results suggested that both FVP-1 and FVP-2 could significantly suppress the proliferation of BGC-823 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The highest inhibitory rates were 78% for FVP-1 and 95% for FVP-2 at the concentration of 200μg/ml, respectively. This high anti-proliferation activity was inferred to be owing to the structural characterizations of polysaccharide, and the recognition of biological system for the triple helical structures of polysaccharides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFlammulina velutipes 3agel chromatography 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3amolecular weight 3amonosaccharides 3apolysaccharides 3astomach neoplasms 3asulfates 3auronic acids1 aPei, Fei1 aShi, Ying1 aZhao, Liyan1 aFang, Yong1 aHu, Qiuhui0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2012 Apr. 2, v. 88, no. 2 p.474-480dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245016200178300001400340520122500354592002801579650001101607650002101618650001701639650001101656650001801667650001101685650001501696650002001711650002201731700002501753700001901778700002701797773010501824856008601929990002302015852000902038655001202047IND60113252120221120164914.0141111e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011325212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2013.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDorneanu, Sorin-Aurel10aElectrochemical and spectroelectrochemical behavior of N-methyl-phenothiazinyl meso-substituted porphyrins and their complexes with Ni(II), Cu(II) and Pd(II)  ap. 17-24.  aThe electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical properties of 11 new N-methyl phenothiazinyl meso-substituted porphyrins, H₂PtzₓPh₄₋ ₓPorph (where Ptz stands for N-methyl phenothiazinyl, Ph for phenyl and Porph for porphyrin; x=0, 1, 2 or 4), and their complexes with Ni(II), Cu(II) and Pd(II) were investigated. The half wave potentials of the redox processes yielding the anion, dianion or π-cation and dication radicals were estimated from square-wave voltammetry measurements, performed in CH₂Cl₂ containing 0.1M TBAPF₆ as supporting electrolyte. Two opposite effects decide the electrochemical behavior of the metal complexes corresponding to the Ptz-substituted porphyrins: (i) the electron attracting ability of the Ptz substituent and (ii) the decrease of the electronic affinity of the porphyrin macrocycle induced by the presence of the metallic ion, i.e. Ni(II), Cu(II) or Pd(II). The electrochemical data were rationalized by using the Hammett’s linear free energy relationship. The spectral data, obtained from in situ spectroelectrochemical measurements, confirmed the characteristic behavior of the porphyrin derivatives and were found in good agreement with the electrochemical results.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3afree radicals 3anickel 3aporphyrins 3aredox potential 3aspectral analysis1 aMuresan, Liana Maria1 aHorovitz, Ossi1 aPopescu, Ionel Catalin0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2013 June 1, v. 698 p.17-24dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2013.03.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02049naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012200170300001800292520071000310592002801020650001401048650001301062650001101075650001101086650001301097650002201110650001901132650001801151650001301169650001901182650001301201653001301214653001301227653002401240653001901264653002401283700002801307700002101335700002101356700002101377773009901398856008501497852000901582655001201591IND60587161120221120050453.0171215e20171118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058716112DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2016.12765842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaiser, Stefan10aImpact of drying conditions and wet film properties on adhesion and film solidification of lithium-ion battery anodes  ap. 1807-1817.  aElectrodes constitute a vital component of lithium-ion battery cells.

I used environmental data covering the whole of mainland Africa and a database of 34 063 published locality records for African ticks to assess the importance of different environmental variables as limiting factors for tick species ranges. The abilities of categorical and continuous variables (including rainfall, temperature, vegetation type, a 6 × 6 degree grid, political regions, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI]) to predict tick distributions were established using a new set of methods where logistic regression equations based on different variables for each of 50 tick species are compared. The results show that, on average, climatic variables are better predictors of tick distributions than vegetation‐related variables. Given also that most tick distributions are not limited by those of their host species, it can be inferred that the primary factor preventing the expansion of tick species ranges is the direct effect of climate. Minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and rainfall are of similar predictive ability; when considered together, their predictive ability increases substantially. I conclude that the key to describing tick distributions is the covariance of temperature and rainfall. Attempts at tick eradication are unlikely to be successful unless suitably broad areas are targeted, but the close relationship between tick distributions and climate should make the prediction of tick‐borne disease outbreaks relatively easy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic factors 3acovariance 3adatabases 3adisease outbreaks 3aequations 3ahosts 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apolitics 3aprediction 3arain 3aregression analysis 3atemperature 3aticks 3avegetation types 3aAfrica0 tEcology.g2002 Jan., v. 83, no. 1 p.255-268dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083%5B0255:CCAVAL%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02651naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245010500166520123200271592002801503650003001531650001501561650003401576650001801610650001901628650001601647650001401663650001201677650001001689650001001699650002701709650001801736653003001754653003401784653003001818653002501848653004801873700001301921700001501934700001701949700001801966773011601984856008402100852000902184655001202193IND60707467120221120202006.0210624e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070746712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2020.1060322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xin-ai13aAn efficient genetic transformation system for Chinese medicine fungus Tolypocladium ophioglossoides  aTolypocladium ophioglossoides is a rare and valuable fungus extensively used in Chinese medicine for relieving postmenopausal syndrome in women yet its bioactive molecules are unknown. To explore its molecular mechanisms, we have developed a reliable Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system using the selective marker: the chlorimuron ethyl-resistance gene sur. For this purpose, we firstly constructed a T-DNA binary vector system and then improved the transformation efficiency by optimizing conditional parameters including the Agrobacterium tumefaciens concentration, the conidia number of T. ophioglossoides, the co-culture time and the concentration of acetosyringone. Furthermore, we have knocked-out the ku70 gene，which is a key gene in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway，and the effect of the length of the homologous arms (HA) on the genetic transformation efficacy was also examined, which increased by 60% when HA was about 3 kb in length. Our results suggest that the genetic transformation system is efficient and feasible for the truffle-parasite fungus T. ophioglossoides, which can further be used in large-scale experiments for characterization of genes of interest in future work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aDNA repair 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aTolypocladium 3aacetosyringone 3achlorimuron 3acoculture 3aconidia 3afungi 3agenes 3agenetic transformation 3apostmenopause 0aTraditional Chinese fungi 0aTolypocladium ophioglossoides 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0aGenetic manipulation 0aAgrobacterium-mediated T-DNA transformation1 aHe, Xian1 aZhang, Min1 aMao, Xu-ming1 aLi, Yong-quan0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2020 Sept., v. 176 p.106032-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2020.1060323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014100170300001600311520146700327592002801794650001101822650002101833650002501854650002001879650001701899650001701916650001801933650002001951650003101971650002702002650001502029650001302044650002202057650001902079650002202098650001802120650001702138650002102155650001402176650004302190650001402233650002402247650002502271650003202296653001902328653001802347653001602365700001602381700001802397700001402415700006002429773010002489856008602589852000902675655001202684IND60654512320221117203707.0190830e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065451232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2019.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsai, Yuh-Feng10aEffect of hesperidin on anti-inflammation and cellular antioxidant capacity in hydrogen peroxide-stimulated human articular chondrocytes  ap. 175-184.  aExcessive levels of oxidative stress can induce a senescence-associated secretory phenotype in chondrocytes which is characterized by the secretions of inflammatory mediators. Citrus flavonoid hesperidin (Hsd) is known to have anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidant capacities. Accordingly, we demonstrated the antioxidant property of Hsd against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress damages to chondrocytes in this study. Primary human chondrocytes were cultured in media supplemented with Hsd (5, 10, 50 and 100 μM) to evaluate the dose-dependent cytotoxicity. Subsequently, cells were stimulated by H2O2 and supplied with Hsd to study chondroprotective effects. Results showed that high-dose of Hsd (50 and 100 μM) has a deleterious effect on normal cells, whilst low Hsd (5 and 10 μM) supplements improved mitochondrial activity, cytotoxicity, proliferation kinetic, survival and cell senescence in H2O2-stimulated chondrocytes. Real-time PCR revealed that Hsd downregulated the mRNA levels of COX-2, IL-1β, TNF-α, MMP-3, MMP-9, and upregulated IL-10, TIMP-1, SOX9. Western blotting further revealed that Hsd modulates Foxo1, Foxo3 and Nrf2 signaling pathways. Furthermore, Hsd improved total antioxidant capacity, and restored superoxide dismutases and glutathione peroxidase activities in H2O2-stimulated chondrocytes. In conclusion, our findings suggest that Hsd has the potential to improve antioxidant capacity in human chondrocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aWestern blotting 3aantioxidant activity 3acell senescence 3achondrocytes 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression regulation 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahesperidin 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amessenger RNA 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3aphenotype 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asecretion 3asignal transduction 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aOsteoarthritis 0aInﬂammation 0aAntioxidant1 aChen, Yi-Ru1 aChen, Jo-Ping1 aTang, Yun1 aYang, Kai-Chiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0979-44630 tProcess biochemistry.g2019 Oct., v. 85 p.175-184dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2019.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245008500176300001800261520114500279592002801424650001501452650001101467650002001478650001501498650001301513650001901526650001601545650001801561700001701579700003001596700002401626773008001650856008401730852000901814655001201823IND60095347320221119212953.0141104e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009534732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2011.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasurto-Pensado, M.A.10aAnalysis and characterization of an optical fiber for Carrol–Water liquid pair  ap. 3952-3958.  aA system of energy recovery depends on the process operation conditions from which it receives the energy when a Carrol–Water pair is used. To improve the performance of the energy recovery system, the variables of temperature, pressure and concentration must be in balance. External sensors for temperature and pressure may be installed for all components. However, concentration is not determined online, and therefore an indirect method must be considered, such as optical transmittance correlation. Humidity contamination accounts for the hygroscopicity of Carrol water samples. The analysis of Carrol–Water optical characteristics is presented at multiple concentrations and temperatures, in which a transfer function involving absorbance and temperature is determined in order to define liquid pair concentration, as a function of actual temperature and signal intensity. This calculation provided the guideline to generate a control system that helps regulate thermal regimens. The characterization of this pair was made from temperature values ranging from 25 °C to 80 °C and mass concentration ranging from 51.79% to 66.2%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3aguidelines 3ahumidity 3ahygroscopicity 3atemperature 3atransmittance1 aRomero, R.J.1 aSánchez-Mondragón, J.J.1 aDorantes-Romero, D.0 tEnergy.g2011 July, v. 36, no. 7 p.3952-3958dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2011.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012800157300001800285520134000303592002801643650001401671650002201685650002101707650001801728650002101746650003201767700001401799700001601813700001901829700001801848700001801866773009801884856007501982852000902057655001202066IND60577037120171220000000.0170806e20140520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057703712DNAL7 a10.1021/la500948h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchonbeck, N.10aSurfactant-Triggered Disassembly of Electrostatic Complexes Probed at Optical and Quartz Crystal Microbalance Length Scales  ap. 5620-5627.  aA critical advantage of electrostatic assemblies over covalent and crystalline bound materials is that associated structures can be disassembled into their original constituents. Nanoscale devices designed for the controlled release of functional molecules already exploit this property. To bring some insight into the mechanisms of disassembly and release, we study the disruption of molecular electrostatics-based interactions via competitive binding with ionic surfactants. To this aim, free-standing micrometer-size wires were synthesized using oppositely charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and poly(acrylic acid) coated iron oxide nanoparticles. The disassembly is induced by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfates that complex preferentially the positive polymers. The process is investigated at two different length scales: the length scale of the particles (10 nm) through the quartz crystal microbalance technique and that of the wires (>1 μm) via optical microscopy. Upon surfactant addition, the disassembly is initiated at the surface of the wires by the release of nanoparticles and by the swelling of the structure. In a second step, erosion involving larger pieces takes over and culminates in the complete dissolution of the wires, confirming the hypothesis of a surface-type swelling and erosion process.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3aionic surfactants 3alight microscopy 3ananoparticles 3apolyacrylic acid 3aquartz crystal microbalance1 aKvale, K.1 aDemarcy, T.1 aGiermanska, J.1 aChapel, J.-P.1 aBerret, J.-F.0 tLangmuir.g2014 May 20, v. 30, no. 19 p.5620-5627dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla500948h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04360naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012800164520315600292592002803448650001503476650002303491650001003514650002003524650001703544650001103561650001703572650001603589650001403605650001903619650001903638650002003657650002403677700001403701700001903715700001503734773012103749856008303870852000903953655001203962IND60778565320221123023329.0220531e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077856532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2022.1039912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, O10aPentoxifylline reduces post-breeding uterine fluid accumulation in older embryo donor mares and may enhance embryo recovery  aMost donor mares in embryo transfer programs have impaired uterine clearance due to uterine and cervical problems. In addition, repeated breeding cycles, gynecological procedures, and embryo flushing make mares prone to endometritis. Anecdotally, pentoxifylline, an anti-inflammatory, has been used in mares to enhance blood flow in the reproductive tract and reduce uterine inflammation. However, this has not been critically studied. This study aimed to assess the post-breeding inflammatory response and embryo recovery of subfertile donor mares treated with pentoxifylline. This study hypothesized that pentoxifylline supplementation mitigates the post-breeding inflammatory response in embryo donor mares. Forty-two estrous cycles of seven embryo donor mares (16±3.7years old; 13±3years donating embryos) were completed in the study. In the first two cycles, mares received pentoxifylline (17mg/kg/day) given in 50mL of Broodmare-Plus® (Botupharma), the two subsequent cycles served as control, and in the last two cycles, mares received 50mL of Broodmare®. Mares were monitored daily, and then once a preovulatory follicle was detected, ovulation was induced with deslorelin (1mg, i.m.). Immediately before (0h), 24, 48, and 72h post-breeding mares had transrectal ultrasonography performed to determine ovulation, quantify uterine edema and intrauterine fluid accumulation (IUF). At similar timepoints, uterine cytology was collected, stained with Diff-Quik®, and polymorphous nuclear cells were counted in ten hpf. Embryo collections were performed eight days after ovulation, and mares receivedan injection of 5mg of dinoprost (i.m., Lutalyse, Zoetis, USA) to return to estrus. Statistical analyses were performed with Graph Prisma (San Diego, CA). Neutrophil counts were analyzed with ANOVA repeated measures and Tukey's as post-hoc. Edema scores and intrauterine fluid accumulation were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's post-hoc. Embryo recovery rates were evaluated with Fisher's test. There was an effect of time for neutrophil counts in the washout cycle (P=0.032) but not in the other two groups (P>0.05). Neutrophil counts didn't differ across groups (P>0.05). Edema scores had effects of time (P=0.046) but no effects of group (P>0.05). Similarly, there was an effect of time (P=0.038) for IUF, and mares receiving pentoxifylline had reduced post-breeding IUF in comparison with washout cycles (P=0.034) but not different than the group receiving just Broodmare® (P>0.05). Embryo recovery was not different across groups (P>0.05) but remarkably different as follows: washout cycle was 29% (4/14); Broodmare® was 36% (5/14), and pentoxifylline (Broodmare-Plus®) was 57% (8/14). Mares in the study were subfertile older mares used as embryo donors for multiple years, thus, justifying the low embryo recovery for the cycles with no pentoxifylline. In conclusion, supplementation with pentoxifylline may be an alternative to improve the post-breeding uterine clearance. It may enhance embryo recovery in mares serving as donors for multiple years; however, this remains to be confirmed with a larger group number of mares.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood flow 3adeslorelin acetate 3aedema 3aembryo transfer 3aendometritis 3aestrus 3ainflammation 3aneutrophils 3aovulation 3apentoxifylline 3aprostaglandins 3aultrasonography 3aveterinary medicine1 aAmorim, G1 aSegabinazzi, L1 aCanisso, I0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2022 June, v. 113 p.103991-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2022.1039913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01873naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245005400177300001600231520070700247592002800954650001000982650001700992650002201009650001401031650001001045650001201055650001501067650002401082650001201106650001901118650001101137650001501148650001301163700004601176700001901222700003001241773010201271856008101373852000901454655001201463IND60439905720221121013156.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043990572DNAL7 a10.1007/s11101-014-9374-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Eliane de Oliveira10aNon-terpenoid biotransformations by Mucor species  ap. 745-764.  aBiotransformation is an important tool for the structural modification of organic compounds, especially natural products with complex structures, which are difficult to achieve using ordinary methods.

The effects of various parameters, including sorbent dose, solution pH, ionic strength, temperature, and competitive adsorption, were determined. The sorption capacity of peat notably increased to a level even higher than that of activated carbon after modification with a quaternary ammonium surfactant. The sorption process fitted the pseudo-second-order model well. The sorption of BPA onto modified peat is preferred in the presence of phenol as a competitor. Hydrophobic interactions play an important role during the sorption process. These observations indicate that the BPA sorption capacity of natural peat can be significantly promoted via surfactant modification and is of great potential for environmental application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abagasse 3abiosorbents 3abisphenol A 3ahydrophobic bonding 3aionic strength 3amodels 3apH 3apeat 3aphenol 3arice hulls 3asawdust 3asurfactants 3atemperature1 aLu, Ping1 aLu, Jun0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2012 Apr. 2, v. 88, no. 2 p.502-508dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.12.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245006500170300002000235520083500255592002801090650002201118650001201140650003001152650001701182650001301199650001901212650001301231650002201244650001201266700002101278700006401299700002301363700002601386700006201412700005801474773013601532856007901668852000901747655001201756IND60746857720220414000000.0210806e20210716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074685772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c010202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLê, Thị Phương,10aPolyhalogenated Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane-1,3-dicarboxylic Acids  ap. 10303-10319.  aHerein we report the highly selective radical chlorination of 2,2-difluorobicyclo[1.1.1]pentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid.

Although these systems share many common features, there are important biological differences between them that have broad evolutionary and genomic implications. Here we combine theoretical predictions with empirical observations to discuss how differences in selection, genetic properties and transmission uniquely shape each system. We elucidate how the differences among these systems can be exploited to gain insights about general evolutionary processes, genome structure, and gene expression.

Flavonoids, lignans, phenolic glycosides, quinones, terpenoids, glycerides, phenolic acids, and miscellaneous other compounds have been isolated from different parts of P. tomentosa plant. Recent interest in this species has focused on isolating and identifying of prenylated flavonoids, that exhibit potent antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiphlogistic activities and inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus papain-like protease. They show cytotoxic activity against various human cancer cell lines and inhibit the effects of human cholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and bacterial neuraminidases. Most of the compounds considered here have never been isolated from any other species of plant.

The apparent shrinkage deformation was obtained by measuring the change in width of drying specimens during drying. Using the slice method, elastic and viscoelastic deformation were defined as the instantaneous change in width of a slice right after cutting and the change in the width of a slice with constant moisture content during 48 h, respectively. Viscous deformation, permanent and nonrecoverable deformation of wood, was defined as the difference in deformation between free shrinkage and the sum of the apparent, elastic, and viscoelastic deformations. These elastic, viscoelastic, and viscous strains were applied to a viscoelastic model, and coefficients of viscoelasticity and viscosity were derived. The drying stress and deformation of red pine wood at specific times during the drying process can be predicted using each coefficients and modulus of elasticity obtained by experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3acutting 3adeformation 3adrying 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3ashrinkage 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscosity 3awater content 3awood 0aDrying stress 0akiln-drying 0ared pine 0astrain 0aviscoelasticity1 aYang, Sang-Yun1 aPark, Jun-Ho1 aChang, Yoon-Seong1 aEom, Chang-Deuk1 aYeo, Hwanmyeong0 tDrying technology.g2017 Nov. 18, v. 35, no. 15 p.1858-1866dTaylor & Francisx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2017.12833233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01485naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245007500162300001600237520059200253592002800845650001900873650001200892650000800904650001800912650001800930650002200948651001000970773011600980856007801096852000901174655001201183IND60129213920221119224449.0151124e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012921392DNAL7 a10.1656/045.020.04172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeinrich, Bernd10aCoordinated Mass Movements of Blow Fly Larvae (Diptera: Calliphoridae)  ap.

Conventional image analysis of cells typically employs either fluorescence detection approaches, such as immunofluorescent staining or transfection with fluorescent proteins or edge detection techniques, which are often error-prone due to noise and other non-idealities in the image background. We designed a new algorithm that could accurately count and distinguish macrophages and fibroblasts, cells of different phenotypes that often colocalize during tissue regeneration. MATLAB was used to implement the algorithm, which differentiated distinct cell types based on differences in height from the background. A primary algorithm was developed using an area-based method to account for variations in cell size/structure and high-density seeding conditions. Non-idealities in cell structures were accounted for with a secondary, iterative algorithm utilizing internal parameters such as cell coverage computed using experimental data for a given cell type. Finally, an analysis of coculture environments was carried out using an isolation algorithm in which various cell types were selectively excluded based on the evaluation of relative height differences within the image. This approach was found to accurately count cells within a 5% error margin for monocultured cells and within a 10% error margin for cocultured cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acoculture 3afibroblasts 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3amacrophages 3atissue repair 3atransfection1 aBoddupalli, Anuraag1 aSullivan, Millicent O.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2022 Feb. 15, , no. 180 p.e63058-e63058dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/630583Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/63058/area-based-image-analysis-algorithm-for-quantification-macrophage  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245014400172520177300316592002802089650001502117650001102132650001702143650002302160650002202183650001702205651001002222653002402232653002602256653003602282653002702318700001802345700002102363700002402384700002102408773011602429856008702545852000902632655001202641IND60755254620221116155313.0211114e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075525462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1148832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahlawan, Hilal10aSimultaneous optimization of the design and operation of multi-generation energy systems based on life cycle energy and economic assessment  aMulti-generation energy systems could mitigate global energy consumption, carbon emissions and economic costs. The promising energy, environmental and economic advantages of these systems are greatly dependent on their design and operational strategy. Consequently, methods and guidelines for the optimal design and operation of such systems, also taking into consideration their life cycle, are needed to fully exploit their potential. This paper proposes a general methodology for the simultaneous optimization of the design and operation of multi-generation energy systems by considering life cycle energy and economic assessment. The design optimization problem is solved by means of surrogate modeling and the operation optimization problem by means of dynamic programming. The multi-generation energy system considered in this paper comprises renewable energy systems, fossil fuel energy systems and energy storage technologies. Different multi-objective optimizations were performed by considering the minimization of fossil cumulative energy demand, and total investment and operational costs. The validity of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by using the campus of the University of Parma (Italy) as a case study. Compared to a conventional plant, the optimal solution allows a life cycle energy saving of about 17% and total cost reduction of about 18%. Moreover, compared to an optimization method based on particle swarm optimization and dynamic programming, the proposed methodology provides comparable results, but the computation time is 78% lower. The proposed methodology outperforms commonly used optimization algorithms and provides an effective and flexible framework for the optimal design and operation of multi-generation energy systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acarbon 3acase studies 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy conversion 3afossil fuels 3aItaly 0aDesign optimization 0aLife cycle assessment 0aMulti-generation energy systems 0aOperation optimization1 aMorini, Mirko1 aPinelli, Michele1 aSpina, Pier Ruggero1 aVenturini, Mauro0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 249 p.114883-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1148833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245012300177300001600300520082500316592002801141650002701169650001001196650001701206650001001223650002001233650001301253650002201266650001401288700001901302700006001321773011501381856008301496852000901579655001201588IND60739450120221118071335.0220317e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073945012DNAL7 a10.1007/s11418-021-01492-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaerani, Syahadatain Nor10aTwo new xanthones from the root of Thai Calophyllum inophyllum and their toxicity against colon and liver cancer cells  ap. 670-674.  aTwo new xanthones, 1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxy-5-methoxy-4-(1′,1′-dimethyl-2′-propenyl)-8-(3″,3″-dimethyl-2″-propenyl)-xanthone (1) and (2′S)-7-hydroxy caloxanthone B (2), were isolated from the root of Thai Calophyllum inophyllum Linn., together with twelve known xanthones (3–14).

Tramadol is an effective opioid analgesic but is associated with risks such as drug dependence and unexpected toxicity arising from genetic differences in metabolism. However, few studies have been performed on the distribution of tramadol and its metabolites in hair. In the present study, a column-switching LC-MS/MS method was developed and fully validated for the simultaneous determination of tramadol and its phase I and II metabolites in hair. Furthermore, the distribution of tramadol and its metabolites in hair was investigated in a pharmacogenetic study. Tramadol and its metabolites were extracted from hair using methanol and injected onto LC-MS/MS. The validation results of selectivity, matrix effect, linearity, precision and accuracy were satisfactory. The (mean) concentrations of O-desmethyltramadol (ODMT) and N,O-didesmethyltramadol (NODMT) in the CYP2D6*10/*10 and CYP2D6*5/*5 groups were lower than those in the CYP2D6*wt/*wt group, while the (mean) concentrations of N-desmethyltramadol (NDMT) were higher. Moreover, the ratios of ODMT/tramadol, NDMT/tramadol and NODMT/NDMT were well correlated with the CYP2D6 genotypes. The developed method was successfully applied to the clinical study, which demonstrated that the concentrations of a drug and its metabolites in hair were dependent on the polymorphism of its metabolizing enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF-2015M3A9E1028327cNational Research Foundation of Korea  aNRF-2016R1A6A1A03011325cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aanalgesics 3adrug abuse 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amethanol 3amonitoring 3arisk 3atoxicity1 aChoi, Minje1 aJang, Jung-Hee1 aPark, Byoungduck1 aSeo, Young-Ho,1 aJeong, Chul-Ho1 aBae, Jung-Woo1 aLee, Sooyeun0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2018 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.554-563dPharmaceutical Society of KoreawJournal:J000001242x0253-62697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12272-018-1013-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014400164300001300308520118700321592002801508650001401536650001101550650001801561650001701579650003001596653002901626653001101655653002901666653003601695700001801731700005601749773012201805856008301927852000902010655001202019IND60688298820221120112624.0200601e20200815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068829882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Zehao10a2-Methylimidazole-mediated hierarchical Co3O4/N-doped carbon/short-carbon-fiber composite as high-performance electromagnetic wave absorber  ap. 1-10.  aAt present, efficient and stable low-cost electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbing materials have been widely explored, but further improvement is still necessary. In this research, three types of hierarchical Co₃O₄/N-doped carbon/short carbon fiber (SCF) composites with different assembly structures were produced by annealing the ZIF-67/SCF and Co-LDHs/SCF precursors at 700 °C. The obtained Co₃O₄/N-doped carbon particles were uniformly attached on SCF in the form of nanocages or thin layer to compose a unique hierarchical structure. Notably, all three composites displayed high-performance EM wave absorption with a low filling ratio of only 20 wt% in paraffin matrix. Among them, cage-like Co-LDHs/SCF derived hierarchical carbon composite demonstrates the best performance, with a broad absorption bandwidth (RL ≤ −10 dB) of 6.08 GHz at 2.0 mm. Such excellent properties are attributed to the formed 3D conductive network, abundant Debye dipolar relaxation centers and strong interfacial polarization. These novel lightweight 2-methylimidazole-mediated Co₃O₄/N-doped carbon/SCF composites are expected to show great potential in EM wave absorption fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3acobalt oxide 3aelectromagnetic radiation 0aLayered double hydroxide 0aZIF-67 0aInterfacial polarization 0aElectromagnetic wave absorption1 aKou, Kaichang1 aWu, Hongjing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5575-32240 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Aug. 15, v. 574 p.1-10dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245016800167520135400335592002801689650003001717650001501747650002201762650001601784650001901800650001101819650001601830653000801846653000701854653000801861653000701869653000801876653000701884653000701891653000801898653000801906653000801914653000901922653000801931653000701939653000901946653000901955653000801964653000901972653000901981653000801990653000801998653001402006653002002020653002002040653002702060653001302087700001802100700001202118700001602130700001802146773011602164856008702280852000902367655001202376IND60755254820221116155347.0220509e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075525482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1148872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xiaoqi10aEffects of direct water injection timings on knock suppression, combustion, and emission performance of high compression ratio hydrogen-enriched natural gas engine  aIn this study, an approach of direct water injection was applied to suppress knock in the high compression ratio (CR) hydrogen-enriched natural gas (NG) engine. A CFD model for the high CR hydrogen-enriched NG engine was established and its effectiveness was verified by experimental data. On this basis, effects of water injection (WI) timings on knock mitigation, combustion, and emission features of the hydrogen-enriched NG engine were studied in detail. Results show that due to the slower flame propagation speed, monitoring points No.3 and 4 (the area near the intake valve) is more likely to knock accompanied by the higher flow velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. Besides, with the advance of WI timing, KI (knock intensity) keeps nearly unchanged firstly and then has a little increase after the second phase of reduction, whose minimum occurs at −150 °CA. Meanwhile, IMEP, CA10-90, and indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) have a similar change tendency with the maximum at −150 °CA, and ITE reaches its peak of about 40.9% with an increment of 3%. From −30 °CA to −180 °CA, NOx decreases a lot, while HC and CO emissions increase to some extent. Therefore, proper WI timing can not only effectively reduce KI and NOx emission, but also improve thermal efficiency and realize high CR in spark-ignition NG engines further.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acombustion 3aenergy conversion 3agas engines 3akinetic energy 3amodels 3anatural gas 0aDWI 0aCR 0aTKE 0aKI 0aITE 0aNG 0aWI 0a3-D 0aHEF 0aHRR 0aBSFC 0aGDI 0aMP 0aUBMF 0aBTDC 0aTDC 0aMAPO 0aIMEP 0aSOC 0aORC 0aNG engine 0aWater injection 0aKnock intensity 0aHigh compression ratio 0aEmission1 aLiu, Kaiqiang1 aLiu, Qi1 aFu, Jianqin1 aLiu, Jingping0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 250 p.114887-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1148873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001900160245009400179300001600273500000900289520192900298592002802227650001802255650001402273650002302287650001802310650001802328650001602346650002102362650002102383650001302404650001002417650001102427650001702438650001902455650002802474700001902502773012302521852000902644856009702653655001202750IND9005330020221121042536.0191122e199009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900533002DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1990.00021962008200050011x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoatley, J.

Field experiments in the spring and fall of 1987 and in the greenhouse in the winter of 1988 were designed to measure seedling Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) growth responses to foliar applications of benzyladenine (BA, 6-benzylaminopurine), propiconazole [l-([ 2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-propyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-y~methyl]-l-(1H-1,2,4-triazole], triadimefon [l-(4-chlorophenoxy)-3,3-dimethyl-l-(lH-1,2,4-triazol-l-yl)-2-butanone], or a fortified seaweed extract (SWE, containing 500 µg L⁻¹ of glycol kinetin and 500 pg L⁻¹ gibberellins) applied alone or in combination with chelated Fe (8% Fephosphate citrate). The seaweed extract (0.03 mL product m⁻²)significantly increased root and shoot growth 6 wk after treatment (WAT) in the spring experiment, and 4 and 6 WAT in the winter greenhouse experiment. The SWE also increased the gross CO₂ exchange rate (CER) on a land area basis 4 and 6 WAT in the winter experiment. Propiconazole (42 mg m⁻²) significantly increased seedling leaf number 6 WAT in the fall experiment. Triadimefon (150 mg m⁻²)or BA (6 mg m⁻²)ap plications generally were not as effective in increasing seedling growth as were the SWE or propiconazole. Foliar Fe applications (112 mg m⁻²)e,it her alone or in combination with biostimulators, significantly increased root and shoot growth and gross CER on a land area basis 4 and 6 WAT in the winter greenhouse experiment. Applications of Fe increased root dry weight 6 WAT in the spring field experiment. Growth responses to individual biostimulator and Fe combinations were highly variable among experiments, suggesting possible interactions between the growth response mechanisms of the treatments.

This powerful framework contains most of the published procedures in this area as special cases, such as maximally selected χ2 and rank statistics, but also allows for direct construction of new test procedures for less standard test problems. As an application, a novel maximally selected rank statistic is derived from this framework for a censored response partitioned with respect to two ordered categorical covariates and potential interactions. This new test is employed to search for a high‐risk group of rectal cancer patients treated with a neo‐adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Moreover, a new efficient algorithm for the evaluation of the asymptotic distribution for a large class of maximally selected statistics is given enabling the fast evaluation of a large number of cutpoints.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adata analysis 3amodels 3apatients 2aAlgorithms 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aBiometryxmethods 2aHumans 2aRectal Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxmortality. 2aStatistics as Topicxmethods 2aSurvival Analysis1 aZeileis, Achim0 tBiometrics.g2008 Dec., v. 64, no. 4 p.1263-1269dBlackwell Publishing Incx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2008.00995.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245012300174520139800297592002801695650003001723650001501753650002201768650000901790650001501799650002401814650002401838650001601862653003801878653003301916653002701949653003501976700002302011700002202034700001902056773011602075856008702191852000902278655001202287IND60755254920221116155343.0220509e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075525492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1148882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVering, Christian10aTowards an integrated design of heat pump systems: Application of process intensification using two-stage optimization  aAiming for a sustainable building stock, air-source heat pump systems are a key technology. In residential application, heat pump systems typically consist of a heat pump, an auxiliary heater, two thermal storages (for space heating and domestic hot water), and a system controller. Compared to conventional technologies, the efficiency of a heat pump system is highly dependent on it’s design, (component sizes, flowsheet, and refrigerant choice) and its operating conditions, particularly part load and temperature levels. While design strategies exist on different domains in the literature, there is no integrated strategy to optimally design heat pumps systems. In this work, we use process intensification to consider the heat pump system design and operation simultaneously. Formulating the intensification process leads to a two-stage MINLP optimization problem with multiple objectives: Costs and emissions. In the first stage, the design is optimized in an annual dynamic building performance simulation using a surrogate-based optimization procedure. Then, using the same dynamic simulation models, the system controller is optimized in the second stage using a Genetic Algorithm. Our results underline the necessity for integrated optimization process. The integrated process can decrease annualized costs up to 36% and emissions up to 51% compared to standard design procedures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aalgorithms 3aenergy conversion 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3asystem optimization 3asystems engineering 3atemperature 0aDesign and operation optimization 0aSurrogate-based optimization 0aRadial basis functions 0aEmission and cost minimization1 aWüllhorst, Fabian1 aMehrfeld, Philipp1 aMüller, Dirk,0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 250 p.114888-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1148883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005500139245011900194300001600313500001900329500002000348520125200368592002801620596007501648596005901723596005901782596009001841596007501931650002702006650002002033650001502053650002102068650002202089650002202111650001702133650002702150650002902177650001902206651001002225700005402235700005202289700005402341700005802395700005602453773012902509856007302638852000902711655001202720IND60734420020221118232505.0210417e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073442002DNAL7 a10.1111/jen.128472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Shan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1976-127810aGenetic variation and phylogeographic structure of Laodelphax striatellus in China based on microsatellite markers  ap. 336-347.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe small brown planthopper (SBPH), Laodelphax striatellus (Fallén) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), is an important agricultural pest that has caused serious economic losses in the major rice‐producing areas of China. To effectively manage this insect pest, we analysed its genetic variation, genetic structure and population demographic history. We used nine nuclear microsatellite loci to investigate the genetic diversity and population genetic structure of SBPH at 43 sampling sites in China. High levels of genetic diversity and genetic differentiation among most populations were detected. Overall, neighbour‐joining dendrograms, STRUCTURE and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) revealed no genetically distinct groups and exhibited an admixed phylogeographic structure in China. Isolation by distance (IBD) and spatial autocorrelation analyses demonstrated no correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance. On the other hand, bottleneck analysis indicated that SBPH populations had not undergone severe bottleneck effects in these regions. This study provides useful data for resolving the genetic relationships and migration patterns of SBPH and thus contributes to developing effective management strategies for this pest.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0200200cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a31871950cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31471770cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aLSNJC202008cScientific Research Project of Education Department of Liaoning Province  a2019JH2/10200012cThe Science and Technology Plan of Liaoning Province 3aLaodelphax striatellus 3aautocorrelation 3aentomology 3agenetic distance 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3ainsect pests 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amultidimensional scaling 3aphylogeography 3aChina1 aZhu, Kexin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7401-805X1 aHan, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9117-197X1 aChen, Chen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0443-73251 aWang, Mingming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2819-39971 aWang, Xingya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0934-46890 tJournal of applied entomology.g2021 May, v. 145, no. 4 p.336-347dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57792x0931-20487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jen.128473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245019500166300001600361520103200377592002801409650001301437650001601450650001001466650001301476650002601489650002701515650001401542650001401556650001601570650001701586650001101603650001501614650002501629653005501654653004901709653002401758653001601782653002201798700001901820700001901839700001801858700001601876700001201892773010601904856008702010852000902097655001202106IND60536559920221120135512.0190409e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053655992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2014.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xia10aRemediation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products using an aerobic granular sludge sequencing bioreactor and microbial community profiling using Solexa sequencing technology analysis  ap. 104-112.  aRecently, a new type of organic pollution derived from pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is gradually on the rise. Wastewater treatment to remove PPCPs was investigated using an aerobic granular sludge sequencing bioreactor (GSBR). After optimization of influent organic load, hydraulic shear stress, sludge settling time, etc., aerobic granular sludge was analyzed for its physiological and biochemical characteristics and tested for its efficacy to remove PPCPs wastewater. The granular sludge effectively removed some but not all of the PPCPs tested; removal correlated with the microbial profiles in the granules, as assessed using Solexa sequencing technology. Sequencing revealed the presence of five phylogenetic groups: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Betaproteobacteria, an unclassified genus, and Zoogloea. The results demonstrated changes in the microbial profiles with time in response to the presence of PPCPs. The effects of PPCPs on microbial communities in granular sludge process are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZoogloea 3abioreactors 3adrugs 3agranules 3amicrobial communities 3apersonal care products 3aphylogeny 3apollution 3aremediation 3ashear stress 3asludge 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aPharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) 0aGranular sludge sequencing bioreactor (GSBR) 0aMicrobial community 0aDegradation 0aSolexa sequencing1 aChen, Zhonglin1 aWang, Xiaochun1 aLi, Jinchunzi1 aShen, Jimin1 aXu, Hao0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Mar., v. 179 p.104-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012300165300001500288520092400303592002801227650001501255650001601270650001201286650002001298650002101318650003801339650001801377650000901395653002601404653002101430653001801451653002001469653001701489700001201506700001501518700001701533773009501550856008201645852000901727655001201736IND60553463720221120120311.0161021e20150815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055346372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zifeng10aSynthesis of cadmium, lead and copper alginate nanobeads as immunosensing probes for the detection of AFP, CEA and PSA  ap. 98-105.  aA double-water-in-oil-emulsion procedure was designed to synthesize cadmium, lead and copper alginate nanobeads less than 200nm diameter under mild conditions. The cadmium, lead and copper alginate nanobeads can be activated to immobilize biomacromolecules and can directly produce distinctive electrochemical signals. Using the novel alginate nanobeads labeled with antibodies as electrochemical probes, a sandwich-type immunosensor was constructed using AFP, CEA and PSA as model analytes. This proposed immunosensor shows wide linear range with detection limits of 0.01, 0.0086 and 0.0075ngmL−1 for AFP, CEA and PSA, respectively. Analysis of clinical serum samples using this immunosensor was well consistent with the data determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). It suggested that the alginate nanobeads electrochemical probes could be generally extended to other multiple analytes detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3acadmium 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmunosensors 3alead 0aWater-in-oil emulsion 0aCadmium alginate 0aLead alginate 0aCopper alginate 0aImmunosensor1 aLiu, Na1 aFeng, Feng1 aMa, Zhanfang0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 Aug. 15, v. 70 p.98-105dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04307naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001400192245012600206300001600332506007600348520195300424536030602377592002802683596009802711596008502809596006502894506003702959650002502996650001703021650001203038650001303050650001003063650002103073650001703094650001703111650001403128650002903142653002703171653002903198653001403227653003203241653001803273653001303291700001703304700001503321700001403336700001403350700001703364700001303381700001303394700001703407700001303424700002003437700001403457773010403471856008503575852000903660655001203669IND60691255820221207073902.0200428e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069125582DNAL7 a10.1080/15476286.2019.15652842doi7 aPMC63803452pmcid7 a306147532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ju10aCircular RNA profiling provides insights into their subcellular distribution and molecular characteristics in HepG2 cells  ap. 220-232.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCircular RNA (circRNA) is a novel RNA molecule that has become a research focus recently. Although some research indicated that the circRNAs in different subcellular compartments could execute different regulatory functions, a panoramic analysis of the subcellular distribution and the transport mechanism of circRNA is still required. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the subcellular distribution/characteristics and the transport mechanism, through systemically investigating the circRNA profiles among the subcellular fractions of HepG2 cell (nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, ribosome, cytosol and exosome). CircRNAs were widely distributed among the subcellular fractions except in the mitochondria, with differences in the subcellular distribution/characteristics in terms of classification, length, GC content, alternative circularization and parental gene function. Further analysis indicated this might be due to the selective transportation mediated by the transport-related RNA binding proteins (RBPs). The circRNAs may follow the same transportation mechanism of linear RNAs, in which the RBPs specially recognize/transport the RNAs with the corresponding binding motifs. Interestingly, we found that the exosome could selectively package the circRNAs containing the purine-rich 5ʹ-GMWGVWGRAG-3ʹ motif, with the characteristic of ‘garbage dumping’ and ‘intercellular signaling’ functions. Besides, although we observed numerous circRNAs enriched in the ribosome, we did not reliably identify any unique-peptides from circRNAs using 3D-LC-MS/MS strategy. This suggests that circRNAs rarely function as translation templates in vivo like lincRNA. Our findings not only indicates the differential distributions/characteristics among the subcellular fractions, but also reveals the possible transportation mechanism. This provides an improved understanding of the life history and molecular behavior of circRNA in cells.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant [31401172, 31500663, 31770870]; the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China under Grant [2015AA020409], and the National Program on Key Basic Research Project under Grant [2014CB964900].  aPublisher supplied data  a31401172cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2015AA020409cNational High Technology Research and Development Program of China  a2014CB964900cNational Program on Key Basic Research Project0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA-binding proteins 3acircular RNA 3acytosol 3aexosomes 3agenes 3ahuman cell lines 3alife history 3amitochondria 3aribosomes 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aCircular RNA (circRNA) 0asubcellular distribution 0atransport 0aRNA binding proteins (RBPs) 0aback-splicing 0anCounter1 aZhang, Xiuli1 aLi, Cuidan1 aYue, Liya1 aDing, Nan1 aRiordan, Tim1 aYang, Li1 aLi, Yang1 aJen, Charles1 aLin, Sen1 aZhou, Dongsheng1 aChen, Fei0 tRNA biology.g2019 Feb. 1, v. 16, no. 2 p.220-232dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2019.15652843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01786naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012600166300001200292520064000304592002800944650001500972650001700987650003201004650001701036653001801053653002901071653003601100653000901136700001601145700001301161700001701174700001801191700002001209773009201229856008201321852000901403655001201412IND60553463820221120104933.0161021e20150815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055346382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhanhui12aA highly sensitive and class-specific fluorescence polarisation assay for sulphonamides based on dihydropteroate synthase  ap. 1-4.  aWe describe a fluorescence polarisation assay based on the use of dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and a fluorescence probe for multi-sulphonamide detection.

The oxidation and reduction reactions specific to thiotriazinone compounds are irreversible, diffusion controlled processes, and occur in a complex mechanism. The stable inclusion of thiotriazinone in β-cyclodextrin is proved by the significant changes of redox activity characteristic for TTZ and good electrochemical stability of the complex. Moreover, the present study demonstrates that β-cyclodextrin can serve as a carrier system, since the TTZ molecule can be gradually released from the inclusion complex with time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-cyclodextrin 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3aelectrochemistry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation1 aMarangoci, Narcisa1 aNicolescu, Alina1 aPinteala, Mariana0 tRSC advances.g2016 Aug. 31, v. 6, no. 86 p.82817-82823dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra16386f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03731naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001400192245012700206300001600333506007600349520135800425536033201783592002802115596009802143596006702241596006302308506003702371650001402408650001802422650001902440650001502459650001402474650001602488650001702504650001302521650001902534650002102553650002002574650002202594650002902616653001202645653000902657653001102666653001902677653002102696700001702717700001502734700001602749700001702765700001402782700001502796700001302811700002502824700001602849700001802865773010402883856008502987852000903072655001203081IND60691255920221207073742.0200428e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069125592DNAL7 a10.1080/15476286.2019.15656652doi7 aPMC63802832pmcid7 a306285142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Xin10aFoxo3a-dependent miR-633 regulates chemotherapeutic sensitivity in gastric cancer by targeting Fas-associated death domain  ap. 233-248.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe development of chemotherapeutic drugs resistance such as doxorubicin (DOX) and cisplatin (DDP) is the major barrier in gastric cancer therapy. Emerging evidences reveal that microRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to chemosensitivity. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-633, an oncogenic miRNA, in gastric cancer chemoresistance. In gastric cancer tissue and cell lines, miR-633 expression was highly increased and correlated with down regulation of Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD). Inhibition of miR-633 significantly increased FADD protein level and enhanced DOX/DDP induced apoptosis in vitro. MiR-633 antagomir administration remarkably decreased tumor growth in combination with DOX in vivo, suggesting that miR-633 targets FADD to block gastric cancer cell death. We found that the promoter region of miR-633 contained putative binding sites for forkhead box O 3 (Foxo3a), which can directly repress miR-633 transcription. In addition, we observed that DOX-induced nuclear accumulation of Foxo3a leaded to the suppression of miR-633 transcription. Together, our study revealed that miR-633/FADD axis played a significant role in the chemoresistance and Foxo3a regulated this pathway in gastric cancer. Thus, miR-633 antagomir resensitized gastric cancer cells to chemotherapy drug and had potentially therapeutic implication.  aThis work was supported by the Shandong Provincial Natural Science outstanding youth fund (grant numbers JQ201815), National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 81602341) and Qingdao Postdoctoral Application Research Project (grant number 2016066);Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (CN) [JQ201815].  aPublisher supplied data  a81602341cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aJQ201815cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (CN)  a2016066cQingdao Postdoctoral Application Research Project0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3abinding sites 3acancer therapy 3acell lines 3acisplatin 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasm cells 3apromoter regions 3aprotein content 3astomach neoplasms 3atranscription (genetics) 0amiR-633 0aFADD 0aFoxo3a 0agastric cancer 0achemosensitivity1 aZhou, Zhixia1 aYu, Zhuang1 aHan, Lichun1 aLin, Zhijuan1 aAo, Xiang1 aLiu, Chang1 aHe, Yuqi1 aPonnusamy, Murugavel1 aLi, Peifeng1 aWang, Jianxun0 tRNA biology.g2019 Feb. 1, v. 16, no. 2 p.233-248dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2019.15656653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014500168300001400313520130800327592002801635650001501663650001301678650001501691650001501706650001601721650002101737650001101758650002001769650001501789650003801804650001101842650001901853653002401872653001601896653001001912653001001922653001201932653002401944653001801968700002801986700001502014700001702029700003002046700001902076700002102095700001802116773009402134856008202228852000902310655001202319IND60553463920221120105000.0161021e20150815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055346392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEletxigerra, U.10aAmperometric magnetoimmunosensor for ErbB2 breast cancer biomarker determination in human serum, cell lysates and intact breast cancer cells  ap. 34-41.  aA highly sensitive amperometric magnetoimmunosensor for the determination of ErbB2 protein, a well-known biomarker related to high-impact high-incidence diseases such as breast cancer, is described. A sandwich format involving the covalent immobilization of a specific capture antibody onto magnetic beads (MBs) and incubation of the modified MBs with a mixture solution of the antigen and a HRP-labeled detector antibody was used. The resulting modified MBs were captured on the surface of a disposable screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) and the amperometric responses at −0.20V were measured. This ErbB2 magnetoimmunosensor exhibited a very low detection limit of 26pgmL−1 far below the established cut-off for this biomarker (15ngmL−1) and was successfully applied to the quantitation of ErbB2 in human serum and cell lysates samples without any matrix effect. In addition, the developed assay allowed the assessment of ErbB2 status directly in intact breast cancer cells. The results correlated well with those obtained with a commercial ELISA method, thus demonstrating that the new magnetoimmunosensing platform offers a truthful and useful analytical tool to be easily applied in breast cancer diagnosis through either ErbB2 protein determination or breast cancer cell status detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3abreast neoplasms 3acarbon 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahumans 3aneoplasm cells 0aMagnetoimmunosensor 0aAmperometry 0aErbB2 0aSerum 0aLysates 0aIntact cancer cells 0aBreast cancer1 aMartinez-Perdiguero, J.1 aMerino, S.1 aBarderas, R.1 aTorrente-Rodríguez, R.M.1 aVillalonga, R.1 aPingarrón, J.M.1 aCampuzano, S.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 Aug. 15, v. 70 p.34-41dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016800164300001500332520104000347592002801387650000801415650001701423650002101440650001601461650002001477650002301497650001801520650001801538650003001556650002801586650000901614700002001623700002201643700002101665700002201686700002301708700002201731773008401753856008101837852000901918655001201927IND50067036720221121040053.0150207e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006703672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-013-0882-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoide, Yohei10aQTL for spikelet number from a high-yielding rice variety, Hoshiaoba, detected in an introgression line with the genetic background of an indica rice variety, IR64  ap. 97-106.  aTotal spikelet number per panicle (TSN) is thought to be one of the most important agronomic traits associated with grain production in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We previously reported the development of 334 introgression lines (ILs) with variations in agronomic traits in the genetic background of indica rice variety IR64. Among these, an IL derived from high-yielding rice variety Hoshiaoba showed significantly higher TSN than IR64. We therefore have conducted a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for TSN in an F₂population of IL × IR64 to ascertain the genetic basis for the high TSN of the IL. The analysis revealed the presence of a QTL for TSN on chromosome 7, where several QTLs for grain number have been previously reported. We developed a near-isogenic line (NIL) for this QTL by using DNA marker-assisted selection and characterized its effect. The NIL showed significantly higher TSN than IR64. These results suggest that the QTL and the NIL will be useful materials in breeding programs aimed at increasing TSN.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aOryza sativa 3aagronomic traits 3achromosomes 3acrop production 3agenetic background 3agenetic lines 3aintrogression 3amarker-assisted selection 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice1 aFujita, Daisuke1 aTagle, Analiza G.1 aSasaki, Kazuhiro1 aIshimaru, Tsutomu1 aFukuta, Yoshimichi1 aKobayashi, Nobuya0 tEuphytica.g2013 July, v. 192, no. 1 p.97-106dSpringer-Verlagx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-013-0882-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245018700171300001800358520126100376592002801637650001801665650002201683650002701705650001801732650001401750650001301764650002001777650001401797650001401811650001701825650002101842650002101863650001901884650001601903650002801919650000901947650001601956650001601972650002101988650002402009653001402033653002102047653000802068653001002076653001702086700001502103700002002118700002002138700001602158700002102174700001802195700001702213773009902230856008602329852000902415655001202424IND60535064820221118055230.0190319e20150820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053506482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.03.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Chih-Hsuan10aUse of recombinant flagellin in oil-in-water emulsions enhances hemagglutinin-specific mucosal IgA production and IL-17 secreting T cells against H5N1 avian influenza virus infection  ap. 4321-4329.  aResearchers are currently involved in a strong effort to find a safe and effective vaccine against highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses. Toward that goal, we obtained soluble recombinant flagellin (FliC) of Salmonella typhimurium to be used as a mucosal adjuvant for H5HA subunit vaccine development. Intranasal immunization of H5HA antigen with recombinant FliC protein in an oil-in-water emulsion increased H5HA-specific IgG and IgA titers in sera, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs), and nasal washes. Use of FliC adjuvant for intranasal immunization further augmented B-cell responses in mucosal environments via increased IgA titers in BALFs and nasal washes. Increases in IgA and IgG titers through the use of FliC adjuvant in intranasal immunization correlated with higher neutralizing antibody titers in sera and BALFs and higher numbers of IgG- and IgA-secreting B cells in spleen and cervical lymph nodes. High levels of IL-17A cytokine production were also found in stimulated T cells of spleen and cervical lymph node cells, only by intranasal immunization particularly with the use of FliC adjuvant in oil-in-water emulsions. These findings may provide useful information toward the development of H5HA mucosal influenza vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aInfluenza A virus 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadjuvants 3aantigens 3aavian influenza 3aemulsions 3aflagellin 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterleukin-17 3alymph nodes 3aneutralizing antibodies 3anose 3aresearchers 3asplenocytes 3asubunit vaccines 3avaccine development 0aFlagellin 0aMucosal adjuvant 0aIgA 0aIL-17 0aH5N1 vaccine1 aTang, Neos1 aJan, Jia-Tsrong1 aHuang, Ming-Hsi1 aLu, Chun-Yi1 aChiang, Bor-Luen1 aHuang, Li-Min1 aWu, Suh-Chin0 tVaccine.g2015 Aug. 20, v. 33, no. 35 p.4321-4329dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.03.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245010300206300001400309506007600323520203800399592002802437506003702465650001502502650002002517650002102537650002002558650001302578653001202591653001602603653001202619653001902631653002402650653001102674700001802685700002002703700002102723700001902744773009702763856008102860852000902941655001202950IND60528753620221207100515.0161016e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052875362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2016.03.0042doi7 aPMC48600832pmcid7 a270212732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRountree, Wes10aVariability of the IFN-γ ELISpot assay in the context of proficiency testing and bridging studies  ap. 69-76.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAssays that assess cellular mediated immune responses performed under Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GCLP) guidelines are required to provide specific and reproducible results. Defined validation procedures are required to establish the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), include pass and fail criteria, as well as implement positivity criteria. However, little to no guidance is provided on how to perform longitudinal assessment of the key reagents utilized in the assay. Through the External Quality Assurance Program Oversight Laboratory (EQAPOL), an Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay proficiency testing program is administered. A limit of acceptable within site variability was estimated after six rounds of proficiency testing (PT). Previously, a PT send-out specific within site variability limit was calculated based on the dispersion (variance/mean) of the nine replicate wells of data. Now an overall ‘dispersion limit’ for the ELISpot PT program within site variability has been calculated as a dispersion of 3.3. The utility of this metric was assessed using a control sample to calculate the within (precision) and between (accuracy) experiment variability to determine if the dispersion limit could be applied to bridging studies (studies that assess lot-to-lot variations of key reagents) for comparing the accuracy of results with new lots to results with old lots. Finally, simulations were conducted to explore how this dispersion limit could provide guidance in the number of replicate wells needed for within and between experiment variability and the appropriate donor reactivity (number of antigen-specific cells) to be used for the evaluation of new reagents. Our bridging study simulations indicate using a minimum of six replicate wells of a control donor sample with reactivity of at least 150 spot forming cells per well is optimal. To determine significant lot-to-lot variations use the 3.3 dispersion limit for between and within experiment variability.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aguidelines 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3aquality control 3avariance 0aELISpot 0aVariability 0aPoisson 0aBridging study 0aProficiency testing 0aEQAPOL1 aBerrong, Mark1 aSanchez, Ana M.1 aDenny, Thomas N.1 aFerrari, Guido0 tJournal of Immunological Methods.g2016 June, v. 433 p.69-76dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2016.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012200165506011700287506007600404520110200480592002801582506003701610650001501647650002201662650001601684650001701700650002601717650002001743650004401763653001701807653001501824653002901839653006301868700001601931700001701947700001301964700001601977773012601993856008202119852000902201655001202210IND60788648220221207135705.0220906e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078864822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1138522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Min-Zhen10aNontargeted metabonomics-assisted two-dimensional ion mobility mass spectrometry point imaging to identify plant teas  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDendrobium has great medicinal value, and their active components vary across different species of Dendrobium. In this study, a two-dimensional ion mobility mass spectrometry point image based on retention time and drift time was first proposed, and the collision cross-section values of Dendrobium metabolites were calculated by the IM browser, which can identify the targeted compounds more accurately, especially for isomeric compounds. During the experimental process, a total of 74 batches of Dendrobium samples containing nine species of Dendrobium were analyzed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ion mobility quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Nontargeted plant metabonomics combined with multivariate statistical analysis was used to realize the clustering of different species of Dendrobium, which made the identification more scientific. Therefore, this method can realize the analysis of multiple active components in Dendrobium, can be used for the identification of Dendrobium teas and can provide a reference for the quality control of Dendrobium.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDendrobium 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amultivariate analysis 3aquality control 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aChemometrics 0aDendrobium 0aNontargeted metabonomics 0aTwo-dimensional ion mobility mass spectrometry point image1 aYu, Ya-Ling1 aZhu, Si-Chen1 aCao, Jun1 aYe, Li-Hong0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 167 p.113852-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1138523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245012700201506007600328520170500404592002802109506003702137650001102174650001802185650003402203650001602237650001102253650001202264650002402276650001902300650001202319650001102331650000802342650002402350650002402374650001702398650001502415700002102430700002802451700002402479700002102503773012202524856007302646852000902719655001202728IND60650075520221207125329.0190709e20161107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065007552DNAL7 a10.3390/nu81106862doi7 aPMC51330742pmcid7 a278279782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirmiran, Parvin12aA Prospective Study of Different Types of Dietary Fiber and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease: Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground and aim: This study was designed to examine the hypothesis that dietary of intake different types of fiber could modify the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a large prospective cohort among Iranian adults. Methods: In 2006–2008, we used a validated food frequency questionnaire to assess dietary fiber intake among 2295 health professionals with no previous history of heart disease. Subjects were subsequently followed until 2012 for incidence of CVD events. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models, adjusted for potential confounders were used to estimate the risk of CVD across tertiles of total dietary fiber and different types of fiber. Linear regression models were also used to indicate the association of dietary fiber intakes with changes of cardiovascular risk factors during the follow-up. Results: Mean age of participants (42.8% men) was 38.2 ± 13.4, at baseline. Mean (SD) dietary intake of total fiber was 23.4 (8.9) g/day. After adjustment for cardiovascular risk score and dietary confounders, a significant inverse association was observed between intakes of total, soluble and insoluble dietary fiber and CVD risk, in the highest compared to the lowest tertiles (HR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.18–0.83, HR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.09–0.41, and HR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.14–0.69, respectively). Inverse relations were observed between risk of CVD and dietary fiber from legumes, fruits and vegetables; however, dietary fiber intake from grain and nut sources was not related to risk of CVD. Conclusion: Our findings confirmed that higher intakes of dietary fiber from different sources is associated with CVD events and modify its major risk-related factors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3adietary fiber 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3afruits 3aglucose 3ahealth care workers 3aheart diseases 3alegumes 3alipids 3amen 3aprospective studies 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3avegetables1 aBahadoran, Zahra1 aKhalili Moghadam, Sajad1 aZadeh Vakili, Azita1 aAzizi, Fereidoun0 tNutrients.g2016 Nov. 07, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu81106863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010300165300001100268520184600279592002802125650001502153650001602168650001802184650002502202650001102227650000902238650001402247650001302261650002402274700001202298700001802310700001902328700001702347773011502364856008302479852000902562655001202571IND60712593120221117033457.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071259312DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-020-02307-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDecloedt, A.10aAssessment of left ventricular function in horses with aortic regurgitation by 2D speckle tracking  ap. 93.  aBACKGROUND: Aortic regurgitation (AR) may lead to left ventricular (LV) dilatation, cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. Close follow-up of horses with AR is therefore paramount to detect onset of cardiac decompensation. The aim of this study was to examine whether two-dimensional speckle tracking (2DST) can be used to detect altered myocardial function in horses with chronic AR compared to control horses. Speckle tracking was performed on short axis and long axis images of the LV in 29 healthy Warmblood horses and 57 Warmblood horses with AR. Radial, circumferential and longitudinal strain, strain rate and displacement were measured for each segment separately and the average was calculated over all segments. Data generated from the apical segments were not included in the analysis. RESULTS: Radial (SR) and circumferential (SC) strain were significantly higher in horses with moderate AR (average SR 75.5 ± 24.3%, SC 19.3 ± 3.2%) but not in horses with severe AR (SR 65.5 ± 26.2%, SC 16.3 ± 3.5%), compared to control horses (SR 54.5 ± 18.0%, SC 16.8 ± 3.0%). Longitudinal strain did not show significant differences, but longitudinal displacement (DL) was larger in horses with moderate (average DL 29.5 ± 4.1 cm) and severe AR (DL 32.4 ± 6.1 cm) compared to control horses (DL 25.7 ± 4.0 cm), especially in the interventricular septum. Diastolic longitudinal strain rate was lower in early diastole in horses with severe AR (0.93 ± 0.18/s) compared to controls (1.13 ± 0.13/s). CONCLUSIONS: 2DST is able to detect altered myocardial motion in horses with AR, which showed significantly higher radial and circumferential strain. Further research is needed to determine whether these findings contribute to a more accurate diagnosis and prognosis in clinical cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarrhythmia 3adeformation 3aheart failure 3aheart valve diseases 3ahorses 3alead 3aprognosis 3aresearch 3aveterinary medicine1 aVen, S.1 aDe Clercq, D.1 aRademakers, F.1 avan Loon, G.0 tBMC veterinary research.g2020 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.93-93dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02307-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245014500158500001400303520154600317592002801863650001601891650001201907650001901919650001901938650001201957650001901969650001201988650002202000650001302022650001602035650001302051650001102064700002402075700001902099700002402118700002302142700002202165773012202187856007302309852000902382655001202391IND60721808120221122044050.0201224e20201127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072180812DNAL7 a10.3390/v121213602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraun, Robert 10aApplication of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in Phage Displayed Peptide Selection to Support the Identification of Arsenic-Binding Motifs  aNAL-light  aNext generation sequencing (NGS) in combination with phage surface display (PSD) are powerful tools in the newly equipped molecular biology toolbox for the identification of specific target binding biomolecules. Application of PSD led to the discovery of manifold ligands in clinical and material research. However, limitations of traditional phage display hinder the identification process. Growth-based library biases and target-unrelated peptides often result in the dominance of parasitic sequences and the collapse of library diversity. This study describes the effective enrichment of specific peptide motifs potentially binding to arsenic as proof-of-concept using the combination of PSD and NGS. Arsenic is an environmental toxin, which is applied in various semiconductors as gallium arsenide and selective recovery of this element is crucial for recycling and remediation. The development of biomolecules as specific arsenic-binding sorbents is a new approach for its recovery. Usage of NGS for all biopanning fractions allowed for evaluation of motif enrichment, in-depth insight into the selection process and the discrimination of biopanning artefacts, e.g., the amplification-induced library-wide reduction in hydrophobic amino acid proportion. Application of bioinformatics tools led to the identification of an SxHS and a carboxy-terminal QxQ motif, which are potentially involved in the binding of arsenic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of PSD combined with NGS of all relevant biopanning fractions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aarsenic 3abacteriophages 3abioinformatics 3agallium 3ahydrophobicity 3aligands 3amolecular biology 3apeptides 3aremediation 3asorbents 3atoxins1 aSchönberger, Nora 1 aVinke, Svenja 1 aLederer, Franziska 1 aKalinowski, Jörn 1 aPollmann, Katrin 0 tViruses.g2020 Nov. 27, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v121213603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100004200150245019400192520122200386592002801608650001501636650001401651650001601665650002001681650001401701650001601715650001701731650001401748650001801762650001101780650001201791650001501803651001101818653001601829653001001845653001401855653001401869653001601883653001101899700002801910700002901938773010701967856008502074852000902159655001202168IND60767254420221119102716.0220719e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076725442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parint.2022.1025602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVieira, Diego Henrique Mirandola Dias10aMorphological and molecular characterization of the cryptic species Myxobolus cataractae n. sp.

We based the description on myxospore morphology, histology, and small subunit ribosomal DNA partial sequences. Whitish and elongated mass of myxospores were found in gill filaments, occupying an intrafilamental position. The myxospores were slightly ellipsoidal and the morphometric measurements revealed a myxospore body length of 7.8 ± 0.4 μm; myxospore width of 5.9 ± 0.4 μm; and thickness of 3.9 ± 0.3 μm. The polar capsules are equal in size and measured 3.5 ± 0.2 μm in length and 1.7 ± 0.2 μm in width. The polar tubules had 6–7 coils. Myxobolus cataractae n. sp. is classified as the intrafilamental type and chondreal subtype by the histological analysis of gills. Phylogenetic analysis showed a well-supported subclade formed by species that parasitize gills of Siluriformes, with M. imparfinis as a sister species of Myxobolus cataractae n. sp. Using molecular and morphological characterization, this cryptic species was identified as a new species of the genus Myxobolus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aImparfinis 3aMyxobolus 3abody length 3acryptic species 3ahistology 3anew species 3aparasitology 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3arivers 3astreams 3awatersheds 3aBrazil 0aMyxosporean 0aGills 0aHistology 0aPhylogeny 0aPardo River 0aBrazil1 aNarciso, Rodrigo Bravin1 ada Silva, Reinaldo José0 tParasitology international.g2022 June, v. 88 p.102560-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2022.1025603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03798naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245012200209300001200331500001100343506007600354520215300430592002802583506003702611650001102648650003302659650002402692650002402716650002702740650002202767650001802789650001202807650001702819650002002836650001402856650001302870650002402883650001702907650002702924651001302951651001002964651001202974651001002986651001102996700002603007700002003033773011203053856008203165852000903247655001203256IND60548667220221207115632.0190220e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054866722DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-016-1743-72doi7 aPMC49943832pmcid7 a275491622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Salem, Waleed12aA review of visceral leishmaniasis during the conflict in South Sudan and the consequences for East African countries  ap. 460.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused predominantly by Leishmania donovani and transmitted by both Phlebotomus orientalis and Phlebotomus martini, is highly endemic in East Africa where approximately 30 thousands VL cases are reported annually. The largest numbers of cases are found in Sudan - where Phlebotomus orientalis proliferate in Acacia forests especially on Sudan’s eastern border with Ethiopia, followed by South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Uganda. Long-standing civil war and unrest is a dominant determinant of VL in East African countries. Here we attempt to identify the correlation between VL epidemics and civil unrest. OBJECTIVE AND METHODOLOGY: In this review, literature published between 1955 and 2016 have been gathered from MSF, UNICEF, OCHA, UNHCR, PubMed and Google Scholar to analyse the correlation between conflict and human suffering from VL, which is especially apparent in South Sudan. FINDINGS: Waves of forced migration as a consequence of civil wars between 1983 and 2005 have resulted in massive and lethal epidemics in southern Sudan. Following a comprehensive peace agreement, but especially with increased allocation of resources for disease treatment and prevention in 2011, cases of VL declined reaching the lowest levels after South Sudan declared independence. However, in the latest epidemic that began in 2014 after the onset of a civil war in South Sudan, more than 1.5 million displaced refugees have migrated internally to states highly endemic for VL, while 800,000 have fled to neighboring countries. CONCLUSION: We find a strong relationship between civil unrest and VL epidemics which tend to occur among immunologically naïve migrants entering VL-endemic areas and when Leishmania-infected individuals migrate to new areas and establish additional foci of disease. Further complicating factors in East Africa’s VL epidemics include severe lack of access to diagnosis and treatment, HIV/AIDS co-infection, food insecurity and malnutrition. Moreover, cases of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) can serve as important reservoirs of anthroponotic Leishmania parasites.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcacia 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aLeishmania donovani 3aPhlebotomus martini 3aPhlebotomus orientalis 3adisease outbreaks 3afood security 3aforests 3amalnutrition 3amixed infection 3aparasites 3arefugees 3aresource allocation 3atherapeutics 3avisceral leishmaniasis 3aEthiopia 3aKenya 3aSomalia 3aSudan 3aUganda1 aHerricks, Jennifer R.1 aHotez, Peter J.0 tParasites & vectors.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.460-460dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-016-1743-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01981naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245020800206300001600414520060500430592002801035650001201063650000901075650001901084650001401103650001001117653002801127653001901155653001701174653001401191653001101205653001801216653002001234653002001254700002401274700005801298700002101356773010201377856008301479852000901562655001201571IND60635768420221123031534.0200210e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063576842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2019.03.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRagaini, Fabio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7803-322X10aRebuttal to: Polemic against conclusions drawn in “Palladium/iodide catalyzed oxidative carbonylation of aniline to diphenylurea: Effect of ppm amounts of iron salts” (J.

Some of the content of the latter is due to some misunderstanding, whereas some assertions are untenable and in contrast with experimental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaniline 3airon 3airon compounds 3apalladium 3asalts 0aOxidative carbonylation 0aAromatic amine 0aDiphenylurea 0aPalladium 0aIodide 0aIron chloride 0aDimethoxyethane 0aCarbon monoxide1 aFerretti, Francesco1 aGatti, Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4722-28341 aRamadan, Doaa R.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2019 Dec., v. 380 p.391-395dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.03.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03998naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014800170300001200318520218200330592002802512596006002540596004102600596005302641596005402694650001902748650001602767650002202783650000802805650001502813650001502828650001602843650001002859650001202869650000902881650001102890650002702901650001402928650001102942650000902953650001202962650001502974650001302989650002403002650001303026651003103039700002003070700002203090700002203112700002103134700002403155700002003179773011703199856008303316852000903399655001203408IND60712593920221117033023.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071259392DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-020-02322-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyers, Alyssa C.10aSelected cardiac abnormalities in Trypanosoma cruzi serologically positive, discordant, and negative working dogs along the Texas-Mexico border  ap. 101.  aBACKGROUND: Chagas disease is increasingly recognized in the southern U.S., where triatomine vectors transmit Trypanosoma cruzi among wildlife and domestic dogs with occasional vector spillover to humans. As in humans, clinical outcome in dogs is variable, ranging from acute death to asymptomatic infections or chronic heart disease. In order to characterize cardiac manifestations of T. cruzi infections, we tracked a cohort of naturally-infected dogs and a matched cohort of uninfected dogs. We hypothesized that selected measures of cardiac disease (abnormal rate, abnormal rhythm, and elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI; a biomarker of cardiac injury)) would occur more commonly in infected than uninfected dogs matched by age, breed, sex and location. In addition to the clearly positive and negative dogs, we specifically tracked dogs with discordant test results across three independent serological assays to gather clinical data that might elucidate the infection status of these animals and inform the utility of the different testing approaches. RESULTS: We placed an ambulatory ECG monitor (Holter) on 48 government working dogs and analyzed 39 successful recordings that met length and quality criteria from 17 T. cruzi-infected, 18 uninfected dogs and 4 dogs with discordant results. Overall, 76.5% of positive, 100.0% of discordant, and 11.1% of negative dogs showed > 1 ECG abnormality (p < 0.0001), and positive and discordant dogs had a higher mean number of different types of ECG abnormalities than negative dogs (p < 0.001–0.014). The most common cardiac abnormalities included supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and atrioventricular block. Positive dogs had higher serum concentrations of cTnI than both negative dogs (p = 0.044) and discordant dogs (p = 0.06). Based on dog handler reports, nearly all (4/5; 80%) dogs with reported performance decline or fatigue were T. cruzi-infected dogs. CONCLUSIONS : Further understanding cardiac manifestations in dogs naturally infected with T. cruzi is critical for prognostication, establishing a baseline for drug and vaccine studies, and better understanding of zoonotic risk.  aPublisher supplied data  aHSHQDC-16-J-00459cU.S. Department of Homeland Security  a1746932cNational Science Foundation  a5T35OD010991cNational Institutes of Health (US)  aVeterinary Scholars ProgramcBoehringer Ingelheim 3aChagas disease 3aTriatominae 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aage 3aarrhythmia 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3adeath 3adecline 3adogs 3ahumans 3aimmunologic techniques 3ainfection 3alength 3arisk 3atesting 3atroponin I 3avaccines 3aveterinary medicine 3awildlife 3aSoutheastern United States1 aEllis, Megan M.1 aPurnell, Julia C.1 aAuckland, Lisa D.1 aMeinders, Marvin1 aSaunders, Ashley B.1 aHamer, Sarah A.0 tBMC veterinary research.g2020 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.101-101dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02322-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015300166300001500319520085200334592002801186650002201214650003701236650002101273650001301294650001901307650002401326650001901350650001701369650001401386650001601400650001701416650001401433650002101447653002701468653001801495653002701513653002301540653002301563700001701586700001301603700001901616700001701635773012401652856008201776852000901858655001201867IND60628867920221123015731.0190131e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062886792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2017.11.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dong-Ning10aDentritic platinum-palladium/palladium core-shell nanocrystals/reduced graphene oxide: One-pot synthesis and excellent electrocatalytic performances  ap. 93-101.  aHerein, we developed a facile one-pot co-reduction method to fabricate highly dentritic platinum-palladium/palladium core-shell nanocrystals on reduced graphene oxide (PtPd@Pd NCs/rGO), where poly-l-lysine (PLL) worked as the eco-friendly structure director and stabilizer.

To combat VAD dietary interventions with β-carotene, the most abundant precursor of vitamin A, are recommended. However, the impact of β-carotene on intestinal health during VAD has not been fully clarified, especially regarding the VAD-associated intestinal dysbiosis. Here we addressed this question by using Lrat⁻/⁻Rbp⁻/⁻ (vitamin A deficient) mice deprived of dietary preformed vitamin A and supplemented with β-carotene as the sole source of the vitamin, alongside with WT (vitamin A sufficient) mice. We found that dietary β-carotene impacted intestinal vitamin A status, barrier integrity and inflammation in both WT and Lrat⁻/⁻Rbp⁻/⁻ (vitamin A deficient) mice on the vitamin A-free diet. However, it did so to a greater extent under overt VAD. Dietary β-carotene also modified the taxonomic profile of the fecal microbiome, but only under VAD. Given the similarity of the VAD-associated intestinal phenotypes with those of several other disorders of the gut, collectively known as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Syndrome, these findings are broadly relevant to the effort of developing diet-based intervention strategies to ameliorate intestinal pathological conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  cEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development  cNIH  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3acytokines 3adiet 3adysbiosis 3ainflammation 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amice 3amicrobiome 3areactive oxygen species 3avitamin A 3avitamin A deficiency 0aIntestine 0aβ-carotene 0aRetinoids1 aMalta, Kiana1 aEricsson, Aaron1 aHolloway, Chelsee1 aKim, Youn-Kyung1 aHämmerling, Ulrich,1 aQuadro, Loredana0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2022 May, v. 1867, no. 5 p.159122-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2022.1591223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01613naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245007800172300001600250520061100266592002800877650001500905650001300920650001100933650000900944650002000953650002500973650001600998650001201014700002301026700002201049773011401071856008101185852000901266655001201275IND60133408020221122034351.0150520e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013340802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10651-014-0295-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aḤusaynī, Riz̤ā,10aNon-linear time-varying stochastic models for agroclimate risk assessment  ap. 227-246.  aThis work develops a model for minimum temperature in order to assess the weather related risk in agriculture industry.

The aim of this study was to determine FA, PL, and GD compositional changes in human milk (HM) during lactation in a large group of Chinese lactating mothers (540 volunteers) residing in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Suzhou. HM samples were collected after full expression from one breast and while the baby was fed on the other breast. FA were assessed by direct methylation followed by gas chromatography (GC) analysis. PL and GD were extracted using chloroform and methanol. A methodology employing liquid chromatography coupled with an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) and with time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry was used to quantify PL and GD classes in HM, respectively. Saturated FA (SFA), mono-unsaturated FA (MUFA), and PL content decreased during lactation, while polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) and GD content increased. Among different cities, over the lactation time, HM from Beijing showed the highest SFA content, HM from Guangzhou the highest MUFA content and HM from Suzhou the highest n-3PUFA content. The highest total PL and GD contents were observed in HM from Suzhou. In order to investigate the influence of the diet on maternal milk composition, a careful analyses of dietary habits of these population needs to be performed in the future.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreast milk 3abreasts 3achloroform 3acities 3adiet 3aeating habits 3agangliosides 3agas chromatography 3ainfant growth 3ainflammation 3alactating women 3alactation 3alight scattering 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3amethylation 3amilk fat 3amothers 3aphospholipids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3atemporal variation 3avolunteers 3aChina1 aCruz-Hernandez, Cristina1 aBertschy, Emmanuelle1 aFontannaz, Patric1 aMasserey Elmelegy, Isabelle1 aTavazzi, Isabelle1 aMarmet, Cynthia1 aSanchez-Bridge, Belén1 aThakkar, Sagar K.1 aDe Castro, Carlos Antonio1 aVinyes-Pares, Gerard1 aZhang, Yumei1 aWang, Peiyu0 tNutrients.g2016 Nov. 10, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu81107153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04189naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001200188245011200200300001000312506007600322520239200398592002802790506003702818650001102855650001302866650002502879650001202904650001202916650001602928650000902944650001802953650001402971650000902985650001102994650001003005650001203015650002303027650001603050650002803066650001303094650001903107650000703126650002203133650004303155650001803198650002303216650002503239700001703264700001203281700001903293700001603312700001803328700001503346773011203361856008103473852000903554655001203563IND60548667720221207115631.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054866772DNAL7 a10.1186/s40104-015-0057-52doi7 aPMC47144472pmcid7 a267793402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Tao10aEffect of supplementation of allicin on methanogenesis and ruminal microbial flora in Dorper crossbred ewes  ap. 1.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Garlic extracts have been reported to be effective in reducing methanogenesis. Related mechanisms are not well illustrated, however, and most studies have been conducted in vitro. This study investigates the effects of supplementary allicin (AL) in sheep diet on in vivo digestibility, rumen fermentation, and shifts of microbial flora. METHODS: Two experiments were conducted using Dorper × thin-tailed Han crossbred ewes. In experiment 1, eighteen ewes (60.0 ± 1.73 kg BW) were randomly assigned for 29 days to either of two dietary treatments: a basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with 2.0 g AL/head·day to investigate supplementary AL on nutrient digestibility and methane emissions. In experiment 2, six ewes (65.2 ± 2.0 kg BW) with ruminal canulas were assigned to the same two dietary treatments as in experiment 1 for 42 days to investigate supplementary AL on ruminal fermentation and microbial flora. The methane emissions were determined using an open-circuit respirometry system and microbial assessment was done by qPCR of 16S rRNA genes. RESULTS: Supplementary AL increased the apparent digestibility of organic matter (P < 0.001), nitrogen (P = 0.006), neutral detergent fiber (P < 0.001), and acid detergent fiber (P = 0.002). Fecal nitrogen output was reduced (P = 0.001) but urinary nitrogen output was unaffected (P = 0.691), while nitrogen retention (P = 0.077) and nitrogen retention/nitrogen intake (P = 0.077) tended to increase. Supplementary AL decreased methane emissions scaled to metabolic bodyweight by 5.95 % (P = 0.007) and to digestible organic matter intake by 8.36 % (P = 0.009). Ruminal pH was unaffected (P = 0.601) while ammonia decreased (P = 0.024) and total volatile fatty acids increased (P = 0.024) in response to supplementary AL. Supplementary AL decreased the population of methanogens (P = 0.001) and tended to decrease that of protozoans (P = 0.097), but increased the populations of F. succinogenes (P < 0.001), R. flavefaciens (P = 0.001), and B. fibrisolvens (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of AL at 2.0 g/head·day effectively enhanced OM, N, NDF, and ADF digestibility and reduced daily methane emissions (L/kg BW⁰.⁷⁵) in ewes, probably by decreasing the population of ruminal protozoans and methanogens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDorper 3aProtozoa 3aacid detergent fiber 3aallicin 3aammonia 3abody weight 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aemissions 3aewes 3agarlic 3agenes 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3apH 3apopulation growth 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3arumen fermentation 3avolatile fatty acids1 aChen, Dandan1 aTu, Yan1 aZhang, Naifeng1 aSi, Bingwen1 aDeng, Kaidong1 aDiao, Qiyu0 tJournal of animal science and biotechnology.g2016 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.1-1dBioMed Centralx2049-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40104-015-0057-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008500167300001800252520100700270592002801277650001201305650001001317650002201327650000901349650001901358650001101377650001801388650001001406650001901416650001901435650002301454650002301477650001501500653001501515653001901530653002401549653002101573700001801594700001501612700002101627773013001648856008101778852000901859655001201868IND60540094720221118135657.0190318e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054009472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2015.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManninen, Hanna10aMeasuring the green color of vegetables from digital images using image analysis  ap. 1184-1190.  aWhen analyzing the color of foods, a measurement device consisting of a digital camera and image analysis software is an attractive alternative to traditional instruments such as spectrophotometers, colorimeters and sensory evaluations.

Therefore, it is increasingly significant to develop an effective model for PM2.5 forecasting and warnings that informs people to foresee the air quality. People can reduce outdoor activities and take preventive measures if they know the air quality is bad ahead of time. In addition, reliable forecasting results can remind the relevant departments to control and reduce pollutants discharge. According to our knowledge, the current hybrid forecasting techniques of PM2.5 do not take the meteorological factors into consideration. Actually, meteorological factors affect the concentrations of air pollution, but it is unclear whether meteorological factors are helpful for improving the PM2.5 forecasting results or not. This paper proposes a hybrid model called CEEMD-PSOGSA-SVR-GRNN, based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm (PSOGSA), support vector regression (SVR), generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and grey correlation analysis (GCA), for the daily PM2.5 concentrations forecasting. The main steps of proposed model are described as follows: the original PM2.5 data decomposition with CEEMD, optimal SVR selection with PSOGCA, meteorological factors selection with GCA, residual revision by GRNN and forecasting results analysis. Three cities (Chongqing, Harbin and Jinan) in China with different characteristics of climate, terrain and pollution sources are selected to verify the effectiveness of proposed model, and CEEMD-PSOGSA-SVR*, EEMD-PSOGSA-SVR, PSOGSA-SVR, CEEMD-PSO-SVR, CEEMD-GSA-SVR, CEEMD-GWO-SVR are considered to be compared models. The experimental results show that the hybrid CEEMD-PSOGSA-SVR-GRNN model outperforms other six compared models. Therefore, the proposed CEEMD-PSOGSA-SVR-GRNN model can be used to develop air quality forecasting and warnings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aalgorithms 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acities 3aclimate 3alandscapes 3ameteorological parameters 3amodels 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3apollution control 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aChina 0aPM2.5 concentrations 0aSupport vector regression 0aGrey correlation analysis 0aParticle swarm optimization 0aGravitational search algorithm1 aLian, Xiuyuan1 aWei, Lin1 aChe, Jinxing1 aShen, Xiping1 aYang, Ling1 aQiu, Xuanlin1 aLiu, Xiaoning1 aGao, Wenlong1 aRen, Xiaowei1 aLi, Juansheng0 tAtmospheric environment.g2018 June, v. 183 p.20-32dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100003500169245009700204300001600301520168300317592002802000650002202028650001502050650002002065650005002085650001302135650002102148650002902169650004002198650004102238650002102279650003102300650004902331650001302380650001502393650002102408653003202429653001202461653001502473653000902488653002102497653002302518700002402541700002102565773012802586856005102714852000902765655001202774IND50076411720221118060418.0140410e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007641172DNAL7 a222428672pmid7 a10.1080/10934529.2012.6402432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilczyńska-Piliszek, Agata J.10aQSAR and ANN for the estimation of water solubility of 209 polychlorinated trans-azobenzenes  ap. 155-166.  aPolychlorinated trans-azobenzenes (PCt-ABs) are less studied a highly toxic impurity in 2,3-dichloroaniline (2,3-D) and some herbicides and are compounds of environmental relevance lacking experimental physical and chemical properties data. In this study, to fulfill gaps on environmentally relevant partitioning properties of PCABs, the values of water solubility (μg/L and log S) have been determined for 209 congeners of chloro-trans-azobenzene (Ct-AB) by means of quantitative structure - property relationship (QSPR) approach and artificial neural networks (ANN) predictive ability. The quantitative structure - property relationship (QSPR) approach used based on geometry optimalization and quantum-chemical structural descriptors, which were computed on the level of density functional theory (DFT) using B3LYP functional and 6-311++G** basis set in Gaussian 03 and the semi-empirical quantum chemistry method for property parameterization (PM6) in the molecular orbital package (MOPAC) software. The predicted solubility of PCt-ABs by PM6 and DFT models and depending on a congener within a homologue class varied between 1995-11481 and 5370-15135 μg/L for mono-; 170-5495 and 138-9332 μg/L for di-; 36-1950 and 209-5248 μg/L for tri-; 15-794 and 41-3715 μg/L for tetra-; 5.5-209 and 39-1259 μg/L for penta-; 1.8-98 and 3.5-1096 μg/L for hexa-; 1.5-34 and 4.7-214 μg/L for hepta-; 0.71-6.2 and 0.76–26 μg/L for octa-; 0.83-1.7 and 0.69-1.2 μg/L for nonaCt-ABs; and between 0.36 and 0.04 μg/L for decaCt-AB, respectively. The calculations by PM6 were highly efficient and inexpensive compared to these by DFT, while both models gave data of similar accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aherbicides 3aneural networks 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3atoxicity 3awater solubility 2aAzo Compoundsxchemistry 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxchemistry 2aHydrocarbons, Chlorinatedxchemistry 2aModels, Chemical 2aNeural Networks, Computer. 2aQuantitative Structure-Activity Relationship 2aSoftware 2aSolubility 2aWaterxchemistry 0aPolychlorinated azobenzenes 0aPCt-ABs 0aherbicides 0aPOPs 0awater solubility 0aenvironmental fate1 aPiliszek, Sławomir1 aFalandysz, Jerzy0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 47, no. 2 p.155-166dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2012.640243  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009000160500001400250520126400264592002801528650002301556650005201579650002401631650001101655650002401666650001301690650002701703650002901730650001701759650001501776700002401791700002201815773012201837856007301959852000902032655001202041IND60721808920221121031236.0201224e20201130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072180892DNAL7 a10.3390/v121213672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPucci, Fabrizio 10aModeling the Molecular Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Infection on the Renin-Angiotensin System  aNAL-light  aSARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by the binding of its spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which plays a pivotal role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The study of RAS dysregulation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection is fundamentally important for a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and risk factors associated with COVID-19 coronavirus disease and to design effective therapeutic strategies. In this context, we developed a mathematical model of RAS based on data regarding protein and peptide concentrations; the model was tested on clinical data from healthy normotensive and hypertensive individuals. We used our model to analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RAS, which we modeled through a downregulation of ACE2 as a function of viral load. We also used it to predict the effect of RAS-targeting drugs, such as RAS-blockers, human recombinant ACE2, and angiotensin 1–7 peptide, on COVID-19 patients; the model predicted an improvement of the clinical outcome for some drugs and a worsening for others. Our model and its predictions constitute a valuable framework for in silico testing of hypotheses about the COVID-19 pathogenic mechanisms and the effect of drugs aiming to restore RAS functionality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3acomputer simulation 3ahumans 3amathematical models 3apeptides 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3arenin-angiotensin system 3atherapeutics 3aviral load1 aBogaerts, Philippe 1 aRooman, Marianne 0 tViruses.g2020 Nov. 30, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v121213673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007100170520164800241592002801889650001801917650001401935650001901949650001601968650001101984650001501995650001902010650002302029650001402052650001902066650001402085650001202099650002202111650001402133650001402147650001702161650002102178653000702199653000802206653000902214653000702223653000702230653000902237653000802246653002102254653001102275653000802286653004502294653000902339700001702348700001902365700002402384700001902408700002102427700002002448773011902468856008502587852000902672655001202681IND60767255020221119102645.0220222e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076725502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2022.1591242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Aashiq10aAttenuation of obesity-induced hyperlipidemia reduces tumor growth  aAccumulating evidence suggests that hyperlipidemia is associated with obesity and cancer mortality in humans. We tested the hypotheses that inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) would attenuate obesity-induced hyperlipidemia and reduce tumor growth by treating BCR-ABL B cell tumor-bearing hyperlipidemic obese ob/ob obese mice with a MTP inhibitor. MTP inhibition in tumor-bearing mice reduced concentrations of plasma apoB100 5-fold together with a corresponding decrease in VLDL triacylglycerol (TG) and cholesterol. Inhibition of MTP decreased tumor volume by 50%. MTP inhibitor did not alter tumor cell viability in vitro, suggesting that the in vivo tumor shrinkage effect was related to altered circulating lipids. Tumor volume reduction occurred without change in the protein expression of LDLR, FASN and HMGCR in the tumor, suggesting a lack of compensatory mechanisms in response to decreased hyperlipidemia. Expression of genes encoding GLUT4 and PEPCK was increased 6- and 10-fold, respectively, but no change in the expression of genes encoding regulatory enzymes of glycolysis was observed, suggesting that the tumors were not dependent on or switching to carbohydrates for energy requirement to support their growth. No change of proliferative signaling PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways after MTP inhibition was observed in the tumors. In conclusion, MTP inhibition decreased dyslipidemia and tumor growth in obese, insulin resistant mice. Therefore, decreasing VLDL secretion could be further explored as an adjuvant therapeutic intervention together with standard care to reduce tumor growth in obese patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aadjuvants 3acell viability 3acholesterol 3aenergy 3aglycolysis 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainsulin resistance 3amortality 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aobesity 3aprotein synthesis 3asecretion 3ashrinkage 3atherapeutics 3atriacylglycerols 0aCE 0aMTP 0aLDLR 0aTC 0aTG 0aTPBC 0aWAT 0aApolipoprotein B 0acancer 0aLDL 0aMicrosomal triglyceride transfer protein 0aVLDL1 aLian, Jihong1 aWatts, Russell1 aGutiérrez, Tomás,1 aNelson, Randal1 aGoping, Ing Swie1 aLehner, Richard0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2022 Apr., v. 1867, no. 4 p.159124-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2022.1591243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245012800202506007600330520143100406592002801837506003701865650001601902650001801918650001401936650001101950650001501961650001901976650001901995650002402014700002102038700002202059700001502081700002202096773012202118856007302240852000902313655001202322IND60650076220221207125327.0190709e20161110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065007622DNAL7 a10.3390/nu81107162doi7 aPMC51331022pmcid7 a278349012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiederichs, Tanja10aRelevance of Morning and Evening Energy and Macronutrient Intake during Childhood for Body Composition in Early Adolescence  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a(1) Background: This study investigated the relevance of morning and evening energy and macronutrient intake during childhood for body composition in early adolescence; (2) Methods: Analyses were based on data from 372 DONALD (DOrtmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed study) participants. Explorative life-course plots were performed to examine whether morning or evening energy and macronutrient intake at 3/4 years, 5/6 years, or 7/8 years is critical for fat mass index (FMI [kg/m2]) and fat free mass index (FFMI [kg/m2]) in early adolescence (10/11 years). Subsequently, exposures in periods identified as consistently critical were examined in depth using adjusted regression models; (3) Results: Life-course plots identified morning fat and carbohydrate (CHO) intake at 3/4 years and 7/8 years as well as changes in these intakes between 3/4 years and 7/8 years as potentially critical for FMI at 10/11 years. Adjusted regression models corroborated higher FMI values at 10/11 years among those who had consumed less fat (p = 0.01) and more CHO (p = 0.01) in the morning at 7/8 years as well as among those who had decreased their morning fat intake (p = 0.02) and increased their morning CHO intake (p = 0.05) between 3/4 years and 7/8 years; (4) Conclusion: During childhood, adherence to a low fat, high CHO intake in the morning may have unfavorable consequences for FMI in early adolescence.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescence 3acarbohydrates 3achildhood 3aenergy 3afat intake 3afat mass index 3alean body mass 3aregression analysis1 aRossbach, Sarah,1 aHerder, Christian1 aAlexy, Ute1 aBuyken, Anette E.0 tNutrients.g2016 Nov. 10, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu81107163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245011200204300001100316500001100327506007600338520178500414592002802199506003702227650001802264650001802282650001102300650002502311650001002336650001102346650001102357650003502368650001302403650000902416650001202425650001702437650002202454650001002476650001802486650001002504650002602514650002302540700001502563700001402578773011402592856008102706852000902787655001202796IND60548667820221207115716.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054866782DNAL7 a10.1186/s40104-016-0070-32doi7 aPMC47611552pmcid7 a269004662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgorevc, J.10aCellular reprogramming in farm animals: an overview of iPSC generation in the mammalian farm animal species  ap. 10.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEstablishment of embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines has been successful in mouse and human, but not in farm animals. Development of direct reprogramming technology offers an alternative approach for generation of pluripotent stem cells, applicable also in farm animals. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent practically limitless, ethically acceptable, individuum-specific source of pluripotent cells that can be generated from different types of somatic cells. iPSCs can differentiate to all cell types of an organism’s body and have a tremendous potential for numerous applications in medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. However, molecular mechanisms behind the reprogramming process remain largely unknown and hamper generation of bona fide iPSCs and their use in human clinical practice. Large animal models are essential to expand the knowledge obtained on rodents and facilitate development and validation of transplantation therapies in preclinical studies. Additionally, transgenic animals with special traits could be generated from genetically modified pluripotent cells, using advanced reproduction techniques. Despite their applicative potential, it seems that iPSCs in farm animals haven’t received the deserved attention. The aim of this review was to provide a systematic overview on iPSC generation in the most important mammalian farm animal species (cattle, pig, horse, sheep, goat, and rabbit), compare protein sequence similarity of pluripotency-related transcription factors in different species, and discuss potential uses of farm animal iPSCs. Literature mining revealed 32 studies, describing iPSC generation in pig (13 studies), cattle (5), horse (5), sheep (4), goat (3), and rabbit (2) that are summarized in a concise, tabular format.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3abiotechnology 3acattle 3aembryonic stem cells 3agoats 3ahorses 3ahumans 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3amedicine 3amice 3arabbits 3areproduction 3asequence homology 3asheep 3asomatic cells 3aswine 3atranscription factors 3atransgenic animals1 aOrehek, S.1 aDovč, P.0 tJournal of animal science and biotechnology.g2016 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.10-10dBioMed Centralx2049-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40104-016-0070-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245012400187300001600311520124100327592002801568650001701596650001201613650000801625650001701633650002301650650001701673650004301690650001301733650001501746650002301761650002701784650002201811650002901833650002801862650002401890650005001914650003801964650002702002650001302029650003202042650003102074650003102105650001602136650001702152650004102169650001402210653002302224653003302247653002302280653000902303700002502312700002502337700003002362773012802392856005102520852000902571655001202580IND50076411820221118060552.0140410e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007641182DNAL7 a222428682pmid7 a10.1080/10934529.2012.6402442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBunkoed, Opas12aA simple and high collection efficiency sampling method for monitoring of carbonyl compounds in a workplace environment  ap. 167-175.  aA simple and high collection efficiency sampling method was developed for the monitoring of carbonyl compounds, i.e., formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, acetone and butanone. The determination is based on the reaction of these compounds in a sensitive absorbing solution of 2,4–DNPH. After the completion of the reaction the derivatives were analyzed by the HPLC system without any post sample preparation. The operation conditions of the proposed method were optimized to obtain the highest sampling efficiency within a short analysis time. The collection efficiency for all compounds was in the range of 95 ± 3 % to 99 ± 4 % and the relative standard deviations (n = 15) were less than 10 %. This method was validated and applied to monitor carbonyl compounds in air samples from an occupational environment, the adhesive industry. Formaldehyde was found to be the most abundant carbonyl compound (64 ± 8 to 250 ± 20 ppbv), followed by acetaldehyde (ND to 24 ± 6 ppbv), acetone (ND to 21 ± 5 ppbv) and benzaldehyde (ND to 27 ± 7 ppbv). The sampling of air directly into the absorbing solution was compared with the conventional method of using an adsorbent cartridge, and the results were in good agreement (P > 0.05).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetone 3aair 3abenzaldehyde 3acarbonyl compounds 3aformaldehyde 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aindustry 3amonitoring 3aworking conditions 2aAcetaldehydexanalysis 2aAcetonexanalysis 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aBenzaldehydesxanalysis 2aButanonesxanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFormaldehydexanalysis 2aIndustry 2aPhenylhydrazinesxchemistry 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSpecimen Handlingxmethods 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxanalysis 2aWorkplace 0aCarbonyl compounds 0a2,4–dinitrophenylhydrazine 0aabsorbing solution 0aHPLC1 aThavarungkul, Panote1 aThammakhet, Chongdee1 aKanatharana, Proespichaya0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 47, no. 2 p.167-175dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2012.640244  aDNAL 7aarticle01985naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245014500158500001400303520085100317592002801168650002501196650003401221650001001255650002001265650001201285650001101297650001701308650001701325650001201342700002201354700002101376700002201397773012201419856007301541852000901614655001201623IND60721809020221122003247.0201224e20201130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072180902DNAL7 a10.3390/v121213682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoftsi, Maria 10aBinding of CCCTC-Binding Factor (CTCF) to the Minute Virus of Mice Genome Is Important for Proper Processing of Viral P4-Generated Pre-mRNAs  aNAL-light  aSpecific chromatin immunoprecipitation of salt-fractionated infected cell extracts has demonstrated that the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a highly conserved, 11-zinc-finger DNA-binding protein with known roles in cellular and viral genome organization and gene expression, specifically binds the genome of Minute Virus of Mice (MVM). Mutations that diminish binding of CTCF to MVM affect processing of the P4-generated pre-mRNAs. These RNAs are spliced less efficiently to generate the R1 mRNA, and definition of the NS2-specific exon upstream of the small intron is reduced, leading to relatively less R2 and the generation of a novel exon-skipped product. These results suggest a model in which CTCF is required for proper engagement of the spliceosome at the MVM small intron and for the first steps of processing of the P4-generated pre-mRNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-binding proteins 3achromatin immunoprecipitation 3aexons 3agene expression 3aintrons 3amodels 3aspliceosomes 3aviral genome 3aviruses1 aMajumder, Kinjal 1 aBurger, Lisa  R.1 aPintel, David  J.0 tViruses.g2020 Nov. 30, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v121213683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012200164300001600286520184600302592002802148650001802176650001102194650002302205650002902228650002802257650002402285650001302309650001802322650001502340650002102355650002302376650001502399650001702414650001202431651001602443700001802459700002302477700002502500773013402525856008102659852000902740655001202749IND60133408420221122044736.0150520e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013340842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10651-014-0300-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lixun10aEstimating daily nitrogen dioxide level: application of a longitudinal model with spatially-correlated random effects  ap. 329-344.  aTypically available nitrogen dioxide (NO 2  ) measurements are either spatially representative but temporally sparse or temporally representative but spatially sparse. This article illustrates an approach for making use of the strengths of these two types of data to obtain pollution estimates that are representative both spatially and temporally. The model uses three data sources: a Connecticut epidemiological study with average monthly NO 2   measurements at 651 sites in each season for 1 year; hourly measurements at four Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sites; and, geospatial data on traffic volume, population density, elevation, and land use. We start by establishing a relationship between observations from the epidemiological study and those at the EPA sites at the monthly level. This relationship is assumed to hold for daily NO 2   levels, enabling us to estimate average daily NO 2   levels using EPA data. Validation study confirmed that this assumption is sound and that the method performs best among three alternatives: a linear model, a mixed-effects model, and the proposed mix-effects model that takes into account spatial correlation. The model can provide predictions of daily NO 2   levels at both study sites and random sites that have no measurements at all. Application of this approach provides pollution estimates that make it possible to study short term relationships between NO 2   exposure and respiratory symptoms such as asthma severity. The approach also offers significant cost reduction for future studies of higher temporal/spatial resolution of air pollution levels by making effective use of readily available EPA monitoring site measurements and observations at spatially dispersed sites from epidemiological studies. The model is implemented under the Bayes framework with a Gibbs sampler.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aasthma 3acost effectiveness 3aenvironmental protection 3aepidemiological studies 3ainhalation exposure 3aland use 3alinear models 3amonitoring 3anitrogen dioxide 3apopulation density 3aprediction 3aspatial data 3atraffic 3aConnecticut1 aGuan, Yongtao1 aLeaderer, Brian P.1 aHolford, Theodore R.0 tEnvironmental and ecological statistics.g2015 June, v. 22, no. 2 p.329-344dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl3870051x1352-85057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10651-014-0300-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03433naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245006900171300001400240520159500254592002801849650001301877650002601890650001901916650001501935650001501950650001301965650001401978650001701992650001902009650000902028650001302037650002002050650001302070650002802083650002102111650002002132650002202152650002702174650001902201650001602220653002402236653001902260653001902279653001902298653002302317653002002340700001702360700005802377700002102435700005802456700005902514700006002573773010202633856008702735852000902822655001202831IND60633147020221119182904.0190529e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063314702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeng, Samantha10aDeliquescence behavior of photo-irradiated single NaNO3 droplets  ap. 33-39.  aNitrate-containing particles are ubiquitous in the troposphere because of their secondary production due to anthropogenic emissions of NOx from the combustion of fossil fuels. Nitrate ions are recognized as photoactive species that may contribute to the formation of oxidants in the atmosphere through heterogeneous photochemical reactions. The chemical transformation of aerosol particles in the atmosphere often leads to modification of the particles’ hygroscopic properties. Although the photo-transformation of nitrate ions into nitrite within aerosol particles has been investigated, the influence of the photoproducts formation on the hygroscopic behavior of particles has not been reported. In this study, we examined the hygroscopic properties of single, ultraviolet-irradiated NaNO3 droplets using Raman microspectrometry. We are the first demonstrated that irradiating NaNO3 particles affects their hygroscopic behavior. For short-term exposures, regarding hygroscopic behavior, the irradiated particles exhibited two-stage transitions that were clearly reproduced in the experimental NaNO3-NaNO2 phase diagram. The production of NO2− decreased the deliquescence relative humidity values. For long irradiation times (>5 h), these values are even more affected by the additional production of peroxynitrite and carbonate ions in individual droplets. The NaNO3-NaNO2 deliquescence phase diagram cannot explain the hygroscopic behavior of long-term irradiated particles. Finally, we demonstrated the influence that CO2 has on the photo-transformation process in NaNO3 droplets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3acombustion 3adroplets 3aemissions 3afossil fuels 3ahygroscopicity 3aions 3anitrites 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxidants 3aphotochemical reactions 3aphotoirradiation 3aphysical phases 3arelative humidity 3asecondary productivity 3asodium nitrate 3atroposphere 0aAtmospheric aerosol 0aSodium nitrate 0aPhotochemistry 0aHygroscopicity 0aRaman spectroscopy 0aSingle particle1 aGuo, Fangqin1 aTobon, Yeny A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1858-82711 aIshikawa, Tomoki1 aMoreau, Myriam1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4720-49941 aIshizaka, Shoji1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9866-58091 aSobanska, Sophie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3264-39380 tAtmospheric environment.g2018 June, v. 183 p.33-39dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013500168300001600303520112700319592002801446650001201474650001601486650002201502650001801524650002501542650001801567650001101585650001701596653001601613653002601629653003301655653002501688653001701713700001301730700001501743700001801758700001701776700001501793700001901808700001901827773011301846856008601959852000902045655001202054IND50060487620221116215918.0190408e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006048762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhi-Hua10aEffects of biomass particle size on steam explosion pretreatment performance for improving the enzyme digestibility of corn stover  ap. 176-184.  aSize reduction is an essential process for corn stover biomass utilization. Effects of biomass particle size on the efficiency of pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis are systematically investigated in the present study. Sugar recoveries and conversions of the biomass with particle sizes at 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5cm were compared. The highest sugar recovery reached 99.6% for glucan and 67.0% for xylan at the particle size of 1.0 and 0.5cm, respectively, but the highest sugar conversion (100% for glucan and 83% for xylan) was observed at the particle size of 2.5cm. The enzymatic hydrolysis rate and conversion of pretreated biomass obviously increased with increasing biomass particle size. With increase of biomass particle size, the specific surface area of pretreated biomass significantly increased and the crystallinity index of pretreated biomass apparently decreased. In studied extent of particle sizes, the utilization of larger biomass particles would be desirable to achieve the high pretreatment efficiency and hence improve subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis performance compared with the smaller ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acorn stover 3acrystal structure 3adigestibility 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aparticle size 3asugars 3asurface area 0aCorn stover 0aBiomass particle size 0aSteam explosion pretreatment 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aMass balance1 aQin, Lei1 aPang, Feng1 aJin, Ming-Jie1 aLi, Bing-Zhi1 aKang, Yong1 aDale, Bruce E.1 aYuan, Ying-Jin0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2013 Jan., v. 44 p.176-184dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001500188245012600203300001100329506007600340520169000416592002802106596007802134596006302212596006002275596006402335506003702399650001302436650002602449650000902475650001702484650002002501650003402521650001802555650002002573650001602593650001402609650002802623650002402651650001802675650002402693650003502717650003102752700001402783700001902797700001502816700001902831700001802850700001902868773012202887856008103009852000903090655001203099IND60591967920221207060831.0191123e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059196792DNAL7 a295760142pmid7 aPMC58680762pmcid7 a10.1186/s12711-018-0383-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNing, Chao10aEigen decomposition expedites longitudinal genome-wide association studies for milk production traits in Chinese Holstein  ap. 12.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Pseudo-phenotypes, such as 305-day yields, estimated breeding values or deregressed proofs, are usually used as response variables for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of milk production traits in dairy cattle. Computational inefficiency challenges the direct use of test-day records for longitudinal GWAS with large datasets. RESULTS: We propose a rapid longitudinal GWAS method that is based on a random regression model. Our method uses Eigen decomposition of the phenotypic covariance matrix to rotate the data, thereby transforming the complex mixed linear model into weighted least squares analysis. We performed a simulation study that showed that our method can control type I errors well and has higher power than a longitudinal GWAS method that does not include time-varied additive genetic effects. We also applied our method to the analysis of milk production traits in the first three parities of 6711 Chinese Holstein cows. The analysis for each trait was completed within 1 day with known variances. In total, we located 84 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of which 65 were within previously reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our rapid method can control type I errors in the analysis of longitudinal data and can be applied to other longitudinal traits. We detected QTL that were for the most part similar to those reported in a previous study in Chinese Holstein. Moreover, six additional SNPs for fat percentage and 13 SNPs for protein percentage were identified by our method. These additional 19 SNPs could be new candidate quantitative trait nucleotides for milk production traits in Chinese Holstein.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014ZX0800953BcNational Major Development Program of Transgenic Breeding  a31661143013cNational Natural Science Foundations of China  a31702091cNational Natural Science Foundations of China  aIRT_15R62cChangjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3aadditive gene effects 3acows 3adairy cattle 3adata collection 3agenome-wide association study 3alinear models 3amilk production 3anucleotides 3aphenotype 3aquantitative trait loci 3aquantitative traits 3arapid methods 3aregression analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3avariance covariance matrix1 aWang, Dan1 aZheng, Xianrui1 aZhang, Qin1 aZhang, Shengli1 aMrode, R.

The main goal of this study was to identify a deconvolving method so as to characterize variability in local, neighbourhood and regional background concentration signals. This method was validated by examining how traffic-related and non-traffic-related sources influenced the different signals.Sampling with a mobile monitoring platform was conducted across the Greater Toronto Area over a seven-day period during summer 2015. This mobile monitoring platform was equipped with instruments for measuring a wide range of pollutants at time resolutions of 1 s (ultrafine particles, black carbon) to 20 s (nitric oxide, nitrogen oxides). The monitored neighbourhoods were selected based on their land use categories (e.g. industrial, commercial, parks and residential areas). The high time-resolution data allowed pollutant concentrations to be separated into signals representing background and local concentrations. The background signals were determined using a spline of minimums; local signals were derived by subtracting the background concentration from the total concentration.Our study showed that temporal scales of 500 s and 2400 s were associated with the neighbourhood and regional background signals respectively. The percent contribution of the pollutant concentration that was attributed to local signals was highest for nitric oxide (NO) (37–95%) and lowest for ultrafine particles (9–58%); the ultrafine particles were predominantly regional (32–87%) in origin on these days. Local concentrations showed stronger associations than total concentrations with traffic intensity in a 100 m buffer (ρ:0.21–0.44). The neighbourhood scale signal also showed stronger associations with industrial facilities than the total concentrations. Given that the signals show stronger associations with different land use suggests that resolving the ambient concentrations differentiates which emission sources drive the variability in each signal. The benefit of this deconvolution method is that it may reduce exposure misclassification when coupled with predictive models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon 3acities 3aland use 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anitric oxide 3aparks 3aparticulate emissions 3apollutants 3aresidential areas 3asummer 3atraffic 0aMobile sampling 0aNeighbourhood background signal 0aBlack carbon 0aUltrafine particles 0aNitrogen oxides 0aLand use emissions1 aJeong, Cheol-Heon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6000-28231 aWang, Jonathan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7221-19641 aEvans, Greg J.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2018 June, v. 183 p.57-68dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013100162300001300293520127700306592002801583650004401611650002201655650001501677650001501692650002201707650001501729650003701744650001901781650002001800650001201820650001501832650001101847650000701858650001201865650003401877650003301911650001101944650002301955650001601978650001501994653001202009653002302021653001502044653002702059653001602086700001802102700001302120700001602133700001602149700001502165773012102180856008202301852000902383655001202392IND60628868620221122190257.0190131e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062886862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2017.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Shan10aSurface sodium lignosulphonate-immobilized sawdust particle as an efficient adsorbent for capturing Hg2+ from aqueous solution  ap. 9-17.  aIn this work, the soluble sodium lignosulphonate (LSNa) molecules were successfully grafted onto the surface of pine sawdust (PSD) particles to obtain an efficient adsorbent (PSD-LS) for removing Hg2+ from wastewater. In advance, the surface of sawdust particles were carboxymethylated by chloroacetic acid, the LSNa would be anchored on the surface by a heterogeneous esterification reaction occurred between the hydroxyl of LSNa and carboxyl on PSD surface. The resultant product (PSD-LS) exhibited a good adsorption performance for Hg2+ with adsorption capacity up to 164.77 mg/g and it was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray diffraction (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The effects of pH, contact time, adsorption temperature and initial concentration on the adsorption of Hg2+ were investigated. Results showed that the pseudo–second–order kinetics and Langmuir isotherm model could describe the adsorption process better. In addition, the composite adsorbent has outstanding reusability with high and stable desorption rates under several continuous cycle. These findings suggested that PSD-LS was a potential adsorbent to remove hazardous metal ions from wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3adesorption 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aesterification 3alignosulfonates 3amercury 3ametal ions 3amodels 3apH 3asawdust 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3awastewater 0aSawdust 0aGraft modification 0aAdsorption 0aSodium lignosulphonate 0aMercury ion1 aLuo, Tiantian1 aZhou, Qi1 aLuo, Wenjun1 aLi, Haifeng1 aJing, Luru0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 May 01, v. 517 p.9-17dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245012900189300001600318520113300334592002801467650001301495650002301508650001201531650003901543650001501582650001101597650002501608650001201633650003001645650003301675650004001708650002701748650001101775653002101786653002001807653001601827653001501843653002701858653000901885700002101894700001801915700001701933773012801950856005102078852000902129655001202138IND50076412120221118060628.0140410e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007641212DNAL7 a222428712pmid7 a10.1080/10934529.2012.6405562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiggin, Asli S.10aEffect of feeding regime and the sludge age on the fate of acetate and the microbial composition in sequencing batch reactor  ap. 192-203.  aThe study investigated the effects of the feeding regime on the substrate metabolism under aerobic conditions.

The microbial characterization studies showed that the feeding regime did not change the microbial composition as determined by the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, however did strongly affect the substrate utilization mechanism. Additionally, the same microbial culture was able to utilize acetate with or without poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) storage under pulse or continuous feeding, respectively. Conversely, the selected sludge ages induced significant changes in the microbial composition and floc structure, however, the well settling and bulking biomass selected at the sludge ages of eight days and two days, respectively, did not significantly affect the substrate utilization mechanism, where storage or growth prevailed as a result of either pulse or continuous feeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aaerobic conditions 3abiomass 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3ametabolism 3asludge 2aAcetatesxmetabolism 2aBiomass 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aHydroxybutyratesxmetabolism 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aPolyestersxmetabolism 2aSewage 0aActivated sludge 0aculture history 0aPHB storage 0asludge age 0amicrobial biodiversity 0aFISH1 aRossetti, Simona1 aMajone, Mauro1 aOrhon, Derin0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 47, no. 2 p.192-203dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2012.640556  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245008200206300001200288520208300300592002802383650001602411650001102427650001802438650001702456650001302473650000902486650001602495650001802511650001102529650002302540650001202563650001802575650001902593650001702612650001202629650001202641651001402653700002202667700003202689773010502721856008302826852000902909655001202918IND60712595520221117032940.0220630e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071259552DNAL7 a10.1186/s12937-020-00606-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoulding, Tara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5455-083114aThe affordability of a healthy and sustainable diet: an Australian case study  ap. 109.  aBACKGROUND/AIMS: EAT–Lancet Commission’s Planetary Health Diet proposed a diet that integrates nutrition and sustainability considerations, however its affordability is unknown in many country-specific contexts, including Australia. The aim of this study is to develop a healthy and sustainable food basket modelled on the Planetary Health Diet to determine the affordability of the Planetary Health Diet basket across various socio-economic groups, and compare this affordability with a food basket modelled on the typical current diet, in an Australian setting. METHODS: An Australian-specific Planetary Health Diet basket was developed for a reference household (2 adults and 2 children) modelled on the Planetary Health Diet reference diet, and compared to a previously-developed Typical Australian Diet basket. The cost of each food basket was determined by online supermarket shopping surveys in low, medium and high socio-economic areas in each Australian state. Basket affordability was determined for the reference household by comparing the basket cost to disposable income in each socio-economic group in each state. Mann-Whitney U tests then determined if there were significant differences between the median costs and the median affordability of both baskets. RESULTS: The Planetary Health Diet basket was shown to be less expensive and more affordable than the Typical Australian Diet basket nationally, in all metropolitan areas, in all socio-economic groups across Australia (median cost: Planetary Health Diet = AUD$188.21, Typical Australian Diet = AUD$224.36; median affordability: Planetary Health Diet = 13%, Typical Australian Diet = 16%; p = < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the Planetary Health Diet to be more affordable than the Typical Australian Diet for metropolitan-dwelling Australians. IMPLICATIONS: These results can help to inform public health and food policy aimed at achieving a healthy and sustainable future for all Australians, including reductions in overweight/obesity rates and increased food security.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAustralians 3aadults 3aaffordability 3acase studies 3achildren 3adiet 3afood policy 3afood security 3aincome 3ametropolitan areas 3aobesity 3apublic health 3asocioeconomics 3asupermarkets 3asurveys 3atesting 3aAustralia1 aLindberg, Rebecca1 aRussell, Catherine Georgina0 tNutrition journal.g2020 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.109-109dBioMed CentralwJournal:2170x1475-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12937-020-00606-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02122naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009900172300001600271520107800287592002801365650001701393650001501410650001101425650001501436650001001451650001501461650001501476651001101491700001901502700002301521700002401544773011401568856008101682852000901763655001201772IND60133408720221122054655.0150520e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013340872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10651-014-0303-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Eliane R.12aA non-homogeneous poisson model with spatial anisotropy applied to ozone data from Mexico City  ap. 393-422.  aIn this work we consider a non-homogenous Poisson model to study the behaviour of the number of times that a pollutant’s concentration surpasses a given threshold of interest. Spatial dependence is imposed on the parameters of the Poisson intensity function in order to account for the possible correlation between measurements in different sites. An anisotropic model is used due to the nature of the region of interest. Estimation of the parameters of the model is performed using the Bayesian point of view via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. We also consider prediction of the days in which exceedances of the threshold might occur at sites where measurements cannot be taken. This is obtained by spatial interpolation using the information provided by the sites where measurements are available. The prediction procedure allows for estimation of the behaviour of the mean function of the non-homogeneous Poisson process associated with those sites. The models considered here are applied to ozone data obtained from the monitoring network of Mexico City.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aalgorithms 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aozone 3apollutants 3aprediction 3aMexico1 aGamerman, Dani1 aTarumoto, Mario H.1 aTzintzun, Guadalupe0 tEnvironmental and ecological statistics.g2015 June, v. 22, no. 2 p.393-422dSpringer-Verlagx1352-85057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10651-014-0303-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002600180245011200206506007600318520139100394592002801785506003701813650002501850650001501875650001901890650001801909650001301927650001201940650001701952650001301969650001501982650001601997650001202013650001402025650001302039700002902052700002102081700002902102700002102131700002602152773012202178856007302300852000902373655001202382IND60650076620221207125414.0190709e20161111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065007662DNAL7 a10.3390/nu81107192doi7 aPMC51331052pmcid7 a278457042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoelho, Wagner Santos10aInvestigating the Cellular and Metabolic Responses of World-Class Canoeists Training: A Sportomics Approach  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a(1) Background: We have been using the Sportomics approach to evaluate biochemical and hematological changes in response to exercise. The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic and hematologic responses of world-class canoeists during a training session; (2) Methods: Blood samples were taken at different points and analyzed for their hematological properties, activities of selected enzymes, hormones, and metabolites; (3) Results: Muscle stress biomarkers were elevated in response to exercise which correlated with modifications in the profile of white blood cells, where a leukocyte rise was observed after the canoe session. These results were accompanied by an increase in other exercise intensity parameters such as lactatemia and ammonemia. Adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol increased during the exercise sessions. The acute rise in both erythrocytes and white blood profile were probably due to muscle cell damage, rather than hepatocyte integrity impairment; (4) Conclusion: The cellular and metabolic responses found here, together with effective nutrition support, are crucial to understanding the effects of exercise in order to assist in the creation of new training and recovery planning. Also we show that Sportomics is a primal tool for training management and performance improvement, as well as to the understanding of metabolic response to exercise.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomarkers 3ablood sampling 3acorticotropin 3acortisol 3aenzymes 3aerythrocytes 3aexercise 3aleukocytes 3ametabolites 3amuscles 3anutrition 3aplanning1 aViveiros de Castro, Luis1 aDeane, Elizabeth1 aMagno-França, Alexandre1 aBassini, Adriana1 aCameron, Luiz-Claudio0 tNutrients.g2016 Nov. 11, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu81107193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007400162300001200236520171100248592002801959650001301987650001202000650001302012650002702025650002102052650002302073650001502096650002502111650001202136650003502148650001102183650002402194650001402218650001902232650001902251650001502270651001002285651001802295700001602313700002602329700001602355773013302371856008102504852000902585655001202594IND60133408820221122034444.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013340882DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-4370-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yang10aAssessing changes in water flow regulation in Chongqing region, China  ap. 362.  aWater flow regulation is an important ecosystem service that significantly impacts on ecological quality and social benefits. With the aim of improving our understanding of ecosystems and proposing strategies for optimizing ecosystem services, a geographic information system (GIS)-based approach was designed to estimate and map regulated water flow in the Chongqing region of China. In this study, we applied the integrated valuation of environmental services and tradeoffs (InVEST) model and mathematical simulations to estimate the provision of the regulated water flow across space and time in 2000, 2005, and 2010. The results indicated that this ecosystem service had improved by 2.07 % from 2000 to 2010 as a result of human activities (such as vegetation restoration) and climatic interaction. Places with positive changes mainly occurred in high mountain areas, whereas places with negative changes were mainly distributed in resettlement areas along the Yangtze River. The type of ecosystem in areas with high mountains and steep slopes was a relatively minor contributor to the total service, but this ecosystem had the higher water flow regulation capacity. Moreover, with the increase in altitude and slope, the percentage contribution of forest increased significantly from 2000 to 2010; by contrast, the percentage contribution of cropland decreased rapidly. As for the impacts, the spatial variation of water flow regulation in the Chongqing region had a significant relation with climate and human activities at the regional scale. These results provided specific information that could be used to strengthen necessary public awareness about the protection and restoration of ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3acropland 3aecological restoration 3aecological value 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3ahumans 3amathematical models 3amountains 3asocial benefit 3aspace and time 3awater flow 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aXiao, Qiang1 aOuyang, Z.q(Zhiyun),1 aMaomao, Qin0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 June, v. 187, no. 6 p.362-362dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4370-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011100172300001100283500001100294520200000305592002802305650000802333650000902341650002002350650001402370650001302384650001502397650001502412650000902427650001502436650001802451650000902469650002302478650002202501650001602523650001402539700002002553700002502573700002302598700002302621773010302644856008202747852000902829655001202838IND60712595720221117033500.0220630e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071259572DNAL7 a10.1186/s12937-020-0526-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArabi, Seyed Mostafa14aThe effect of vitamin D supplementation on hemoglobin concentration: a systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 11.  aReview  aAIMS: The purpose of this review was to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplements on hemoglobin concentration in subjects aged 17.5–68 years old; using randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Relevant RCT studies were identified from January 2000 to January 2019 by using MeSH terms in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinical trials, Scopus databases and gray literature. The studies were reviewed systematically, and quality assessments were evaluated by the guidelines of the Cochrane risk of bias. The effect of vitamin D supplements (n = 14) on hemoglobin concentration was considered as primary outcome, while its effects on the levels of ferritin, transferrin saturation and iron status were derived as secondary outcomes. In total, 1385 subjects with age range of 17.5 to 68 years old were examined for 3 h to 6 months; Mean (standard deviation) or median interquartile changes in the hemoglobin concentration in each treatment group was recorded for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Current study findings propose that vitamin D supplementation leads to a non-significant reduction in hemoglobin levels in subjects (17.5–68 years old) [std. mean difference (SMD): 0.01; 95% CI: − 0.28, 0.29; P = 0.95], also it has no significant effect on ferritin concentrations [std. mean difference (SMD): -0.01; 95% CI: [− 0.20, 0.18; P = 0.91]. However, vitamin D supplementation demonstrated positive effects on transferrin saturation [mean difference (MD): 1.54; 95% CI: 0.31, 2.76; P = 0.01] and iron status [std. mean difference (SMD): 0.24; 95% CI: − 0.09, 0.39; P = 0.002]. CONCLUSION: Current review concluded that supplementation with vitamin D had no significant effect on hemoglobin and ferritin levels while positive effects on transferrin saturation and iron status were observed. Further clinical studies are required to determine the actual effect of this intervention on hemoglobin levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage 3abias 3aclinical trials 3adatabases 3aferritin 3aguidelines 3ahemoglobin 3airon 3aliterature 3ameta-analysis 3arisk 3astandard deviation 3asystematic review 3atransferrin 3avitamin D1 aRanjbar, Golnaz1 aBahrami, Leila Sadat1 aVafa, Mohammadreza1 aNorouzy, Abdolreza0 tNutrition journal.g2020 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.11-11dBioMed CentralwJournal:2170x1475-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12937-020-0526-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245015100161500001400312520107900326592002801405650003001433650001401463650001801477650002201495650001701517650001601534650002001550650001001570650001101580650001101591700001901602700002201621700001801643700002001661700003201681700001901713773012201732856007401854852000901928655001201937IND60729385720221119220658.0210228e20210209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072938572DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130205762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeroy, Fabienne 12aA New Method to Monitor the Nutritional Quality of Packaged Foods in the Global Food Supply in Order to Provide Feasible Targets for Reformulation  aNAL-light  aNutrient profiling systems, initially designed to promote healthy food choices at the point of sale, can also provide the scientific basis for innovation and product reformulation by the food industry. This work presents a new profiling system to help define feasible nutrient targets for reformulation of packaged foods. The focus is on five key nutrients for which the World Health Organisation (WHO) has set population-level goals: sugar, saturated fat, sodium, fiber, and protein. The methodology uses Mintel’s Global New Products Database of packaged foods to (1) identify nutrients relevant to each food category (2) sort products into sub-categories defined by a unique nutritional signature, and (3) develop standards for “best of class” products. For instance, if targeted to be amongst the best 15% of the global food supply, pizza must have less than 4.0 g/100 g saturated fat, less than 520 mg/100 g total sodium and more than 9.8 g/100 g protein. Fiber and sugar are not identified as relevant nutrients for the pizza category and no targets are provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3adatabases 3afood industry 3afood supply chain 3ahealthy diet 3amethodology 3anutritive value 3apizza 3asodium 3asugars1 aRytz, Andreas 1 aDrewnowski, Adam 1 aTassy, Marie 1 aOrengo, Audrey 1 aCharles, Veronique  Rheiner1 aGreen, Hilary 0 tNutrients.g2021 Feb. 09, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130205763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01960naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008000161500001400241520076800255592002801023650001201051650002201063650001101085650002101096650000901117650001201126651001001138700002101148700002201169700002301191700001901214700002301233700002501256700002301281700002201304700002001326773012201346856007301468852000901541655001201550IND60721809620221121150924.0201224e20201124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072180962DNAL7 a10.3390/v121213472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMombo, Illich  M.10aDetection of Ebola Virus Antibodies in Fecal Samples of Great Apes in Gabon  aNAL-light  aBased on a large study conducted on wild great ape fecal samples collected in regions of Gabon where previous human outbreaks of Ebola virus disease have occurred between 1994 and 2002, we provide evidence for prevalence of Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV)-specific antibodies of 3.9% (immunoglobulin G (IgG)) and 3.5% (immunoglobulin M (IgM)) in chimpanzees and 8.8% (IgG) and 2.4% (IgM) in gorillas. Importantly, we observed a high local prevalence (31.2%) of anti-EBOV IgG antibodies in gorilla samples. This high local rate of positivity among wild great apes raises the question of a spatially and temporally localized increase in EBOV exposure risk and the role that can be played by these animals as sentinels of the virus’s spread or reemergence in a given area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGorilla 3aZaire Ebola virus 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3arisk 3aviruses 3aGabon1 aFritz, Matthieu 1 aBecquart, Pierre 1 aLiegeois, Florian 1 aElguero, Eric 1 aBoundenga, Larson 1 aMebaley, Telstar  N.1 aPrugnolle, Franck 1 aMaganga, Gael  D.1 aLeroy, Eric  M.0 tViruses.g2020 Nov. 24, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v121213473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245012100187300001600308520118400324592002801508650002401536650001401560650001201574650001101586650001801597650002501615650002401640650001601664650001301680650001201693650002401705650001101729650001601740650001701756650003501773653004601808653001301854653001801867653005001885700002801935700002401963700002101987700001802008773012802026856005102154852000902205655001202214IND50076412420221118060629.0140410e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007641242DNAL7 a222428742pmid7 a10.1080/10934529.2012.6405842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiau, Víctor10aModelling of the temperature-phased batch anaerobic digestion of raw sludge from an urban wastewater treatment plant  ap. 221-227.  aThe disposal of excess sludge from wastewater treatment plants is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. Temperature-phased anaerobic digestion (TPAD) which combines thermophilic and mesophilic processes in one, brings together the advantages of both systems. The aim of the present work was to develop a simple kinetic model to describe the TPAD of sewage sludge in batch completely stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) and to determine the kinetic parameters of both thermophilic and mesophilic stages. A zero-order kinetic equation described the thermophilic step after 2, 4 and 6 days of digestion time (experiment 1, 2 and 3, respectively), yet a first-order equation was found to be adequate to correlate the methane gas accumulated with time in the mesophilic step, the kinetic constant being 0.21 days⁻¹. The methane yield coefficient obtained was found to be almost proportional to the digestion time used in the thermophilic step with values of 0.067, 0.132 and 0.193 L CH₄ STP/g VSₐddₑd for experiments 1, 2 and 3, respectively. By contrast, the kinetic constant of the mesophilic stage was not influenced by the digestion time used in the thermophilic phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3aequations 3amethane 3amodels 3asewage sludge 3awastewater treatment 2aBacteria, Anaerobic 2aBioreactors 2aKinetics 2aMethane 2aModels, Theoretical 2aSewage 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 0abiochemical methane potential (BMP) assay 0akinetics 0asewage sludge 0atemperature phased anaerobic digestion (TPAD)1 aDe la Rubia, M.

Previous studies have shown that HMTp210, a 210-kDa outer-membrane protein, is the major protective antigen of Av. paragallinarum both serovars A and C. Region 2 is a serovar-specific domain in the HMTp210 protein. Although the serovar C region 2 has been reported to be an effective vaccine antigen for infectious coryza, there have been no reports on the efficacy of region 2 from serovar A. In the current study, region 2 from serovars A and C was expressed as a fusion peptide. Chickens inoculated with vaccine consisting of 0.6μg of the fusion peptide showed no clinical signs of disease after challenge with either serovar A or C, and there were no side effects such as swelling at the injection site. These results demonstrate that the recombinant fusion peptide derived from HMTp210 could be useful for producing effective and safe vaccines against infectious coryza in chickens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aantigens 3achickens 3agrowth retardation 3ainjection site 3arecombinant vaccines 3aserotypes 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialximmunology 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsximmunology 2aChickensximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aHaemophilus Infectionsximmunologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aHaemophilus Vaccinesximmunologyxtherapeutic use. 2aHaemophilus paragallinarumximmunology 2aHemagglutination Inhibition Testsxveterinary 2aImmunity, Humoralximmunology 2aPoultry Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aVaccines, Syntheticxtherapeutic use 0aAvibacterium paragallinarum 0aHMTp210 0aInfectious coryza 0aRecombinant vaccine1 aBaba, Susumu1 aUshijima, Toshihiro1 aKino, Yoichiro1 aHonda, Takashi1 aMizokami, Hiroshi1 aSakaguchi, Masashi0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2013 June, v. 94, no. 3 p.504-509dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2012.10.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04126naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010800166300001200274520237800286592002802664650004902692650001602741650000802757650001802765650001302783650002402796650002802820650002302848650003402871650001202905650002302917650001002940650002202950650002502972650001102997650002503008650001203033650001503045650001403060650002203074650001503096650002403111650001703135650001103152651000903163700002103172700001803193700006003211700002703271700002003298700002103318773010503339856008303444852000903527655001203536IND60712595920221117033350.0220630e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071259592DNAL7 a10.1186/s12937-020-00631-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahimi, Hamed10aDietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score and obesity phenotypes in children and adolescents  ap. 112.  aBACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity and its two important phenotypes, the metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and the metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO) are 10.9, 9.1, and 1.8%, respectively, among children and adolescents in Iran. Data on the link between diet quality indices and obesity phenotypes in children and adolescents is scarce. The present study aimed to assess the association of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score with MHO and MUO, as well as with cardiometabolic risk factors (RFs) in children and adolescents with excess weight. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 341 children and adolescents with excess weight aged 6–13 years, selected from primary schools of Tehran. The DASH score was determined based on eight components using a valid and reliable food frequency questionnaire. Anthropometric measures, insulin, fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile, and physical activity levels were collected. MUO was classified based on two definitions: having 2 or more cardiometabolic RFs, or being insulin resistant determined by a homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) ≥ 3.16. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for MUO phenotypes and cardiometabolic RFs in each tertile of the DASH score after adjustment for confounders. RESULTS: The mean ± SD for age and DASH score was 9.3 ± 1.7 years and 24.0 ± 4.9, respectively. The prevalence of MUO was 62.2% based on RFs, and 43.4% based on HOMA-IR. Participants in the highest tertile of the DASH score had significantly decreased odds for MUO based on HOMA-IR (OR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.28–0.87) compared with those in the lowest tertile, after adjustment for confounders. However, there were no associations between the DASH score and any of cardiometabolic RFs, or MUO based on RFs (OR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.38–1.20). CONCLUSION: The DASH score was inversely associated with MUO based on HOMA-IR, but not associated with MUO based on cardiometabolic RFs in this sample of children and adolescents. A DASH-style diet may have favourable effects on insulin sensitivity among children and adolescents with excess weight. Universal definitions for MHO/MUO are required, and longitudinal studies recommended to shed light upon this subject.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet 3aadolescents 3aage 3ablood glucose 3achildren 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3aelementary schools 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alight 3alipid composition 3alongitudinal studies 3amodels 3anutritional adequacy 3aobesity 3aodds ratio 3aphenotype 3aphysical activity 3aprevalence 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3aweight 3aIran1 aYuzbashian, Emad1 aZareie, Rahim1 aAsghari, Golaleh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7925-51581 aDjazayery, Abolghassem1 aMovahedi, Ariyo1 aMirmiran, Parvin0 tNutrition journal.g2020 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.112-112dBioMed CentralwJournal:2170x1475-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12937-020-00631-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245009700209300001600306520095600322592002801278650002601306650001901332650002501351650002301376650001501399650001701414650002501431650002201456650001501478650001401493650002101507650001601528651001001544653002101554653001101575653000901586653001601595653002301611700001201634700001701646700001501663700001401678700002101692773011901713856008701832852000901919655001201928IND60531711720221118203708.0180904e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053171172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.06.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xiaogang,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2898-942310aElevated soil CO2 efflux at the boundaries between impervious surfaces and urban greenspaces  ap. 375-378.  aImpervious surfaces and greenspaces have significant impacts on ecological processes and ecosystem services in urban areas. However, there have been no systematic studies of how the interaction between the two forms of land cover, and especially their edge effects, influence ecosystem properties. This has made it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of urban greenspace design in meeting environmental goals. In this study, we investigated edge effects on soil carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes in Beijing and found that soil CO2 flux rates were averagely 73% higher 10 cm inwards from the edge of greenspaces. Distance, soil temperature, moisture, and their interaction significantly influenced soil CO2 flux rates. The magnitude and distance of edge effects differed among impervious structure types. Current greening policy and design should be adjusted to avoid the carbon sequestration service of greenspaces being limited by their fragmentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aedge effects 3aenvironmental impact 3aissues and policy 3aland cover 3alandforms 3asoil temperature 3aurban areas 3aChina 0aUrban greenspace 0aCarbon 0aSoil 0aEdge effect 0aImpervious surface1 aHu, Dan1 aMa, Shengli,1 aZhang, Xia1 aGuo, Zhen1 aGaston, Kevin J.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 Sept., v. 141 p.375-378dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.06.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04760naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129024002200167024001900189040001800208100001300226245019100239300001100430500001500441506002800456506006400484520253600548592002803084596008303112506003703195650001203232650002803244650000903272650001303281650001003294650001503304650001603319650001803335650001503353650002003368650002703388650003103415650002503446650002603471650001103497650001203508650001103520650002003531650001803551650001003569650002003579650001703599650001403616650001603630650002003646650001503666653001703681700002303698700002403721700002303745700002003768700001803788773013203806856008103938903002204019852000904041655001204050IND60548668620221207130328.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054866862DNAL7 a10.1186/s40104-016-0077-92doi7 a10.1186/s40104-016-0077-92chorus7 aPMC47844692pmcid7 a269624512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Cong10aPeripartal rumen-protected methionine supplementation to higher energy diets elicits positive effects on blood neutrophil gene networks, performance and liver lipid content in dairy cows  ap. 18.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Access  aSpringer Science and Business Media LLC License Information  aBACKGROUND: Main objectives were to determine to what extent Smartamine M (SM) supplementation to a prepartal higher-energy diet could alter neutrophil (PMN) and liver tissue immunometabolic biomarkers, and whether those responses were comparable to those in cows fed a prepartal lower-energy diet (CON). RESULTS: Twenty-eight multiparous Holstein cows were fed CON (NEL = 1.24 Mcal/kg DM) during d −50 to d −22 relative to calving. From d −21 to calving, cows were randomly assigned to a higher-energy diet (OVE, n = 9; NEL = 1.54 Mcal/kg DM), OVE plus SM (OVE + SM, n = 10; SM = 0.07 % of DM) or remained on CON (n = 9). All cows received the same basal lactation diet (NEL = 1.75 Mcal/kg DM). Supplementation of SM (OVE + SM) continued until 30 d postpartum. Liver biopsies were harvested at d −10, 7, and 21 relative to parturition. Blood PMN isolated at −10, 3, and 21 d relative to calving was used to evaluate gene expression. As expected, OVE increased liver lipid content postpartum; however, cows fed OVE + SM or CON had lower concentrations than OVE. Compared with OVE, cows in CON and OVE + SM had greater DMI postpartum and milk production. Furthermore, cows fed OVE + SM had the greatest milk protein and fat percentage and lowest milk SCC despite having intermediate PMN phagocytic capacity. Adaptations in PMN gene expression in OVE + SM cows associated with the lower SCC were gradual increases from −10 to 21 d in genes that facilitate migration into inflammatory sites (SELL, ITGAM), enzymes essential for reducing reactive oxygen metabolites (SOD1, SOD2), and a transcription factor(s) required for controlling PMN development (RXRA). The greater expression of TLR4 on d 3, key for activation of innate immunity due to inflammation, in OVE compared with CON cows suggests a more pronounced inflammatory state. Feeding OVE + SM dampened the upregulation of TLR4, despite the fact that these cows had similar expression of the pro-inflammatory genes NFKB1 and TNF as OVE. Cows in CON had lower overall expression of these inflammation-related genes and GSR, which generates reduced glutathione, an important cellular antioxidant. CONCLUSIONS: Although CON cows appeared to have a less stressful transition into lactation, SM supplementation was effective in alleviating negative effects of energy-overfeeding. As such, SM was beneficial in terms of production and appeared to boost the response of PMN in a way that improved overall cow health.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenzymes 3areactive oxygen species 3amilk 3aHolstein 3agenes 3adairy cows 3aglutathione 3adairy protein 3abiomarkers 3agene expression 3atumor necrosis factors 3agene expression regulation 3aToll-like receptor 4 3atranscription factors 3aenergy 3acalving 3abiopsy 3aadverse effects 3alipid content 3aliver 3ainnate immunity 3ainflammation 3alactation 3aneutrophils 3amilk production 3amethionine 0aantioxidants1 aBatistel, Fernanda1 aOsorio, Johan Samir1 aDrackley, James K.1 aLuchini, Daniel1 aLoor, Juan J.0 tJournal of animal science and biotechnology.g2016 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.18-18dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl35737x2049-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40104-016-0077-93Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle03411naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015200168300002000320500001900340520194000359592002802299650001202327650001202339650001302351650000902364650002002373650000902393650002302402650001502425650001402440650001402454650001302468650001902481650001702500650001902517650001902536651002102555700001802576700001902594700002302613700002102636700002502657773015502682856008302837852000902920655001202929IND60739447220221118071347.0210731e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073944722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-12477-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHannet, Godfrey10aEffects of biochar, compost, and biochar-compost on soil total nitrogen and available phosphorus concentrations in a corn field in Papua New Guinea  ap. 27411-27419.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReplenishing soil nutrient particularly total nitrogen (TN) and available phosphorus (P) is important to sustain soil health for food production. Organic amendments such as compost and biochar are commonly applied to improve soil nutrient retention especially N and P. In farms, biochar is usually applied once followed by applying other organic amendment applied in their full rates. Both form and rate of organic amendments can affect soil nutrient concentrations particularly in short term. This study aimed to examine the effects of compost and mixture of compost with biochar (both at full rates) on soil nutrient concentrations in short term. A randomised complete block filed experiment with eight replicates was used for this study. The effects of biochar (5 t/ha) only, compost (at the rates of 10 t/ha, 25 t/ha and 35 t/ha) and biochar mixed with compost (5 t/ha and 10 t/ha, respectively) on soil nutrient concentrations compared with control were explored in a corn field. Compost treatment at the rate of 35 t/ha had significantly higher TN, available P, calcium (Ca) and iron (Fe) compared with other treatments and control. Soil potassium (K) levels remained unchanged among all treatments. Biochar only treatment had significantly higher available P and Ca concentrations compared with biochar mixed with compost treatment. Compost application at higher rate (35 t/ha) proved best practice to significantly increase TN and available P concentrations in short term. Significantly higher available P concentration in biochar only treatment compared with the biochar mixed with compost treatment could have been associated with stimulation of P immobilisation when biochar was mixed with compost. Our results indicated that the form and rate of organic amendments in short term cropping systems are important to be considered while applying to a volcanic soil to ensure N and P availability for plants are not compromised.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acalcium 3acomposts 3acorn 3afood production 3airon 3anutrient retention 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3apotassium 3aresearch 3asoil nutrients 3asoil quality 3atotal nitrogen 3avolcanic soils 3aPapua New Guinea1 aSingh, Kanika1 aFidelis, Chris1 aFarrar, Michael B.1 aMuqaddas, Bushra1 aBai, Shahla Hosseini0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 June, v. 28, no. 21 p.27411-27419dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12477-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04032naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245013900166300001600305520211400321592002802435596012302463596005602586650002702642650001702669650001302686650001502699650002402714650001502738650002302753650000902776650002302785650002002808650000902828650001702837650001402854650001002868651001502878653002102893653003702914653001702951653002502968653001302993700002003006700002103026700002403047700002203071700002503093700002803118700002003146700002103166700002303187773014303210856008003353852000903433655001203442IND60621554820221121221253.0181203e20170401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062155482DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.116.1479422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDewey, Kathryn G10aLipid-based nutrient supplementation in the first 1000 d improves child growth in Bangladesh: a cluster-randomized effectiveness trial  ap. 944-957.  aBackground: Stunting in linear growth occurs mainly during the first 1000 d, from conception through 24 mo of age. Despite the recognition of this critical period, there have been few evaluations of the growth impact of interventions that cover most of this window. Objective: We evaluated home fortification approaches for preventing maternal and child undernutrition within a community-based health program. We hypothesized that small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs) provided to women during pregnancy and the first 6 mo postpartum, LNSs provided to their offspring from 6 to 24 mo of age, or both would result in greater child length-for-age z score (LAZ) at 24 mo than iron and folic acid (IFA) provided to women during pregnancy and postpartum plus micronutrient powder (MNP) or no supplementation for their offspring from 6 to 24 mo. Design: We conducted a cluster-randomized effectiveness trial with 4 arms: 1) women and children both received LNSs (LNS-LNS group), 2) women received IFA and children received LNSs (IFA-LNS group), 3) women received IFA and children received MNP (IFA-MNP group), and 4) women received IFA and children received no supplements (IFA-Control group). We enrolled 4011 women at ≤20 wk of gestation within 64 clusters, each comprising the supervision area of a community health worker. Analyses were primarily performed by using ANCOVA F tests and Tukey-Kramer–corrected pairwise comparisons. Results: At 24 mo, the LNS-LNS group had significantly higher LAZ (+0.13 compared with the IFA-MNP group) and head circumference (+0.15 z score compared with the IFA-Control group); these outcomes did not differ between the other groups. Stunting prevalence (LAZ <−2) was lower in the LNS-LNS group at 18 mo than in the IFA-MNP group (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.92), but the difference diminished by 24 mo (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.04). Conclusion: Home fortification with small-quantity LNSs, but not MNP, during the first 1000 d improved child linear growth and head size in rural Bangladesh. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01715038.  aPublisher supplied data  cOffice of Health, Infectious Diseases and Nutrition, Bureau for Global Health, US Agency for International Development  cFood and Nutrition Technical Assistance III Project 3aanalysis of covariance 3achild growth 3achildren 3aconception 3adietary supplements 3afolic acid 3agrowth retardation 3ahead 3ahead circumference 3ahealth programs 3airon 3amalnutrition 3apregnancy 3awomen 3aBangladesh 0agrowth faltering 0alipid-based nutrient supplements 0amalnutrition 0amicronutrient powder 0astunting1 aMridha, Malay K1 aMatias, Susana L1 aArnold, Charles D.,1 aCummins, Joseph R1 aKhan, Md Showkat Ali1 aMaalouf-Manasseh, Zeina1 aSiddiqui, Zakia1 aUllah, Md Barkat1 aVosti, Stephen A.,0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 105, no. 4 p.944-957dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45206x1938-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.1479423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245027500157300002000432520127500452592002801727650001001755650001401765650001101779650001401790650001401804650001301818650001201831650001901843650001901862650001101881650001001892650001901902700001901921700002501940700001601965773012401981856007402105852000902179655001202188IND60641066320221121025811.0190505e20160805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064106632DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra16316e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Renzi, M.10aComments on “Dental lessons from past to present: ultrastructure and composition of teeth from plesiosaurs, dinosaurs, extinct and recent sharks” by A.

These conclusions are based on their finding high fluoride levels (i.e. fluoroapatite) in the dentine of fossilised shark teeth as well as in both the dentine and enamel of plesiosaurs, mosasaurs, and dinosaurs, which is in sharp contrast to recent teeth (which contain almost no fluoride in the dentin or enamel; i.e. hydroxyapatite). However, in our opinion, the authors have either obviated or underestimated a process well known to palaeontologists and archaeologists: the fluorine content of fossil teeth and bones increases with age during the course of fossilization because of the diagenetic passage of hydroxyapatite to more stable fluoroapatite. Thus, the aim of this letter is to show that the high fluoride contents found in the questioned paper are due to the diagenetic alteration of fossils, with the goal of avoiding future confusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abones 3adinosaurs 3aenamel 3aevolution 3afluorides 3afluorine 3afossils 3ahydroxyapatite 3amineralization 3asharks 3ateeth 3aultrastructure1 aManzanares, E.1 aMarin-Monfort, M.

Genotyping of mutant mice is a critical requirement for maintaining the colony, to breed with other mutants and to match the phenotypic observations. The SCID (Severe Combine Immuno Deficiency) mouse model has been extensively used as a common background-strain in many immunology and transplantation studies. Many different types of assays, including Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), confronting two primer pairs PCR and end-point methods have been attempted for establishing a genotyping protocol for the SCID mutation. However, the best method that is thought to be reliable is sequencing, which requires additional time and resources to perform on a routine basis. In this report, we describe a novel RFLP assay that is simple and reliable. The method is validated by sequencing analysis, and this novel method can be adapted for routine genotyping of SCID model.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3abiomedical research 3agenotyping 3aimmunology 3amice 3amutants 3aphenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asequence analysis 3asevere combined immunodeficiency 0aSCID 0aNSG 0aHumanized mice 0aRFLP 0aGenotyping1 aPoluektova, Larisa Y.1 aGurumurthy, Channabasavaiah B.0 tJournal of Immunological Methods.g2016 Apr., v. 431 p.60-62dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2016.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001900160245007900179300001600258500000900274500001500283520176400298592002802062650001802090650001302108650002102121650001502142650001902157650002802176650001602204650001502220650001102235650002002246650002502266651001302291653001002304653002502314700001802339700001602357773012202373852000902495856009702504655001202601IND9004953820221121021351.0191122e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900495382DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1990.00021962008200040023x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlevins, R.

Field experiments were conducted to determine the fertilizer N equivalency of hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), bigflower vetch (Vicia grandiflora W. Koch var. Kitailbeliana), and rye (Secale cereale L.) to no-tillage corn (Zea mays L.) and grain sorghum [sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]. A fallow treatment, consisting of stalk residue only, was used as a comparison. Fertilizer N rates for corn were 0, 50, or 100 kg N ha⁻¹ for 1980 to 1983 and 0, 85, or 170 kg N ha⁻¹ for 1984 to 1987. Hairy vetch produced the most cover crop dry matter with the highest percentage of N. During 1980 to 1983, corn grain yields were significantly higher with the vetch treatments than with rye or fallow treatments at the 0 and 50 kg N ha⁻¹ rates with a tendency toward higher yields at the 100 kg N ha⁻¹ rate. During 1984 to 1987, corn yields from the vetch treatments were significantly higher than the other cover treatments at all N levels. Grain sorghum, like corn yields, were greater with the vetch treatments than with the rye or fallow treatments, although the bigflower vetch treatment was not significantly higher than the fallow treatment at the 170 kg N ha⁻¹ rate. The estimated fertilizer-N equivalency of the hairy vetch-N in the corn experiment was 75 kg N ha⁻¹ and bigflower vetch was 65 kg N ha⁻¹. Fertilizer N equivalency values in the grain sorghum experiment were estimated to be 125 kg N ha⁻¹ for hairy vetch and 135 kg N ha⁻¹ for bigflower vetch.

Although various genomic datasets are relevant to this issue, each dataset provides relatively weak evidence on its own. Developing methods that can integrate different sequence, expression and localization data have become important. RESULTS: Here we use a novel method that integrates chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data with microarray expression data and with combinatorial TF-motif analysis. We systematically identify combinations of transcription factors and of motifs. The various combinations of TFs involved multiple binding mechanisms. We reconstruct a new combinatorial regulatory map of the yeast cell cycle in which cell-cycle regulation can be drawn as a chain of extended TF modules. We find that the pairwise combination of a TF for an early cell-cycle phase and a TF for a later phase is often used to control gene expression at intermediate times. Thus the number of distinct times of gene expression is greater than the number of transcription factors. We also see that some TF modules control branch points (cell-cycle entry and exit), and in the presence of appropriate signals they can allow progress along alternative pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Combining different data sources can increase statistical power as demonstrated by detecting TF interactions and composite TF-binding motifs. The original picture of a chain of simple cell-cycle regulators can be extended to a chain of composite regulatory modules: different modules may share a common TF component in the same pathway or a TF component cross-talking to other pathways.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell cycle 3achromatin 3adata collection 3agene expression 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3aprecipitin tests 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3ayeasts1 aHata, Naoya1 aBanerjee, Nilanjana1 aFutcher, Bruce1 aZhang, Michael Q.,0 tGenome biology.g2004 July, v. 5, no. 8 p.860-860dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2004-5-8-r563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03593naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245023300134300001800367520197000385592002802355650003802383650004202421650001902463650001502482650001802497650001602515650001102531650001402542650001202556650001502568650001202583650001702595650001702612650001302629650002002642650001602662650002502678650001802703650001402721650001102735650001802746650002202764650002402786651001302810700001702823700001902840700002802859773017902887852000903066655001203075IND4501133020221118025511.0150420e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450113302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPromnuan, Yaowanoot10aActinomadura apis sp. nov., isolated from a honey bee (Apis mellifera) hive, and the reclassification of Actinomadura cremea subsp. rifamycini Gauze et al. 1987 as Actinomadura rifamycini (Gauze et al. 1987) sp. nov., comb. nov.  ap. 2271-2277.  aA Gram-reaction-positive aerobic actinomycete, designated strain IM17-1T, was isolated from a honey bee (Apis mellifera) hive in Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. The strain formed a branched substrate mycelium and mature aerial mycelium bore short chains of arthrospores with warty surfaces. The cell wall contained meso-2,6-diaminopimelic acid (cell-wall type III) and the whole cell sugars were fucose, galactose, glucose, madurose, mannose and ribose. The major isoprenoid quinone was hexahydrogenated menaquinone with nine isoprene units and the predominant cellular fatty acids were C16 : 0 (33.8 %), C18 : 1Ï9c (32.7 %), summed feature 3 (C16 : 1Ï7c and/or iso-C15 : 0 2-OH) (8.7 %) and 10-methyl C18 : 0 (8.2 %). The phospholipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol mannosides. These morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics were consistent with the classification of IM17-1T within the genus ACTINOMADURA: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain IM17-1T was closely related to the type strains of Actinomadura cremea subsp. cremea (98.1 %) and Actinomadura cremea subsp. rifamycini (98.6 %); however, it represented a distinct phylogenetic lineage from the other species within this genus. The unique genetic characteristics were reaffirmed by low levels of DNAâDNA relatedness between strain IM17-1T and the two most closely related type strains, A. cremea subsp. cremea JCM 3308T (56.5Â±4.9 %) and A. cremea subsp. rifamycini JCM 3309T (31.0Â±22.6 %), and further supported the proposal of IM17-1T as a novel species. Strain IM17-1T ( = JCM 16576T = TISTR 1980T) thus represents a novel species of the genus Actinomadura, for which the name Actinomadura apis sp. nov. is proposed. In addition, the genotypic and phenotypic data suggested the reclassification of Actinomadura cremea subsp. rifamycini Gauze et al. 1987 as a separate species, Actinomadura rifamycini sp. nov., comb. nov.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinomadura cremea subsp. cremea 3aActinomadura cremea subsp. rifamycini 3aApis mellifera 3acell walls 3achemotaxonomy 3afatty acids 3afucose 3agalactose 3aglucose 3ahoney bees 3amannose 3amenaquinones 3amicrobiology 3amycelium 3anew combination 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3aphospholipids 3aphylogeny 3aribose 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3ataxonomic revisions 3aThailand1 aKudo, Takuji1 aOhkuma, Moriya1 aChantawannakul, Panuwan0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2011 Sept., v. 61, no.

The criteria used to define adherence to dietary self‐monitoring in obesity treatment tend to vary, particularly in studies that include dietary self‐monitoring via mobile applications (apps). The objectives of this study were to (a) determine weight change outcomes related to app‐based dietary self‐monitoring and (b) determine the associations between the frequency, consistency, and completeness of dietary self‐monitoring and weight change. METHODS: In this single‐arm uncontrolled prospective study, employees at a large, urban health system who had overweight or obesity self‐monitored dietary intake for 8 weeks using the Calorie Counter by FatSecret app. A paired sample t‐test examined the association of app‐based dietary self‐monitoring and weight change; linear regression examined the associations of frequent, consistent, and complete dietary self‐monitoring and weight change. RESULTS: A significant mean difference [t (89) = 6.59, p < 0.001] was found between baseline and 8‐week weight (M = −1.5 ± 2.1 kg) in the sample (N = 90). Linear regression revealed a significant association [F (1, 88) = 7.18, p = 0.009] between total weeks of consistent dietary self‐monitoring (M = 4.4 ± 2.8) and percent weight loss (M = −1.54% ± 2.26%), and a significant association [F (1, 88) = 6.42, p = 0.013] between dietary self‐monitoring frequency (M = 50.1% ± 33.3%) and percent weight loss. The total weeks of complete dietary self‐monitoring (M = 3.42 ± 2.87) was not associated [F (1, 88) = 3.57, p = 0.062] with percent weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent and frequent app‐based dietary self‐monitoring were associated with short‐term weight loss. Emphasizing these aspects of self‐monitoring may be an avenue for decreasing the burden of self‐monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe Ohio Nurses Foundation (ONF) 3afood intake 3aobesity 3aprospective studies 3aregression analysis 3at-test 3aweight loss1 aTurk, Melanie T.1 aKalarchian, Melissa A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2099-92991 aPellegrini, Christine A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0922-01950 tObesity science & practice.g2022 June, v. 8, no. 3 p.279-288dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27210x2055-22387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/osp4.5663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245015600180300002000336500001900356520169500375592002802070650001402098650002702112650001502139650001602154650002002170650001702190650000702207650001002214650001302224650001102237650001302248650001402261650001502275650002502290700003202315700002102347700002302368700005602391773015502447856008302602852000902685655001202694IND60739447720221118071725.0210731e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073944772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-12675-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarei Mahmoudabadi, Tahereh10aComparison of poly ferric chloride and poly titanium tetrachloride in coagulation and flocculation process for paper and cardboard wastewater treatment  ap. 27262-27272.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe current study investigated the efficiency of poly ferric chloride (PFC) and poly titanium tetrachloride (PTC) in coagulation-flocculation process for treatment of paper and cardboard wastewater. The effect of pH (5–11), coagulant concentrations (100–1000 mg/L), mixing rate (10–60 rpm), mixing time (5–25 min), and settling time (5–30 min) were examined. The results showed that the removal efficiency for turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) by PFC and PTC coagulants increased with pH rising up to 9 for the former and 7 for the latter coagulant. Furthermore, the removal efficiency for the afore-mentioned parameters increased along with a 30 rpm increase in the mixing rate, while the mixing time reached 20 min. It was also found that the best removal efficiencies for turbidity, TSS, and COD by PFC under optimal conditions (pH 9, coagulant dose 800 mg/L, and settling time of 25 min) were 97.11%, 99.1%, and 84.91%, respectively. In addition, the removal efficiencies for PTC (optimal conditions of pH 7, coagulant dose 600 mg/L, and settling time of 15 min) were found to be 98.29%, 99.29%, and 86.42%, respectively. Water recovery and the produced sludge volume by PFC were 80% and 200 cm³, respectively, in the settling time of 25 min and for PTC were 81.5% and 185 cm³, respectively, in the settling time of 15 min. Costs of the coagulation-flocculation process for treatment 1 m³ of paper and cardboard wastewater using PTC and PFC were 0.42 $ and 0.32 $, respectively. Finally, it can be concluded that compared to PFC, PTC with higher settling rate has a greater efficiency for treatment of paper and cardboard wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardboard 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoagulants 3acoagulation 3aferric chloride 3aflocculation 3apH 3apaper 3aresearch 3asludge 3atitanium 3aturbidity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aEhrampoush, Mohammad Hassan1 aTalebi, Parvaneh1 aFouladi-Fard, Reza1 aEslami, Hadi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5137-47640 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 June, v. 28, no. 21 p.27262-27272dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12675-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245012900205300001600334520127900350592002801629650004401657650002201701650003701723650001101760650001401771650002001785650001201805650002201817650000901839650001401848650001301862650001401875650001801889650001501907650002701922650001701949650001701966650003701983653003302020653002102053653001402074700001702088700001702105700001602122700005702138700001502195700001902210700005102229700001202280700001402292700001502306773012502321856008302446852000902529655001202538IND60688296820221121114804.0200516e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068829682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yaoning1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3457-100X10aGlucose enhanced the oxidation performance of iron-manganese binary oxides: Structure and mechanism of removing tetracycline  ap. 287-298.  aIn this work, iron-manganese binary oxides (FMO) modified with different proportions of glucose addition (FMOCx) by co-precipitation method showed good activity in activating hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) for tetracycline degradation. The structure and surface characterizations of the FMO and FMOCx were measured by XRD, FTIR, TEM, BET and XPS. With increased glucose addition, FMOCx has more surface functional groups such as –OH and –COOH, particle size decreases, surface area gradually increases, and the ratio of high valence iron and manganese also increases. In addition, the glucose might be oxidized by KMnO₄ to form amorphous carbon on the catalyst surface. Glucose modified iron-manganese binary oxides FMOC3 (with 0.003 mol glucose added) showed the highest efficiency removal capability for tetracycline up to 85%, which attribute to it has a larger surface area, more surface functional groups and higher surface active Mn(IV) site content. The results also demonstrated that FMOC3 could efficiently activate hydrogen peroxide. This study proves that glucose modified iron-manganese binary oxides (FMOCx) can offered a possibility of degradation of refractory organic pollutants as an environmentally friendly catalyst in the absence of H₂O₂ or not.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acoprecipitation 3aglucose 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3amanganese 3amoieties 3aoxidation 3aparticle size 3apollutants 3apotassium permanganate 3asurface area 3atetracycline 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aIron-manganese binary oxides 0aGlucose modified 0aMechanism1 aZeng, Ziping1 aLi, Yuanping1 aLiu, Yihuan1 aChen, Yanrong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3457-100X1 aWu, Yanxin1 aZhang, Jiachao1 aLi, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0759-32781 aXu, Ran1 aWang, Sha1 aPeng, Zhen0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 573 p.287-298dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02134naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014300171300001200314520071500326592002801041650003001069650001401099650002801113650001001141650001801151650001701169650001001186650001101196653001601207653001601223653002801239653002201267700001901289700001701308700001801325700001601343700002001359700005901379700001901438700002201457773010101479856008701580852000901667655001201676IND60536557820221120114719.0190409e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053655782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2014.11.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Jui-Jen10aIntegrating an algal β-carotene hydroxylase gene into a designed carotenoid-biosynthesis pathway increases carotenoid production in yeast  ap. 2-8.  aThe algal β-carotene hydroxylase gene Crchyb from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Czchyb from Chlorella zofingiensis, or Hpchyb from Haematococcus pluvialis and six other carotenoid-synthesis pathway genes were co-integrated into the genome of a yeast host. Each of these three algal genes showed a higher efficiency to convert β-carotene to downstream carotenoids than the fungal genes from Phaffia rhodozyma. Furthermore, the strain with Hpchyb displayed a higher carotenoid productivity than the strains integrated with Crchyb or Czchyb, indicating that Hpchyb is more efficient than Crchyb and Czchyb.

They represent an attractive alternative to lithium batteries to power implantable devices, as they work at body temperature, are light and easy-to-miniaturise. To be implantable in blood vessels, EBFCs should not only be made of non-toxic and biocompatible compounds but should also be able to operate in continuous flow-through mode. The EBFC devices reported so far, however, implement carbon-based materials of questionable toxicity and stability, such as carbon nanotubes, and rely on the use of external redox mediators for the electrical connection between the enzyme and the electrode. With this study, we demonstrate for the first time continuous power generation by flow through miniature enzymatic biofuel cells fed with an aerated solution of glucose and no redox mediators. Non-toxic highly porous gold was used as the electrode material and the immobilisation of the enzymes onto the electrodes surface was performed via cost-effective and easy-to-reproduce methodologies. The results presented here are a significant step towards the development of revolutionary implantable medical devices that extract the power they require from metabolites in the body.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3abiosensors 3ablood vessels 3abody temperature 3acarbon nanotubes 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3aglucose 3agold 3alithium 3amedical equipment 3ametabolites 3amicrobial fuel cells 3apower generation 3atoxicity 0aEnzymatic biofuel cells 0aBioenergy 0aHighly porous gold 0aFlow-through 0aGlucose oxidase 0aLaccase1 aDi Lorenzo, Mirella0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 July 15, v. 69 p.199-205dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.02.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03827naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014400165300002000309500001900329520218000348592002802528596006802556650004702624650001902671650001802690650001602708650003002724650001002754650002502764650001402789650001102803650002202814650001302836650000902849650001602858650001602874650002502890651001002915700001302925700001302938700001802951700001902969700001902988700001403007700001403021700001503035773015503050856008303205852000903288655001203297IND60739447920221118071907.0210731e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073944792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-12474-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Yaqiong10aAmbient air pollution and cerebrovascular disease mortality: an ecological time-series study based on 7-year death records in central China  ap. 27299-27307.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMost studies of short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and cerebrovascular diseases focused on specific stroke-related outcomes, and results were inconsistent due to data unavailability and limited sample size. It is unclear yet how ambient air pollution contributes to the total cardiovascular mortality in central China. Daily deaths from cerebrovascular diseases were obtained from the Disease Surveillance Point System (DSPs) of Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the period from 2013 to 2019. Air pollution data were obtained from Wuhan Ecology and Environment Institute from 10 national air quality monitoring stations, including average daily PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, SO₂, NO₂, and O₃. Average daily temperature and relative humidity were obtained from Wuhan Meteorological Bureau. We performed a Poisson regression in generalized additive models (GAM) to examine the association between ambient air pollution and cerebrovascular disease mortality. We observed a total of 84,811 deaths from cerebrovascular diseases from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2019 in Wuhan. Short-term exposure to PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, SO₂, and NO₂ was positively associated with daily deaths from cerebrovascular diseases, and no significant association was found for O₃. The largest effect on cerebrovascular disease mortality was found at lag0 for PM₂.₅ (ERR: 0.927, 95% CI: 0.749–1.105 per 10 μg/m3) and lag1 for PM₁₀ (ERR: 0.627, 95% CI: 0.493–0.761 per 10 μg/m³), SO₂ (ERR: 2.518, 95% CI: 1.914, 3.122 per 10 μg/m³), and NO₂ (ERR: 1.090, 95% CI: 0.822–1.358 per 10 μg/m³). The trends across lags were statistically significant. The stratified analysis demonstrated that females were more susceptible to SO₂ and NO₂, while elder individuals aged above 65 years old, compared with younger people, suffered more from air pollution, especially from SO₂. Short-term exposure to PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, SO₂, and NO₂ were significantly associated with a higher risk of cerebrovascular disease mortality, and elder females seemed to suffer more from air pollution. Further research is required to reveal the underlying mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015061701011631cWuhan Municipal Science and Technology Bureau 3aCenters for Disease Control and Prevention 3aacute exposure 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acerebrovascular disorders 3adeath 3adisease surveillance 3amortality 3apeople 3arelative humidity 3aresearch 3arisk 3asample size 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aChina1 aChen, Xi1 aGuo, Yan1 aWu, Chuangxin1 aZhao, Yuanyuan1 aYang, Niannian1 aDai, Juan1 aGong, Jie1 aXiang, Hao0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 June, v. 28, no. 21 p.27299-27307dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12474-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011700174300001800291520078400309592002801093650000801121650002001129650002001149650001401169650000701183650002301190650002101213650001701234653000901251653001701260653001201277653001301289700005701302700001901359773015601378856008601534852000901620655001201629IND60539330020221121222103.0190215e20150722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053933002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2015.06.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreco, Maria Laura10aDouble stranded promoter region of BRAF undergoes to structural rearrangement in nearly physiological conditions  ap. 2117-2123.  aThe folding of oncogene promoters into non-canonical DNA secondary structures is considered a strategy to control gene expression.

We analyzed the structural behavior of the G- and C-rich strands. By the use of spectroscopic and electrophoretic techniques we confirmed that they actually fold into a predominant antiparallel G-quadruplex and into an i-motif, respectively, and that they can coexist at nearly physiological conditions. Finally, the influence of several factors (KCl, pH, PEG200) on the conversion of the double stranded form of the oncogene promoter into the two above mentioned non-canonical structures has been explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aelectrophoresis 3agene expression 3aoncogenes 3apH 3apotassium chloride 3apromoter regions 3aspectroscopy 0aBRAF 0aG-quadruplex 0ai-motif 0aOncogene1 aFolini, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1811-44071 aSissi, Claudia0 tFEBS letters.g2015 July 22, v. 589, no. 16 p.2117-2123dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2015.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245009600178300001600274520145300290592002801743650001501771650001901786650001301805650001101818650001101829650001701840650003101857650001601888653002501904653003201929653002701961653002001988653002002008653002302028653001702051700006202068700001502130700002102145700001802166700002902184700002102213700006102234773012502295856008302420852000902503655001202512IND60688296920221121114806.0200516e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068829692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukhopadhyay, Manikuntala10aInterfacial energy driven distinctive pattern formation during the drying of blood droplets  ap. 307-316.  aDried blood droplet morphology may potentially serve as an alternative biomarker for several patho-physiological conditions. The deviant properties of the red blood cells and the abnormal composition of diseased samples are hypothesized to manifest through unique cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions leading to different morphological patterns. Identifying distinctive morphological trait from a large sample size and proposing confirmatory explanations are necessary to establish the signatory pattern as a potential biomarker to differentiate healthy and diseased samples.Comprehensive experimental investigation was undertaken to identify the signatory dried blood droplet patterns. The corresponding image based analysis was in turn used to differentiate the blood samples with a specific haematological disorder “Thalassaemia” from healthy ones. Relevant theoretical analysis explored the role of cell-surface and cell-cell interactions pertinent to the formation of the distinct dried patterns.The differences observed in the dried blood patterns, specifically the radial crack lengths, were found to eventuate from the differences in the overall interaction energies of the system. A first-generation theoretical analysis, with the mean field approximation, also confirmed similar outcome and justified the role of the different physico-chemical properties of red blood cells in diseased samples resulting in shorter radial cracks.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood sampling 3adroplets 3adrying 3aenergy 3aerythrocytes 3aphysicochemical properties 3asample size 0aBlood droplet drying 0aCell-substrate interactions 0aCell-cell interactions 0aDrying patterns 0aRed blood cells 0aInterfacial energy 0aThalassaemia1 aDasGupta, Sunando,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6365-50771 aRay, Rudra1 aAyushman, Manish1 aSood, Pourush1 aBhattacharyya, Maitreyee1 aSarkar, Debasish1 aDasGupta, Sunando1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6365-50770 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 573 p.307-316dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245018000152300002000332520122400352592002801576650001601604650001401620650002801634650003001662650002301692650001601715700001501731773012501746856007501871852000901946655001201955IND60641066820221120111845.0220402e20160906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064106682DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra16321a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yan10aUnderstanding the mechanisms, regioselectivies and enantioselectivities of the DMAP-catalyzed [2 + 4] cycloaddition of γ-methyl allenoate and phenyl(phenyldiazenyl)methanone  ap. 84177-84186.  aThe mechanisms, regioselectivities and enantioselectivities of the DMAP-catalyzed [2 + 4] cycloaddition reaction between γ-methyl allenoate R₁ and phenyl(phenyldiazenyl)methanone R₂ have been theoretically studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Various possible reaction pathways are analyzed and discussed. The results of the DFT calculations show that the preferred mechanism (mechanism A) includes four steps: the nucleophilic addition of DMAP to R₁ to form the zwitterionic intermediate 1 (first step), the γ-addition of 1 to R₂ to generate intermediates γ-2(R&S) (second step), the intramolecular Michael addition to give the six-membered ring intermediates γ-3(RS&SR) (third step), and the catalyst DMAP liberation from γ-3(RS&SR) to generate the final product γ-P(R&S) (fourth step). The addition of DMAP to R₁ is calculated to be the rate-determining step. The reaction of 1 with R₂ is both the regioselective- and enantioselective-determining step. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental findings. The present study may provide a useful guide not only for understanding other analogous reactions but also for designing new reactions in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3acatalysts 3acycloaddition reactions 3adensity functional theory 3aenantioselectivity 3azwitterions1 aDu, Shiwen0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 06, v. 6, no. 87 p.84177-84186dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra16321a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03642naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100007000188245011600258300001400374506007600388520166100464592002802125506003702153650001802190650001102208650001002219650001602229650002002245650001102265650002102276650001902297650001802316650001802334650001802352650003202370653000802402653000802410653000902418653000902427653001002436653001002446653001002456653000802466653001002474653000802484653000802492653000902500653002002509653002302529653001602552653001002568700002602578700002402604700002402628700001902652700001702671700002402688700005702712773009702769856008102866852000902947655001202956IND60528751520221207100505.0161016e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052875152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2016.02.0062doi7 aPMC48012232pmcid7 a268592432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitcharoensakkul, Maleewan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1080-468110aTemporal biological variability in dendritic cells and regulatory T cells in peripheral blood of healthy adults  ap. 63-65.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStudies evaluating circulating dendritic cells (DCs) and natural and induced regulatory T cells (nTregs, iTregs) are often obtained at a single time point and difficult to interpret without understanding their intrinsic day-to-day biologic variability.We investigated the day-to-day variability in quantifying DCs, nTregs (FoxP3+CD25+CD4+) and cytokine production by iTregs (granzyme B—GZB, Th1/2 cytokines following CD3 plus CD46 in vitro activation) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected on three consecutive days in healthy adults. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to evaluate intra-individual variability.In 10 healthy adults, the %PBMCs of plasmacytoid (pDC) and myeloid (mDC1 and mDC2) were 0.27±0.12, 0.22±0.10, and 0.02±0.02, with ICC 0.91, 0.90, and 0.17 respectively. Natural Tregs (3.27±1.27% CD4+ cells) had an ICC of 0.86. Inducible Tregs (GZB-positive, 35.3±17.7% CD4+ cells) had an ICC of 0.77. The ICCs for IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-5 production by iTregs were 0.49, 0.63, 0.68, 0.74, and 0.82, respectively. There were no significant changes in ICC (<0.1) after adjusting for age, gender and atopy except for IL-4. Substantial variability for iTregs was determined for the control condition (PBS with IL-2).No meaningful day-to-day biologic variability was observed for the quantification of nTregs, pDC and mDC1 in normal adults; however, there was substantial variability in measuring mDC2 proportions and iTreg production of IL-10. These results suggest obtaining an average of several measurements over time to determine the most representative value of these biologic measures.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadults 3aatopy 3acorrelation 3adendritic cells 3agender 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-5 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aDCs 0apDC 0amDC1 0amDC2 0aTregs 0anTreg 0aiTreg 0aIBV 0aPBMCs 0aFBS 0aGZB 0aICCs 0aDendritic cells 0aRegulatory T cells 0aVariability 0aHuman1 aBacharier, Leonard B.1 aYin-Declue, Huiqing1 aBoomer, Jonathan S.1 aBurgdorf, Dana1 aWilson, Brad1 aSchechtman, Kenneth1 aCastro, Mario1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6328-89940 tJournal of Immunological Methods.g2016 Apr., v. 431 p.63-65dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2016.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012400171520152600295592002801821650003001849650001901879650000901898650002201907650001401929650001401943650002101957650002901978650001602007653002902023653003002052653002402082653001602106653003202122653002202154700001802176700001802194700002402212700002202236773011602258856008702374852000902461655001202470IND60755252920221116153015.0220509e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075525292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1148582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei-Hsin10aPerformance evaluation and improvement of thermoelectric generators (TEG): Fin installation and compromise optimization  aHow to improve the performance of thermoelectric generators is an important issue to recover waste heat and convert it into green power, which is conducive to practicing net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. The heat transfer and power generation of a thermoelectric module (TEM) under the influence of fin installation is investigated by three-dimensional fully numerical simulations where vehicle exhaust waste heat is harvested. This study considers a TEM in a hot channel without fins as well as with plate fins and square pin fins, while a cold channel is used to cool the TEM. The results show that installing plate fins or square pin fins can drastically intensify waste heat harvest, and the optimal number of square pin fins is 78 which increases the output power of the TEM by 24.14% compared to the plate fins. A compromise method in terms of heat flow rate ratio and heat flow rate ratio per unit area of square pin fins is conducted, which simultaneously considers the TEM’s output power and material cost. As a result, it is found that the optimal number of square pin fins is 54. The influences of the temperature and mass flow rate of the hot fluid on TEM performance are also evaluated, and the results indicate that the former has a pronounced impact whereas the latter is relatively unimportant. Installing more square pin fins gives rise to a higher pressure drop. Nevertheless, the net output power of the TEM increases with increasing the number of square pin fins and the highest value occurs at 78.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acarbon dioxide 3acold 3aenergy conversion 3aheat flow 3amass flow 3apower generation 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 0aThermoelectric generator 0aPlate and square pin fins 0aWaste heat recovery 0aSource term 0aComputational fluid dynamic 0aCompromise method1 aWang, Jiming,1 aHuat Saw, Lip1 aHoàng, Anh Tuấn,1 aBandala, Argel A.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 250 p.114858-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1148583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245010100160300002000261500001900281500001100300520130900311592002801620596005901648596005901707596007001766650001401836650003001850650002601880650001401906650001301920650001201933700001601945700001401961700001701975700001901992773015502011856008302166852000902249655001202258IND60739448120221118071714.0210731e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073944812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-13614-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Shu10aAssessment models and dynamic variables for dynamic life cycle assessment of buildings: a review  ap. 26199-26214.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aLife cycle assessment (LCA) is widely used to quantify the environmental performance of buildings. Recently, the potential temporal variations in the lifetime of buildings and their influences on assessment results have attracted considerable attention. Dynamic LCA (DLCA) is an emerging research topic. This study provides an overview of the current scenario of DLCA studies in the building field. A literature survey was conducted by searching through scientific literature databases; 48 articles met the inclusion criteria. Eleven dynamic variables as well as their addressing approaches were summarized and analyzed. A few typical dynamic assessment models were synthesized and compared to present the methodology progress. Finally, considering the existing limitations, a few research directions were recommended: setting cutoff criteria for dynamic variables, developing a dynamic database, and considering the interactions between dynamic variables. The analyses in this study indicate that research on the DLCA of buildings needs interdisciplinary cooperation. This review promotes in-depth understanding about DLCA research of buildings and offers valuable implications for environmental practice. The highlighted future research directions facilitate further explorations in this research area.  aPublisher supplied data  a71901062cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a71671042cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aBK20190377cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China 3adatabases 3aenvironmental performance 3alife cycle assessment 3apollution 3aresearch 3asurveys1 aZhang, Huan1 aZuo, Jian1 aLi, Xiaodong1 aYuan, Jingfeng0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 June, v. 28, no. 21 p.26199-26214dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13614-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159072000900168100001500177245014800192300001600340500002400356500001500380520108300395650001401478650002201492650001501514650002301529650000801552650003001560650001401590650001901604650002801623650002501651650002401676650002201700650001201722650004501734650003001779650002801809650002801837650001401865650003001879650005801909650002701967650004801994651001202042651001202054653002202066700001602088700001502104700001502119700001602134773012002150852000902270856008002279930003302359945002502392946001302417655001202430IND4420426720221122235756.0090514e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442042672DNAL7 a194964442pmid7 a10.1603/033.046.03382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8211 aGilles, J.10aPolymerase Chain Reaction Detection of Rickettsia felis-Like Organism in Archaeopsylla erinacei (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae) from Bavaria, Germany  ap. 703-707.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFleas occur as ectoparasites of vertebrates around the world. The obligate intracellular bacterium Rickettsia felis has been detected globally in several flea species, causing a murine-typhus like disease in humans. In this study, a total of 150 hedgehog fleas (Archaeopsylla erinacei Bouché) were collected from 18 hedgehogs coming from four locations in southern Germany for the detection of R. felis. Individual DNA extracts were tested with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification of the rickettsial ompB, gltA, ompA, and 16S rRNA genes. A total of 144 samples (96%) were positive using ompB PCR. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed an organism very closely related to R. felis with 96% similarity. These results provided evidence that hedgehog fleas in Germany may be nearly 100% infected with a rickettsial species closely related to R. felis. Further studies are needed for its molecular and pathogenetic characterization. The hedgehog as a potential reservoir for the emergent pathogen R. felis or closely related strains also needs further study. 3aPulicidae 3adisease detection 3aRickettsia 3adisease prevalence 3aDNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aphylogeny 3ainsect vectors 3apathogen identification 3arickettsial diseases 3aErinaceus europaeus 3asequence homology 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistry 2aHedgehogsxparasitology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRickettsia felisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSiphonapteraxclassificationxmicrobiology. 3aGermany 0aGermany 0asequence analysis1 aSilaghi, C.1 aJust, F.T.1 aPradel, I.1 aPfister, K.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2009 May, v. 46, no. 3 p.703-707dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/033.046.03383Available from publisher's Web site  a20090611b20090703c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/06/11  aOther US 7aarticle02471naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245012700173300001400300520121900314592002801533650001501561650001901576650001301595650001801608650001301626650001901639650002001658650001801678650001701696650001201713650003301725650001701758650001101775650002101786700001901807700002101826700001901847773008801866856008601954852000902040655001202049IND60095489320221122050600.0141104e20120605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009548932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2012.03.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Young-Hyeun10aPreparation of water powders by the adsorption of hydrophobic nanoparticles at the surface of hydrated starch particulates  ap. 41-44.  aWater powders, aqueous droplets stabilized by the adsorption of hydrophobic nanoparticles at surface, were prepared for the cosmetic applications. The mild shear stress applied to water powders can induce the collapse of powders, and release water to skin. The hydrophobicity of nanoparticles, measured by the contact angle with water, played an important role for the formation of water powders. When the contact angle of nanoparticles with water was between 126 and 138°, the stable water powders were formed. The surfaces of silica or TiO₂ nanoparticles were modified with dimethicone or alumina to control the hydrophobicity of nanoparticles. Also the size of nanoparticles was one of the key factors in forming water powders. When the size of nanoparticles was 1/500–1/750 compared with that of modified starch particulate, the water powders were formed well. The modified starch particulates were swelled with aqueous phase. The optimal amount of aqueous phase in water powder was 75–80% by weight. Even though the content of aqueous phase was very high, the appearance of water powder was powdery. The water powders prepared at various conditions were investigated with SEM and an optical microscope.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaluminum oxide 3acolloids 3acontact angle 3adroplets 3ahydrophobicity 3amodified starch 3ananoparticles 3aparticulates 3apowders 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashear stress 3asilica 3atitanium dioxide1 aChoi, Kyung-Ho1 aPak, Ch'ang-hun,1 aOh, Seong-Geun0 tColloids and surfaces.g2012 June 5, v. 403 p.41-44dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2012.03.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245019200166300001600358520157500374592002801949650000801977650001501985650001702000650002102017650001502038650001902053650001902072650001802091650003002109653003202139653001902171653003202190653002702222653004402249700001802293700001702311700001602328700001502344700001902359773009602378856008202474852000902556655001202565IND60553461920221120090932.0161021e20150715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055346192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2015.02.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Bingqian10aTarget-regulated proximity hybridization with three-way DNA junction for in situ enhanced electronic detection of marine biotoxin based on isothermal cycling signal amplification strategy  ap. 241-248.  aA new signal amplification strategy based on target-regulated DNA proximity hybridization (TRPH) reaction accompanying formation of three-way DNA junction was designed for electronic detection of Microcystin-LR (MC-LR used in this case), coupling with junction-induced isothermal cycling signal amplification. Initially, a sandwiched-type immunoreaction was carried out in a low-cost PCR tube between anti-MC-LR mAb1 antibody-labeled DNA1 (mAb1-DNA1) and anti-MC-LR mAb2-labeled DNA2 (mAb2-DNA2) in the presence of target to form a three-way DNA junction. Then, the junction could undergo an unbiased strand displacement reaction on an h-like DNA nanostructure-modified electrode (labeled with methylene blue redox tag on the short DNA strand), thereby resulting in the dissociation of methylene blue-labeled signal DNA from the electrode. The newly formed double-stranded DNA could be cleaved again by exonuclease III, and the released three-way DNA junction retriggered the strand-displacement reaction with h-like DNA nanostructures for junction recycling. During the strand-displacement reaction, numerous methylene blue-labeled DNA strands were far away from the electrode, thus decreasing the detectable electrochemical signal within the applied potentials. Under optimal conditions, the TRPH-based immunosensing system exhibited good electrochemical responses for detecting target MC-LR at a concentration as low as 1.0ngkg−1 (1.0ppt). Additionally, the precision, reproducibility, specificity and method accuracy were also investigated with acceptable results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3adissociation 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3amethylene blue 3amicrocystin-LR 3ananomaterials 3apolymerase chain reaction 0aElectrochemical immunoassay 0aMicrocystin-LR 0aDNA proximity hybridization 0aThree-way DNA junction 0aIsothermal cycling signal amplification1 aChen, Jinfeng1 aWei, Qiaohua1 aZhang, Bing1 aZhang, Lan1 aTang, Dianping0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 July 15, v. 69 p.241-248dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.02.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01515naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002100127024001900148040001800167100001500185245007200200300001200272506007600284520042500360592002800785506003700813650001600850650001300866650001700879650002200896650001300918700002100931700002200952773010300974856007901077852000901156655001201165IND60119511920221207135958.0141214e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011951192DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2004-5-8-2372doi7 aPMC5078712pmcid7 a152879682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Jian10aSuccess for gene therapy: render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's  ap. 752.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReports that two young children developed leukemia after being treated for immunodeficiency with their own retrovirally modified bone-marrow cells delivered a severe blow to confidence in gene therapy as a treatment.

In order to study mouse models for such disorders, several behavioral tests involving social interaction with other mice have been developed. While a precise annotation of rodent behavioral state is necessary for these types of experiments, manual annotation of rodent social behavior is time-consuming and subjective. Therefore, an automated system that can instantly and independently quantify the animal's social exploration is desirable. We developed a capacitive touch device for automated detection of direct social-exploration in a modified three-chamber social behavior test. In this device, capacitive sensors can readily detect nose-pokes and other direct physical touches from the rodent under investigation. In addition, a conductive barrier makes mouse behavioral output immediately available for real-time use, by sending data to a host computer via a custom Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. Our capacitive touch sensing device produced similar results to the manually annotated data, demonstrating the ability to instantly and independently analyze direct social-exploration of animals in a social behavior test. Compared to the manual annotation method, this capacitive touch sensing system can be used to instantaneously quantify direct social-exploration, saving significant amount of time of post-hoc video scoring. Furthermore, this low-cost method enhances the objectivity of data by reducing experimenter involvement in analysis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautomation 3acomputers 3amice 3asocial behavior 0aCapacitive touch sensing device 0aAutomatic touch detection 0aRodent models of brain disorders 0aSocial behavior 0aClosed-loop experiments1 aLiang, Bo1 aZhang, Yan1 aMoffitt, Casey1 aLi, Yun1 aLin, Da-Ting0 tMethodsX.g2020, v. 7 p.101024-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2020.1010243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04702naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245012200203300001600325520203000341592002802371596008202399596012402481596008502605596008702690596008202777596004502859596010102904650002003005650002403025650001403049650001103063650001503074650001203089650002303101650001103124650003003135650001203165650001403177650001203191650002403203650001103227651001403238653001403252653001703266653001803283653002003301653002103321653001803342653002603360653001803386653001903404653001003423700002103433700002403454700002003478700002303498700002403521700001803545700002603563700002103589700001603610700002103626700001903647700002703666700001903693773014303712856008003855852000903935655001203944IND60621555420221121221200.0181203e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062155542DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.116.1482702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ling-Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2661-875210aAssociations of maternal macronutrient intake during pregnancy with infant BMI peak characteristics and childhood BMI  ap. 705-713.  aBackground: Infant body mass index (BMI) peak characteristics and early childhood BMI are emerging markers of future obesity and cardiometabolic disease risk, but little is known about their maternal nutritional determinants. Objective: We investigated the associations of maternal macronutrient intake with infant BMI peak characteristics and childhood BMI in the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes study. Design: With the use of infant BMI data from birth to age 18 mo, infant BMI peak characteristics [age (in months) and magnitude (BMIₚₑₐₖ; in kg/m²) at peak and prepeak velocities] were derived from subject-specific BMI curves that were fitted with the use of mixed-effects model with a natural cubic spline function. Associations of maternal macronutrient intake (assessed by using a 24-h recall during late gestation) with infant BMI peak characteristics (n = 910) and BMI z scores at ages 2, 3, and 4 y were examined with the use of multivariable linear regression. Results: Mean absolute maternal macronutrient intakes (percentages of energy) were 72 g protein (15.6%), 69 g fat (32.6%), and 238 g carbohydrate (51.8%). A 25-g (∼100-kcal) increase in maternal carbohydrate intake was associated with a 0.01/mo (95% CI: 0.0003, 0.01/mo) higher prepeak velocity and a 0.04 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.08) higher BMIₚₑₐₖ. These associations were mainly driven by sugar intake, whereby a 25-g increment of maternal sugar intake was associated with a 0.02/mo (95% CI: 0.01, 0.03/mo) higher infant prepeak velocity and a 0.07 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.13) higher BMIₚₑₐₖ. Higher maternal carbohydrate and sugar intakes were associated with a higher offspring BMI z score at ages 2–4 y. Maternal protein and fat intakes were not consistently associated with the studied outcomes. Conclusion: Higher maternal carbohydrate and sugar intakes are associated with unfavorable infancy BMI peak characteristics and higher early childhood BMI. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01174875.  aPublisher supplied data  cSingapore National Research Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001381  aNMRC/TCR/004-NUS/2008aNMRC/TCR/012-NUHS/2014cNational Medical Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001349  cSingapore Institute for Clinical Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001355  cAgency for Science, Technology and Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001348  cNational Institute for Health Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000272  cNIHRdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006662  aFP7/2007-2013cEuropean Union Seventh Framework Programmedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004963 3abody mass index 3acarbohydrate intake 3achildhood 3aenergy 3afat intake 3ainfancy 3amaternal nutrition 3amodels 3anutrition risk assessment 3aobesity 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3aregression analysis 3asugars 3aSingapore 0aadiposity 0acarbohydrate 0achildhood BMI 0agrowth modeling 0ainfancy BMI peak 0amacronutrient 0adevelopmental origins 0amaternal diet 0apregnancy diet 0asugar1 aAris, Izzuddin M1 aBernard, Jonathan Y1 aTint, Mya-Thway1 aColega, Marjorelee1 aGluckman, Peter D.,1 aTan, Kok Hian1 aShek, Lynette Pei-Chi1 aChong, Yap Seng,1 aYap, Fabian1 aGodfrey, Keith M1 avan Dam, Rob M1 aChong, Mary Foong-Fong1 aLee, Yung Seng0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 105, no. 3 p.705-713dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45206x1938-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.1482703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007600168300001600244520124500260592002801505650002201533650001401555650002101569650002301590650002001613650001201633650002001645650001701665650001501682650002201697650001401719650001401733650001301747653001201760653001701772653001401789700002801803773008901831856008601920852000902006655001202015IND60535062920221118055141.0190319e20150608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053506292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.03.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlter, Galit10aBeyond adjuvants: Antagonizing inflammation to enhance vaccine immunity  ap. B55-B59.  aSince the development of the first vaccine over 200 years ago, vaccines have saved millions of lives and have become the most cost-effective modern medical intervention. However, over 70 years ago, Freund recognized that the effectiveness of the vaccine-induced immune responses could be vastly improved via the co-delivery of inflammation-induced agents, giving birth to the adjuvant field. Since the first description of adjuvants, revolutionary discoveries, including the discovery of dendritic cells and pattern recognition receptors, that drive remarkably different biological profiles, have opened the landscape of opportunities for the development of novel adjuvants able to trigger a remarkably diverse inflammatory profiles, thereby qualitatively and quantitatively skewing adaptive immunity in a tailored manner against target pathogens. However, mounting data point to a critical role for pre-existing inflammation as a predictor of vaccine responsiveness. Thus, in this review we will discuss novel opportunities by which pre-existing inflammation may be modulated, skewed, or tuned via next-generation vaccine approaches to enhanced vaccine-induced immunity in the elderly, immunocompromised, or subjects with chronic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive immunity 3aadjuvants 3achronic diseases 3acost effectiveness 3adendritic cells 3aelderly 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3alandscapes 3amedical treatment 3apathogens 3areceptors 3avaccines 0aVaccine 0aInflammation 0aAdjuvants1 aSékaly, Rafick-Pierre,0 tVaccine.g2015 June 08, v. 33 p.B55-B59dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.03.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001400188245007600202300001400278506007600292520110900368592002801477506003701505650001701542650001501559650002301574650002501597650003801622650001301660650001301673650001201686650003201698650002001730650001001750650002601760650001301786650002501799653001001824653000801834653000801842653001001850653001001860653000801870653000801878653002301886653001501909653003901924653003801963653001702001700001602018700006002034700002202094700001302116700002102129700001702150700001802167773009602185856008102281852000902362655001202371IND60528751820221207100508.0161016e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052875182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2016.02.0092doi7 aPMC54951022pmcid7 a269028992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Jed10aHigh-throughput allogeneic antibody detection using protein microarrays  ap. 57-64.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have traditionally been used to detect alloantibodies in patient plasma samples post hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT); however, protein microarrays have the potential to be multiplexed, more sensitive, and higher throughput than ELISAs. Here, we describe the development of a novel and sensitive microarray method for detection of allogeneic antibodies against minor histocompatibility antigens encoded on the Y chromosome, called HY antigens. Six microarray surfaces were tested for their ability to bind recombinant protein and peptide HY antigens. Significant allogeneic immune responses were determined in male patients with female donors by considering normal male donor responses as baseline. HY microarray results were also compared with our previous ELISA results. Our overall goal was to maximize antibody detection for both recombinant protein and peptide epitopes. For detection of HY antigens, the Epoxy (Schott) protein microarray surface was both most sensitive and reliable and has become the standard surface in our microarray platform.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aY chromosome 3aantibodies 3aantibody detection 3acell transplantation 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepitopes 3aepoxides 3afemales 3ahistocompatibility antigens 3aimmune response 3amales 3amicroarray technology 3apatients 3arecombinant proteins 0aELISA 0aHCT 0amHA 0acGVHD 0aF➔M 0aMFI 0aIQR 0aProtein microarray 0aHY antigen 0aHematopoietic cell transplantation 0aChronic graft versus host disease 0aAlloantibody1 aSahaf, Bita1 aPerloff, Spenser1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6404-97091 aSchoenrock, Kelsi1 aWu, Fang1 aNakasone, Hideki1 aColler, John1 aMiklos, David0 tJournal of Immunological Methods.g2016 May, v. 432 p.57-64dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2016.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009400165300001600259520132500275592002801600650002401628650001101652650002101663650001101684650001201695650002201707650003101729653001501760653001101775653002601786653001001812653002601822700001501848700005501863700005301918700001201971700001701983700001602000700001802016773012502034856008302159852000902242655001202251IND60688297320221121231003.0211227e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068829732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Limin10aPerovskite-type CaMnO3 anode material for highly efficient and stable lithium ion storage  ap. 698-705.  aLithium ion batteries are attracting ever increasing attention due to their advantages of high energy/ power density, environmental friendly, lifetime and low cost. As a star in the field of materials and energy, perovskites have received extensive attention due to their attracting physical and chemical properties. Herein, CaMnO₃, one material from the perovskite family is introduced as a novel anode material for lithium ion batteries, and its electrochemical performance at different temperatures is systematically investigated. CaMnO₃ has been synthesized using a liquid phase synthesis method followed by high temperature calcination. The as-obtained CaMnO₃ exhibits an initial high discharge capacity of 708.4 mAh g⁻¹, superior rate capability and stable cycling performance at room temperature, the specific capacity is 102.5 mAh g⁻¹ after 500 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g⁻¹. Additionally, at an extreme temperature of 0 °C, the discapacity can reach 138.2 mAh g⁻¹ at a current density of 0.05 A g⁻¹. At high temperature of 50 °C, the reversible discharge capacity is up to 216.5 mAh g⁻¹under the same condition. It is believed that this contribution may lay the foundation for the application of perovskites in other rechargeable batteries and energy storage devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3aphysicochemical properties 0aPerovskite 0aCaMnO3 0aLithium ion batteries 0aAnode 0aDifferent temperature1 aLi, Jiahui1 aLe, Zaiyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9925-75131 aNie, Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8640-86851 aGuo, Yu1 aWang, Hairui1 aXu, Tianhao1 aXue, Xiangxin0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 584 p.698-705dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01143naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002100127024001900148040001800167100002400185245002500209300001200234506007600246520021600322592002800538506003700566650002000603650001600623650001100639773010300650856007900753852000900832655001200841IND60119512020221207140010.0141214e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011951202DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2004-5-8-2382doi7 aPMC5078722pmcid7 a152879692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikkelsen, Tarjei S10aWhat makes us human?  ap. 753.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe sequence of chimpanzee chromosome 22 is starting to help us to define the set of genetic attributes that are unique to humans, but interpreting the biological consequences of these remains a major challenge.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPan troglodytes 3achromosomes 3ahumans0 tGenome biology.g2004 July, v. 5, no. 8 p.753-753dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2004-5-8-2383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245021100171300001400382520098700396592002801383650001901411650001801430650001301448650002701461650001201488650001901500650002101519650001501540650001501555650000901570650001301579650001601592650002801608650002001636650001101656650001501667650002501682653001401707653001501721653001801736653003601754653002401790700001801814700001401832700001501846773010401861856008701965852000902052655001202061IND60536558320221120114847.0190409e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053655832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2014.11.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jingxin10aEnhancement of anaerobic acidogenesis by integrating an electrochemical system into an acidogenic reactor: Effect of hydraulic retention times (HRT) and role of bacteria and acidophilic methanogenic Archaea  ap. 43-49.  aIn this study, an acidogenic reactor packed with a pair of Fe–carbon electrodes (R1) was developed to enhance anaerobic acidogenesis of organic wastewater at short hydraulic retention times. The results indicated that the acidogenic efficiency was improved by settling a bio-electrochemical system. When hydraulic retention times decreased from 12 to 3h, R1 showed 18.9% more chemical oxygen demand removal and 13.8% more acidification efficiency. After cutting off the voltage of R1, the COD removal decreased by about 5%. Coupling of Fe2+ leaching and electric field accelerated the hydrolysis of polysaccharide, relieving its accumulation in the sludge phase. Several acidophilic methanogenic Archaea such as Methanosarcina sp. were enriched in R1, which was favorable for consuming organic acids and preventing excessive pH decline. Thus, the developed acidogenic reactor with Fe–carbon electrodes is expected to be potentially effective and useful for wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanosarcina 3aacidification 3abacteria 3achemical oxygen demand 3acutting 3aelectric field 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydrolysis 3airon 3aleaching 3amethanogens 3aorganic acids and salts 3apolysaccharides 3asludge 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aAnaerobic 0aHydrolysis 0aAcidification 0aBio-electrochemical enhancement 0aMicrobial community1 aZhang, Yaobin1 aQuan, Xie1 aChen, Shuo0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Mar., v. 179 p.43-49dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.11.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006200145245006700207300001800274500001100292520091300303592002801216596006601244650000801310650000801318650002301326650002101349650001001370650002401380650002201404650001801426700005901444700006201503700006101565773011201626856008001738852000901818655001201827IND60779028820221117202538.0220603e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077902882DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.133822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeymier, Séverine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0038-604110aISG20: an enigmatic antiviral RNase targeting multiple viruses  ap. 1096-1111.  aREVIEW  aInterferon‐stimulated gene 20 kDa protein (ISG20) is a relatively understudied antiviral protein capable of inhibiting a broad spectrum of viruses. ISG20 exhibits strong RNase properties, and it belongs to the large family of DEDD exonucleases, present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. ISG20 was initially characterized as having strong RNase activity in vitro, suggesting that its inhibitory effects are mediated via direct degradation of viral RNAs. This mechanism of action has since been further elucidated and additional antiviral activities of ISG20 highlighted, including direct degradation of deaminated viral DNA and translational inhibition of viral RNA and nonself RNAs. This review focuses on the current understanding of the main molecular mechanisms of viral inhibition by ISG20 and discusses the latest developments on the features that govern specificity or resistance to its action.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR‐20‐CE15‐0025‐01cAgence Nationale de la Recherche 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aantiviral proteins 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3amechanism of action 3aprokaryotic cells 3aribonucleases1 aLouvat, Camille1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4502-56101 aFiorini, Francesca1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8388-15761 aCimarelli, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0892-04880 tFEBS Open Bio.g2022 June, v. 12, no. 6 p.1096-1111dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.133823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002200150245009600172300001800268520108800286592002801374650001101402650001301413650001001426650000901436650001401445651001201459700001801471700001801489700003201507700002001539700001901559700001901578773009201597856008601689852000901775655001201784IND4458814920221120222840.0141111e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445881492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBilandžić, Nina10aDetermination of trace elements in Croatian floral honey originating from different regions  ap. 1160-1164.  aThe concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Hg and Pb were determined in 54 multi-floral honey samples collected from five regions of Croatia during 2009 and 2010. Element contents decreased in the following order: Cu>Pb>As>Hg>Cd. Significant differences in lead and copper levels were observed between regions. Mean levels of elements (μgkg⁻¹) in all honey samples measured were: 19.7 for As, 1.51 for Cd, 1074 for Cu, 2.72 for Hg and 65.2 for Pb. Copper and lead were the most abundant elements in the Centre region, with range and mean contents of 108–41,271 and 3232μgkg⁻¹ and 22.0–440 and 131μgkg⁻¹, respectively. The highest element contents were: As 23.8μgkg⁻¹ in the South region, Cd 2.11μgkg⁻¹ in the Southwest region and Hg 2.63μgkg⁻¹ in the Northeast region. The finding that lead contents in Croatian honey were higher than most reported lead levels in honey from other European countries is of particular concern. These indicate that attention must be focused on setting positions for honey production hives in areas distant from highways and railways.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3ahighways 3ahoney 3alead 3arailroads 3aCroatia1 aĐokić, Maja1 aSedak, Marija1 aKolanović, Božica Solomun1 aVarenina, Ivana1 aKončurat, Ana1 aRudan, Nevenka0 tFood chemistry.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 128, no. 4 p.1160-1164dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002100127024001900148040001800167100002300185245018900208300001200397506007600409520180400485592002802289506003702317650002802354650002902382650001802411650001402429650002002443650002702463650001502490650002502505650001902530650002202549650002902571650002602600650002302626700002302649700002002672700002302692700002002715700002102735700002202756773010302778856007902881852000902960655001202969IND60119512420221207140630.0141214e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011951242DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2004-5-9-r612doi7 aPMC5228682pmcid7 a153450452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerman, Benjamin P10aComputational identification of developmental enhancers: conservation and function of transcription factor binding-site clusters in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura  ap. 865.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The identification of sequences that control transcription in metazoans is a major goal of genome analysis. In a previous study, we demonstrated that searching for clusters of predicted transcription factor binding sites could discover active regulatory sequences, and identified 37 regions of the Drosophila melanogaster genome with high densities of predicted binding sites for five transcription factors involved in anterior-posterior embryonic patterning. Nine of these clusters overlapped known enhancers. Here, we report the results of in vivo functional analysis of 27 remaining clusters. RESULTS: We generated transgenic flies carrying each cluster attached to a basal promoter and reporter gene, and assayed embryos for reporter gene expression. Six clusters are enhancers of adjacent genes: giant, fushi tarazu, odd-skipped, nubbin, squeeze and pdm2; three drive expression in patterns unrelated to those of neighboring genes; the remaining 18 do not appear to have enhancer activity. We used the Drosophila pseudoobscura genome to compare patterns of evolution in and around the 15 positive and 18 false-positive predictions. Although conservation of primary sequence cannot distinguish true from false positives, conservation of binding-site clustering accurately discriminates functional binding-site clusters from those with no function. We incorporated conservation of binding-site clustering into a new genome-wide enhancer screen, and predict several hundred new regulatory sequences, including 85 adjacent to genes with embryonic patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring conservation of sequence features closely linked to function - such as binding-site clustering - makes better use of comparative sequence data than commonly used methods that examine only sequence identity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aDrosophila pseudoobscura 3abinding sites 3aevolution 3agene expression 3agermplasm conservation 3aprediction 3aregulatory sequences 3areporter genes 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atransgenic insects1 aPfeiffer, Barret D1 aLaverty, Todd R1 aSalzberg, Steven L1 aRubin, Gerald M1 aEisen, Michael B1 aCelniker, Susan E0 tGenome biology.g2004 Aug., v. 5, no. 9 p.865-865dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2004-5-9-r613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011300164500001900277520099700296592002801293650001601321650001501337650002401352650001201376650001201388650001701400650001101417650002201428650002301450650000701473650001401480650001501494650001801509653002201527653002001549653001301569700001301582700002201595700001601617773010301633856008301736852000901819655001201828IND60706893020221119102435.0201024e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070689302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.btre.2020.e005152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Haiyuan14aThe role of rice husk biochar addition in anaerobic digestion for sweet sorghum under high loading condition  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiochar is a carbon rich product made from the biomass pyrolysis process. Recently, biochar addition in anaerobic digestion processes has attracted attention for its possible functions to act as pH stabilizing agent, microbial carrier, and interspecies electron transfer. In this study, the effects of rice husk biochar addition in sorghum anaerobic digestion were investigated in batch tests. Under high F/M (food to microorganism) ratio conditions, obvious pH decreases and volatile fatty acids (VFA) accumulation was observed. Addition of 15 g/L biochar was found effective to increase the sorghum maximum methane production rate by 25 % and shorten the lag phase time by 44 %. Further biochar concentration increase showed little effects. Alkalinity increase brought by biochar addition contributed to the performance enhancement. Moreover, the promotive effects of biochar addition on degradation of acetic acid, propionic and butyric acid were not obvious under neutral pH conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aalkalinity 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiochar 3abiomass 3abutyric acid 3acarbon 3aelectron transfer 3amethane production 3apH 3apyrolysis 3arice hulls 3asweet sorghum 0aRice husk biochar 0aDirect electron 0aTransfer1 aHu, Yong1 aKobayashi, Takuro1 aXu, Kai-Qin0 tBiotechnology reports.g2020 Sept., v. 27 p.e00515-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23403x2215-017X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.btre.2020.e005153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001500192245010200207300001400309506007600323520108400399536017001483592002801653596006001681596006901741506003701810650001501847650002401862650001901886650001101905650002101916650001201937650001901949650001401968650002101982650002002003650001102023653002002034653001602054653002302070700002002093700001702113700001602130700001902146700001202165700001502177773010202192856008502294852000902379655001202388IND60691254120221207060015.0200428e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069125412DNAL7 a10.1080/15476286.2018.15561482doi7 aPMC63803282pmcid7 a305262712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Mengbo10aLong noncoding RNA SMRG regulates Drosophila macrochaetes by antagonizing scute through E(spl)mβ  ap. 42-53.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt is obvious that the majority of cellular transcripts are long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Although studies suggested that lncRNAs participate in many biological processes through diverse mechanisms, however, little is known about their effects on epidermal mechanoreceptors. Here, we identified one novel Drosophila lncRNA, Scutellar Macrochaetes Regulatory Gene (SMRG), which regulates scutellar macrochaetes that act as mechanoreceptors by antagonizing the proneural gene scute (sc), through the repressor Enhancer-of-split mβ (E(spl)mβ). SMRG deficiency induced supernumerary scutellar macrochaetes and simultaneously a high sc RNA level in the adult thorax. Genetically, sc overexpression enhanced this supernumerary phenotype, while heterozygous sc mutant rescued this phenotype, both of which were mediated by E(spl)mβ. At the molecular level, SMRG recruited E(spl)mβ to the sc promoter region, which in turn suppressed sc expression. Our work presents a novel function of lncRNA and offers insights into the molecular mechanism underlying mechanoreceptor development.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [31571033, 91632107]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS [QYZDY-SSW-SMC015].  aPublisher supplied data  a31571033cNational Natural Sciences Foundation of China  aQYZDY-SSW-SMC015cKey Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3agene overexpression 3aheterozygosity 3aimagos 3amechanoreceptors 3amutants 3anon-coding RNA 3aphenotype 3apromoter regions 3aregulator genes 3athorax 0aMechanoreceptor 0adevelopment 0along noncoding RNA1 aXiang, Yuanhang1 aLiu, Xiaojun1 aBai, Baoyan1 aChen, Runsheng1 aLiu, Li1 aLi, Meixia0 tRNA biology.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 16, no. 1 p.42-53dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2018.15561483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002400191245017800215300001600393506007600409520096800485592002801453506003701481650002601518650001601544650002301560650001801583650002601601650001501627650002201642650003701664700002001701700002301721700002301744700002101767700002301788700001801811700002901829773009201858856008401950852000902034655001202043IND60113779020221207122753.0141112e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011377902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2010.09.0172doi7 aPMC30253202pmcid7 a210558112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, Elizabeth A.12aA structural basis for Staphylococcal complement subversion: X-ray structure of the complement-binding domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein Sbi in complex with ligand C3d  ap. 452-462.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe structure of the complement-binding domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein Sbi (Sbi-IV) in complex with ligand C3d is presented. The 1.7Å resolution structure reveals the molecular details of the recognition of thioester-containing fragment C3d of the central complement component C3, involving interactions between residues of Sbi-IV helix α2 and the acidic concave surface of C3d. The complex provides a structural basis for the binding preference of Sbi for native C3 over C3b and explains how Sbi-IV inhibits the interaction between C3d and complement receptor 2. A second C3d binding site on Sbi-IV is identified in the crystal structure that is not observed in related S. aureus C3 inhibitors Efb-C and Ehp. This binding mode perhaps hints as to how Sbi-IV, as part of Sbi, forms a C3b–Sbi adduct and causes futile consumption of C3, an extraordinary aspect of Sbi function that is not shared by any other known Staphylococcal complement inhibitor.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-radiation 3abacterial proteins 3abinding sites 3achemical interactions 3acomplement 3acrystal structure 3astructure-activity relationships1 aCrennell, Susan1 aUpadhyay, Abhishek1 aZozulya, Alexey V.1 aMackay, Julia D.1 aSvergun, Dmitri I.1 aBagby, Stefan1 avan den Elsen, Jean M.H.0 tMolecular immunology.g2011 Jan., v. 48, no. 4 p.452-462dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2010.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245005000164300001800214500001100232520105400243592002801297596011401325596008601439596008601525596007501611596008101686596007001767650002401837650001001861650002401871650001601895650002601911650001701937650002601954700002201980700003302002700002402035700006302059773011202122856008002234852000902314655001202323IND60779029120221117202534.0220603e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077902912DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.134192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyes, Antonia10aIs there a role for HSF1 in viral infections?  ap. 1112-1124.  aREVIEW  aCells undergo numerous processes to adapt to new challenging conditions and stressors. Heat stress is regulated by a family of heat shock factors (HSFs) that initiate a heat shock response by upregulating the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) intended to counteract cellular damage elicited by increased environmental temperature. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is known as the master regulator of the heat shock response and upon its activation induces the transcription of genes that encode for molecular chaperones, such as HSP40, HSP70, and HSP90. Importantly, an accumulating body of studies relates HSF1 with viral infections; the induction of fever during viral infection may activate HSF1 and trigger a consequent heat shock response. Here, we review the role of HSF1 in different viral infections and its impact on the health outcome for the host. Studying the relationship between HSF1 and viruses could open new potential therapeutic strategies given the availability of drugs that regulate the activation of this transcription factor.  aPublisher supplied data  a30488811‐0cRegional Government of Antofagasta through the Innovation Fund for Competitiveness FIC‐R 2017  a1190864cFONDECYT from the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID)  a1190830cFONDECYT from the Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID)  aICN09_016/ICN 2021_045cANID ‐ Millennium Science Initiative Program  aICN09_016/ICN 2021_045cMillennium Institute on Immunology and Immunotherapy  aP09/016‐FcMillennium Institute on Immunology and Immunotherapy 3aambient temperature 3afever 3aheat shock response 3aheat stress 3aheat-shock protein 40 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factors1 aNavarro, Areli J.1 aDiethelm‐Varela, Benjamín1 aKalergis, Alexis M.1 aGonzález, Pablo A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7709-68700 tFEBS Open Bio.g2022 June, v. 12, no. 6 p.1112-1124dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.134193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100002400189245010100213300002000314506007600334520111200410592002801522506003701550650001101587650001901598650001901617650002801636650001201664650001601676650001001692650001901702650001101721650000901732650002601741650002101767650000901788650001801797650003601815653001001851653001801861653001801879653001101897653000801908653001501916653001701931653001801948653001601966653001801982700001702000700002102017700001502038700001402053700002002067700001502087700002202102700002302124773010002147856008302247852000902330655001202339IND60626461820221207105231.0200705e20180322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062646182DNAL7 a295029712pmid7 aPMC59737862pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Tamer M.A.10aRegulation of Cell Cycle to Stimulate Adult Cardiomyocyte Proliferation and Cardiac Regeneration  ap. 104-116.e12.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman diseases are often caused by loss of somatic cells that are incapable of re-entering the cell cycle for regenerative repair. Here, we report a combination of cell-cycle regulators that induce stable cytokinesis in adult post-mitotic cells. We screened cell-cycle regulators expressed in proliferating fetal cardiomyocytes and found that overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), CDK4, cyclin B1, and cyclin D1 efficiently induced cell division in post-mitotic mouse, rat, and human cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of the cell-cycle regulators was self-limiting through proteasome-mediated degradation of the protein products. In vivo lineage tracing revealed that 15%–20% of adult cardiomyocytes expressing the four factors underwent stable cell division, with significant improvement in cardiac function after acute or subacute myocardial infarction. Chemical inhibition of Tgf-β and Wee1 made CDK1 and cyclin B dispensable. These findings reveal a discrete combination of genes that can efficiently unlock the proliferative potential in cells that have terminally exited the cell cycle.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3acardiac output 3acardiomyocytes 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acyclins 3acytokinesis 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3amice 3amyocardial infarction 3aprotein products 3arats 3asomatic cells 3atransforming growth factor beta 0aheart 0acardiomyocyte 0acell division 0acyclin 0aCDK 0acell cycle 0aregeneration 0aproliferation 0acytokinesis 0aheart failure1 aAng, Yen-Sin1 aRadzinsky, Ethan1 aZhou, Ping1 aHuang, Yu1 aElfenbein, Arye1 aFoley, Amy1 aMagnitsky, Sergey1 aSrivastava, Deepak0 tCell.g2018 Mar. 22, v. 173, no. 1 p.104-116.e12dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006600164300001400230520173700244592002801981650003502009650002002044650001502064650001002079650002002089650001402109650002902123650001102152650001402163650001302177650001402190650001402204650001302218650001502231650002402246650001702270650001402287653002002301653001402321653001802335653001402353700002002367700002202387700002902409700002202438700001902460700002402479700002002503773012202523856008202645852000902727655001202736IND60628019120221120104850.0190320e20190330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062801912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2019.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabu, Dinesh10aIsoniazid induces a monocytic-like phenotype in HL-60 cells  ap. 15-23.  aIsoniazid (INH) is one of the oldest drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) and is of continual clinical and research interest. The aim of the current study is to investigate the ability of INH to induce monocyte differentiation and the underlying signaling pathway involved in this phenomenon using HL-60 cells. In this study, HL-60 cells were treated with different non-cytotoxic concentrations of INH or vitamin D (a well-known inducer of monocytic differentiation) to determine key functional changes in the phenotype of these cells using several biochemical and cytobiological experiments. HL-60 cells are derived from human promyelocytic leukemia and bear some resemblance to promyelocytes, which differentiate into various cell types. INH-induced differentiation was confirmed to occur in a concentration-dependent manner through several functional markers such as nonspecific esterase activity, NADPH oxidase activity and expression of surface markers CD14 and CD16 (characteristic of monocytes). INH-induced monocytic-like differentiation in HL-60 cells and demonstrated that at least 25% of cells were differentiated within the range of the pharmacological concentrations of INH. To determine the effects of INH on HL-60 cells, we applied quantitative proteomics that revealed 32 proteins were altered significantly in pathways that could involve differentiation signals. Lastly, INH activated the ERK-1/MAPK signaling pathway based on detection of phosphorylated ERK-1. These in vitro findings in HL-60 cells warrant further study using promyelocytes or hematopoietic stem cells to evaluate the physiological capability of INH to induce monocytic differentiation that may aid in host defense against TB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3abiomarkers 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3aesterases 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3ahumans 3aisoniazid 3aleukemia 3amonocytes 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asignal transduction 3atuberculosis 3avitamin D 0aDifferentiation 0aMonocytes 0aHL-60 cells 0aIsoniazid1 aKhan, Saifur R.1 aSrivastava, Nutan1 aKyoung Suh, Lindsey Yeon1 aMorgan, Andrew G.1 aAljuhani, Naif1 aFahlman, Richard P.1 aSiraki, Arno G.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2019 Mar. 30, v. 664 p.15-23dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2019.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04435naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245010000178300001600278506002800294520278100322592002803103506003703131650001003168650001303178650001103191650001903202650001203221650002303233650001103256650001503267650001503282650001003297650002303307650001403330650000903344650001303353650002603366650001503392650001103407650001103418650001603429650001003445650001403455650001603469650001703485653001903502653001503521653001603536653001903552653002303571700002703594773012703621856008803748852000903836655001203845IND60739922120221215142819.0180530e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073992212DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.2016.0.0.16472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornelis van Leeuwen10aModified grape composition under climate change conditions requires adaptations in the vineyard  ap. 147-154.  aResource is Open Access  aAim: Major effects of climate change are an increase in temperature, a modification in rainfall patterns and an increase in incoming radiations, in particular UV-Bs. Grapevines are highly sensitive to climatic conditions. Hence, plant development, grape ripening and grape composition at ripeness are modified by climate change. Some of these changes are already visible and will be amplified over the coming decades; other effects, although not yet measurable, can be predicted by modeling. The objective of this paper is to assess which modifications in wine quality and typicity can be expected and what levers growers can implement to adapt to this changing situation. Methods and results: This paper focusses on the effect of temperature, vine water status and UV-B radiation in viticulture. Vine phenology is driven by temperacture. A significant advance in phenology (i.e. budburst, flowering and veraison dates) has been observed since the early 1980’s in most winegrowing regions. The combined effect of advanced phenology and increased temperatures results in warmer conditions during grape ripening. In these conditions, grapes contain more sugar and less organic acids. Composition in secondary metabolites, and in particular aromas and aroma precursors, is dramatically changed. Increased drought, because of lower summer rain and/or because of higher reference evapotranspiration (ET0), induces earlier shoot growth cessation, reduced berry size, increased content in skin phenolic compounds, lower malic acid concentrations and modified aroma and aroma precursor profiles. Increased UV-B radiation enhances the accumulation of skin phenolics and modifies aroma and aroma precursor profiles. Over the next decades, an amplification of these trends is highly likely. Major adaptations can be reached though modifications in plant material (grapevine varieties, clones and root stocks), vineyard management techniques (grapevine architecture, canopy management, harvest dates, vineyard floor management, timing of harvest, irrigation) or site selection (altitude, aspect, soil water holding capacity). Conclusion: Climate change will induce changes in grape composition which will modify wine quality and typicity. However, these modifications can be limited through adaptations in the vineyard. Significance and impact of the study: This study assesses the impact of major climatic parameters (temperature, water and radiation) on vine physiology and grape ripening. It addresses the issue of how the expected changes under climate change will impact viticulture. It is shown that appropriate levers do exist to allow growers to adapt to this new situation. Among these, modifications in plant material and viticultural techniques are the most promising tools.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVitis 3aaltitude 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3agrapes 3airrigation 3amalic acid 3aodors 3aphenolic compounds 3aphenology 3arain 3aripening 3asecondary metabolites 3asoil water 3asugars 3asummer 3atemperature 3avines 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3awine quality 0aclimate change 0aadaptation 0aviticulture 0aplant material 0amanagement systems1 aDestrac-Irvine, Agnès0 tOENO One.g2017 May, v. 51, no. 2 p.147-154dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2016.0.0.16473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007100150245005600221520100800277592002801285650001901313650003101332650001701363650001801380650001901398650001501417650001001432650001001442650002801452650001701480650001501497650001501512650001501527650001901542650001001561650002101571650001301592650001401605650002201619650001601641653003101657653001001688653001901698700003401717773009201751856008501843852000901928655001201937IND60696714520221119023124.0200804e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069671452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plgene.2020.1002332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández Estévez, Ingrid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9693-827610a“Plant Glutathione S-transferases: An overview”  aGlutathione S-transferases (GST) belong to a super-family of multifunctional proteins and are one of the most important families of detoxifying enzymes in nature. There are involved in diverse intracellular events such as, primary and secondary metabolisms, stress metabolism, herbicide detoxification and plant protection against ozone damages, heavy metals, xenobiotics and microbes infections as well as in various aspects of seedling development, including hypocotyl elongation, anthocyanin accumulation, and the like. The crucial functions of GSTs have stimulated the development of novel applications in analytical and agricultural biotechnology. In this last field, GSTs are exploited in the development of transgenic plants with increased resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Deepening on the study of GST functions will allow addressing new strategies to improve the yields of agronomic crops, not only in the face of threats of climate change, but also for the agriculture of the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3aagricultural biotechnology 3aanthocyanins 3abiotic stress 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3acrops 3agenes 3aglutathione transferase 3aheavy metals 3aherbicides 3ahypocotyls 3ametabolism 3amicroorganisms 3aozone 3aplant protection 3aproteins 3aseedlings 3atransgenic plants 3axenobiotics 0aGlutathione S-transferases 0aPlant 0aDetoxification1 aRodríguez Hernández, Meilyn0 tPlant gene.g2020 Sept., v. 23 p.100233-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23305x2352-40737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plgene.2020.1002333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01702naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245010600164300001800270500001400288520035600302592002800658650002200686650001700708650001800725650002600743650001300769650002600782653002500808653004000833653001500873653005900888700002100947700002400968700001900992700002401011773018501035856007501220852000901295655001201304IND60691862020221118045718.0200502e20000101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069186202DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.64.23802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMATSUURA, Hideyuki10aQualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Endogenous Jasmonoids in Potato Plant (Solanum tuberosum L.)  ap. 2380-2387.  aNAL-light  aQualitative and quantitative analyses of endogenous jasmonoids were done by liquid chromatography/selected ion monitoring (LC-SIM) using deuterium-labeled compounds as internal standards.

After escaping captivity, both species spread into the Mississippi River Basin and now threaten to enter the Great Lakes. Human consumption is one solution, but many Americans believe that carp is unsavory. A random sample of 2,000 licensed anglers in Missouri was asked to complete a mail-back questionnaire about Asian carp, yielding a 27% response rate (n = 465). Results indicated that knowledge and perception about carp were poor, and food neophobia (fear of new foods) scores were above average. Less than 15% of respondents had eaten carp, but nearly 53% were willing to try. Marketing should focus on the benefits of consumption while downplaying any possible concerns. Although education programs are worthwhile, taste might be more influential to change public attitudes toward Asian carp.  aThis work was funded by the University of Missouri.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Missouridhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007165 3aAmericans (United States) 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3aHypophthalmichthys nobilis 3abiological control 3acarp 3aeducation programs 3afishermen 3ahumans 3amarketing 3apublic opinion 3aquestionnaires 3ataste 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aGreat Lakes 3aMississippi River 3aMissouri 0aAsian carp 0aconsumption 0afood 0aperceptions1 aHo, Yun0 tHuman dimensions of wildlife.g2018 Sept. 3, v. 23, no. 5 p.491-498dRoutledgewJournal:J000000084x1533-158X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10871209.2018.14859903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009400158300002000252520155900272592002801831650004401859650002901903650001701932650001501949650002101964650002201985650001502007650001902022650001902041650002602060650002202086650001302108650002402121700001702145700001702162700001702179700001402196700001802210700001502228700001902243700001602262700001802278773014302296856007402439852000902513655001202522IND60701204720221119112152.0200708e20200707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070120472DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta04350h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xue Lang10aHighly conductive fluorine-based anion exchange membranes with robust alkaline durability  ap. 13065-13076.  aAnion exchange membranes (AEMs) with robust alkaline stability and high ionic conductivity are imminently required for the promising electrochemical energy conversion devices – fuel cells. Herein, a series of novel crosslinked AEMs with hydrophobic fluorine-based polymer backbones bearing special functional sites and hydrophilic long flexible multi-cation side chains are prepared. Morphology observation and ion transport analysis confirm the existence of distinct microphase separation and efficient ion-conducting channels within the membranes resulting from the inherent chemical structure. A highest ionic conductivity of 136.27 mS cm⁻¹ can be achieved by TQ-PDBA-70% (IEC = 2.16 meq. g⁻¹) at 80 °C. Meanwhile, the prepared TQ-PDBA-X AEMs exhibit a desirable swelling ratio (<10%) and excellent mechanical properties (tensile stress > 22.8 MPa). It is worth noting that the retained ionic conductivity of the TQ-PDBA-70% AEM is 98.14%, 95.50%, 77.90%, 72.02% and 58.15% after being immersed in 1, 2, 4, 8 and 10 M KOH at 80 °C for 1000 h, respectively. Chemical structure change of the TQ-PDBA-70% AEM before and after the alkaline stability test is negligible, as revealed by FT-IR. Moreover, TQ-PDBA-70% has high ionic exchange capacity (IEC) retention and maintains good mechanical properties. A single cell assembled with TQ-PDBA-70% has a maximum power density of 158.8 mW cm⁻² under a current density of 360 mA cm⁻². These results suggest that this type of structure opens a new strategy for developing high performance AEMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aanion-exchange membranes 3acrosslinking 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3afuel cells 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amechanical properties 3amechanical stress 3apolymers 3apotassium hydroxide1 aSun, Li Xuan1 aWu, Hong Yue1 aZhu, Zhao Yu1 aXiao, Nan1 aChen, Jia Hui1 aYang, Qian1 aZhang, Qiu Gen1 aZhu, Ai Mei1 aLiu, Qing Lin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 July 7, v. 8, no. 26 p.13065-13076dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta04350h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245021600163520165300379592002802032650002002060650001302080650001402093650002902107650001602136650002202152650001102174650000902185650002202194650002102216650001502237650001302252650001902265650001802284650001102302650002002313650002602333651001002359651001502369653002502384653002802409653001802437653002402455653002102479700002202500700002302522700001302545700001402558773011502572856008302687852000902770655001202779IND60696714620221119023153.0200607e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069671462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2019.1008422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Weiwei10aTrophic ecology of Penaeus chinensis (Decapoda: Dendrobranchiata: Penaeidae) and potential competitive interactions with other species in the Haizhou Bay determined by carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis  aThe Chinese white shrimp Penaeus chinensis is one of the most economically important crustacean species in China with respects to both capture and aquaculture. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N) was analyzed to reveal its potential dietary characteristics, in particular contributions of primary producers as food sources, as well as isotopic niche width and potential food competitions with materials from Haizhou Bay in Yellow Sea, a state-level germplasm source conservation and stock recovery area. The results confirmed that bivalves served as an important diet of P.chinensis and the prawn incorporated a mixture of benthic microalgae and marine phytoplankton as food sources, while terrestrial organic matter supposed to be made minimum contributions. Benthic microalgae overwhelmingly dominated in the dietary proportion (mode), and accounted for 90% of the food sources in comparison with the contribution of 10% of marine phytoplankton. Penaeus chinensis was closest to Charybdis japonica and Dorippe japonica in isotopic compositions. Trophic niche widths were similar in P.chinensis and D. japonica, and they were larger than that of C.japonica, as determined by the sizes of SEAb (Bayesian standard ellipse areas). The overlaps of standard ellipse areas of P.chinensis with C. japonica and D. japonica were 98.5% and 86.5% respectively, indicating intense competition for food between P.chinensis and the other two species. In the views of food availability and competition, biomasses of benthic microalgae, bivalves and C.japonica and D.japonica may regulate the population of P.chinensis in Haizhou Bay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aBivalvia 3aCharybdis 3aFenneropenaeus chinensis 3aaquaculture 3abenthic organisms 3acarbon 3adiet 3afood availability 3aisotope labeling 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aphytoplankton 3ashrimp 3astable isotopes 3atrophic relationships 3aChina 3aYellow Sea 0aChinese white shrimp 0aDietary characteristics 0aTrophic level 0aTrophic niche width 0aFood competition1 aYokoyama, Hisashi1 aReid, William D.K.1 aFu, Jing1 aZhou, Jin0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2019 Nov., v. 32 p.100842-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2019.1008423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010900172300001600281520124400297592002801541650000801569650002301577650002001600650001001620650002601630650002201656650001301678653001201691653000901703653000901712653000801721653002001729653002001749653002501769653002501794700002701819700002201846700001701868773009401885856008501979852000902064655001202073IND60552093920221117043545.0161020e20141020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055209392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarbani, Behrooz10aCorrection of gene expression data: Performance-dependency on inter-replicate and inter-treatment biases  ap. 100-109.  aThis report investigates for the first time the potential inter-treatment bias source of cell number for gene expression studies. Cell-number bias can affect gene expression analysis when comparing samples with unequal total cellular RNA content or with different RNA extraction efficiencies. For maximal reliability of analysis, therefore, comparisons should be performed at the cellular level. This could be accomplished using an appropriate correction method that can detect and remove the inter-treatment bias for cell-number. Based on inter-treatment variations of reference genes, we introduce an analytical approach to examine the suitability of correction methods by considering the inter-treatment bias as well as the inter-replicate variance, which allows use of the best correction method with minimum residual bias. Analyses of RNA sequencing and microarray data showed that the efficiencies of correction methods are influenced by the inter-treatment bias as well as the inter-replicate variance. Therefore, we recommend inspecting both of the bias sources in order to apply the most efficient correction method. As an alternative correction strategy, sequential application of different correction approaches is also advised.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aanalytical methods 3agene expression 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3asequence analysis 3avariance 0aRNA-Seq 0aRPKM 0aStd. 0aTMM 0aData correction 0aGene expression 0aInter-replicate bias 0aInter-treatment bias1 aStewart, C.

The coordination is predicted, from first-principles density functional theory, to enable electronic pathways that could facilitate charge carrier mobility. Calculated frontier crystal orbitals indicate extended electronic communication in DMOF-1, but not in MOF-649. This feature is confirmed by band structure calculations and effective masses of the valence band edge. We explain the origin of the frontier orbitals of both MOFs based on the energy and symmetry alignment of the underlying building blocks. The effects of isovalent substitution on the band structure of MOF-649 are considered. Our findings highlight DMOF-1 as a potential semiconductor with enhanced 1D charge carrier mobility along the framework.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoordination polymers 3acopper 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3aligands 3anitrogen 3asemiconductors1 aCalbo, Joaquín1 aBristow, Jessica K.1 aWalsh, Aron0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 July 7, v. 8, no. 26 p.13160-13165dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta04466k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03453naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010800163300001400271500002000285520205400305592002802359650002602387650002202413650003002435650001402465650001802479650001302497650002702510650001602537650001902553650001402572650002502586650001802611650001002629700002102639700003102660700001802691700002202709700001702731700002102748773014202769856007502911852000902986655001202995IND60786363920221120231352.0220803e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078636392DNAL7 a10.1002/tafs.101152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeathers, T.

We sought to improve our understanding of how spatial isolation, occupancy range, and restricted gene flow influence contemporary phenotypic variation within and among native populations of Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis by examining the neutral genetic and phenotypic characteristics of 35 isolated headwater populations from Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Across a suite of 13 neutral microsatellite loci, we observed high levels of allelic fixation and considerable genetic differentiation among populations, subwatersheds, and watersheds that were consistent with patterns of isolation. We found significant positive correlations between allelic diversity and estimates of effective population size. In contrast, we observed considerably less phenotypic structure among streams, subwatersheds, and watersheds. Much of the observed phenotypic variation occurred among individuals within populations. Pairwise Mann–Whitney tests revealed no significant phenotypic differences among the populations of Brook Trout we examined. Similarly, there was no significant relationship between the amount of phenotypic variation within populations and any of the examined measures of genetic diversity or the amount of occupied habitat sampled, which suggests that unmeasured variables may be influencing morphometric and meristic variation within isolated populations. The observed patterns of isolation, genetic drift, and allelic fixation highlight the importance of enhancing population connectivity but also suggest that considerable phenotypic variability may persist within small, fragmented populations. Our results elucidate some challenges associated with managing and conserving isolated populations of Brook Trout and reinforce the importance of conducting genetic studies on fragmented populations to inform management decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvelinus fontinalis 3aallelic variation 3aeffective population size 3agene flow 3agenetic drift 3ahabitats 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amorphometry 3anational parks 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3asubwatersheds 3awater1 aKazyak, David C.1 aStauffer, Jay R., Jr.cJr.1 aKulp, Matt A.1 aMoore, Stephen E.1 aKing, Tim L.1 aCarlson, John E.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2019 Jan., v. 148, no. 1 p.58-72dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19703x0002-84877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.101153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245018100197300001600378500002000394520140400414592002801818596008501846596008501931596009102016650002502107650002802132650001802160650001002178650001502188650001802203650002302221650002602244650002302270650001702293650002002310650001002330650000902340650001402349650001402363650001702377650002802394650001202422700002402434700001802458773015102476856007402627852000902701655001202710IND60636439520221118044110.0190408e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063643952DNAL7 a10.1111/jwas.125872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaggi, Thiago1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5576-829010aFeeding of juvenile cobia, Rachycentron canadum: Evaluation of practical feeds, comparison of commercial fishmeal replacers, and estimation of essential amino acid requirements  ap. 317-335.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThree studies were conducted with juvenile cobia, Rachycentron canadum: (Study 1) a 10‐week feeding trial within floating net cages to test the nutritional efficacy of different dietary feeding regimes (trash‐fish control diet, a semimoist diet, an in‐house dry formulated diet, and a commercial cobia feed); (Study 2) a 10‐week feeding trial within an indoor water‐recirculating tank‐based system to test the nutritional efficiency of different potential dietary fishmeal replacers (poultry byproduct meal, soy protein concentrate, feather meal), a diet without taurine supplementation, and a commercial cobia feed; and (Study 3) estimation of the essential amino acid (EAA) requirements of cobia based on EAA whole‐body composition in fast‐growing cobia fed a trash‐fish‐based diet. Fish performance in terms of growth and feed efficiency was the greatest within the outdoor net‐cage feeding trial, with fish fed the control trash‐fish‐based diet exhibiting the best performance. Although fish growth was poorer within the indoor feeding trials, fish performance was similar for most diets, with apparent crude protein digestibility coefficients of over 75% being obtained in all experimental diets in both feeding trials. The estimated EAA requirements of cobia obtained during this study were similar to those reported for other similar marine carnivorous fish species.  aPublisher supplied data  a400713/2012‐8cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a406472/2012‐2cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a2014/04164‐02016/10772‐9cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aRachycentron canadum 3aamino acid requirements 3aanimal growth 3acages 3acarnivores 3acrude protein 3adigestible protein 3aessential amino acids 3aexperimental diets 3afeather meal 3afeed conversion 3afeeds 3afish 3afish meal 3ajuveniles 3apoultry meal 3asoy protein concentrate 3ataurine1 aTacon, Albert G.

This is applicable for lithium-ion cells with a graphite anode irrespective of the form factor, capacity or cathode chemistry. This new charging strategy leads to a seven-fold increase in cycle life and a concomitant improvement in the electrochemical performance. Conventional charging shows copious lithium plating swiftly followed by cell failure due to accelerated increase in the anode resistance. The anode potential controlled charging strategy, based on a three-electrode cell construction, exhibits minimal increase in the anode resistance and shows no signs of lithium plating in operational extremes. Optical micrographs and high-resolution scanning electron images confirm that the graphite anode in the conventionally charged Li-ion cell undergoes significant loss in porosity resulting in massive underlithiation and dramatic capacity fading. The degradation rate in the anode is decelerated in anode potential controlled charging by ensuring that plating potential is not reached and improving ion transport in the anode even at low temperatures due to the absence of decomposition products that would have formed during plating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3alithium 3aporosity 3atemperature1 aBarsukov, Yevgen1 aMukherjee, Partha P.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 July 7, v. 8, no. 26 p.13077-13085dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta04467a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003500148245014900183520153500332592002801867650002201895650002201917650001701939650001001956650001201966650002101978650002301999650001402022650001902036650001402055650001402069650002502083650002202108650001802130650001202148650001202160650001302172650000902185650001002194650001902204653001302223653001102236653002802247700002402275700002202299700002502321773011502346856008302461852000902544655001202553IND60696714920221119023424.0200607e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069671492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2019.1008292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández Severini, Melisa D.10aMicroplastics in oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and water at the Bahía Blanca Estuary (Southwestern Atlantic): An emerging issue of global concern  aDetection of microplastics (MPs) in biotic and abiotic matrices is relevant to evaluate how marine ecosystem’s exposure to these pollutants is of emerging environmental concern and at risk of loss of functionality and biodiversity. The presence of MPs was studied for the first time in the gut of benthic oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and in the water column in a eutrophic estuary under high anthropogenic pressure, in the southwestern Atlantic. Significant abundances of small plastic debris were found at all the sampling stations- mainly fibers, fragments, pellets, and beads. MPs were categorized and counted according to type, color, and size. Microfibers presented the highest percentage of abundance in the water column (98% with Van Dorn bottles and 72.73 % with a 60μm plankton net) as well as in oysters (91%). In water collected with Van Dorn bottles, the total MP concentrations ranged from 5900 to 782,000 particles/m³ and from 42.6 to 113.6 particles/m³ in samples collected with a 60μm plankton net. The widespread presence of fibers in all the assessed components could be related to the intense harbor activities in the area, such as the use of ropes for the mooring of boats and from fishing nets, as well as from domestic and industrial effluents. The presence of MPs in both the pelagic and benthic realms may imply risk for the animals that inhabit the estuary, and for human wellbeing, with respect to the potential transfer of MPs through the food web, affecting the provisioning of ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea gigas 3abenthic organisms 3abiodiversity 3aboats 3abottles 3adigestive system 3aecosystem services 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3afish nets 3afood webs 3aindustrial effluents 3amarine ecosystems 3amicroplastics 3aoysters 3apellets 3aplankton 3arisk 3aropes 3asocial welfare 0aPlastics 0aFibers 0aEnvironmental pollution1 aVillagran, Diana M.1 aBuzzi, Natalia S.1 aSartor, G.

Amongst the major producers are Brazil, China, United States, Mexico and some European countries. Brazil is the largest sweet orange producer accounting for more than three-quarters of the orange juice exports around the world, followed by China and the United States (Foreign Agricultural Service/USDA, 2019). Although juice is the main commodity in many countries producing citrus, by-products like essential oils, molasses, dried pulp, pectin, blend syrup and others are also part of the citrus trade chain. Since citriculture is threatened by several pathogens and its control is mainly based on regular chemical applications both during plant development and post-harvest, management becomes a non-environmentally friendly strategy. Meanwhile, consumers are searching for sustainable products of great quality and high aggregated value pressuring the agricultural industry to crop in a sustainable manner. In this scenario, citriculture also needs innovative solutions to meet such demand. Although classic breeding programs succeeded over time, citrus narrow genetic base and long evaluation periods turns it difficult to demand faster solutions for emerging problems. Biotechnology rises as a source of innovative solutions since new varieties can be developed for specific problems. In this context, the use of biotechnology approaches involving genetic engineering that allow the development of more resistant varieties are the focus of many research groups. Here we show how biotechnology has been used to develop citrus plants more resistant to the main phytopathogens that impact citrus production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aagricultural industry 3abiotechnology 3abreeding programs 3acitriculture 3acrop production 3adisease resistance 3aessential oils 3afruit growing 3agenetic engineering 3amolasses 3anew variety 3aorange juice 3aoranges 3apectins 3aplant development 3aplant pathogens 3apulp 3aBrazil 0aTransgenic plants 0aGMO 0aNew breeding techniques1 aTeixeira-Silva, N.S.1 aGranato, L.M.1 aDorta, S.O.1 aRodrigues, C.M.1 aMitre, L.K.1 aYochikawa, J.T.H.1 aFischer, E.R.1 aNascimento, C.A.1 aSouza-Neto, R.R.1 aTakita, M.A.1 aBoscariol-Camargo, R.L.1 aMachado, M.A.1 aDe Souza, A.A.0 tBiotechnology Research and Innovation.g2019, v. 3 p.95-109dElsevier Editora Ltda.wJournal:23600x2452-07217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biori.2019.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007600165300002200241520112100263592002801384650002701412650002201439650000801461650001901469650001101488650002001499650001101519650001401530650001301544650001301557650001701570650002901587650001201616653002801628653001301656653002401669653001601693700001701709700001401726700002101740700001301761700001601774700002601790700001701816700002101833700001501854700002701869700001701896700002301913700001701936700001401953773010201967856008302069852000902152655001202161IND60694002520221122030344.0210603e20200625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069400252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBost, Pierre10aHost-Viral Infection Maps Reveal Signatures of Severe COVID-19 Patients  ap. 1475-1488.e12.  aViruses are a constant threat to global health as highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, lack of data underlying how the human host interacts with viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus, limits effective therapeutic intervention. We introduce Viral-Track, a computational method that globally scans unmapped single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data for the presence of viral RNA, enabling transcriptional cell sorting of infected versus bystander cells. We demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of Viral-Track to systematically detect viruses from multiple models of infection, including hepatitis B virus, in an unsupervised manner. Applying Viral-Track to bronchoalveloar-lavage samples from severe and mild COVID-19 patients reveals a dramatic impact of the virus on the immune system of severe patients compared to mild cases. Viral-Track detects an unexpected co-infection of the human metapneumovirus, present mainly in monocytes perturbed in type-I interferon (IFN)-signaling. Viral-Track provides a robust technology for dissecting the mechanisms of viral-infection and pathology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoronavirus infections 3aHepatitis B virus 3aRNA 3aanimal viruses 3ahumans 3amixed infection 3amodels 3amonocytes 3apandemic 3apatients 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviruses 0avirus host interactions 0aCOVID-19 0asingle-cell RNA-seq 0aViral-Track1 aGiladi, Amir1 aLiu, Yang1 aBendjelal, Yanis1 aXu, Gang1 aDavid, Eyal1 aBlecher-Gonen, Ronnie1 aCohen, Merav1 aMedaglia, Chiara1 aLi, Hanjie1 aDeczkowska, Aleksandra1 aZhang, Shuye1 aSchwikowski, Benno1 aZhang, Zheng1 aAmit, Ido0 tCell.g2020 June 25, v. 181, no. 7 p.1475-1488.e12dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002300146245009200169300001000261500000900271500001500280520138800295592002801683650002701711650002601738650000901764650002801773650001901801650002001820650001501840650001801855650001701873650002701890650001801917650001801935651000901953653001701962653001801979653001101997700001602008700001502024700001602039773010802055852000902163856008302172655001202255IND4380617720221118064525.0191122e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438061772DNAL7 a10.1094/CM-2004-0301-01-RS2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcAndrews, Gina M.10aForage Yield and Nutritive Value of Oat Interseeded with Berseem Clover and Sweetclover  ap. 0.  aepub  a2019-12-06  aCrop rotations that include an oat-legume crop provide several potential benefits, including improving soil structure, and reducing pests, soil erosion, and nutrient run-off. The market for oat (Avena sativaL.) is limited; however, oat may provide a beneficial addition to forage when grown with a legume. Over two years, oat was interseeded with berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinumL.) and sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis(L.) Lam.) and harvested at two oat growth stages. The yield and nutritive value of each oat-legume mixture was determined. Oat-sweetclover had greater dry matter yield in two of the three experiments. At both harvest growth stages, there was no difference in neutral detergent fiber (NDF) between oat-berseem clover and oat-sweetclover. Likewise, there was no difference in crude protein between the two oat-legume mixtures at either growth stage. In vitro dry matter digestibility was the same for oat-berseem and oat-sweetclover. Overall, the binary mixtures had greater yield, crude protein, and digestibility than oat. A decision of whether to plant oat-berseem clover or an oat-sweetclover forage mixture in a crop rotation should be based on the use of the legume crop after the oat crop has been harvested for forage, the preferred method to kill the forage for the following season, and the preferred use of the land following the oat-legume crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3ain vitro digestibility 3aMelilotus officinalis 3aoats 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aforage legumes 3anutritive value 3acrop yield 3acrude protein 3aAvena sativa 3aTrifolium alexandrinum 3aintercropping 3acrop rotation 3aIowa 0aforage crops 0afiber content 0aforage1 aKim, Franke1 aKen, Moore1 aRon, George0 tCrop management.g2004 Mar., v. 3, no. 1 p.0-0dPlant Management NetworkwJournal:6161x1543-78337nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CM-2004-0301-01-RS3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03143naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024004600137040001800183100001900201245020300220300001600423520165800439592002802097650001502125650001302140650002802153650001602181650001702197650002302214650002302237650001602260650001402276650001202290653001202302653001402314653001902328653001302347653001502360653001602375700001602391700001502407700001902422700001902441773011402460856009002574852000902664655001202673IND60532370320221116193357.0190318e20150420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053237032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.02.0122doi7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.02.0122chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHawkyard, Matt10aEvaluation of liposomes for the enrichment of rotifers (Brachionus sp.) with taurine and their subsequent effects on the growth and development of northern rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra) larvae  ap. 118-125.  aThe naturally occurring taurine concentrations of rotifers (Brachionus sp.) may not be sufficient to meet the nutritional demands of several species of marine fish larvae. In this study, we evaluated the use of liposomes for taurine-enrichment of rotifers and compared them with standard methods in which taurine was dissolved in the rotifer enrichment water i.e., the “dissolved method”. Each enrichment method was further evaluated by determining the growth performance of northern rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra) larvae fed on the taurine-enriched rotifers. Results indicated that rotifers enriched with taurine-containing liposomes obtained approximately 1.2% taurine on a dry weight basis, similar to the upper concentrations reported in wild copepods and approximately 10-fold higher than in control rotifers. Northern rock sole larvae grew significantly larger, were more developed and had higher whole body taurine concentrations when fed rotifers enriched with taurine-containing liposomes, compared to larvae fed either unenriched rotifers or rotifers enriched with equivalent concentrations of taurine using the dissolved method. The dissolved method required 60× more taurine to achieve rotifer enrichment levels and larval growth performance observed using the liposome-enrichment method. Fluorescent markers indicated that rotifers were able to break down liposomes, liberating water-soluble nutrients into their guts and body cavity. Differences and similarities are discussed between the efficacy of liposomes and previously studied wax spray beads (WSB) for rotifer enrichment and subsequent nutritional effects on fish larvae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachionus 3aCopepoda 3aLepidopsetta polyxystra 3afish larvae 3afluorescence 3agrowth performance 3alarval development 3amarine fish 3anutrients 3ataurine 0aTaurine 0aLiposomes 0aMicroparticles 0aRotifers 0aEnrichment 0aFish larvae1 aLaurel, Ben1 aBarr, Yoav1 aHamre, Kristin1 aLangdon, Chris0 tAquaculture.g2015 Apr. 20, v. 441 p.118-125dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03611naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245008400162300001300246500002000259520210700279592002802386596004802414596003602462596001002498596000902508596003502517596003402552650002402586650001702610650002602627650001602653650001802669650001502687650001002702650003502712650001102747650001002758651001902768700002002787700002202807700002102829700001902850700002302869773014102892856007503033852000903108655001203117IND60786364320221120213040.0220803e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078636432DNAL7 a10.1002/tafs.101132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlowers, H.

Success of stocking efforts relies upon fish behavior and survival to maximize the availability of fish to anglers. We quantitatively described the movement behavior and survival of stocked Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis, Brown Trout Salmo trutta, and Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in three southern Appalachian Mountain streams in western North Carolina, USA, that were managed under delayed harvest regulations. Hatchery trout were tagged with a combination of PIT tags and radio transmitters (radio tags); stocked into “Delayed Harvest Trout Waters” of the North Toe, East Prong Roaring, and Little rivers; and monitored during the catch‐and‐release season from October to June. Assessed according to river and species, 19–65% of trout emigrated from the delayed harvest study reaches, while 1–29% died within the reaches. The majority of radio‐tagged fish (71%; 59–85% by river) remained within 2 km of the stocking location, whereas 6% migrated over 10 km from the stocking location. Few trout stocked during fall (October and November) were available to anglers the following June due to a combination of migration and mortality. Emigration from delayed harvest study reaches was associated with stocking and high‐flow events. Multi‐state modeling detailed these observations with weekly estimates of migration and survival rates. River‐specific differences in emigration and mortality suggested that emigration was a greater source of trout loss than mortality in all rivers; no pattern related to river size was apparent in emigration, but mortality was greater in small streams. Brook Trout mortality rates were highest among the three species, and large fish of most species showed higher emigration and mortality than catchable‐sized trout. Fisheries managers can apply our results to alter stocking regimes so as to enhance the efficiency of stocking and the acclimation of stocked trout to instream environments.  aPublisher supplied data  cFederal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Funds  cNorth Carolina State University  cNCWRC  cUSGS  cU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  cWildlife Management Institute 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aSalmo trutta 3aSalvelinus fontinalis 3aacclimation 3afish behavior 3ahatcheries 3aradio 3aradio frequency identification 3arivers 3atrout 3aNorth Carolina1 aKwak, Thomas J.1 aFischer, Jesse R.1 aCope, W.

The present study was carried out to study bacterial population dynamics in consortium Vatva soil sample (VSS) during azo dye ROM2R degradation and to identify the consortium members that were actively involved in the degradation process. To achieve this goal, a real-time Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay targeting species-specific region of 16S rDNA of each consortial bacteria was developed to provide quantitative information about the bacterial abundance during azo dye degradation. The real-time PCR assay indicated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa (VSS-6) dominated consortium bacterial community during the active continuous bioremediation process. Attempt has been made to scale up from 100 ml volume to 10 L operation volume with intermittent additions (batch fed loadings) in a Sequence batch reactor (SBR). The development of VSS consortium biomass (MLVSS), changes in COD and biochemical oxygen demand, and the dye degradation were studied under conditions simulating the operations of biological effluent treatment in an attempt to develop a commercially applicable dye effluent treatment process unit.  aKadi Sarva Vishwavidyalaya, sector-23 Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India.  aPublisher supplied data  a50,000/-cKadi Sarva Vishwavidyalaya 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aazo dyes 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3achemical oxygen demand 3adecolorization 3aenrichment culture 3aphytotoxicity 3apopulation dynamics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3asoil 3awastewater 0aBacterial consortium 0abiodegradation 0aazo dye 0areal-time PCR 0aPseudomonas 0aBacillus cereus 0aEnterococcus casseliflavus 0aStenotrophomonas maltophilia 0aSBR 0ascale up1 aJohnson, Jenny1 aDatta, Madamwar1 aLakshmi, Bhaskaran Jayachandran0 tBioremediation journal.g2018 Apr. 3, v. 22, no. 1-2 p.63-71dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000055x1547-65297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10889868.2018.14764523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245010100166506002800267520108000295592002801375506003701403650001501440650001301455650002301468650001901491650001201510650002701522650001901549650001801568650001601586650001001602650001501612650001301627650000701640650001501647650001101662650001101673700002001684700001901704700002301723700002301746773009601769856008301865852000901948655001201957IND60739923120221207085324.0200302s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073992312DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202017001132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOleg, Olenin10aDigital monitoring of agro-ecosystems indicators on the basis of space and unmanned technologies  aResource is Open Access  aThe aim of the research is to develop a digital monitoring methodology for agro-ecosystem indicators based on space and unmanned technologies with the conversion of digital aerial photography results into real parameters of agrophytocenosis indicators as physical units.

In this study, the heritability of body weight and survival under two grow-out temperature conditions, genotype by environment interaction for body weight and survival at different grow-out temperatures, and the heritability of cold tolerance traits of P. vannamei were investigated and estimated. The heritability estimates for body weight in normal controls (CK) and low-temperature groups (LTT) were, respectively, moderate (0.3191±0.0622) and low (0.1368±0.0889), and those for survival were all low (0.1094±0.0265 and 0.0598±0.0229, respectively). The genetic correlations between the CK and LTT groups for body weight and survival were 0.4788±0.2073 and 0.2968±0.2284 respectively, and both of them showed significant differences from unity (P<0.05). Furthermore, their K-values were all higher than 0.50, which indicated that the genotype-by-environment interaction effect was substantial in both growth and survival at different temperatures. The cold tolerance heritability estimated from a cold temperature challenge (18°C to 8°C) using cooling degree hours for each individual (CDH) and survival rate of each family at half lethal time (SR50) were low (0.0258±0.0205 and 0.0211±0.0196 respectively), and negative genetic correlations between these cold tolerance traits and body weight (−0.7702±0.4583 and −0.8253±0.4553 respectively) were also estimated from the cold challenge. However, they showed no statistically significant differences from zero. Thus, more research needs to be conducted on the more accurate heritability of cold tolerance trait and genetic correlations between traits in P. vannamei to further improve the achievement of breeding goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3abody weight 3abreeding 3acold 3acold tolerance 3acooling 3agenetic correlation 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrowing season 3aheritability 3asurvival rate 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 0aPenaeus vannamei 0aHeritability 0aGenotype by environment interaction 0aCold tolerance 0aBody weight 0aSurvival1 aLuan, Sheng1 aLuo, Kun1 aSui, Juan1 aXu, Xiaodong1 aTan, Jian1 aKong, Jie0 tAquaculture.g2015 Apr. 20, v. 441 p.8-15dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03372naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011300156300002000269520199200289592002802281650001302309650001502322650002302337650003402360650002202394650001302416650000902429650001302438650002102451650002102472650001702493650002002510650001902530650003002549700001602579700002102595700002002616700001702636700001402653700002102667773014302688856007402831852000902905655001202914IND60701205420221119112017.0200708e20200707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070120542DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta04712k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Ruirui10aEnhancing solar–thermal–electric energy conversion based on m-PEGMA/GO synergistic phase change aerogels  ap. 13207-13217.  aThermoelectric power generation from solar radiation or waste heat has attracted tremendous attention due to strong global demand for cost-effective, pollution-free forms of energy conversion. However, the storage and sustainable release of thermal energy, as essential factors for thermoelectric generators (TEGs), remain great challenges. Herein, a TEG based on phase change aerogels (PCAs) has been fabricated to enhance the solar–thermal–electric energy conversion. The PCAs exhibit synergistic phase change properties, excellent thermal reliability, and shape-stabilized properties and can overcome the drawbacks of enthalpy degradation and leakage existing in the phase change materials (PCMs). Under the radiation of simulated solar light, the voltage and current output of the PCA-loaded TEG (∼144 mV, 14.8 mA) are approximately 3 times and 2.7 times that of a blank one (∼48 mV, 5.4 mA), respectively, and the thermal-to-electricity conversion maximum efficiency is enhanced by about 61.3% compared to that of the blank one. The sustained thermal release based on PCAs enables a sustainable electric output when solar light or the heat source is removed. In proof-of-concept experiments, the PCA-loaded TEGs can instantly light up commercial LEDs, drive various portable electronic gadgets, and charge several different capacitors. The sustainable lighting time of eighty green LEDs directly powered by PCA-loaded TEGs is about 4 times longer than that of the blank one. In particular, the maximum value of the voltage difference (ΔV) of LEDs powered by PCA-loaded TEGs and the blank one is up to 1.74 V. Therefore, the PCA-loaded TEGs have enhanced power supply capability when removing solar radiation or the heat source. This study expands the application of PCMs in TEGs and promises a new potential application in advanced energy-related devices and systems for solar energy utilization and storage, self-powered sensing systems, waste heat reuse and other fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3acapacitors 3acost effectiveness 3aelectric potential difference 3aenergy conversion 3aenthalpy 3aheat 3alighting 3aphase transition 3apower generation 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3athermal energy 3athermoelectric generators1 aSun, Dequan1 aWang, Liangliang1 aYan, Zhengguang1 aLiu, Wenquan1 aWang, Xin1 aZhang, Xingxiang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 July 7, v. 8, no. 26 p.13207-13217dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta04712k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01705naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245005500209300001600264520062500280592002800905650001800933650001600951650002300967650002300990650001601013650004401029650002201073650001301095700006101108773011801169856008301287852000901370655001201379IND60627220820221119140459.0190128e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062722082DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.8b034512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkumu, Antony A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4641-784310aSynthesis of the C1–C19 Domain of Azaspiracid-34  ap. 356-359.  aAzaspiracid-34 (AZA34) is a recently described structurally unique member of the azaspiracid class of marine neurotoxins. Its novel structure, tentatively assigned on the basis of MS and ¹H NMR spectroscopy, is accompanied by a 5.5-fold higher level of toxicity against Jurkat T lymphocytes than AZA1. To completely assign the structure of AZA34 and provide material for in-depth biological evaluation and detection, synthetic access to AZA34 was targeted. This began with the convergent and stereoselective assembly of the C1–C19 domain of AZA34 designed to dovetail with the recent total synthesis approach to AZA3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aazaspiracid 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aneurotoxins 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astereoselectivity 3atoxicity1 aForsyth, Craig J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0836-81870 tOrganic letters.g2019 Jan. 02, v. 21, no. 2 p.356-359dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.8b034513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003800140245012700178300002000305520116700325592002801492650002601520650002501546650002801571650002101599650002101620650002201641650001301663650001901676700002001695700002901715700002201744700002101766773014301787856007401930852000902004655001202013IND60701205620221119112010.0200708e20200707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070120562DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta04939e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Lourdes Gonzalez-Juarez, Maria10aElectrochemical deposition and thermoelectric characterisation of a semiconducting 2-D metal–organic framework thin film  ap. 13197-13206.  aThe electrical conductivity and porosity of the 2-dimensional metal–organic framework Cu₃(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene)₂ [Cu₃(HHTP)₂] make it a promising candidate for thermoelectric applications. In this work, we report the electrochemical synthesis of Cu₃(HHTP)₂ films by an anodization approach and an evaluation of its thermoelectric properties. The electrochemically synthesised Cu₃(HHTP)₂ thin films were transferred using a wet chemical method in order to perform electrical measurements. We are reporting the first thermoelectric measurements of this framework both in bulk and thin film form which resulted in Seebeck coefficients of −7.24 μV K⁻¹ and −121.4 μV K⁻¹ with a power factor of 3.15 × 10⁻³ μW m⁻¹ for the film respectively. The negative Seebeck coefficients suggest that Cu₃(HHTP)₂ behaves as an n-type semiconductor. Since the introduction of conductive MOFs in electronic devices is at an early stage of development, we believe this work validates the use of electrochemical synthetic routes of conducting MOFs to further investigate and expand their applications in thin film technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoordination polymers 3adevelopmental stages 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrosynthesis 3afilms (materials) 3aporosity 3asemiconductors1 aFlores, Eduardo1 aMartin-Gonzalez, Marisol1 aNandhakumar, Iris1 aBradshaw, Darren0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 July 7, v. 8, no. 26 p.13197-13206dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta04939e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02181naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245016500162300001800327500001400345520069600359592002801055650000901083650002401092650001001116650001801126650003201144650001901176650001601195650002601211650000901237653002101246653001101267653002801278653001601306653002901322700002101351700002101372700001901393700002001412700002201432773018501454856007501639852000901714655001201723IND60691863120221118045809.0200502e20000101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069186312DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.64.24542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshihara, Kenji,10aPurification of Stearidonic Acid (18:4(n-3)) and Hexadecatetraenoic Acid (16:4(n-3)) from Algal Fatty Acid with Lipase and Medium Pressure Liquid Chromatography  ap. 2454-2457.  aNAL-light  aStearidonic acid (18:4(n-3)) and hexadecatetraenoic acid (16:4(n-3)) are included in some edible marine algae such as Undaria pinnatifida and Ulva pertusa with relatively high compositions (up to 40%) of total fatty acids.

The syringe process suffers from engine failure and low maintenance inefficiencies. Increasing efficiency can be done by mapping the maintenance value flow (MVSM) and the Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) method. Activities using the RCM method formulate the optimal replacement schedule for the V-Belt component, namely 437.4 days (V-Belt delivers power to the drive), 527.386906 days (V-Belt delivers power to the finishing machine), 557.73 days (V-Belt delivery power to the crusher), 557.73 days (V-Belt transmitting power to the six in one engine), and 500.05 days (V-Belt transmitting power to the GT engine). The flow of engine maintenance using the MVSM method has a positive impact on the lag time for engine maintenance to be 36.43%. The results of this study provide several recommendations, namely the implementation of 5S, improvement of standard operating procedures (SOP), training and coaching of workers, and purchasing spare parts before the damage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acrushers 3aengines 3afinishes 3afinishing 3amethodology 3apurchasing 3astandard operating procedures 3asyringes 0acorrective 0amvsm 0arcm 0asop1 aSoekarno, Siswoyo1 aSuryaningrat, Ida Bagus0 tJurnal Teknik Pertanian.g2020 Dec., v. 9, no. 4 p.287-296dJurusan Teknik Pertanian Universitas LampungwJournal:27834x2549-08187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.23960/jtep-l.v9.i4.287-2963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011800173300001600291520145000307592002801757650002001785650001701805650001001822650001101832650001601843651001401859653001701873653001501890653001501905653002201920653001301942653001301955653002201968653001401990653001102004773011102015856008502126852000902211655001202220IND60610284820221118002340.0180827e20181002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061028482DNAL7 a10.1080/13235818.2017.14090692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolcroft, Lorelle10aProtoconch sculpture as a taxonomic tool in Australian charopid systematics (Gastropoda: Eupulmonata: Charopidae)  ap. 258-273.  aCharopidae represent one of the most speciose land snail faunas in Australia with an estimated 750 species, mostly being less than 5 mm in shell diameter. The majority of its species are undescribed. With limited available material suitable for molecular analysis, morphological methods remain the primary technique for the identification of charopid species, and recent studies have shown that the sculptural patterns on the protoconch are diagnostic in establishing a generic signature. This study attempts to establish a formal framework for the description of the protoconch patterns for those species currently considered to be members of the eastern Australian Gyrocochlea sensu lato (s.l.) group of charopids. The protoconch sculpture of 60 species and 72 putative species of Gyrocochlea s.l. were examined and grouped by sculptural pattern and location. Eleven major configurations are identified, defined and described. It is intended that this terminology will be the benchmark for future descriptions of the protoconch characteristics of Australian charopid species and their generic placement. Implications for the past generic allocation of some Gyrocochlea s.l. species are discussed. Evidence from this study also indicates that there is local geographic consistency in the distribution of the protoconch patterns and a broad latitudinal sequence of pattern turnover. The biogeographic implications of this are briefly explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStylommatophora 3abiogeography 3afauna 3asnails 3aterminology 3aAustralia 0aBiogeography 0acancellate 0aCharopidae 0ageneric framework 0amalleate 0aMollusca 0aprotoconch radial 0asculpture 0aspiral0 tMolluscan research.g2018 Oct. 2, v. 38, no. 4 p.258-273dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19693x1448-60677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13235818.2017.14090693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002500165245007100190300001600261520064200277592002800919650000900947650001200956650002000968650001200988650001701000650001201017650004301029650000901072650003501081650000901116650004401125650002201169650006301191650005801254650006401312651002601376700002701402700002401429700002401453700002401477700002501501700002501526773012301551852000901674856008301683655001201766IND4399739420221120200430.0181127e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439973942DNAL7 a179889152pmid7 a10.1016/j.jfms.2007.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorgozinho, Katia B.10aCatheter-induced urethral trauma in cats with urethral obstruction  ap. 481-486.  aFifteen cats were evaluated with urethral obstruction.

The clients considered their cats to have a good quality of life following surgery.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3aurethra 3aanimal injuries 3asurgery 3acase studies 2aAnimals 2aCat Diseasesxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aCats 2aIatrogenic Diseasexveterinary 2aMale 2aPostoperative Complicationsxveterinary 2aUrethraxinjuries 2aUrethral Obstructionxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aUrinary Catheterizationxadverse effectsxveterinary. 2aUrinary Diversionxstatistics & numerical dataxveterinary. 0aBrazilxepidemiology.1 ade Souza, Heloisa J.M.1 aPereira, Adriana N.1 aBelchior, Cristiane1 ada Silva, Michel A.1 aMartins, Marina C.L.1 aDamico, Cristiane B.0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 9, no. 6 p.481-486dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1098-612X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2007.09.0023Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02793naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245006100134300001400195506002800209520171900237592002801956506003701984650001302021650001102034650002102045650001402066650001402080650001602094653002302110653002102133653002302154653001902177700001602196700002302212700001602235700002002251773012702271852000902398655001202407IND60739923520221207085310.0210420e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073992352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanishoaib, S. A.14aThe Study of Energy Loss in Stepped- Labyrinth Spillways  ap. 29-41.  aResource is Open Access  aA ‘spillway’ is a structure used to provide the controlled release of flood water from upstream into downstream area of a dam. As an important component of every dam, a spillway should be constructed strongly, reliably and efficiently to be used at any moment. Labyrinth and stepped spillways are presented as appropriate modifications to those spillways hardly capable of managing the maximum potential discharge. Owing to their nonlinear crests for a given width, labyrinth and stepped spillways have a larger discharge rate than linear- crest spillways at an identical height. Compared to other energy dissipaters, the combination of stepped and labyrinth spillways is known as a very strong energy dissipater. In the following part, the combination of these two structures and their dimensional change for increasing the water- energy dissipation are addressed. To conduct this study, an experimental flume with a 90- degree bend in the Islamic Azad University of Ahwaz was used. In total, 90 experiments were conducted on three different labyrinth- shape stepped spillway models with two different lengths, three different widths, and five different discharges. Analysis of the results showed a greater energy loss reduction in triangular rather than rectangular or trapezoidal labyrinth- shape stepped spillways. In addition, energy loss was greater in labyrinth spillways with two cycles than those with one cycle. Energy loss was increased by raising the Froude number from 0.05 to 0.1; in contrast, energy loss was decreased with increasing the Froude number from 0.1 to 1.0, which was due to the submergence of steps, a decrease in the roughness of steps and an increase in the intensity of aeration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaeration 3aenergy 3ahydraulic flumes 3aroughness 3aspillways 3asubmergence 0alabyrinth spillway 0astepped spillway 0aenergy dissipation 0aphysical model1 aBordbar, A.1 aKamanbedast, A.

Grazing had no effects on vegetation and soil C, but increased vegetation and soil N. As indicated by grazing increasing △δ¹³C and reducing soil δ¹⁵N, grazing accelerated soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition but decelerated the rate of N production. Contrasting effects of increased SOC decomposition and allocation of more belowground biomass are suggested to be responsible for SOC not changing. The effects of grazing on plant δ¹³C differed among species, but for most species grazing increased plant δ¹³C. However, grazing reduced vegetation δ¹³C, the opposite trends of species and community levels indicating that grazing would change plant species composition. Reduced Δδ¹⁵N indicates that grazing would change the main N sources used by plants. The study emphasizes that measuring plant and soil δ¹³C, δ¹⁵N, △δ¹³C and △δ¹⁵N simultaneously is necessary to comprehensively understand how grazing influences C and N dynamics in plant-soil systems. We also raise the concern that grazing would eventually lead to loss of SOC with consequent decline in C sequestration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3abelowground biomass 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3adecline 3agrasslands 3anitrogen 3asoil 3asoil organic carbon 3aspecies diversity 3avegetation cover 0aCarbon content 0aNitrogen content 0aSoil organic carbon decomposition 0aNitrogen dynamics1 aDing, Yong1 aLi, Haibo1 aXu, Xinyang1 aLi, Yinghua1 aZhang, Wenbo1 aLin, Hong0 tJournal of arid environments.g2020 Aug., v. 179 p.104198-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2020.1041983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245014600185300001800331520113700349592002801486650001301514650001501527650001101542650001501553650001501568650002601583650002401609650002301633650003801656650001301694650002101707650001901728651001601747651001801763700001401781700001701795773011601812856004801928852000901976655001201985IND50074369220221120093800.0140330e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007436922DNAL7 a244643962pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-014-3615-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Seung-Jae13aAn automated monitoring of atmospheric mixing height from routine radiosonde profiles over South Korea using a web-based data transfer method  ap. 3253-3263.  aThis study describes an effort to estimate atmospheric mixing height using vertical profiles of thermodynamic variables measured operationally at radiosonde sites in South Korea. We focus on mixing height at 06UTC (15LST) when vigorous daytime convection is expected with clear skies. For this purpose, we developed a simple numerical algorithm using a new data transfer tool, known as cURL, to determine mixing height and applied it to radiosonde data at Osan and Gwangju for 2010. Emphasis was placed on automating as much as possible the process of determining mixing height. According to the preliminary results, the estimation algorithm performed successfully for most cases with clear sky conditions and was useful in diagnosing and monitoring daytime mixing heights more effectively on a near-real-time basis. With the developed algorithm, it is possible to estimate mixing heights from radiosonde data within a few hours of the development of the convective boundary layer. Application to radiosonde sites in other countries is straightforward and continued modifications of the algorithm are anticipated in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aalgorithms 3amixing 3amonitoring 2aAlgorithms 2aAtmospherexchemistry 2aComputer Simulation 2aDatabases, Factual 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aInternet 2aModels, Chemical 2aThermodynamics 3aSouth Korea 0aKorea (South)1 aKim, Joon1 aCho, Chun-Ho0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2014 May, v. 186, no. 5 p.3253-3263dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3615-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245009700161300001800258500001900276520095400295592002801249650001201277650001801289650001201307650001301319650002001332650000901352650001101361653002401372653002301396653001301419653001101432700001901443700002201462773018501484856007501669852000901744655001201753IND60691863320221118045759.0200502e20000101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069186332DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.64.24622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKONISHI, Yotaro10aIncreases in 1,5-Anhydroglucitol Levels in Germinating Amaranth Seeds and in Ripening Banana  ap. 2462-2465.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo examine whether 1,5-anhydroglucitol (AG) is derived from starch degradation in plant tissues, we colorimetrically measured AG contents of germinating amaranth seeds and ripening banana pulp. In both cases, as starch degradation proceeded, AG levels were significantly increased, but were 1,700-5,000 times lower than those of total soluble carbohydrates. α-1,4-Glucan lyase activity, which is measured by the 1,5- anhydrofructose (AF) liberated from non-reducing glucose residues of starch or glycogen, was too low to be detected in amaranth or banana by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method. On the other hand, AF reductase, which reduces AF to AG, was detected in germinating amaranth seeds and banana pulp. Thus, the increases in AG levels are conceived to be derived from starch breakdown, although further investigation is needed to answer whether the starch degradation pathway via α-1,4-glucan lyase/AF reductase exists in plant tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3abananas 3abiotechnology 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3aoxidoreductases 3apulp 3astarch 0a1,5-Anhydroglucitol 0astarch degradation 0aamaranth 0abanana1 aHASHIMA, Keiko1 aKISHIDA, Kunihiro0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2000 Jan. 1, v. 64, no. 11 p.2462-2465dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.64.24623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245009200164300001600256500002000272520137100292592002801663596005901691596003301750650001701783650002501800650001601825650001801841650000901859650001101868650002001879650002001899650001601919650002001935650001501955650002301970650002901993650001202022650002502034650001402059700006002073773015102133856007402284852000902358655001202367IND60636440420221119171234.0190408e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063644042DNAL7 a10.1111/jwas.125212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusharraf, Mohammad10aDietary Phosphorus Requirement of Fingerling Indian Major Carp, Labeo rohita (Hamilton)  ap. 469-484.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDietary phosphorus requirement of fingerling Labeo rohita (6.1 ± 0.13 cm; 1.88 ± 0.05 g) was quantified by feeding seven isonitrogenous (350 g/kg crude protein) and isocaloric (16.72 kJ/g gross energy) purified diets with different levels of phosphorus as 3.5 (basal diet), 4.6, 5.7, 6.5, 7.8, 8.9, and 10.1 g/kg. Triplicate groups of fish were fed at 0800, 1200, and 1600 h to apparent satiation for 8 wk. Live weight gain (LWG; 494.68%), specific growth rate (3.18%/d), feed conversion ratio (1.54), feed efficiency (0.65), protein gain (PG; 1.26 g/fish), protein efficiency ratio (1.86), and phosphorus utilization efficiency (98.78%) improved significantly (P < 0.05), with increasing dietary phosphorus level up to 6.5 g/kg. However, phosphorus contents of vertebrae and scale increased significantly up to 7.8 g/kg. Dietary phosphorus levels significantly affected serum phosphorus concentration and alkaline phosphatase activity. Broken‐line analysis based on LWG; PG; and whole‐body, vertebrae, and scale phosphorus against dietary phosphorus indicated the optimal phosphorus requirement of fingerling L. rohita at 6.56, 6.58, 6.56, 8.02, and 8.44 g/kg diet, respectively. In order to restrict superfluous phosphorus in the diet, inclusion of 6.56 g/kg phosphorus is recommended for optimal growth of fingerling L. rohita.  aPublisher supplied data  aSR/FST/LS1‐225/2004cDST‐FIST Programme, New Delhi  cUniversity Grants Commission 3aLabeo rohita 3aalkaline phosphatase 3ablood serum 3acrude protein 3adiet 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3afeed conversion 3afingerlings 3aliveweight gain 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus content 3aprotein efficiency ratio 3asatiety 3aspecific growth rate 3avertebrae1 aKhan, Mukhtar A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3223-89800 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2019 Apr., v. 50, no. 2 p.469-484dWiley Subscription Services, Inc.wJournal:jnl42330x0893-88497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jwas.125213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245016400174520219000338592002802528653002102556653001902577653002702596653001202623700002302635700002802658700002202686700002302708700001902731700001602750700002602766700002602792700002002818700002402838700001702862700002102879773009802900856008402998852000903082655001203091IND60684291520221120181626.0200320e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068429152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sciaf.2020.e002842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLokpo, Sylvester Yao10aEvaluation of dietary patterns and haematological profile of apparently healthy officers of the Central Prisons in the Ho municipality. A cross sectional study  aThis study is aimed at examining the dietary patterns and haematological profile in apparently healthy officers at the Ho Central Prisons.We employed a cross-sectional study to conveniently enroll 113 prison officers at the Ho Central Prisons. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to obtain demographic information including age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and marital status as well as the number of children, educational level, occupational rank and duration of service. A Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and 24-Hour Recall (24HR) instrument were used to assess participants’ dietary intakes and consumption patterns. Portion sizes of all meals indicated were estimated using handy measures. Nutrient intakes were then determined using the FAO food composition database. Using standard methods, venous blood samples were obtained to determine participants’ full blood count (FBC). Anaemia and its morphological types were defined based on gender specific haemoglobin cut-off and MCV and MCH cut-off values respectively.Only half of the total respondents [65 (57.5%)] followed the recommended daily eating pattern (breakfast, lunch and supper). Thirty-two (28.3%) had often skipped breakfast, 36 (31.9%) skipped lunch and 6 (5.3%) skipped supper while 16 (14.2%) skipped snacks. High protein intake was predominant among study participants [74(65.49%)], with a male preponderance [47(75.81%)]. Low folate, vitamins (C, B₆, and B₁₂) and fiber consumptions were proportionally higher among the study population whereas low thiamine [35(68.63%)] and copper [36(70.59%)] intakes were significantly higher among female compared to their male peers, [33(53.23%)] and [40(64.52%)]. The rate of anaemia was 36(31.86%). Normocytic normochromic anaemia was the commonest [76(67.26%)], followed by microcytic hypochromic anaemia [19(16.81%)]. Anisocytosis accounted for 18(15.93%) of the total study population, with a preponderance towards the male gender [10(16.13%)].Good dietary practices is not optimal among the officers of the Ho Central Prisons. A third of the officers suffer from anaemia, with normocytic normochromic anaemia as the predominant anaemia type.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDietary patterns 0aDietary habits 0aHaematological profile 0aAnaemia1 aOsei-Yeboah, James1 aOwiredu, William K.B.A.1 aAgordoh, Percival1 aKortei, Nii Korley1 aMensah, Daniel1 aPeter, Nogo1 aUssher, Francis Abeku1 aAmeke, Louis Selassie1 aDei Dika, Noble1 aKwasie, David Annor1 aNoagbe, Mark1 aSegbefia, Selorm0 tScientific African.g2020 Mar., v. 7 p.e00284-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27277x2468-22767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2020.e002843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009800172300001400270520142400284592002801708650001301736650001101749650001601760650001901776650001701795650001401812650001101826650001101837650002101848650001001869650002401879650001201903650002101915653000801936653000801944653001001952653000901962653000701971653000801978653000801986653000901994653000902003653000902012653000902021653000902030653001002039653000802049653001002057653001002067653000802077653000802085653000902093653000802102653003002110653002902140653003002169653003902199653001902238653001902257700001702276700002302293700003202316700001802348773009102366856008502457852000902542655001202551IND60552094720221117043607.0161020e20150510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055209472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaibach, Natalie14aThe characteristics and potential applications of structural lipid droplet proteins in plants  ap. 15-27.  aPlant cytosolic lipid droplets are storage organelles that accumulate hydrophobic molecules. They are found in many tissues and their general structure includes an outer lipid monolayer with integral and associated proteins surrounding a hydrophobic core. Two distinct types can be distinguished, which we define here as oleosin-based lipid droplets (OLDs) and non-oleosin-based lipid droplets (NOLDs). OLDs are the best characterized lipid droplets in plants. They are primarily restricted to seeds and other germinative tissues, their surface is covered with oleosin-family proteins to maintain stability, they store triacylglycerols (TAGs) and they are used as a source of energy (and possibly signaling molecules) during the germination of seeds and pollen. Less is known about NOLDs. They are more abundant than OLDs and are distributed in many tissues, they accumulate not only TAGs but also other hydrophobic molecules such as natural rubber, and the structural proteins that stabilize them are unrelated to oleosins. In many species these proteins are members of the rubber elongation factor superfamily. NOLDs are not typically used for energy storage but instead accumulate hydrophobic compounds required for environmental interactions such as pathogen defense. There are many potential applications of NOLDs including the engineering of lipid production in plants and the generation of artificial oil bodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3aenergy 3aengineering 3ahydrophobicity 3alipid bodies 3apathogens 3apollen 3arubber 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3astructural proteins 3atissues 3atriacylglycerols 0aAOB 0aCPT 0aCsPAT 0aDGAT 0aER 0aHLL 0aHSD 0aLDAP 0aLEC2 0aMLDP 0aMuSI 0aNOLD 0aOBAB1 0aOLD 0aPaGHS 0aPDAT1 0aREF 0aSRP 0aSRPP 0aTAG 0aArtificial lipid droplets 0aLipid-based formulations 0aLipid-based drug delivery 0aRecombinant lipid-binding proteins 0aDual-use crops 0alipid droplets1 aPost, Janina1 aTwyman, Richard M.1 aGronover, Christian Schulze1 aPrüfer, Dirk0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2015 May 10, v. 201 p.15-27dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01860naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245007800165300001800243520089300261592002801154653003501182653001001217653004601227653003401273700001701307700001701324700002001341773010401361856008401465852000901549655001201558IND60121827820221120072950.0150325e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012182782DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2014.9034112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoskas, R.10aInvestigation of Air Flow Distribution in Small-Scale Food Products Dryer  ap. 1533-1539.  aExperimental and numerical investigations showed that the air flow velocity distribution between the shelves with identical inlet cross sections is nonuniform; in the gaps between the shelves located in the bottom part of the dryer the velocity is rather high and in the gaps between the shelves located in the middle and at the top of the dryer the velocity is low. A nonuniform air flow distribution causes unequal drying of the product; therefore, the position of shelves with the products must be periodically changed; that is, operation of the dryer is not optimal. It was revealed during numerical investigations that the use of variable inlet cross sections between the shelves gives more uniform air flow distribution. Numerically obtained air flow velocity distribution results between the shelves with the use of variable inlet cross sections were also justified experimentally.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAir flow velocity distribution 0aDryer 0aExperimental and numerical investigations 0aVariable inlet cross sections1 aPoškas, P.,1 aSirvydas, A.1 aGediminskas, A.0 tDrying technology.g2014 Oct. 3, v. 32, no. 13 p.1533-1539dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2014.9034113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245012800178500001900306520135300325592002801678650001301706650002101719650002401740650003001764650000901794650002201803650001601825650001401841650002501855650000901880650001101889650000901900650000701909650001301916650001501929653001201944653001901956653002701975700002102002700003302023700002502056700002202081700002102103700002902124773010602153856008702259852000902346655001202355IND60736433220221119172505.0210619e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073643322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchreiner, Tatiana B.10aEvaluation of saponin-rich extracts as natural alternative emulsifiers: A comparative study with pure Quillaja Bark saponin  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDue to synthetic surfactants' environmental impact, their replacement by natural alternatives has gained relevance, with saponins emerging as sustainable approaches. In this work, three saponin-rich extracts from different sources (Tribulus terrestris (TT), Trigonella foenum-graecum (FG), and Ruscus aculeatus (RA)) were tested as emulsifiers, and their performance compared with Quillaja Bark saponin (PS). Characterisation comprised FTIR, solubility studies, CMC assays, and emulsifying properties (emulsifying capacity (EC) and foaming capacity (FC)). For all samples, solubility assays indicated high solubility in water and low in apolar solvents (e.g., n-hexane), compatible with their O/W emulsifier character. In general, the saponin content ruled extracts' performance (PS > TT > FG > RA). EC values (without pH adjustment) were found to be 82.5, 55.0, 47.5, 36.3%, respectively. When pH changed for 7 and 9, a shift in FG and RA order was observed. The pseudo-ternary diagrams, constructed to map emulsion's composition zones, indicate the formation of single-phase systems in the region of low oil and high extract content. Except for RA extract, gel samples were formed, which are interesting technological solutions for several applications. Among the studied samples, and in alternative to PS, TT extract showed the best performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuillaja 3aRuscus aculeatus 3aTribulus terrestris 3aTrigonella foenum-graecum 3abark 3acomparative study 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3aenvironmental impact 3agels 3ahexane 3aoils 3apH 3asaponins 3asolubility 0aSaponin 0aPlant extracts 0aEmulsifying properties1 aColucci, Giovana1 aSantamaria-Echart, Arantzazu1 aFernandes, Isabel P.1 aDias, Madalena M.1 aPinho, Simão P.1 aBarreiro, Maria Filomena0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 623 p.126748-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03431naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006700167300001600234520225200250592002802502650001402530650002502544650001102569650002102580650000902601650001402610650001102624650002102635650001502656650001402671650001002685651002002695651001502715700002102730700001902751700002002770773010502790856008202895990002302977852000903000655001203009IND60097733320221121005724.0141104e20131010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009773332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2013.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnight, Jon M.10aShort-term dissolved oxygen patterns in sub-tropical mangroves  ap. 290-296.  aMangrove forests in subtropical areas are highly heterogeneous environments, influenced by diverse physical structures and tidal flushing regimes. An important component of tidal water is the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO), as it affects aquatic organisms such as fish (directly: respiration and behaviour) and immature mosquitoes (directly: trigger for egg-hatch; indirectly: fish predation of larvae). Changes in DO may be important over relatively small time scales such as minutes and days, but, at such scales it has received little investigation. The aim of this study was to address this knowledge gap, monitoring DO at small time intervals (1 min) over tidal flooding events (hours – days) in two contrasting subtropical mangrove systems. These represented a range of mangrove tidal hydrology: a well-connected fringing mangrove forest in south-east Queensland and a more complex mangrove basin forest in northern New South Wales with impeded tidal connections. The results indicated that patterns of DO varied diurnally and by mangrove system. In the fringing forest, where the substrate was exposed before and after flooding, the highest mean DO concentration was during the day, followed by evening, with pre-dawn the lowest (6.8, 6.5 and 6.1 mg/l, respectively). DO patterns differed by tide stage and time of day with falling DO especially during late evening and pre-dawn as tides ebbed. In the mangrove basin forest the pattern was reversed, but also depended on the distance the tide had travelled across the basin. Before tidal incursion, standing water in the basin was anoxic (DO 0 mg/l). As tidal water flooded into the systems there was a greater increase in DO closer to the tide source than further away, with a DO concentration of 7.6 mg/l compared to 5.4 mg/l. The observations were interpreted in the light of processes and potential impacts on aquatic organisms (fish and immature mosquitoes). The most significant observation was that in the mangrove basin DO concentrations suitable for aquatic organisms (such as fish) persisted for only a relatively small period during the tide (∼1 h), with hypoxic conditions for the remainder. This combination of conditions is favourable to immature mosquitoes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aanaerobic conditions 3abasins 3adissolved oxygen 3afish 3ahydrology 3alarvae 3amangrove forests 3amonitoring 3apredation 3atides 3aNew South Wales 3aQueensland1 aGriffin, Lachlan1 aDale, Pat E.R.1 aSheaves, Marcus0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2013 Oct. 10, v. 131 p.290-296dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2013.06.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003600151245013800187520155100325592002801876650001501904650001301919650001301932650002101945650001801966650001601984650002002000650001902020650002202039650001702061650001702078650001702095650003702112653002902149653003302178653002602211653002802237653001702265653002402282700001402306700002602320700002502346700003302371700003002404773010302434856008602537852000902623655001202632IND60768882620221118180239.0220411e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076888262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.1065802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Moura, MariaLuiza Abatemarco10aMycorrhiza fungi application as a successful tool for worldwide mine land restoration: Current state of knowledge and the way forward  aThe restoration of degraded areas in mined land has not always achieved the desired success. Biological tools such as the use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are needed to increase and accelerate the restoration effectiveness of natural processes and ecosystem services in restored degraded areas. AMF can increase water and nutrient uptake by the host plants, therefore decreasing plant stress and improving habitat development in mined areas under restoration. We conducted a global meta-analysis from 193 independent outcomes to understand the overall effect of employing AMF as a restoration tool and to evaluate sources of variation on the effects of AMF inoculation on plant development in areas degraded by mining. Our results emphasize the great potential of the use of AMF to stimulate plant growth in the restoration of mined areas with stronger effects if associated with the utilization of organic matter and other soil microorganisms. Although AMF studies are concentrated in temperate regions, AMF inoculum promoted greater plant development on mined substrates regardless of the region and fungi type or origin. Inoculation also improved plant growth in materials of difficult restoration, such as overburden and tailings, but the AMF effects depended upon the exploited mineral type. Further investment in long-term field studies on the effects of AMF inoculation on plant survival, reproduction, fitness, and related ecological processes is essential to further consolidate the use of AMF on the restoration of mined areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3ainoculum 3aland restoration 3ameta-analysis 3amined soils 3anutrient uptake 3aorganic matter 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aplant stress 3areproduction 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aEcosystem rehabilitation 0aLand recover and reclamation 0aMining degraded areas 0aMycorrhizal inoculation 0aPlant growth 0aSoil microorganisms1 aOki, Yumi1 aArantes-Garcia, Lucas1 aCornelissen, Tatiana1 aNunes, Yule Roberta Ferreira1 aFernandes, Geraldo Wilson0 tEcological engineering.g2022 May, v. 178 p.106580-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.1065803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245012700174520110500301592002801406650002401434650001601458650002801474650001401502650001501516650001901531650003101550653003501581653002001616653002401636653001701660700001801677700001601695700001501711700001701726773009101743856009001834852000901924655001201933IND60790586620221120192003.0220914e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079058662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1071472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuo, Longchao10aLow-cost and low-temperature 3D printing for refractory composite inspired by fused deposition modeling and binder jetting  aInspired by two subsets of additive manufacturing, a novel method of low-cost and low-temperature 3D printing for net shape refractory products has been proposed and validated in the present work. Taking the typical refractory composite of tungsten-copper as an instance, the feedstock for printing was made of 97 wt% W-Cu composite powders and 3 wt% binder. The resulted W-Cu composite was printed on a desktop 3D printer at room temperature, followed by designated degreasing and hydrogen-reduction sintering. Characteristics including phase constituents, microstructure, mechanical and electrical properties of the resulted composite have been identified. The revealed neat and intact interfaces between the constituent Cu and W after fully degreasing ensured sufficient loading transfer and deformation coordination, contributing to excellent mechanical properties with high electrical conductivity. This work extended the feasibility of fabricating refractory alloys without molds and expensive equipment, providing a new solution and scheme for refractory materials with intricate structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3adeformation 3aelectrical conductivity 3aequipment 3afeedstocks 3amicrostructure 3athree-dimensional printing 0aMetal-matrix composites (MMCs) 0aMicrostructures 0aElectron microscopy 0a3-D printing1 aLiu, Changgen1 aYin, Enhuai1 aZhao, Zhao1 aPang, Shujie0 tComposites.g2022 Nov., v. 162 p.107147-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1071473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113024004100151040001800192100001700210245009300227300001400320520107800334592002801412650001401440650001201454650001401466650001201480650001301492650001101505650002201516650001901538650002401557650001301581650001501594650002401609650002601633650001301659650002001672650003101692650002501723700002001748700001101768700002001779773010501799856008401904852000901988655001201997IND60086709820221119075817.0141102e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008670982DNAL7 a226597282pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2012.05.0022doi7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2012.05.0022chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasozi, G.N.10aSorption of atrazine and ametryn by carbonatic and non-carbonatic soils of varied origin  ap. 12-19.  aSorption of two s-triazines, atrazine and ametryn, by carbonatic soils, Histosols, Spodosols and Oxisols was examined. Linear isotherms were observed and sorption coefficients (Kd) of both compounds were significantly lower (α = 0.05) onto carbonatic soils compared to non-carbonatic soils. Furthermore, among carbonatic soil types, the marl-carbonatic soils had the lowest sorption affinities. Kd and organic carbon content were highly correlated, suggesting predominant influence of organic carbon in the sorption of the s-triazine, except in Oxisols and Spodosols where variations suggest other factors. Upon removal of organic matter (OM) using sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide, the Kd values were reduced by ∼90%, indicating minimal contribution of mineral surfaces. Thus OM compositional differences likely explain the large variation in s-triazine sorption within and between soil orders. This study highlights the need to consider OM composition in addition to quantity when determining pesticide applications rates, particularly for carbonatic soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHistosols 3aOxisols 3aSpodosols 3aametryn 3aatrazine 3acarbon 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aorganic matter 3asodium hypochlorite 3asorption 2aAdsorption 2aAtrazinexchemistry 2aHerbicidesxchemistry 2aKinetics 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxchemistry 2aTriazinesxchemistry1 aNkedi-Kizza, P.1 aLi, Y.1 aZimmerman, A.R.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2012 Oct., v. 169 p.12-19dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl59519x0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2012.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245014400172300001400316520121500330592002801545650002201573650002001595650001601615650001601631650001701647650001901664650001801683650002901701650001601730650001901746650000801765650001401773650002501787650001401812650002201826650002501848650001801873650001301891651001101904700003001915700002701945700003101972773010302003856008202106990002302188852000902211655001202220IND60097733520221121005629.0141104e20131010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009773352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2013.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatselis, George N.10aLong-term changes of fisheries landings in enclosed gulf lagoons (Amvrakikos gulf, W Greece): Influences of fishing and other human impacts  ap. 31-40.  aThe present study analyses long-term annual fishery landings time series (1980–2007) for species derived from six lagoons (covering about 70 km²) around an important European wetland, the fjord-like Amvrakikos gulf. Landing trends for most abundant species revealed that typical lagoon fish species-groups, such as Mugilidae (Mugil cephalus, Chelon labrosus, Liza saliens, Liza aurata and Liza ramada), eels (Anguilla anguilla) and Gobies (mainly Zosteriosessor ophiocephalus) had largely decreased, while the landings of Sparus aurata increased during the entire study period. These trends led to a significant change in species composition during recent years that might be attributed to large-scale climatic changes as well as serious anthropogenic impacts that degraded the water quality and altered the hydrology within the gulf and lagoons, the increase of fishing exploitation in Amvrakikos gulf, the expansion of aquaculture activities within the gulf, the application of new fishing management practices in lagoons, and the increase of fish-eating sea-bird populations. The findings are needed for the implementation of an efficient and integrated management tool for the study of coastal systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnguilla anguilla 3aChelon labrosus 3aLiza aurata 3aLiza ramada 3aLiza saliens 3aMugil cephalus 3aSparus aurata 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquaculture 3aclimate change 3aeel 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3ahydrology 3aspecies diversity 3atime series analysis 3awater quality 3awetlands 3aGreece1 aMoutopoulos, Dimitrios K.1 aDimitriou, Evagelos N.1 aKoutsikopoulos, Constantin0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2013 Oct. 10, v. 131 p.31-40dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2013.07.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04121naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014400170300001600314520240400330592002802734650002102762650002002783650002002803650001802823650001802841650002302859650001202882650002202894650001702916650001402933650001302947650002602960650001502986650001403001650002503015650000903040650001903049650002203068650002203090650001603112651001103128653002803139653002603167653002603193653002703219653002403246653003503270700001903305700002103324773011603345856008503461852000903546655001203555IND60542571220221118150300.0190403e20150215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054257122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2014.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Marcus10aTree species diversity effects on productivity, soil nutrient availability and nutrient response efficiency in a temperate deciduous forest  ap. 114-123.  aThere are contrasting reports whether and how tree diversity influences stand productivity in temperate deciduous forests. Tree species diversity may increase stand productivity in temperate forests through complementary resource use and/or facilitation if the resource considered limits productivity. In unpolluted temperate forests, net primary production is typically limited by nitrogen (N). However, in many parts of Europe high N deposition has alleviated N limitation and there is some evidence that phosphorus (P) and/or potassium (K) limitation has become more widespread. Here, we report on a study where we investigated whether complementarity and/or facilitation increase productivity in a typical German deciduous forest with tree species of beech (Fagus sylvatica), oak (Quercus petraea and Quercus robur), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) and lime (Tilia cordata and Tilia platyphyllus). We measured biomass production and availability of soil N, P, K, calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in stands of single species (mono-species stands) and in stands with different combinations of three of the tree species above (mix-species stands). We used nutrient response efficiency (NRE) to evaluate whether a specific nutrient limits tree growth. At a stand level, above-ground net primary productivity did not differ between mono- and mix-species stands. At a tree level, using a neighborhood approach, relative growth rates of beech trees in mono-species stands were smaller than when they were in mix with lime and hornbeam whereas growth of lime trees in mono-species stands was larger than in mix with beech and oak. The NRE curve for beech showed that beech trees in mix-species stands had optimal P and K response efficiencies whereas beech trees in mono-species stands showed P and K limitations. The NRE curve for oak with exchangeable soil K showed that K levels were beyond the optimum NRE and thus K was not limiting oak growth. NRE curves for hornbeam and lime showed no significant relationships with any of the soil nutrients. Hence, nutrient limitation was species-dependent. Our results showed that using both NRE and a neighborhood approach are useful tools in quantifying the effects of individual tree species on a species’ productivity between mono- and mix-species stands. Such tools provide important basis for improving management of typical mix-species, temperate forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarpinus betulus 3aFagus sylvatica 3aQuercus petraea 3aQuercus robur 3aTilia cordata 3abiomass production 3acalcium 3adeciduous forests 3aforest trees 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aprimary productivity 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3aspecies diversity 3atemperate forests 3atree growth 3aEurope 0aGerman deciduous forest 0aHainich national park 0aNeighborhood approach 0aNet primary production 0aNutrient limitation 0aPlant-available soil nutrients1 aVeldkamp, Edzo1 aCorre, Marife D.0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Feb. 15, v. 338 p.114-123dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2014.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012800172520160000300592002801900650002601928650002801954650001301982650002401995650002602019650002202045650001402067650002902081650003602110650002002146650001702166653002802183653001502211653002802226653002202254653002002276653003902296700002002335700002402355700001802379700001702397773012102414856008502535852000902620655001202629IND60688947820221122091705.0200819e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068894782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2020.1482042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Leanne C.10aUnfolding pathway and intermolecular interactions of the cytochrome subunit in the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center  aPrecise folding of photosynthetic proteins and organization of multicomponent assemblies to form functional entities are fundamental to efficient photosynthetic electron transfer. The bacteriochlorophyll b-producing purple bacterium Blastochloris viridis possesses a simplified photosynthetic apparatus. The light-harvesting (LH) antenna complex surrounds the photosynthetic reaction center (RC) to form the RC-LH1 complex. A non-membranous tetraheme cytochrome (4Hcyt) subunit is anchored at the periplasmic surface of the RC, functioning as the electron donor to transfer electrons from mobile electron carriers to the RC. Here, we use atomic force microscopy (AFM) and single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) to probe the long-range organization of the photosynthetic apparatus from Blc. viridis and the unfolding pathway of the 4Hcyt subunit in its native supramolecular assembly with its functional partners. AFM images reveal that the RC-LH1 complexes are densely organized in the photosynthetic membranes, with restricted lateral protein diffusion. Unfolding of the 4Hcyt subunit represents a multi-step process and the unfolding forces of the 4Hcyt α-helices are approximately 121 picoNewtons. Pulling of 4Hcyt could also result in the unfolding of the RC L subunit that binds with the N-terminus of 4Hcyt, suggesting strong interactions between RC subunits. This study provides new insights into the protein folding and interactions of photosynthetic multicomponent complexes, which are essential for their structural and functional integrity to conduct photosynthetic electron flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlastochloris viridis 3aatomic force microscopy 3abacteria 3abacteriochlorophyll 3achemical interactions 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3alight harvesting complex 3aphotosynthetic reaction centers 3aprotein folding 3aspectroscopy 0aAtomic force microscopy 0aCytochrome 0aPhotosynthetic membrane 0aProtein unfolding 0aReaction center 0aSingle-molecule force spectroscopy1 aZhao, Longsheng1 aCanniffe, Daniel P.1 aMartin, David1 aLiu, Lu-Ning0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 1861, no. 8 p.148204-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2020.1482043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010200165300001600267520152600283592002801809650001501837650001201852650002601864650001501890650001601905650002201921650002101943650001001964650001601974650001001990651001002000700001502010700001802025700002102043773010102064856004802165852000902213655001202222IND4472608720221122225512.0120510e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447260872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-011-9865-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoharram, S.

The increasing demand of groundwater in El-Farafra Oasis has resulted in an indiscriminate exploitation of this source causing environmental hazards such as decline of groundwater levels and well interference. In this paper, the study of these problems is conducted. The methodology introduced in this paper includes application of mathematical and Genetic Algorithm (GA) techniques. This situation has led to a growing realization that through good management, use of groundwater can be made more productive and sustainable. The proposed model of optimization is based on the combination of the MODFLOW with GA. The performance of the proposed model is tested on groundwater management problem (maximization of total pumping rate from an aquifer at steady-state). The results show that the GA solutions nearly agree with the solutions of other methods of previous works. Thus, it can be used to solve the management problems in groundwater. This model is used to develop the optimal pumping rate and number of wells in El-Farafra Oasis under different scenarios. The results show that under the current situation, the optimal pumping rate is 183023 m3/day. The second scenario assumes an increase of number of wells by 20%, the optimal rate reaches 220016 m3/day. The third scenario proposes pumping rate 254484 m3/day which equalizes an increase in the cultivated area by 4000 acres, the optimal rate reaches 258007 m3/day.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adeserts 3aenvironmental hazards 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic models 3amodel validation 3aoases 3awater table 3awells 3aEgypt1 aGad, M.

Herein, a cotton/magnesium silicate composite film is successfully synthesized with a hierarchically porous structure. The composite film can be separated from the treated solution and avoid the potential risk of secondary pollution. The porous magnesium silicate spheres constructed by thin nanosheets are in situ deposited on the surface of cotton fibers using silica spheres as the template under the hydrothermal condition, showing a high specific surface area of 523.1 m² g⁻¹. Due to the presence of abundant adsorption sites and effective diffusion paths, the composite film exhibits an excellent adsorption property to methylene blue (194.4 mg g⁻¹). The adsorption isotherms and mechanisms are also briefly investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acomposite films 3amagnesium silicates 3amethylene blue 3ananosheets 3apollution 3arisk 3asilica 3asurface area 3awastewater 0aMagnesium silicate 0aCotton 0aAdsorption 0aDye 0aFilm1 aHuang, Yali,1 aYue, Yuan1 aZhang, Wen0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Sept. 20, v. 625 p.126751-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245013500171506010400306506007600410520104900486592002801535506003701563650001101600650001701611650001101628650001301639650001501652650002201667650001301689653001701702653001701719653002601736653002001762700003001782700002001812700002201832700001701854700002001871700001801891773009101909856009002000852000902090655001202099IND60790586920221207122702.0220914e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079058692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1071502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Sheng10aOn the effect of binders on interlaminar fracture energies and R-curves of carbon/epoxy laminates with non-woven micro-fibre veils  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe effect of short micro-fibre-based veils on the mode-I and mode-II interlaminar fracture energies and R-curves of composite laminates is investigated in this study—with an emphasis on the role of veil binders. Non-woven polyphenylene sulfide veils with 10 g/m² areal weight and two different binders (i.e. cross-linked styrene-acrylic and cross-linked polyester), and non-woven carbon veils with 10 g/m² areal weight and four different binders (i.e. cross-linked styrene-acrylic, cross-linked polyester, polyester and polyvinyl alcohol) are used for interleaving composite laminates. Carbon/epoxy laminates are manufactured by vacuum-assisted resin infusion with out-of-autoclave curing. The mode-I and mode-II fracture behaviour of the laminates are investigated. The results show that the binders used in the manufacturing of veils can considerably affect the fracture energy, crack path and R-curve behaviour, and that the effect of binders is more pronounced in the laminates with carbon veils than in the laminates with PPS veils.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon 3acrosslinking 3aenergy 3aepoxides 3apolyesters 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asulfides 0aA.

Oxygen binding to heme iron in the sensor domain of FixL initiates protein conformational changes that are transmitted to the histidine kinase domain, inactivating autophosphorylation activity. Although FixL also can bind other diatomic ligands such as CO, the CO-bound FixL represents incomplete inhibition of kinase activity. Ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) spectra revealed that oxygen binding to the truncated sensor domain of FixL markedly decreased the intensity of the Y8a band arising from Fα-10 Tyr. In contrast, no appreciable change in intensity of the Y8a band occurred after CO binding, and time-resolved UVRR spectra of the sensor domain of FixL upon O₂ dissociation indicated that structural changes near Fα-10 Tyr occurred at ∼0.1 μs. These results suggest that O₂ dissociation from FixL changes the protein conformation near the Fα-10 Tyr residue within a microsecond. The conformational changes of FixL upon O₂ dissociation and the underlying sensing mechanism also are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3adissociation 3agenes 3aheme iron 3ahistidine kinase 3aligands 3anitrogen fixation 3aoxygen 3aprotein conformation 3aprotein phosphorylation1 aIshikawa, Haruto1 aMizuno, Misao1 aNakamura, Hiro1 aShiro, Yoshitsugu1 aMizutani, Yasuhisa0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Dec. 12, v. 117, no. 49 p.15786-15791dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp406709e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245011000174300001800284520118400302592002801486650004401514650002301558650001301581650001001594650002001604650002001624650002301644650000701667650001801674650003101692650003301723650001701756650001701773650002101790650001901811653002101830653001901851653002101870653001701891653002701908700001801935700001901953700002001972773010401992856008402096852000902180655001202189IND60121828220221121120802.0150325e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012182822DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2014.9098432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstevinho, Berta N.14aThe Influence of Microencapsulation with a Modified Chitosan (Water Soluble) on β-Galactosidase Activity  ap. 1575-1586.  aThe aim of this work was to investigate the possibility of producing microparticles containing β-galactosidase, using a modified chitosan (water soluble) as encapsulating agent. β-galactosidase microparticles were prepared by a spray-drying method and were characterized in terms of particle size, surface morphology, zeta potential, and stability over a storage period of six months. Microparticles were also analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy and thermogravimetry techniques. Structural analysis of the surface of the particles was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM results show that the obtained microparticles have an average diameter smaller than 3.5 µm and a regular shape. The β-galactosidase activity decreases when microencapsulated. The parameters Km and Vmax of the Michaelis-Menten equation were calculated for the different experimental conditions. The optimal pH ranges from 6.4 to 7.2, approximately, depending on the enzyme concentration in the microcapsule. After six months of storage, the enzyme activity presents a small decrease, although no significant differences in the appearance, color, and particle size distribution were identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abeta-galactosidase 3achitosan 3acolor 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme kinetics 3amicroencapsulation 3apH 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspray drying 3astorage time 3athermogravimetry 3azeta potential 0aβ-Galactosidase 0aImmobilization 0aMichaelis-Menten 0aSpray drying 0aWater-soluble chitosan1 aDamas, Ana M.1 aMartins, Pedro1 aRocha, Fernando0 tDrying technology.g2014 Oct. 3, v. 32, no. 13 p.1575-1586dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2014.9098433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245006000155300001800215500001900233520133000252592002801582650002201610650002201632650000901654650001101663700001601674700001301690773014201703856007401845852000901919655001201928IND60707106520221120132137.0200813e20200812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070710652DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb00659a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Yuqing10aGap-enhanced resonance Raman tags for live-cell imaging  ap. 6944-6955.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSurface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanotags are widely used in the biomedical field including live-cell imaging due to the high specificity from their fingerprint spectrum and the multiplexing capability from the ultra-narrow linewidth. However, long-term live-cell Raman imaging is limited due to the photodamage from a relatively long exposure time and a high laser power, which are needed for acquiring detectable Raman signals. In this work, we attempt to resolve this issue by developing ultrabright gap-enhanced resonance Raman tags (GERRTs), consisting of a petal-like gold core and a silver shell with the near-infrared resonant reporter of IR-780 embedded in between, for long-term and high-speed live-cell imaging. GERRTs exhibit an ultrahigh Raman intensity down to a single-nanoparticle level in aqueous solution and the solid state upon 785 nm excitation, allowing for high-resolution time-lapse live-cell Raman imaging with an exposure time of 1 ms per pixel and a laser power of 50 μW. Under these measurement conditions, we can possibly capture dynamic cellular processes with a high temporal resolution, and track living cells for long periods of time owing to the reduced photodamage to cells. These nanotags open new opportunities for ultrasensitive, low-phototoxic, and long-term live-cell imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aexposure duration 3agold 3asilver1 aBi, Xinyuan1 aYe, Jian0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 Aug. 12, v. 8, no. 31 p.6944-6955dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb00659a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02072naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245009600171520086700267592002801134650001501162650001301177650001301190650001401203650001301217650001601230653003701246653003201283653002901315700001401344700001301358700001701371700001901388700001401407700001501421700002001436700001601456773009101472856009001563852000901653655001201662IND60790587020221120073219.0220914e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079058702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1071592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Yuan10aUsing in-situ conversed nano SiC to bond UHTC particles and construct anti-ablation coating  aWe use the natural adsorption and in-siu chemical conversion of ZrB₂-polycarbosilane mixed slurry to construct ZrB₂-SiC coating on the surface of Cf/ZrC-SiC composite, which achieved nearly zero ablation under 1800 °C holding over 300 s.

This research developed a novel 3D-printed extruder to fabricate CCFRP composites using an in-situ impregnation technique. The printed CCFRP composites present relatively low void content and competitive mechanical properties due to the well impregnation of carbon fibers. The printing pressure during the 3D printing was analyzed with an in-situ traction force monitor system. The effect of printing pressure on mechanical properties and void distribution of 3D-printed CCFRP composites was then investigated by adjusting the layer thickness. It demonstrates that a thinner printing layer can generate a larger ironing force, minimizing the void formation, thus improving the mechanical properties and surface quality of final parts. However, the large traction force would reduce the dimension accuracy.

Here, by using the Hartree–Fock (HF) method, the density functional theory (DFT) method, and the second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) method, we extend our early work from the less anharmonic region <2000 cm–¹ into the more anharmonic region >2000 cm–¹ covering C–H, C–D, and CN stretching modes of benzene, deuterated benzene, acetonitrile, deuterated acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran. The computed Raman γ values of these vibrational modes have been determined by using either the 992 cm–¹ Raman band of benzene or the compound’s own Raman band (C–C stretch) around 800–1000 cm–¹ as an internal standard. In this more anharmonic region, the HF method with a larger basis set provides the best outputs and the predicted Raman γ values agree well with experimental values for most of the vibrational modes studied. By choosing a suitable method and basis set, this facile approach could be applied to a broader spectral range for Raman γ estimation of various materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3abenzene 3amathematical theory 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphysical chemistry 3aprediction 3atetrahydrofuran1 aHe, Anqi1 aXu, Yizhuang0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Dec. 12, v. 117, no. 49 p.15812-15818dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp40731193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245005700177300001400234520166200248592002801910650002001938650002401958650001301982650001101995650001302006650001502019650001102034650001502045650001302060650001902073650001302092700002102105700002102126700002102147773010502168856008902273852000902362655001202371IND60084058820221116204542.0141101e20120330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008405882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2011.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuber, Patrick R.10aMunicipal and regional habitat connectivity planning  ap. 15-26.  aPlanning for safe passage of wildlife involves understanding the complexities of natural and human landscapes and incorporating connectivity assessments in local and regional planning. The present study describes a novel landscape analysis approach that was used in the context of municipal open space planning and regional land use and transportation planning. The project approach focused on two principles: (1) wildlife movement is not limited to formally managed reserves and corridors, but occurs across a gradient of land uses in the human landscape, and (2) that local and regional planners should be included in the process of identifying habitat connectivity needs and in turn incorporate connectivity in their own planning processes. In the first case, a species-specific combination of landscape disturbance and least-cost modeling was based on the concept that wildlife originate their movement from anywhere within suitable habitat and move in a least-costly direction. This results in a “least cost surface” of possible wildlife movement based on habitat preference and barriers to safe passage. In the second case, planners at two geographic scales – municipal and regional – were informed of landscape connectivity principles and their needs incorporated into the assessment itself. The least cost surface approach allows for the integration of modeled connectivity and disturbance with site-specific municipal planning activities. However, the potential for this type of local planning to be folded into local decision-making processes can be dependent on the interests of individual planners rather than being systematic in nature.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aopen space 3aplanning 3atransportation 3awildlife1 aShilling, Fraser1 aThorne, James H.1 aGreco, Steven E.0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2012 Mar. 30, v. 105, no. 1-2 p.15-26dElsevier B.V.x0169-20467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2011.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010300175300001800278520099100296592002801287650002001315650001901335650001201354650002201366650001701388650001101405650001801416650001601434653002201450653001901472653001601491653002701507700002001534700002401554773012401578856008501702852000901787655001201796IND60548907820221118042523.0170809e20161002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054890782DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2015.11171732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, Julian R.10aGCM-related uncertainty for river flows and inundation under climate change: the Inner Niger Delta  ap. 2325-2347.  aA semi-distributed hydrological model of the Niger River above and including the Inner Delta is developed. GCM-related uncertainty in climate change impacts are investigated using seven GCMs for a 2°C increase in global mean temperature, the hypothesised threshold of “dangerous” climate change. Declines in precipitation predominate, although some GCMs project increases for some sub-catchments, whilst PET increases for all scenarios. Inter-GCM uncertainty in projected precipitation is three to five times that of PET. With the exception of one GCM (HadGEM1), which projects a very small increase (3.9%), river inflows to the Delta decline. There is considerable uncertainty in the magnitude of these reductions, ranging from 0.8% (HadCM3) to 52.7% (IPSL). Whilst flood extent for HadGEM1 increases (mean annual peak +1405 km ²/+10.2%), for other GCMs it declines. These declines range from almost negligible changes to a 7903 km ² (57.3%) reduction in the mean annual peak.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3adecline 3ahydrologic models 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asubwatersheds 3auncertainty 0aInner Niger Delta 0aclimate change 0auncertainty 0ahydrological modelling1 aCrawley, Andrew1 aKingston, Daniel G.0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2016 Oct. 2, v. 61, no. 13 p.2325-2347dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2015.11171733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245014400179300001600323520159300339592002801932650000801960650002001968650001101988650001701999650001102016650001202027650001502039650001302054650001502067650001702082650001102099650001002110650001302120650001202133651001102145700001902156700002102175700001902196773010702215856008902322852000902411655001202420IND60084059020221116195451.0141101e20120330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008405902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2011.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapangelis, Giorgos13aAn urban “green planning” approach utilizing the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) modeling system. A case study of Athens, Greece  ap. 174-183.  aThe ameliorating thermal effect induced by green areas inside the warm urban microclimate of densely populated cities can improve the thermal comfort, as well as the overall health and living conditions of their inhabitants. In this modeling study, an effort is made to predict the impact of urban green solutions inside the high density and diverse urban landscape of the coastal city of Athens, Greece. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, coupled to a single layer urban canopy model, is utilized to carry out high resolution (0.5km) land use scenarios, focusing on proposed urban parks (sized 8 and 4km²), which substitute a mainly industrial/commercial area (Eleonas) near the city's center. Results during nighttime of a typical warm-period day, depict a large cooling (on average greater than 5°C) over the park's vegetated surface compared to current conditions, and a park cool island effect of 9.5°C when comparing park and surrounding urban fabric air temperatures. Additionally, a significant cooling of the neighboring built-up areas is indicated at a radius proportional to the park's dimensions, related to the nocturnal advection of cool air beyond its borders (park breeze). During daytime, although no significant temperature changes over the park are simulated, a cooling (up to 1°C) downwind its northern borders and over the inner city is predicted. This finding is related to the smaller frictional elements of the altered land cover located upon the axis of the seabreeze flow, which enhances the local sea-breeze circulation and its inland extent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair temperature 3acanopy 3acase studies 3acities 3acooling 3aland cover 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amicroclimate 3amodels 3aparks 3aplanning 3aweather 3aGreece1 aTombrou, Maria1 aDandou, Aggeliki1 aKontos, Themis0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2012 Mar. 30, v. 105, no. 1-2 p.174-183dElsevier B.V.x0169-20467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2011.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010800177520117900285592002801464650002301492650002401515650001901539650001301558650001801571650001701589650002201606650002401628653001901652653001701671653002401688653002301712653001401735700001901749700002201768773010701790856008701897852000901984655001201993IND60736434220221119170804.0220404e20210905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073643422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade León, Alberto S.10aHybrid hierarchically structured materials combining breath figures and thermal decomposition of KAuCl4  aThis paper presents the preparation of porous, hybrid membranes consisting of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) embedded in the surface of a polystyrene (PS) matrix combining the breath figures technique with a subsequent thermal treatment. The membranes were obtained by drop casting THF solutions containing PS and KAuCl₄ in different concentrations (0.1–10 wt%) under high relative humidity conditions. This bottom-up approach allowed to have porous materials with controlled composition, due to the coffee stain effect driving the KAuCl₄ inside the pores of the membrane. The formation of AuNPs was achieved by performing a facile and rapid thermal treatment to the membranes after they were fabricated. The AuNPs formation was analyzed by high-resolution electron microscopy techniques, allowing to depict their morphology, distribution and placement in the porous structures. It was observed that 1 min at 170 ºC is enough to obtain AuNPs confined within the pores of the membrane without altering the structure of the PS matrix. The functionality of these membranes was proven by studying the catalytic activity of the AuNPs in the reduction of p-nitrophenol (pNP).  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aelectron microscopy 3aheat treatment 3ananogold 3ap-nitrophenol 3apolystyrenes 3arelative humidity 3athermal degradation 0aBreath figures 0aHybrid films 0aElectron microscopy 0aGold nanoparticles 0aCatalysis1 ade la Mata, M.1 aMolina, Sergio I.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 624 p.126766-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1267663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012100169300001400290520179600304592002802100650001102128650002402139650000902163650002102172650000902193650001402202650002302216650002102239650001202260650001402272650001902286650001402305650001102319650002302330650001402353650001902367651002202386773010302408856008202511990002302593852000902616655001202625IND60097734420221123005203.0141104e20131010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009773442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2013.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYücel, Mustafa,10aDown the thermodynamic ladder: A comparative study of marine redox gradients across diverse sedimentary environments  ap. 83-92.  aThe thermodynamic succession of electron acceptors used in microbial oxidation of organic matter and associated redox products lead to the vertical chemical zonation in diffusion-controlled marine sediments. The structure of this gradient is a key player in the recycling of organic carbon and nutrients in the marine environment. However, little attention has been given to the advection-dominated sedimentary systems where the co-existence of different reduced and oxidized chemical species is expected. In this study, performing multi-analyte Au/Hg voltammetric microelectrode profiling on cores from diverse sediment depositional settings in the Mediterranean Sea (lagoon, coastal marine, submarine canyon and shallow-water vent sediments), it is shown that there exists an excess of reducing species (H₂S, Mn²⁺, Fe²⁺ and FeSₐq) in the advective shallow vent sediments compared to similar upper sediment sections of diffusion-controlled environments. The ex-situ upward diffusive flux of reduced species accounted for at least 26 percent of oxygen consumption in the shallow water vent sediments, and this figure is likely higher when in-situ advective fluxes and the oxidation of other known vent-derived reduced components are taken into account. In contrast, the upward fluxes of reduced species do not significantly contribute to oxygen consumption in the studied lagoon, coastal or submarine canyon sediments, where organic matter oxidation by oxygen likely dominates. A major implication of these findings is that the reduced substrate advection in shallow vents leads to a potential for chemoautotrophy in an otherwise oligotrophic marine system, whereas in diffusion-controlled sediments the vertical input of organic matter and its heterotrophic use is more important.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achemical speciation 3agold 3ahydrogen sulfide 3airon 3amanganese 3amarine environment 3amarine sediments 3amercury 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3arecycling 3athermodynamics 3aMediterranean Sea0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2013 Oct. 10, v. 131 p.83-92dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2013.07.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245012800172300001600300520156800316592002801884650002701912650001901939650001601958650001501974650001501989650001902004650002002023650001202043650001702055651001402072700001902086773010502105856008902210852000902299655001202308IND60084059120221116195415.0141101e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008405912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2011.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDzidic, Peta10aOutdoing the Joneses: Understanding community acceptance of an alternative water supply scheme and sustainable urban design  ap. 266-273.  aConcern regarding the sustainability of Australia's potable water supply has prompted investigation into the use of alternative water supply options and other sustainable urban design features at the household and neighbourhood level. This paper details a mixed methodology research project exploring the acceptability of a non-potable groundwater supply system, as well as attitudes towards and uptake of other sustainable urban design options. Results from a photo-elicitation survey depicting aesthetically degraded water in different use scenarios demonstrate that overall participants are accepting of some degree of aesthetic degradation for all uses; however issues relating to fairness and ‘keeping up appearances’ were raised. When asked about sustainable urban design options most participants felt these were important to have, yet few had these in their homes, and noted many barriers to adoption. Notable during interviews was the reported pressure to out-do others in the neighbourhood with respect to home upkeep. Findings from our research suggest that normative processes are highly important, seen to shape the way in which people engage with sustainable urban design in the public/private space, as well as the expectations that they have on others and themselves. We suggest that current social norms need to be challenged to encourage home owners to adopt more sustainable practices or utilised so that new developments present an opportunity for neighbours to compete over the ‘greenest’ housing design rather than the greenest lawn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3ahomeowners 3ainterviews 3alawns and turf 3asocial behavior 3asurveys 3awater supply 3aAustralia1 aGreen, Melissa0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 105, no. 3 p.266-273dElsevier B.V.x0169-20467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2011.12.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012300168300001500291520205400306592002802360650001902388650001102407650002402418650001902442650001802461650001102479650001302490650002002503650001202523650001302535650001702548700002402565700002102589773010402610856008202714990002302796852000902819655001202828IND60097734520221123005337.0141104e20131010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009773452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2013.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergström, Per10aTemporal consistency of spatial pattern in growth of the mussel, Mytilus edulis: Implications for predictive modelling  ap. 93-102.  aHuman pressures on coastal seas are increasing and methods for sustainable management, including spatial planning and mitigative actions, are therefore needed. In coastal areas worldwide, the development of mussel farming as an economically and ecologically sustainable industry requires geographic information on the growth and potential production capacity. In practice this means that coherent maps of temporally stable spatial patterns of growth need to be available in the planning process and that maps need to be based on mechanistic or empirical models. Therefore, as a first step towards development of models of growth, we assessed empirically the fundamental requirement that there are temporally consistent spatial patterns of growth in the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis. Using a pilot study we designed and dimensioned a transplant experiment, where the spatial consistency in the growth of mussels was evaluated at two resolutions. We found strong temporal and scale-dependent spatial variability in growth but patterns suggested that spatial patterns were uncoupled between growth of shell and that of soft tissue. Spatial patterns of shell growth were complex and largely inconsistent among years. Importantly, however, the growth of soft tissue was qualitatively consistent among years at the scale of km. The results suggest that processes affecting the whole coastal area cause substantial differences in growth of soft tissue among years but that factors varying at the scale of km create strong and persistent spatial patterns of growth, with a potential doubling of productivity by identifying the most suitable locations. We conclude that the observed spatial consistency provides a basis for further development of predictive modelling and mapping of soft tissue growth in these coastal areas. Potential causes of observed patterns, consequences for mussel-farming as a tool for mitigating eutrophication, aspects of precision of modelling and sampling of mussel growth as well as ecological functions in general are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus edulis 3acoasts 3aecological function 3aeutrophication 3agrowth models 3ahumans 3aindustry 3amollusc culture 3amussels 3aplanning 3aspatial data1 aLindegarth, Susanne1 aLindegarth, Mats0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2013 Oct. 10, v. 131 p.93-102dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2013.08.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245013100177300001800308520121000326592002801536650002101564650001601585650001101601650001301612650001001625650001301635650002201648650001801670650001201688651001401700653002501714653001501739653001801754700002801772773010401800856008401904852000901988655001201997IND60121828920221121103154.0150325e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012182892DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2014.9155562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasan, Sayed Mahmudul,10aNumerical Simulation of a Solar Kiln Design for Drying Timber with Different Geographical and Climatic Conditions in Australia  ap. 1632-1639.  aA numerical simulation for the modeling of solar kilns for hardwood timber drying with different boundary conditions has been developed in this work. This simulation has been used to predict the key behavior of the wood and the kiln itself under different geographical and weather conditions in Australia. This work, therefore, enables a site to be suggested that is likely to give the best kiln performance both in terms of the productivity and the quality of the end-use product. As test cases, realistic climatic conditions for three representative geographical locations in Australia, including Sydney (latitude 33.86°S), Melbourne (37.81°S), and Brisbane (27.46°S), have been considered in this simulation. Out of the three sites considered in this work, the fastest drying rates (and highest diffusion coefficients) were predicted in Brisbane. The highest level of instantaneous strain in the timber for this location was also predicted to be 0.0075 m/m, which is much less than the failure value (0.02 m/m). The moisture content distribution profile within the boards toward the end of the drying period was found to be almost uniform, which is likely to cause low degrade in the dried timber.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic factors 3adiffusivity 3adrying 3ahardwood 3akilns 3alatitude 3asimulation models 3awater content 3aweather 3aAustralia 0aNumerical simulation 0aSolar kiln 0aTimber drying1 aLangrish, Timothy A.

The use of lignin as a source of polyol to make lignin-based polyurethanes (PUs) has been the subject of intense studies in recent years. It is well known that there is a difference in reactivity between aliphatic and aromatic hydroxyl groups towards isocyanates. For simple model systems using conventional fossil-fuel based polyols the overall kinetics are well known. However, unveiling the complex kinetic behavior obtained when combining an isocyanate with lignin derived components exhibiting different types of hydroxyl groups is challenging. Therefore, an in-depth investigation using lignin model compounds and lignin hydrogenolysis oil to elucidate these differences of reactivity is presented and will be invaluable towards the development of lignin-based PUs. Understanding the kinetics involved will lead to optimized synthetic protocols and a higher valorization potential for lignin-based PUs. In this work, various monolignol model compounds are studied concerning their reactivity to aliphatic and aromatic isocyanates. Isothermal experiments revealed the kinetic rate constants and reaction orders while non-isothermal DSC was used to obtain the activation energies through the Friedman isoconversion model-free-kinetics (MFK) approach. These results were confirmed with FT-IR and ¹H NMR. It was found that in all cases, aliphatic hydroxide groups react the fastest with aromatic isocyanates while aromatic hydroxide groups react the slowest with aromatic isocyanates. Reactions with aliphatic isocyanates, independent of the hydroxyl type, fall in between these extremes shown by the aromatic isocyanates. Apparent activation energies ranging from 55.2 kJ·mol⁻¹ to 39.5 kJ·mol⁻¹ were found with corresponding reaction rate constants ranging from 5.19·10⁻³ M¹⁻ⁿ s⁻¹ to 1.04·10⁻³ M¹⁻ⁿ s⁻¹. The presented work will be a capstone for the further valorization of lignin as a material for renewable PUs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3afossil fuels 3alignin 3aoils 3apolyols 3aurethane 0aPolyurethane 0aKinetics 0aHydroxyl groups 0aBiomaterials1 aWesemael, M.

Two parameters including the composition of casting solutions and the solvent evaporation time were selected. In this study, PVC/PVC-g-PEGMA blended membranes were prepared by non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) using 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as mixing solvents. We found that (1) the membrane morphologies like surface pore size and porosity decreased as the ratio of THF to NMP increased, which resulted in the decrease in pure water flux and the increase of sodium alginate (SA) rejection ratio; (2) the presence of THF in the casting solution could significantly lower the membrane surface roughness compared to only using NMP as a solvent; (3) solvent evaporation for an appropriate time increased the hydrophilicity of the membrane. Among these findings, we achieved a membrane exhibiting the highest flux recovery ratio of 98.65 ± 0.85% with a mixing ratio of 1 : 9 (THF : NMP) at 60 s of evaporation time. High pollutant rejection and high flux recovery ratio were achieved. This study provides more insight into the PVC/PVC-g-PEGMA membrane and a more flexible approach to the application of PVC membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevaporation 3ahydrophilicity 3amethyl ethers 3amixing 3amixing ratio 3apollutants 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3aporosity 3aseparation 3asodium alginate 3asolvents 3asurface roughness 3atetrahydrofuran1 aXie, Wancen1 aWu, Haibo1 aWang, Liang1 aLiang, Songmiao1 aChang, Haiqing1 aLiu, Baicang0 tRSC advances.g2019 Oct. 25, v. 9, no. 59 p.34486-34495dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra05454e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245017200209520108900381592002801470650004101498650001701539650002201556650002101578650001601599650002501615650001901640653002901659653002201688653002601710653002501736653000601761653001501767700006001782700002001842700001801862700005801880700006201938700002102000700002502021773011502046856008602161852000902247655001202256IND60790588020221120101229.0220906e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079058802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.1054972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Tam V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9111-439313aAn interactive graphical interface tool for parameter calibration, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis, and visualization for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool  aThe Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is one of the most widely used and well-tested eco-hydrological models.

Third-party packages can be integrated into R-SWAT with minimum effort. The application of R-SWAT for a test case study demonstrates its functionalities. In general, R-SWAT (1) is a potential platform for developing and testing new sensitivity or optimization packages, and (2) promotes the understanding of hydrological processes with open-source SWAT and R.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3ahydrologic cycle 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 3auser interface 0aGraphical user interface 0aModel calibration 0aParameter sensitivity 0aUncertainty analysis 0aR 0aSWAT model1 aDietrich, Jörg,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1742-80251 aDang, Thanh Duc1 aTran, Dang An1 aVan Doan, Binh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7687-05501 aSarrazin, Fanny J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9928-95661 aAbbaspour, Karim1 aSrinivasan, Raghavan0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2022 Oct., v. 156 p.105497-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.1054973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011900169300001600288520162700304592002801931650001301959650001201972650001201984650001101996650001302007650001102020650001102031650001402042650001502056650001602071650000902087650000902096650001402105650001402119650001502133650001102148650000702159650001402166650000902180650001102189650001402200650000802214650000902222700003702231700001702268700002202285700002702307773010502334856008202439990002302521852000902544655001202553IND60097734720221123005120.0141104e20131010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009773472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2013.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGredilla, Ainara10aLong-term monitoring of metal pollution in sediments from the estuary of the Nerbioi-Ibaizabal River (2005–2010)  ap. 129-139.  aThis work aims to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of trace metals in sediment samples taken from the Nerbioi-Ibaizabal River estuary (Bilbao, Basque Country) over the course of a long-term surveillance monitoring programme from 2005 to 2010. Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) and the geoaccumulation indexes (Igₑₒ) were used to assess the environmental risk posed by metal content in the estuary sediment. Sediment was collected at eight different sites in the estuary every three months over the period of investigation. A total of 14 elements (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sn, V and Zn) were selected and the concentration of each was measured in all samples. Additionally, conductivity, pH and the concentration of carbonate, total organic carbon and fulvic and humic acids were also measured in those samples collected in sampling campaigns from March 2006 to October 2008. The concentration of most of the metals systematically decreased over the period of investigation. There are still some points of the estuary (those located in the surroundings of the Gobela and Galindo tributaries), however, where concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn are significantly higher than the background values estimated for the area. According to the mean Effects Range Median quotients (mERMqs) calculated for these sites, sediments may still pose a toxicological threat to living organisms. Metal content in inner estuary sediment is low. Specific point sources of metals to the estuary, together with background contamination of diffuse origin, are probably responsible for this situation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acarbon 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aestuaries 3aguidelines 3ahumic acids 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amonitoring 3anickel 3apH 3apollution 3arisk 3arivers 3asediments 3atin 3azinc1 aFdez-Ortiz de Vallejuelo, Silvia1 aArana, Gorka1 ade Diego, Alberto1 aMadariaga, Juan Manuel0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2013 Oct. 10, v. 131 p.129-139dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2013.07.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245013500204300001600339520147900355592002801834650001901862650000801881650002001889650001501909650001101924650002001935650001201955650001501967651001101982700005801993700005902051773012602110856008302236852000902319655001202328IND60696792520221116161400.0210720e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069679252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-020-00749-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelch, L.

While warming is known to speed many rate processes, the acute effects of temperature on performance under field conditions remain poorly studied. The effects of temperature are usually nonlinear, and tropical animals have been predicted to be particularly likely to be negatively affected by global warming as they may have optimal temperatures that are close to current ambient temperatures. We observed three different A. colombica colonies three times per day (two times during daylight hours and one time at night) during June 2018 in Gamboa, Panama, measuring air temperature, ant traffic, intake of leaves per second, and ant walking speeds. We found that ant walking speed and intake of leaves increased at higher temperatures. Leaves carried per ant also increased with temperature, suggesting that warmer temperatures improve leaf-handling rates, at least over the thermal range studied here. However, there was also an independent effect of time of day, with higher foraging in the morning than the evening, despite similar air temperatures. Consistent with the positive effect of temperature on foraging rates, critical thermal maxima were well above ground temperatures. At least during the rainy season, our data suggest that moderate warming could enhance foraging success and herbivory of leafcutting ants in semi-deciduous moist forests throughout much of the day.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtta colombica 3aair 3aair temperature 3aherbivores 3aleaves 3asolar radiation 3atraffic 3awet season 3aPanama1 aBaudier, K.

Our results identified replicated habitat-specific (adaptive) phenotypic divergence in the brown macroalga Fucus vesiculosus that is independent of population (neutral) genetic structure. F. vesiculosus inhabits contiguous and contrasting marine to estuarine intertidal habitats. Combining analyses of genetic and phenotypic traits of populations living under differential selective regimes (estuaries and open coast), we investigated levels of neutral genetic differentiation and adaptive physiological responses to emersion stress. In southwest England (SW UK) and northern Iberia (N. Iberia), populations living in estuaries and marine coastal habitats were genetically characterized at six microsatellite loci. In N. Iberia, two clades with limited admixture were recovered, each including one open coast site and the adjacent estuarine location. In contrast, SW UK samples clustered according to habitat and formed three distinct groups of genotypes; one including the two open coast locations and the other two representing each of the estuarine sites. Temperature loggers revealed distinct emersion regimes that characterized each habitat type independently of the region, while water and air temperature profiles showed site-specific trends. Despite acclimation under usual conditions, trait means of emersion stress resilience showed a strong phenotypic divergence between habitats, consistent with environmental clines in exposure time observed in the different habitats. We demonstrate that neutral genetic clusters do not reflect locally adapted population units. Our results identified replicated habitat-specific (adaptive) phenotypic divergence that is independent of population (neutral) genetic structure in F. vesiculosus. The significance of such findings extends beyond the theoretical evolutionary and ecological interest of discovering parallel adaptive responses to the broader implications for conservation of intraspecific biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFucus vesiculosus 3aacclimation 3aadaptive radiation 3aair temperature 3abiodiversity 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3aexposure duration 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahabitats 3amacroalgae 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphenotypic variation 3aphysiological response 3atemperature profiles 3aEngland 3aIberian Peninsula1 aNicastro, K.R.1 aFerreira Costa, J.1 aSerrão, E.A.1 aPearson, G.A.0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2013 Oct. 10, v. 131 p.140-148dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2013.08.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02043naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245014200170300001800312520080700330592002801137650001401165650002301179650001401202650001301216650001501229650001201244650001801256650001201274650001501286650001401301653002701315653001901342653002701361653003201388700001901420700002301439773008101462856008101543852000901624655001201633IND60568543020221122104259.0170709e20170706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056854302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2017.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzabó, Katalin E.10aC-Glycosyl 1,2,4-triazoles: Synthesis of the 3-β-d-glucopyranosyl-1,5-disubstituted and 5-β-d-glucopyranosyl-1,3-disubstituted variants  ap. 3810-3822.  aHighly variable synthetic routes were elaborated toward trisubstituted C-glycopyranosyl 1,2,4-triazoles.

PKM catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenol-pyruvate to pyruvate in glycolytic pathway. PKM1 exist as a stable tetramer that is at an active enzyme state, while PKM2 is in equilibrium among monomer, dimer and tetramer under the regulation of its allosteric activators. Many cancer cells show the feature of higher glucose uptake and lactate production in spite of oxygen availability, which is known as the Warburg effect. PKM2 is upregulated in most cancer types and the inactive PKM2 lead to the cancer metabolism. In addition, dimeric PKM2 induces its nuclear translocation through posttranslational modification and acts as a transcriptional co-activator for the expression of oncogenes. Therefore, it is important to elucidate mechanisms for modulation of an active or inactive state of PKM2, namely the tetramer-to-dimer-transition. The definitive difference between PKM1 and PKM2 is to constitutively form tetramer or not in the cytoplasm, which is ascribed to 22 amino acids derived from exon 9 (PKM1) or exon 10 (PKM2). In this study, we generated 22 different PKM1-mimetic point mutants of PKM2, and demonstrated that replacement of cysteine424 residue of PKM2 with leucine424 conserved in PKM1 (C424L) promote its tetramerization. PKM2(C424L) formed a tetramer without allosteric activator, and escaped the inhibitory effects by oxidative stress, like PKM1. Our findings intensely suggest that C424 or L424 determines the different catalytic and modulatory properties between PKM splicing isoforms.  aPublisher supplied data 3acysteine 3acytoplasm 3aexons 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3alactic acid 3aoncogenes 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3apost-translational modification 3apyruvate kinase 3apyruvic acid 3aresearch 3atranscription (genetics) 0aPyruvate kinase M 0aSplicing isoforms1 aHashimoto, Kozue1 aKihara, Daiki1 aTsuzuki, Chizuru1 aKataoka, Naoyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4498-74201 aSuzuki, K.q(Kenji),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8630-44160 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 June 11, v. 526, no. 4 p.973-977dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.1823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03964naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245008800159300001800247500002000265520173500285592002802020596006802048596007802116650002102194650002202215650001702237650001102254650001802265650001602283650001802299650001402317650001102331650001402342650001002356650002302366650002602389650002202415650001102437650001902448650001802467650001002485651001202495700005702507700001702564700001702581700001702598700001602615700001802631700001502649700001802664700005402682700001702736700001802753700001502771700001702786700001502803700001602818700001302834700001702847700002202864700005502886700001702941700005702958773013203015856007403147852000903221655001203230IND60754817020221119224229.0211024e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075481702DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.136482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Pengxiang10aInsights into the effect of human civilization on Malus evolution and domestication  ap. 2206-2220.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe evolutionary history of the Malus genus has not been well studied. In the current study, we presented genetic evidence on the origin of the Malus genus based on genome sequencing of 297 Malus accessions, revealing the genetic relationship between wild species and cultivated apples. Our results demonstrated that North American and East Asian wild species are closer to the outgroup (pear) than Central Asian species, and hybrid species including natural (separated before the Pleistocene, about 2.5 Mya) and artificial hybrids (including ornamental trees and rootstocks) are between East and Central Asian wild species. Introgressions from M. sylvestris in cultivated apples appeared to be more extensive than those from M. sieversii, whose genetic background flowed westward across Eurasia and eastward to wild species including M. prunifolia, M. × asiatica, M. × micromalus, and M. × robust. Our results suggested that the loss of ancestral gene flow from M. sieversii in cultivated apples accompanied the movement of European traders around the world since the Age of Discovery. Natural SNP variations showed that cultivated apples had higher nucleotide diversity than wild species and more unique SNPs than other apple groups. An apple ERECTA‐like gene that underwent selection during domestication on 15ᵗʰ chromosome was identified as a likely major determinant of fruit length and diameter, and an NB‐ARC domain‐containing gene was found to strongly affect anthocyanin accumulation using a genome‐wide association approach. Our results provide new insights into the origin and domestication of apples and will be useful in new breeding programmes and efforts to increase fruit crop productivity.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS‐27cEarmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System  a2020zdzx03‐01‐02cKey S&T Special Projects of Shaanxi Province, China 3aMalus sylvestris 3aPleistocene epoch 3aanthocyanins 3aapples 3abiotechnology 3achromosomes 3adomestication 3aevolution 3afruits 3agene flow 3agenes 3agenetic background 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3ahybrid species 3aintrogression 3apears 3aEurasia1 aLi, Zhongxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6869-48441 aZhang, Dehui1 aShen, Wenyun1 aXie, Yinpeng1 aZhang, Jing1 aJiang, Lijuan1 aLi, Xuewei1 aShen, Xiaoxia1 aGeng, Dali1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1266-96281 aWang, Liping1 aNiu, Chundong1 aBao, Chana1 aYan, Mingjia1 aLi, Haiyan1 aLi, Cuiying1 aYan, Yan1 aZou, Yangjun1 aMicheletti, Diego1 aKoot, Emily1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1956-34151 aMa, Fengwang1 aGuan, Qingmei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3153-31470 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2021 Nov., v. 19, no. 11 p.2206-2220dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774064x1467-76447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.136483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007200168506010400240506007600344520090200420592002801322506003701350650002401387650001401411650001501425650001601440650001701456650001601473650001401489650001401503650001901517650002801536700002401564700002701588773011101615856008201726852000901808655001201817IND60790588320221207130818.0220914e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079058832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2022.1022022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurge, Rebecca J10aUbiquitin and ubiquitin-like conjugation systems in trypanosomatids  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn eukaryotic cells, reversible attachment of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers (Ubls) to specific target proteins is conducted by multicomponent systems whose collective actions control protein fate and cell behaviour in precise but complex ways. In trypanosomatids, attachment of ubiquitin and Ubls to target proteins regulates the cell cycle, endocytosis, protein sorting and degradation, autophagy and various aspects of infection and stress responses. The extent of these systems in trypanosomatids has been surveyed in recent reports, while in Leishmania mexicana, essential roles have been defined for many ubiquitin-system genes in deletion mutagenesis and life-cycle phenotyping campaigns.

For example, the plant alkaloid, nicotine, can reduce infections by the trypanosome gut parasite (Crithidia bombi) in bumblebees. Parasitized bumblebees may be drawn to nicotine and thereby self-medicate their infection. We tested the hypothesis that nicotine can reduce infections of a common microsporidian pathogen, Nosema ceranae, in the honey bee gut. We found, however, that that a field realistic exposure dose of 1 ppm nicotine was not preferentially consumed by Apis mellifera foragers fed live Nosema spores (5 × 10⁴ spores per bee; N = 160). One-day-old bees infected with Nosema (1 × 10⁴ spores per bee; N = 160) showed no repression of nosemosis over a chronically applied exposure gradient of 0, 10⁻², 10⁻¹, 10⁰, 10¹, 10², 10³ or 10⁴ ppm nicotine. Since imbibed nicotine may not effectively reach the spores in the bee gut, we conducted an in vitro experiment, in which Nosema spores were exposed up to 10⁴ ppm nicotine in vials, rinsed of nicotine, and then fed to 1 day old bees (2 × 10⁴ spores per bee; N = 216). However, the in vitro nicotine-treated spores remained infectious. Nicotine did impair bee mortality at high concentrations. Dietary nicotine is evidently not a treatment for nosemosis, but future studies should continue to examine the role of phytochemicals and bee health.  aPublisher supplied data  a20162891cNorth American Pollinator Protection Campaign (NAPPC) Pollinator Partnership  a20162891cNorth American Pollinator Protection Campaign (NAPPC) Pollinator Partnership 3aApis mellifera 3aCrithidia bombi 3aNosema ceranae 3aTrypanosoma 3abee pollen 3adigestive system 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3amortality 3anectar 3anicotine 3anosema disease 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3apathogens 3aphytochemicals1 aBain, J.

This difference can be due to salinity, temperature, concentration, turbidity, or a combination of them. Over a sloping bottom, the inflowing momentum decreases progressively until a critical stage is reached where the inflow plunges underneath the ambient and flows adjacent to the bed as an underflow density current. In the present work, a new equation is proposed in order to predict the critical depth for plunging, i.e., the plunging criterion. It differs from previous studies since it includes the role of the settling velocity and the bed slope. The high spatiotemporal resolution from twelve original numerical simulations allows us to validate the initial hypotheses established, in addition to numerical and experimental data available in the literature, and good agreement is found between them. A negative value for the mixing coefficient was observed for the first time for the hyperpycnal flow in a tilted channel. This indicates that if the settling velocity of the suspended material is high enough, the submerged flow may lose fluid to the environment (detrainment), instead of incorporating it. The proposed plunging criterion may assist in the design of future experimental or numerical works.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amomentum 3asalinity 3atemperature 3aturbidity 0aPlunging flow 0aPlunging criterion 0aTurbidity current 0aLarge-eddy Simulation1 aMeiburg, Eckart1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3670-81931 aH.

X-ray diffraction analysis reveals much purer and smaller sizes of acanthite phase of Ag ₂S QDs modified by MPS than those by TGA. Lower concentrations of silver ions in samples of MPS-Ag ₂S-modified fabrics were demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectra analysis. Degradation of methylene blue by Ag ₂S QD-sensitized TiO ₂ is in accordance with pseudo-first kinetic model. Decrease in contact angles and decoloration of red wine on silk fabrics show that Ag ₂S QDs modified by TGA or MPS can be used as sensitizer in photocatalytic reactions of TiO ₂. TGA appears highly efficient than MPS in sensitizing TiO ₂ with Ag ₂S QDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3acontact angle 3adecolorization 3aions 3akinetics 3amethylene blue 3aphotocatalysis 3aquantum dots 3ared wines 3asilk fabric 3asilver 3asulfides 3atitanium dioxide 0aquantum dot 0aself-cleaning 0asilk fabric 0aanatase 0aphotocatalysis1 aQi, Zhenming1 aChen, Guoqiang0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2016 Dec. 1, v. 107, no. 12 p.1501-1510dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2015.11282273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012100166500002200287520074600309592002801055650002201083650002301105650002201128650001301150650002301163650001601186650002101202650001701223653001901240653001301259653001601272653002201288653001301310700002101323700002501344700002001369700002201389700002401411773005601435856008101491852000901572655001201581IND60568543220221120103139.0170628s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056854322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2017.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdamski, Ariel10aNovel family of fused tricyclic [1,4]diazepines: Design, synthesis, crystal structures and molecular docking studies  aPre-press version  aAn efficient one-pot strategy for the synthesis of a new family of imidazo[1,4]diazepines has been developed and its mechanism has been proposed, which follows a seven-membered ring closure reaction.

Moisture content (MC) was measured at 58 points in various locations of the timber using a new in-process monitoring concept. This concept uses the relationship between temperature, pressure, and equilibrium moisture content (EMC). Factors affecting the accuracy of MC measurement were also investigated in this study. The results showed that small wood pieces reached equilibrium at constant conditions within 1.5 h of the fiber saturation point (FSP) and that using the mean value of temperature and pressure within 30 min during radio-frequency/vacuum (RF/V) drying for MC measurement was an efficient method. The accuracy of moisture content measurement was the same for both drying schedules A and B. It can be concluded that air in wood was removed completely with drying schedule B and that below the FSP, pressure in the wood was maintained only by water vapor pressure during drying. It was possible to obtain accurate MC measurement.

The microplastics were extracted from the sediment cores through a density floating separation method. The shape, size, and color of the microplastics was then observed under a microscope. Polymer types were identified using micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The average abundance of microplastics was 13.2 ± 6.0 items 50 g⁻¹ dry weight. The main components of microplastics were polystyrene, cellophane, polyethylene and polypropylene. The quantities of microplastics at different depths in the sediment cores were consistent with the history of microplastic pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellophane 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amarine environment 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 3apolystyrenes 3asalt marshes 3asediments 3aChina 0aSediment cores 0aTemporal trends 0aAndong salt marsh1 aHuang, Wei1 aXu, Yongjiu1 aJin, Aimin1 aZhang, Dongdong1 aZhang, Chunfang0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2020 Mar., v. 35 p.101149-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2020.1011493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010400169300001500273520116200288592002801450650001801478650002101496650001401517650001301531650001201544650001701556650001501573650000901588650002301597650002201620650002801642650001901670653002601689653002701715653002701742653002801769653003901797700001601836700001901852700001401871700001501885700001801900700001701918773009301935856008502028852000902113655001202122IND60552091820221120205508.0161020e20141010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055209182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.07.4442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Jingyang10aStimulating short-chain fatty acids production from waste activated sludge by nano zero-valent iron  ap. 98-105.  aAn efficient and green strategy, i.e. adding nano zero-valent iron into anaerobic fermentation systems to remarkably stimulate the accumulation of short-chain fatty acids from waste activated sludge via accelerating the solubilization and hydrolysis processes has been developed. In the presence of nano zero-valent iron, not only the short-chain fatty acids production was significantly improved, but also the fermentation time for maximal short-chain fatty acids was shortened compared with those in the absence of nano zero-valent iron. Mechanism investigations showed that the solubilization of sludge, hydrolysis of solubilized substances and acidification of hydrolyzed products were all enhanced by addition of nano zero-valent iron. Also, the general microbial activity of anaerobes and relative activities of key enzymes with hydrolysis and acidification of organic matters were improved than those in the control. 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing analysis suggested that the abundance of bacteria responsible for waste activated sludge hydrolysis and short-chain fatty acids production was greatly enhanced due to nano zero-valent iron addition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aactivated sludge 3aanaerobes 3abacteria 3aenzymes 3afermentation 3ahydrolysis 3airon 3amicrobial activity 3asequence analysis 3ashort chain fatty acids 3asolubilization 0aNano zero-valent iron 0aAnaerobic fermentation 0aWaste activated sludge 0aShort-chain fatty acids 0a454 high-throughput pyrosequencing1 aFeng, Leiyu1 aChen, Yinguang1 aLi, Xiang1 aChen, Hong1 aXiao, Naidong1 aWang, Dongbo0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2014 Oct. 10, v. 187 p.98-105dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.07.4443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013500161300001800296500002000314520195500334592002802289596008002317596003002397596003202427596005002459596002902509650002302538650001202561650000902573650001402582650001402596650000902610700001802619700002002637773014602657856007502803852000902878655001202887IND60786361820221120181524.0220803e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078636182DNAL7 a10.1002/tafs.100982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAilloud, Lisa E.10aShort‐Term Pain and Long‐Term Gain: Using Phased‐In Minimum Size Limits to Rebuild Stocks—the Pacific Bluefin Tuna Example  ap. 1015-1029.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLike many stocks, the Pacific Bluefin Tuna Thunnus orientalis has been considerably depleted. High exploitation rates on very young fish have reduced the spawning stock biomass (SSB) to 2.6% of the unexploited level. We provide a framework for exploring potential benefits of minimum size regulations as a mechanism for rebuilding stocks, and we illustrate the approach using simulations patterned after Pacific Bluefin Tuna dynamics. We attempt to mitigate short‐term losses in yield by considering a phased‐in management strategy. With this approach, the minimum size limit (MSL) is gradually increased as biomass rebuilds, giving fishing communities time to adjust to new restrictions. We estimated short‐ and long‐term effects of different MSLs on yield and biomass by using data from the 2016 assessment. A variety of scenarios was considered for growth compensation, discard mortality, and interest rates. The long‐term value of the fishery was maximized by setting an MSL of 92 cm FL, which resulted in a 70% loss in yield during the first year (short‐term pain). By implementing the MSL in two phases (64 cm FL in year 1; 92 cm FL in subsequent years), the long‐term value of the fishery was maintained, and the short‐term pain was reduced to a maximum 46% loss in yield during any 1 year. Under a three‐phase implementation (55 cm FL in year 1; 77 cm FL in year 2; and 92 cm FL in subsequent years), the short‐term pain was further reduced to a maximum loss of 30% during any 1 year. With no discard mortality, long‐term yield increased by 165% and SSB increased 13‐fold (to 33% of virgin SSB), regardless of the number of phases used. Long‐term benefits were quickly diminished with increasing discard mortality. This simulation approach is widely applicable to cases where minimum size changes are contemplated; for Pacific Bluefin Tuna, our simulations demonstrate that size limits should be considered.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Southeast Fisheries Science Center  cNMFS Sea Grant Fellowship  cNational Science Foundation  cCommonwealth of Virginia Equipment Trust Fund  cOffice of Naval Research 3aThunnus orientalis 3abiomass 3afish 3afisheries 3amortality 3apain1 aGedamke, Todd1 aHoenig, John M.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2018 Nov., v. 147, no. 6 p.1015-1029dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19703x0002-84877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.100983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008700156300001800243500002000261520185300281592002802134596004502162596004002207596006302247596002702310596004802337596005302385650002402438650003202462650003102494650002402525650002602549650002802575650000902603650001402612650001802626650001402644650001702658650001502675651002202690700003202712700002202744700006302766700001702829773014602846856007502992852000903067655001203076IND60786361920221120181701.0220803e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078636192DNAL7 a10.1002/tafs.101172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanft, Eric10aVulnerability of Juvenile Bighead and Silver Carps to Predation by Largemouth Bass  ap. 1207-1214.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe establishment of Bighead Carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and Silver Carp H. molitrix throughout the Mississippi River basin potentially expands the prey base for native predators. A mechanistic understanding of interactions between nonnative prey and native predators is needed to assess the potential for predator regulation of Hypophthalmichthys carp populations and impacts on native predator assemblages. We conducted a series of experiments to quantify the selectivity and efficiency of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides predation on juveniles of both of these Hypophthalmichthys species and behaviors that potentially influence this selectivity and efficiency. Selectivity was measured over 24 h in 2‐m‐diameter pools containing one of two prey assemblages consisting of three individuals from each of three species: (1) Bighead Carp with native littoral (Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus) and pelagic prey (Golden Shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas) or (2) Bighead Carp, Silver Carp, and a morphologically similar native prey (Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum). Foraging efficiency and predator–prey behaviors were quantified in 45‐min trials in which Largemouth Bass foraged on 10 individuals of a single prey species inside a 750‐L observation tank. All prey species were readily attacked and consumed by Largemouth Bass; Silver Carp were selected less often than Gizzard Shad, and Bighead Carp were selected at a higher rate than any of the other prey species. Of the species tested, Bighead Carp formed the tightest schools and were captured most efficiently by Largemouth Bass. Overall, Hypophthalmichthys carps were similar to native prey in their vulnerability to Largemouth Bass; therefore, factors affecting Hypophthalmichthys carp availability relative to native prey may shape postinvasion predator–prey interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  cIllinois Department of Natural Resources  cThe Illinois Natural History Survey  cDepartment of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences  cUniversity of Illinois  cInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee  a11053cUniversity of Illinois Urbana–Champaign 3aDorosoma cepedianum 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3aHypophthalmichthys nobilis 3aLepomis macrochirus 3aMicropterus salmoides 3aNotemigonus crysoleucas 3acarp 3ajuveniles 3alittoral zone 3apredation 3aprey species 3awatersheds 3aMississippi River1 aParkos, Joseph J., IIIcIII1 aCollins, Scott F.1 aPorreca, Anthony P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7401-49021 aWahl, D.

Higher estimates of heritability coupled with the higher genetic advance for plant height, number of peduncles per plant, number of pods per plant and pod yield per plant indicated that these traits are under the control of additive genes. Correlationanalysis pointed out the importance of number of branches/plant, peduncles/plant, pods/plant, pod length, pod weight and number of seeds/pod towards pod yield. Forty three genotypes were mainly divided into 2 clusters with 38 and 5 genotypes at the first node.

However, hybrid sterility between O. longistaminata and O. sativa hinders application of desirable genes in rice production. In order to further understand the nature of interspecific hybrid sterility between these two species, near isogenic lines (NILs) were raised with RD23, an indica cultivar from Thailand, as background and an accession of O. longistaminata as donor. Using two NIL/RD23 F2 populations, a new pollen sterility gene, denoted as HYBRID STERILITY 44(t) or S44(t) in abbreviation, was mapped between simple sequence repeat markers RM5814 and RM20695 on the long arm of rice chromosome 6. The genetic pattern of S44(t) follows one-locus allelic interaction model. The interaction between S44(t)-sativa and S44(t)-longistaminata leads to partial abortion of male gametes carrying the allele of S44(t)-sativa in the heterozygotes, but the spikelet fertility is not affected by S44(t).  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza longistaminata 3aOryza sativa 3aalleles 3achromosomes 3acrop production 3acultivars 3agerm cells 3aheterozygosity 3ahybrids 3aisogenic lines 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3apollen 3arice 3aThailand1 aLi, Jing1 aXu, Peng1 aZhou, Jiawu1 aHu, Fengyi1 aDeng, Xianneng1 aDeng, Wei1 aTao, Dayun0 tEuphytica.g2012 Oct., v. 187, no. 3 p.339-344dSpringer-Verlagx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-012-0691-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03925naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006300149245017800212300001300390520184800403592002802251650001302279650001702292650001902309650002902328650001702357650002702374650002402401650002002425650002602445650002902471650002402500650001002524650002302534650001402557650002602571650002102597650001102618650002102629650001002650650001802660650001302678651001102691653003202702653001702734653002102751653002602772653002602798653001302824653001102837700005702848700001502905700007302920700006702993700002103060700002503081773008803106856008403194852000903278655001203287IND60626460120221118230722.0190410e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062646012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.limno.2018.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusonge, Peace S.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8751-251310aBaseline assessment of benthic macroinvertebrate community structure and ecological water quality in Rwenzori rivers (Albertine rift valley, Uganda) using biotic-index tools  ap. 1-10.  aThe Rwenzori Mountains and Albertine Rift region of southwestern Uganda are part of a globally recognized biodiversity hotspot, but are currently facing pressures from intensified agriculture, mineral exploitation and hydroelectric power generation. This study was undertaken to assess the ecological water quality of Rwenzori rivers using biomonitoring metrics to determine the major factors shaping macroinvertebrate community structure in disturbed and undisturbed sites. We sampled macroinvertebrates at 66 sites along headwater tributaries and downstream areas of the Nyamwamba, Mubuku and Nyamugasani rivers, supplemented by five sites along the Kazinga channel and Lake George wetland, and identified a total of 32,579 macroinvertebrates to family level. Insecta was the most diverse taxon (45 families). Based on Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) scores, sites were classified into four ecological water quality groups as excellent (40 sites), good (16), fair (7) and poor (8). Upstream sites had the highest abundance of pollution-sensitive families such as Caenidae and Hydropsychidae, while downstream sites had high numbers of Chironomidae. Lorenz curves revealed a low degree of evenness with Gini coefficient values ranging from 0.75 to 0.94. Ordination analysis revealed that total phosphorus, specific conductivity, chloride and chemical oxygen demand were key environmental variables contributing to variation among the sites. The majority of sites did show little to no anthropogenic influence with the exception of downstream sites. The results of this study provide useful baseline reference data, to assess and better manage the impacts of anthropogenic activities on the ecological integrity of the region’s aquatic systems. Furthermore, these datasets will advance the development of a regional family-level biotic index.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenidae 3aChironomidae 3aHydropsychidae 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3achemical oxygen demand 3acommunity structure 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ahydroelectric power 3alakes 3amacroinvertebrates 3amountains 3aordination techniques 3apower generation 3arivers 3atotal phosphorus 3awater 3awater quality 3awetlands 3aUganda 0aMacroinvertebrate diversity 0aBiotic index 0aRiver monitoring 0aEcological assessment 0aAlbertine rift valley 0aRwenzori 0aUganda1 aBoets, Pieter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8183-328X1 aLock, Koen1 aDamanik Ambarita, Naomi Minar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1968-20941 aForio, Marie Anne Eurie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6675-47511 aVerschuren, Dirk1 aGoethals, Peter L.M.0 tLimnologica.g2019 Mar., v. 75 p.1-10dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1974x0075-95117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2018.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010400171300001400275520134700289592002801636650002701664650002501691650001701716650001801733650003301751650000901784650002101793650002501814650003201839650001501871650002601886650002301912653001201935653001801947653003401965653003401999653002902033700002302062700002302085700002102108700002102129700001902150773009202169856008502261852000902346655001202355IND60552092120221120205711.0161020e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055209212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.07.4472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOßwald, Corina12aA highly unusual polyketide synthase directs dawenol polyene biosynthesis in Stigmatella aurantiaca  ap. 54-63.  aEnormous progress in the field of polyketide biosynthesis has led to the establishment of rules for general text book biosynthetic logic and consequently to the assumption that biosynthetic genes can be easily correlated with the corresponding natural products. However, non-textbook examples of polyketide assembly continue to be discovered suggesting the gene to product and product to gene predictions need improvement, especially as they are increasingly used in the post-genomic era. Here, we analyzed the genomic blueprint of a myxobacterial multi-producer of secondary metabolites, Stigmatella aurantiaca DW4/3-1, for its biosynthetic potential by genome-mining. In addition to the five polyketide synthase and/or nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters of known function we identified a further 13 genomic regions exemplifying the enormous genetic potential for the production of additional chemical diversity by this strain. We show by gene inactivation and heterologous expression of the newly identified biosynthetic pathway for dawenol that the biosynthesis of this known polyene does not follow text book biosynthetic logic. Intriguingly, a genomic locus encoding an unusual polyketide synthase exhibiting similarity to gene loci involved in the formation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and secondary lipids was identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStigmatella aurantiaca 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3agenome mining 3aheterologous gene expression 3aloci 3amultigene family 3apolyketide synthases 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aprediction 3asecondary metabolites 3astrain differences 0aDawenol 0aGenome-mining 0aPUFA-like polyketide synthase 0aIterative polyketide synthase 0aSecondary lipid synthase1 aZaburannyi, Nestor1 aBurgard, Christian1 aHoffmann, Thomas1 aWenzel, Silke C.1 aMüller, Rolf,0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 191 p.54-63dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.07.4473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245015200170300001600322500001900338520105600357592002801413650001501441650001001456650001701466650001101483650001001494650001901504650001801523653002301541653001901564653001401583653001201597653001001609700001701619773021101636856008301847852000901930655001201939IND60696712220221119021528.0200607e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069671222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.japb.2020.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yŏng-sŏn,10aRange expansion and redescription of the hagfish Eptatretus walkeri (Myxiniformes: Myxinidae) from Northeast Asia and its distinction from E. atami  ap. 182-188.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEptatretus walkeri was originally described based on 25 specimens from several coasts of Japan by McMillan and Wisner in 2004. We report the first collection of this species since its first description, based on 80 specimens caught at several localities along the southern Korean coast. Eptatretus walkeri is distinguished from its congeners by six gill pouches and gill apertures arranged in a closely spaced, linear pattern or a slightly crowded, irregular pattern; absence of branchial slime pores; 3/2 fused cusps; 36–44 total cusps; 68–79 total slime pores; faint or absent eyespots; poorly developed ventral fin-fold; and gill aperture surrounded by a pale margin. Based on molecular data (mtDNA), Eptatretus walkeri differs from other congeners by 0.9–4.5% in 16S ribosomal RNA gene, and 5.2–12.6% in cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. Because Eptatretus walkeri is poorly known, we redescribe the species based on additional voucher specimens, report its range expansion, and discuss its past taxonomic confusion with E. atami (Dean 1904)  aPublisher supplied data 3aEptatretus 3aJapan 3abiodiversity 3acoasts 3agenes 3aredescriptions 3aribosomal RNA 0aEptatretus walkeri 0amtDNA 16S rRNA 0amtDNA COI 0ahagfish 0aKorea1 aKim, Jin-Koo0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific biodiversity(Online).g2020 June 01, v. 13, no. 2 p.182-188dElsevier B.V.aNational Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA)wJournal:23211x2287-884X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japb.2020.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245013000165300001600295520117800311592002801489650001601517650002901533650002101562650001801583650003101601650002401632650001001656650001701666650001901683650001401702700001301716700001801729700001601747700001701763700001801780773014101798856008701939852000902026655001202035IND60598262720221122035210.0200511e20090101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059826272DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2009.115125472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tao,10aRoles of CmFL, CmAFL1, and CmSOC1 in the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.  ap. 447-453.  aThe transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is marked by the termination of vegetative development and adoption of a floral identity by the shoot apical meristem. This process is called the floral transition. To elucidate the molecular determinants involved in this process in chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.), we isolated the following three floral identity and/or integrator genes from plants: CmFL, a homologue of FLORICAULA (FLO)/LEAFY (LFY); CmAFL1, a member of the APETALA1 (AP1)/FRUITFULL (FUL) sub-family; and CmSOC1, a member of the SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1) sub-family. Up-regulated expression of CmFL in Arabidopsis resulted in an early-flowering phenotype. Our data show significant up-regulation of expression of all three of the above-mentioned genes and a strong correlation between the floral transition and gene expression under three different photoperiodic conditions. This study strongly suggests that CmFL, CmAFL1, and CmSOC1 are involved in the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, and are activated co-ordinately after the floral transition in early-developing inflorescences in chrysanthemum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aChrysanthemum morifolium 3aapical meristems 3abiotechnology 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahorticulture 3ainflorescences 3aphenotype1 aNiki, T.1 aNishijima, T.1 aDouzono, M.1 aKoshioka, M.1 aHisamatsu, T.0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2009 Jan. 1, v. 84, no. 4 p.447-453dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2009.115125473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245011700177300001400294520190400308592002802212650002002240650002002260650001602280650001002296650000902306650001502315650001302330650001502343650001802358650001702376650001302393650001102406650001002417653001102427653001102438653001902449653001502468653001602483700001702499700001702516700002402533773009702557856009002654852000902744655001202753IND60532368120221118013356.0190318e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053236812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWade, Nicholas M.14aThe combined effects of diet, environment and genetics on pigmentation in the Giant Tiger Prawn, Penaeus monodon  ap. 78-86.  aThe colour of prawns, particularly the Giant Tiger Prawn Penaeus monodon, is highly desired and fetches premium market prices. Prawn pigmentation is influenced by the interaction of a range of factors, including the amount of dietary carotenoid, the distribution of hypodermal pigments, and genetics. These aspects have been studied in isolation, but there is limited knowledge on how these components interact to influence prawn pigmentation. This study tracked the colour of prawns that had been fed four different levels of dietary astaxanthin (Axn) over 6weeks, and then transferred to either black or white coloured tanks. The dietary influence on colour was slow and had only developed after 6weeks. Meanwhile the effect of background colour was rapid, within 15min. Results showed that diet and background colour work in combination to affect prawn colour. The poorest colour was recorded in prawns fed without dietary Axn and transferred to white substrates, and this colour was improved by the addition of dietary Axn. Animals fed without dietary Axn and exposed to black substrates showed an intermediate colour, and this was further improved by the addition of dietary Axn. The best colour was recorded in prawns fed 100mg/kg Axn and exposed to black substrates. The abundance of the epithelial pigment protein crustacyanin (CRCN) was not correlated with prawn colour, suggesting that this protein does not regulate the modifications in response to background colour. Finally, the effect of substrate exposure was assessed on farmed prawns, and indicated a small positive effect on colour during harvesting. These data demonstrate that while short term exposure to black substrates can have positive effects on prawn colour, dietary Axn supplementation can both improve pigmentation of animals exposed to black substrates, and prevent the negative effects of exposure to white substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenaeus monodon 3aadverse effects 3aastaxanthin 3acolor 3adiet 3aepithelium 3agenetics 3aharvesting 3amarket prices 3apigmentation 3apigments 3ashrimp 3atanks 0aShrimp 0aColour 0aQuantification 0aCarotenoid 0aAstaxanthin1 aBudd, Alyssa1 aIrvin, Simon1 aGlencross, Brett D.0 tAquaculture.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 449 p.78-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245011800180300001800298520135400316592002801670650000801698650002101706650001401727650001401741650001501755650001601770650002101786650001901807650002801826650001101854650001201865650002301877650002801900650002101928650003701949650003501986650001102021650002902032650003402061700001702095700001302112700001802125700001702143700001602160700001802176700001102194700001902205773011602224856004802340852000902388655001202397IND50069436620221120211529.0130926e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006943662DNAL7 a239430122pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-013-0417-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Wei10aApoptosis of Human Gastric Carcinoma SGC-7901 Induced by Deoxycholic Acid via the Mitochondrial-Dependent Pathway  ap. 1061-1071.  aThe study aimed to evaluate the effects of deoxycholic acid (DCA) on human gastric carcinoma cell lines and to explore its mechanisms. In the present study, effects of DCA on SGC-7901 cell growth, cell cycle, and apoptosis were investigated by MTT assay, inverted microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, PI single- and FITC/PI double-staining flow cytometry, and western blotting. The study have revealed that DCA significantly inhibited the growth of SGC-7901 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner and arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase. SGC-7901 cells showed typical apoptotic morphological changes after treated with DCA for 48 h. The intensity of typical apoptosis pattern- "ladders" formed by DNA in fragments of multiples of 200 base pairs was also observed. Apoptosis of SGC-7901 cells induced by DCA were associated with collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential. DCA treatment could also increase the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 in SGC-7901 cells. Meanwhile, the expression of p53, cyclinD1, and c-Myc were changed after DCA treatment. These results suggest that DCA induces apoptosis of gastric carcinoma cells through an intrinsic mitochondrial-dependent pathway, and the increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential may play important roles in DCA-induced apoptosis of gastric carcinoma cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3acarcinoma 3acell cycle 3acell growth 3adeoxycholic acid 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahumans 3aladders 3amembrane potential 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aDeoxycholic Acidxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aStomach Neoplasmsxmetabolism1 aYang, Hai-Bo1 aChen, Pu1 aWang, Shumin,1 aZhao, Li-Pei1 aXu, Wen-Hao1 aFan, Hai-Fang1 aGu, Xu1 aChen, Lan-Ying0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2013 Oct., v. 171, no. 4 p.1061-1071dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-013-0417-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245019400165300001600359500001900375520135200394592002801746650002801774650001301802650001501815650001701830650001201847650001601859650002401875650001301899650001801912650001001930650001601940651002101956653001001977653001601987653001602003653001202019700003202031700001902063700001902082700001602101773021102117856008302328852000902411655001202420IND60696712320221119021703.0200607e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069671232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.japb.2020.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Anand10aRelative abundance, habitat preference, and breeding ecology of Asian Black francolin, Francolinus francolinus asiae (Bonaparte, 1856) (Galliformes: Phasianidae) from North-Western Himalaya  ap. 162-168.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAsian black francolin (Francolinus francolinus asiae) is an important bird species in the northwestern Himalayan region, inhabiting diverse subtropical to lower temperate habitat types. The relative abundance, habitat preference, and some aspects of breeding ecology are studied here at eleven sites in different habitat types along elevation gradient. The abundance of species at different altitude was worked both through transect trails of different lengths and point counts at some spots. At each study site, maximum activity habitats were marked and selected for breeding ecology study. Sighting of black francolin was minimal in April (0.585±0.185 birds/Km) and maximum in May (2.339±0.015 birds/Km). Data on breeding timings, nest site selection, clutch size, incubation period, and hatching success were collected. Breeding period of black francolin extended from March up to late July with peak egg-laying between May to June. Twelve nests were monitored throughout the breeding season using binoculars from a distance and camera traps, wherever possible and without disturbing the species. The average size of nest was 20.063±1.452 cm ranging from of 18.80 cm to 22.30 cm in width. Mean clutch size was 5.417±0.793 eggs/nest. The hatching success was 86.15% with 56 successfully hatched eggs, whereas the fledging success was 83.92%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrancolinus francolinus 3aaltitude 3abinoculars 3abiodiversity 3acameras 3aclutch size 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3anesting sites 3anests 3aoviposition 3aHimalayan region 0aCalls 0aForest fire 0aGalliformes 0aNesting1 aSharma, D.

The stability of seven mono-, di-, and trihaloacetonitriles was examined under a variety of conditions including different pH levels and disinfectant doses that are typical of drinking water distribution systems. Results indicated that hydroxide, hypochlorite, and their protonated forms could react with HANs via nucleophilic attack on the nitrile carbon, forming the corresponding haloacetamides (HAMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) as major reaction intermediates and end products. Other stable intermediate products, such as the N-chloro-haloacetamides (N-chloro-HAMs), may form during the course of HAN chlorination. A scheme of pathways for the HAN reactions was proposed, and the rate constants for individual reactions were estimated. Under slightly basic conditions, hydroxide and hypochlorite are primary reactants and their associated second-order reaction rate constants were estimated to be 6 to 9 orders of magnitude higher than those of their protonated conjugates (i.e., neutral water and hypochlorous acid), which are much weaker but more predominant nucleophiles at neutral and acidic pHs. Developed using the estimated reaction rate constants, the linear free energy relationships (LFERs) summarized the nucleophilic nature of HAN reactions and demonstrated an activating effect of the electron withdrawing halogens on nitrile reactivity, leading to decreasing HAN stability with increasing degree of halogenation of the substituents, while subsequent shift from chlorine to bromine atoms has a contrary stabilizing effect on HANs. The chemical kinetic model together with the reaction rate constants that were determined in this work can be used for quantitative predictions of HAN concentrations depending on pH and free chlorine contact times (CTs), which can be applied as an informative tool by drinking water treatment and system management engineers to better control these emerging nitrogenous DBPs, and can also be significant in making regulatory decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3abromine 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3achlorination 3achlorine 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3adrinking water 3ahaloacetic acids 3akinetics 3apH 3aprediction 3awater distribution 3awater treatment1 aReckhow, David A.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 49, no. 18 p.11028-11036dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.5b027723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008600169300001600255520175300271592002802024650002102052650001802073650001602091650001602107650001702123650000902140650001102149650001202160650001402172650001802186650001902204650001302223650001402236650001002250650001602260650001402276650001102290650002002301650000902321650001802330700002202348700001702370700001702387700001802404700003102422700001702453700001902470773014102489856008702630852000902717655001202726IND60598262920221122035020.0200511e20090101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059826292DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2009.115125492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKishor, Arun10aPaclobutrazol minimises the effects of salt stress in mango (Mangifera indica L.)  ap. 459-465.  aWe investigated the effects of paclobutrazol (PBZ) on 1-year-old plants of ‘Olour’ mango subjected to NaCl stress under polythene tunnel conditions. Plants were treated with two levels of salt [0.0 g NaCl kg⁻¹ soil (control) or 1 g NaCl kg⁻¹ soil] and three concentrations of paclobutrazol [PBZ; 0.0 mg l⁻¹ (control), 750 mg l⁻¹ or 1,500 mg l⁻¹] after 30 d of establishment. Mortality in saline-treated mango plants was reduced significantly (LSD = 8.55; P ≤ 0.05) following the application of PBZ. NaCl-stress reduced the survival of plants without PBZ treatment by 89%, but only by 28.4% for 1,500 mg l⁻¹ PBZ-treated plants. PBZ-treated plants also showed less defoliation, and fewer leaves per plant exhibited salt stress symptoms. It was also evident that treatment with PBZ increased the relative water and chlorophyll contents of mango seedlings, and reduced membrane injury, under salt stress. Furthermore, saline treatment without PBZ increased the Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ion contents of leaves and roots; however, application of PBZ consistently and significantly lowered these ion contents (P ≤ 0.05). The Na⁺ content of leaves on saline-treated plants was reduced by 1.96- to 2.12-fold, whereas Cl⁻ ion contents were reduced by 22 – 39% by PBZ treatment compared to salt-treated seedlings without PBZ. Our results suggest a role for PBZ in promoting the avoidance of salt stress in mango by increasing the levels of photosynthetic pigments, water content, K⁺ uptake and accumulation, and by reducing defoliation, the membrane injury index, and the uptake and accumulation of harmful Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions. These findings may be used to improve the yields and quality of mango trees grown in salt-affected areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMangifera indica 3abiotechnology 3achlorophyll 3adefoliation 3ahorticulture 3aions 3aleaves 3amangoes 3amortality 3apaclobutrazol 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3apotassium 3aroots 3asalt stress 3aseedlings 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asoil 3awater content1 aSrivastav, Manish1 aDubey, A.

For preparative application the preferred method is the simultaneous coupling of an in situ regeneration reaction. There are different strategically advantageous routes to achieve this goal. The standard method uses a second enzyme and a second co-substrate, for example formate and formate dehydrogenase or glucose and glucose dehydrogenase. Alternatively, a second substrate is employed which is converted by the same enzyme used for the primary reaction. For example, alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzed reactions are often coupled with excess 2-propanol which is oxidized to acetone during the regeneration of NAD(P)H. A third method utilizes a reaction-internal sequence by the direct coupling of an oxidizing and a reducing enzyme reaction. Neither an additional substrate nor a further regenerating enzyme are required for the recycling reaction. This kind of “closed-loop” or “self-sufficient” redox process for cofactor regeneration has been used rarely so far. Its most intriguing advantage is that even redox reactions with unstable precursors can be realized provided that this compound is produced in situ by an opposite redox reaction. This elegant method is applicable in special cases only but increasing numbers of examples have been published during the last years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aacetone 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aenzymatic reactions 3aformate dehydrogenase 3aformates 3aglucose 3aisopropyl alcohol 3anicotinamide 3arecycling 3aredox reactions 0aCoenzyme regeneration 0aOxidoreductases 0aDehydrogenases 0aClosed-loop 0aSelf-sufficient1 aGröger, Harald,0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 191 p.22-31dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.07.4493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245010800202500001400310520151900324592002801843650001301871650001601884650001101900650002501911650002401936650001601960650001201976650001601988650001702004650001102021650001302032650002302045650001802068650002602086650001302112650001002125650001402135650001502149650001402164700005402178700005302232700005702285700005702342700005702399700005402456700005602510700002302566700001902589773010802608856007602716852000902792655001202801IND60719832520221118051738.0201207e20201129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071983252DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/66430452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiana, Nunik Eka1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7523-888X10aGlucose Required for Tissue Formation and Its Effects on Cane Yield, Recoverable Sugar, and Sugar Yield  aNAL-light  aGlucose in sugarcane affected cane yield, recoverable sugar, and sugar yield. Glucose is available since the formation of the stems and stored until sugarcane is ready to be harvested. Information regarding the need for glucose to form sugarcane plant tissue is still not widely available. So, research was conducted to determine the quantity of glucose to form sugarcane plant tissue and its relation to cane yield, recoverable sugar, and sugar yield obtained. The research was carried out at the Karangploso Research Station and Laboratory of Plant Chemistry, Indonesian Sweeteners and Fiber Crops Research Institute, in July 2016–September 2017. A split plot design with two factors and three replications was utilized. The main factor was the growth phases, namely, the vegetative phase and maturity phase, while the other factor was sugarcane varieties, namely, PS-881 (early mature), JR-01 (early-middle mature), Kenthung (early-middle mature), and Bululawang (middle-late mature). The measurements of nitrogen, carbon, and the ash content of the leaves and stems were at 5 months (representing the growth period) and 9 months (representing the ripening period). The results showed that quantities of 1.962–2.160 kg and 2.066–2.113 kg glucose were required to form each kg of leaf and stem tissue depending on the growth phase and variety. Glucose requirements in the maturing phase affected the cane yield, recoverable sugar, and sugar yield as much as by 51.48%, 57.60%, and 58.26%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3aash content 3acarbon 3adevelopmental stages 3aexperimental design 3afiber crops 3aglucose 3ainformation 3alaboratories 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aplant biochemistry 3aplant tissues 3aresearch institutions 3aripening 3astems 3asugarcane 3asweeteners 3avarieties1 aSupriyadi,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2186-18061 aDjumali, 1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6258-808X1 aBudi Santoso,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7275-63231 aHerwati, Anik1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8539-51251 aYulaikah, Sri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3612-49401 aSupriyono,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6347-76801 aHamida, Ruly1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6316-768X1 aRidhawati, Aprilia1 aAbdurrakhman, 0 tInternational journal of agronomy.g2020 Nov. 29, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:J000000090x1687-81677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/66430453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245011300183300001500296520136000311592002801671650002601699650001501725650001501740650002501755650002101780650001001801650001701811650001001828650001101838650002101849650001701870650002101887650002101908650001901929650001301948650001201961653002601973653003401999653001802033653002602051653001202077653003202089653002802121700001802149700002202167700001802189700002202207700002202229700002002251700001802271700002002289700003502309773008702344856008702431852000902518655001202527IND60608093220221116185227.0180904e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060809322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2016.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Eichel-Streiber, Alice10aInduction of antitoxin responses in Clostridium-difficile-infected patients compared to healthy blood donors  ap. 91-103.  aAccording to the literature Clostridium difficile antitoxins are present in up to 66% of humans.

Systemic responses to TcdB and mucosal responses to TcdA predominated. Among patients infected with the NAP1/027/BI strain, systemic IgG-anti-TcdB responses were particularly elevated. In contrast, patients infected with non-027 strains had more elevated mucosal IgA-anti-TcdA responses. Furthermore, high titer sera did not correlate with high neutralizing potential. We hypothesize that paradoxical killing of primed B-cells by antibody-mediated endosomal uptake of the Large Clostridial Toxins, TcdA and TcdB leads to clonal elimination of the fittest B-cells. If this hypothesis is confirmed, immune suppression rather than protective humoral immunity might be the consequence in some patients infected with toxigenic C. difficile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium difficile 3aantibodies 3aantitoxins 3abacterial infections 3abacterial toxins 3ablood 3ablood donors 3afeces 3ahumans 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aneutralization 3apatients 3asurveys 0aClostridium difficile 0aC. difficile infection (CDI) 0aRecurrent CDI 0aAnti-Toxin antibodies 0aToxin A 0aToxin B. clonal elimination 0aAntigen presenting cell1 aPaik, Wonbeom1 aKnight, Katherine1 aGisch, Karina1 aNadjafi, Karolina1 aDecker, Christine1 aBosnjak, Oliver1 aCheknis, Adam1 aJohnson, Stuart1 avon Eichel-Streiber, Christoph0 tAnaerobe.g2016 Oct., v. 41 p.91-103dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2016.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245010000183300001600283520148800299592002801787650002301815650001601838650001201854650001301866650001801879650002501897650001701922650002001939650001701959650001101976650001301987650001402000650001402014650001202028650002002040650001302060653002302073653002202096653002002118653002002138700002302158700002502181700001802206700002102224700002002245700001602265700002102281700002302302773008802325856008702413852000902500655001202509IND60608093320221116185249.0180904e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060809332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2016.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLicona-Cassani, Cuauhtemoc10aTetanus toxin production is triggered by the transition from amino acid consumption to peptides  ap. 113-124.  aBacteria produce some of the most potent biomolecules known, of which many cause serious diseases such as tetanus. For prevention, billions of people and countless animals are immunised with the highly effective vaccine, industrially produced by large-scale fermentation. However, toxin production is often hampered by low yields and batch-to-batch variability. Improved productivity has been constrained by a lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling toxin production. Here we have developed a reproducible experimental framework for screening phenotypic determinants in Clostridium tetani under a process that mimics an industrial setting. We show that amino acid depletion induces production of the tetanus toxin. Using time-course transcriptomics and extracellular metabolomics to generate a ‘fermentation atlas’ that ascribe growth behaviour, nutrient consumption and gene expression to the fermentation phases, we found a subset of preferred amino acids. Exponential growth is characterised by the consumption of those amino acids followed by a slower exponential growth phase where peptides are consumed, and toxin is produced. The results aim at assisting in fermentation medium design towards the improvement of vaccine production yields and reproducibility. In conclusion, our work not only provides deep fermentation dynamics but represents the foundation for bioprocess design based on C. tetani physiological behaviour under industrial settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium tetani 3aamino acids 3aanimals 3abacteria 3abioprocessing 3adevelopmental stages 3afermentation 3agene expression 3ametabolomics 3apeople 3apeptides 3aphenotype 3ascreening 3atetanus 3atranscriptomics 3avaccines 0aClostridium tetani 0aFermentation maps 0aSystems biology 0aTeTN production1 aSteen, Jennifer A.1 aZaragoza, Nicolas E.1 aMoonen, Glenn1 aMoutafis, George1 aHodson, Mark P.1 aPower, John1 aNielsen, Lars K.1 aMarcellin, Esteban0 tAnaerobe.g2016 Oct., v. 41 p.113-124dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2016.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01827naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245011900207300001400326520081200340592002801152650002301180650001301203650002101216650002101237650001901258700005201277773011501329856008401444852000901528655001201537IND60627218920221120034934.0190128e20181218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062721892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.8b024462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeo, Yew Chin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5630-436710aFacile Synthesis of Macromonomers via ATRP–Nitroxide Radical Coupling and Well-Controlled Brush Block Copolymers  ap. 81-87.  aWe report facile and efficient synthesis of macromonomers (MMs) via nitroxide radical coupling (NRC) of a norbornene moiety to the chain end of various polymers prepared using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The synthesis can be simplified to a one-pot procedure for MMs of polyacrylate homopolymers and block copolymers. The MMs synthesized by this method underwent well-controlled ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) to almost complete conversions (>90%) to yield brush polymers and block copolymers with low dispersities (<1.2) and high molecular weights (300–3000 kDa). This facile method of MM synthesis provided a range of high-quality MMs, which enabled easy access to diverse well-defined brush multiblock copolymers with different blocks in the backbone and/or side chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3apolyacrylic acid 3apolymerization1 aXia, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5298-748X0 tMacromolecules.g2018 Dec. 18, v. 52, no. 1 p.81-87dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b024463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03947naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011100170300001600281520224900297592002802546650001902574650002202593650001902615650001502634650001202649650002002661650001102681650000902692650002802701650001202729650001202741650001302753650001502766650001302781650001702794650002202811650001802833650002202851650002302873650001702896650001402913650002902927650002302956651002502979651001103004653003303015653001903048653001303067653002403080700002403104700002003128773011803148856008203266852000903348655001203357IND60612547220221120064641.0190415e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061254722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnc.2018.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Maggio, Rosanna10aLesser kestrel diet and agricultural intensification in the Mediterranean: An unexpected win-win solution?  ap. 122-130.  aFarmland bird species have suffered dramatic declines in recent decades, especially in Mediterranean areas. The intensification of agricultural practices has led to reduced invertebrate prey, which represent the bulk of the diet of many farmland birds. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal variation in the diet of the lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) during the breeding season, monitored over a five-year period between 2006 and 2013 in the Gela Plain (Sicily). Our aim was to understand whether, and to what extent, farming practices affected the reproductive outputs of this predominantly insectivore bird in order to find a profitable compromise between conservation of farmland birds and farming practices. During our study, lesser kestrel diet varied among farmland habitats, in terms of ingested biomass, prey items/pellet and diet breadth. This has reflected in the reproductive output because colonies characterised by a higher ingested biomass fledged more chicks than the others. The artichoke and grassland fields were found to provide the most beneficial dietary parameters. Unexpectedly, the intensive and high-profit artichoke farming might turn out to be suitable for lesser kestrels. Artichoke fields are chiefly used when abandoned after harvest, providing high prey availability and accessibility for kestrels during the brood raising stage of their breeding season. A mosaic of grassland and artichoke fields can thus be recommended for Mediterranean agricultural areas of the Natura2000 network, in which some intensive farming and lesser kestrels can coexist, if adequately framed in a friendly-to-wildlife agriculture policy. Such a potential optimal trade-off between avian population persistence and economic sustainability for farmers we have found, should be planned in alternative management of agro-ecosystems, enhancing the functioning of trophic chains. For our study area, we suggest at least farmers be: i) informed on the role of predators as biological agents for pest control; ii) granted to reduce the high level of chemicals currently used during cultivation in favour of organic farming; and iii) granted to maintain the artichoke fields until June, following completion of the harvest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFalco naumanni 3aagricultural land 3aagroecosystems 3aartichokes 3abiomass 3abreeding season 3achicks 3adiet 3aeconomic sustainability 3afalcons 3afarmers 3aforaging 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3ainsectivores 3aintensive farming 3ainvertebrates 3aissues and policy 3aorganic production 3apest control 3apredators 3areproductive performance 3atemporal variation 3aMediterranean region 3aSicily 0aAgricultural intensification 0aFarmland birds 0aLand use 0aLesser kestrel diet1 aCampobello, Daniela1 aSarà, Maurizio0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2018 Sept., v. 45 p.122-130dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000095x1617-13817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2018.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002400166245007700190300001400267520124100281592002801522650001101550650001301561650001301574650002001587650001601607650001901623650002101642651001001663651001101673651000901684653001101693653001301704653001701717653001801734700002501752773012201777856011401899852000902013655001202022IND60127643020221120120824.0151110e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012764302DNAL7 a10.3100/1043-4534(2006)11[61:NANSOB]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWindham, Michael D.10aNew and noteworthy species of boechera (brassicaceae) i: sexual diploids  ap. 61-88.  aOn the basis of a critical examination of the type collections of all taxa described in Arabis and Boechera from North America, we propose the following nomenclatural adjustments among the sexual diploid taxa.

This study aims to assess spatiotemporal urban LULC changes, the axis, and patterns of growth as well as drivers influencing urban growth over the past three decades in the Harare Metropolitan Province. The analysis was based on remotely sensed Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager data from 1984&ndash;2018, GIS application, and binary logistic regression. Supervised image classification using support vector machines was performed on Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI data combined with the soil adjusted vegetation index, enhanced built-up and bareness index and modified difference water index. Statistical modelling was performed using binary logistic regression to identify the influence of the slope and the distance proximity characters as independent variables on urban growth. The overall mapping accuracy for all time periods was over 85%. Built-up areas extended from 279.5 km2 (1984) to 445 km2 (2018) with high-density residential areas growing dramatically from 51.2 km2 (1984) to 218.4 km2 (2018). The results suggest that urban growth was influenced mainly by the presence and density of road networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acase studies 3ageographic information systems 3aland use and land cover maps 3apopulation growth 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3aresidential areas 3aroads 3asoil 3astatistical models 3asupport vector machines 3aurbanization 3avegetation index 3aZimbabwe1 aSchütt, Brigitta,0 tLand.g2019 Oct. 19, v. 8, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land81001553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245011400159300002000273520108300293592002801376650002101404650001701425650002401442650001201466650001401478650002201492650002201514650001801536650001301554650001601567650001301583650001401596650001101610650001101621650001901632650001301651650001801664700001601682700001501698700005201713700005301765773017301818856008001991852000902071655001202080IND60675394020221120133748.0191106e20191011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067539402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b038892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jie10aEngineering Surface Groups of Commercially Activated Carbon for Benzene Hydroxylation to Phenol with Dioxygen  ap. 20226-20235.  aBenzene hydroxylation with green oxidants such as dioxygen is a promising sustainable alternative to produce phenol, but the design of an easily available and efficient heterogeneous catalyst remains a challenge. In this work, the surface oxygen groups of commercially activated carbon were facilely modulated through post-treatment with an aqueous nitric acid solution and therefore an effective metal-free heterogeneous catalyst was obtained. This strategy led to the formation of abundant surface quinone carbonyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups, which acted as the active sites to produce hydroxyl radicals and then oxidized benzene to phenol. A satisfactory yield of 10.1% and well reusability were obtained. In addition, the formation of these surface oxygen species above to promote the activity was also observable in other modified activated carbon materials using aqueous hydrogen peroxide, sulfuric acid, or ammonium persulfate solutions and thus suggests a facile way to modulate the commercially active carbon for the establishment of an efficient metal-free catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aactive sites 3aammonium persulfate 3abenzene 3acatalysts 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ahydroxylation 3amoieties 3anitric acid 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphenol 3aprocess design 3aquinones 3asulfuric acid1 aLi, Guoqing1 aWang, Qian1 aZhou, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1757-37051 aWang, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3796-98810 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Oct. 11, v. 58, no. 44 p.20226-20235dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b038893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03708naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245009900176506010400275506007600379520179900455592002802254506003702282650001502319650001202334650001602346650001202362650001402374650001902388650002002407650001302427650001402440650001702454650002102471650001602492650001002508650001402518650003502532650000902567651001102576653002102587653001902608653002502627653001402652653001502666653001802681700002402699700002202723700001902745700002402764700002202788700002102810700002802831700001802859773012002877856008802997852000903085655001203094IND60775986320221207121313.0220628e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077598632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1556162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolenda, Krzysztof10aBottled & canned – Anthropogenic debris as an understudied ecological trap for small animals  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNowadays, littering is one of the biggest challenges that environmental conservation is facing. Although beverage containers, such as bottles and cans, belong to the most common threats in this context, their effect on animals has been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to assess the diversity and mortality level of the animal taxa entering discarded containers and to investigate which container features influence the number and functional composition of the trapped animals. The study was conducted in 10 urban woodlands in the city of Wrocław, Poland. In total, 939 open containers were collected. In 56% of them, a total number of 10,162 dead individuals (10,139 invertebrates and 23 vertebrates) was found. The most common amongst them were insects (orders: Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera), malacostracans (Isopoda), arachnids (Opiliones, Sarcoptiformes) and gastropods (Stylommatophora). The number of dead animals was affected positively by the container capacity and was significantly higher in glass and plastic bottles when compared to aluminium cans. At the same time, the presence of a neck negatively affected the number of dead animals. Container capacity was also positively correlated with the abundance of the most common functional groups: predators, phytophages and saprophages. Moreover, colourless and green, but not brown, containers were a significant predictor for the abundance of the latter two groups. Our study revealed that discarded containers constitute an ecological trap for many groups of animals. There is an urgent need to reduce the amount of rubbish in the environment by, for example, the implementation of regional and international regulations addressing the problem of littering, or organising repeated clean-up and educational activities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aColeoptera 3aDiptera 3aHymenoptera 3aIsopoda 3aOpiliones 3aSarcoptiformes 3aStylommatophora 3aaluminum 3abeverages 3adetritivores 3aecological traps 3aenvironment 3aglass 3amortality 3anatural resources conservation 3aneck 3aPoland 0aAnimal mortality 0aCentral Europe 0aDiscarded containers 0aLittering 0aEntrapment 0aUrban forests1 aKuśmierek, Natalia1 aKujawa, Krzysztof1 aSmolis, Adrian1 aWiśniewski, Konrad1 aSalata, Sebastian1 aMaltz, Tomasz K.1 aStachowiak, Mieczysław1 aKadej, Marcin0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 837 p.155616-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1556163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014300158300001600301520194200317592002802259650002102287650001502308650001802323650002102341650001302362650002402375650001602399650001402415650001102429650002302440650001502463650001902478650002602497650002102523700001902544700002002563700002002583700001902603700002502622700001702647700002302664773016202687856007402849852000902923655001202932IND60501750220221116191317.0160223e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6050175022DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.136252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTruong, Alice10aDynamics of internalization and recycling of the prometastatic membrane type 4 matrix metalloproteinase (MT4‐MMP) in breast cancer cells  ap. 704-722.  aMembrane type 4 matrix metalloproteinase (MT4‐MMP) [matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 17] is a GPI‐anchored membrane‐type MMP expressed on the cell surface of human breast cancer cells. In triple‐negative breast cancer cells, MT4‐MMP promotes primary tumour growth and lung metastases. Although the trafficking and internalization of the transmembrane membrane type 1 MMP have been extensively investigated, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of the GPI‐anchored MT4‐MMP. Here, we investigated the fate and cellular trafficking of MT4‐MMP by analysing its homophilic complex interactions, internalization and recycling dynamics as compared with an inert form, MT4‐MMP‐E249A. Oligomeric and dimeric complexes were analysed by cotransfection of cells with FLAG‐tagged or Myc‐tagged MT4‐MMP in reducing and nonreducing immunoblotting and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The trafficking of MT4‐MMP was studied with an antibody feeding assay and confocal microscopy analysis or cell surface protein biotinylation and western blot analysis. We demonstrate that MT4‐MMP forms homophilic complexes at the cell surface, and internalizes in early endosomes, and that some of the enzyme is either autodegraded or recycled to the cell surface. Our data indicate that MT4‐MMP is internalized by the clathrin‐independent carriers/GPI‐enriched early endosomal compartments pathway, a mechanism that differs from that responsible for the internalization of other membrane‐type MMP members. Although MT4‐MMP localizes with caveolin‐1, MT4‐MMP internalization was not affected by inhibitors of caveolin‐1 or clathrin endocytosis pathways, but was reduced by CDC42 or RhoA silencing with small interfering RNA. We provide a new mechanistic insight into the regulatory mechanisms of MT4‐MMP, which may have implications for the design of novel therapeutic strategies for metastatic breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aantibodies 3abiotinylation 3abreast neoplasms 3aclathrin 3aconfocal microscopy 3aendocytosis 3aendosomes 3ahumans 3ametalloproteinases 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3asmall interfering RNA 3asurface proteins1 aYip, Cassandre1 aPaye, Alexandra1 aBlacher, Silvia1 aMunaut, Carine1 aDeroanne, Christophe1 aNoel, Agnès1 aSounni, Nor Eddine0 tFEBS journal.g2016 Feb., v. 283, no. 4 p.704-722dPublished by Blackwell Pub. on behalf of the Federation of European Biochemical Societiesx1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.136253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012500157300001600282520127000298592002801568650002601596650002301622650001901645650002601664650002001690650001601710650001401726650001001740650000901750650001001759650002101769650000901790650001501799650001601814653001401830653002801844653002001872653001601892653002001908700001901928700001701947773014301964856007402107852000902181655001202190IND60764386220221118225157.0220130e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076438622DNAL7 a10.18805/ag.D-3102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuraz, Belete14aThe Role of Bole (Lake Soil) as a Mineral Supplement to Arsi-Bale Sheep Fed Natural Grass Hay and Concentrate Supplement  ap. 638-643.  aMineral deficiencies are considered to be one of the nutritional constraints to sheep performance. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the role of bole soil on feed intake, live weight change and carcass characteristics of Arsi-Bale sheep fed natural grass hay and concentrate supplement and its cost-benefit analysis of bole soil supplementation. Total DM, OM, CP, NDF, ADF intake and ADL were higher (p<0.0001) for T3 than for T1, T2 and T4. Final weight, body weight change, average daily gain and feed conversion efficiency were greater (p<0.0001) for T3 and T2 than for T1 and T4. There were no differences (p>0.05) between T3 and T2 whereas T4 was greater than T1 in these variables. Slaughter weight (SW) was heavier (p<0.0001) for treatment two and treatment three than for treatment four and treatment one, hot carcass weight, foreleg weight and dressing percentage on empty body weight basis were greater (p<0.0001) for T3 and T2 than for T1 and T4. Bole soil supplementation had potentially highest effect on feed intake, live weight change and carcass characteristics of Arsi-Bale sheep than non-supplemented groups. The present study also revealed that supplementation of minerals improved the total weight gain of sheep over the control treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural sciences 3aaverage daily gain 3acarcass weight 3acost benefit analysis 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agrass hay 3alakes 3alegs 3asheep 3aslaughter weight 3asoil 3atree trunk 3aweight gain 0aBole soil 0aCarcass characteristics 0aNutrient intake 0aPerformance 0aSupplementation1 aAdugna Tolera,1 aAbebe, Aster0 tAgricultural science digest.g2021 Dec., v. 41, no. 4 p.638-643dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2003x0976-05477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ag.D-3103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04243naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245011200176300001400288520244300302592002802745650001602773650002302789650001802812650001102830650002902841650001502870650002302885650002702908650002402935650000902959650001502968650001002983650001502993650001103008650001503019650001503034650001403049650001403063650001103077650002103088650002103109650001003130650001403140650001303154651001003167653002003177653001103197653001703208653001403225653001503239653001803254700001803272700002303290700001903313700003103332700002303363773011603386856008203502852000903584655001203593IND60612547420221120064655.0190415e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061254742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnc.2018.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhattacharjee, Subhadeep12aA case for reconsidering the conservation status of former Closed Areas in arid landscapes of western India  ap. 30-40.  aThe Indian Wildlife Protection Act (WPA) of 1972 prohibits hunting within the ProtectedAreas (PA), while diverse populations of wildlife exist outside them, as well. In the 1980s, the State Government of Rajasthan declared wildlife-rich areas (14690 km2) located outside PA, as Closed Areas (CA) to prohibit hunting activities. In 2002, due to an amendment of the WPA of 1972, these CA lost their PA status, thus putting into question, the future of these endangered species-rich ecosystems. To inform future management decisions, a rapid biodiversity assessment was conducted across seven former CA in the arid landscapes of western Rajasthan. Furthermore, the dynamics of biodiversity and conservation practices over time was also assessed through interviews of 3357 adults from 2470 households in the region. Due to the natural low productivity of arid regions, the mean tree density (5.2 ± 0.8 individual ha−1) was found significantly lower (P = 0.001) than the mean shrub density (114.4 ± 31.4 individual ha−1) particularly where human interferences were recorded, while species richness and diversity (Sobs and Shannon indices) were higher for trees (16 ± 0.0 and 2.4, respectively) than the shrubs (13 ± 0.1 and 1.8, respectively). Prosopis cineraria was assessed, as the most dominant and exploited tree species. Ecological densities of all the wild ungulates (11.7 ± 1.8 individual km−2) were quite comparable to other well-guarded PA of India. However, high density of domestic livestock (94.6 ± 7.2 individual km−2) provides severe competition to them. Indian desert fox (Vulpes vulpes pusilla) and domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), adapted to survive amongst human dominated landscapes, were the most abundant canids (0.9 ± 0.2 individual km−2 and 0.6 ± 0.1 individual km−2, respectively), where the latter was considerably responsible for wild ungulate mortalities. State Government records and over 69% of the interviewees (n = 2331) reported that the region’s wildlife populations had significantly declined during the past two decades in absence of any designated protection regime. Therefore, to protect this endangered biodiversity, reconsideration of the future conservation status of these former CA should be prioritized, as “Conservation Reserves – CR” or “Community Conservation Reserves – CCR” with the assistance of local communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis lupus 3aProsopis cineraria 3aVulpes vulpes 3aadults 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarid zones 3aconservation areas 3aconservation practices 3aconservation status 3adogs 3aecosystems 3afoxes 3ahouseholds 3ahumans 3ainterviews 3alandscapes 3alivestock 3amortality 3ashrubs 3aspecies richness 3astate government 3atrees 3aungulates 3awildlife 3aIndia 0aArid landscapes 0aCanids 0aClosed Areas 0aUngulates 0aVegetation 0aWestern India1 aKidwai, Zaara1 aBhattarai, Santosh1 aBajpai, Hemant1 aReddy, Goddilla Viswanatha1 aYessoufou, Kowiyou0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2018 Sept., v. 45 p.30-40dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000095x1617-13817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2018.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245017600172300001600348520103800364592002801402650001501430650001401445650002201459650001501481650001901496650001801515650002301533650000901556650002201565650002001587650001301607651001701620700001601637700002001653773009601673856004801769852000901817655001201826IND50062548620221122112454.0130322e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006254862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-012-0435-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Walt, Joelle10aDifferentiation at mitochondrial and nuclear loci between the blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi) and bontebok (D. p. pygargus): implications for conservation strategy  ap. 243-248.  aDamaliscus pygargus is an endemic species in South Africa belonging to the contemporary antelope tribe Alcelaphine. The species has been subdivided into two subspecies based upon phenotypic differences and historical geographic isolation. We found D. p. pygargus (bontebok) and D. p. phillipsi (blesbok) to be significantly differentiated based on microsatellite and mtDNA control region markers. Bontebok genetic diversity was depauperate with just one mtDNA haplotype, not found in blesbok populations, and reduced heterozygosity and polymorphism at microsatellite DNA loci compared to the blesbok. Erosion of molecular genetic variation in bontebok may have been due to anthropogenic impact causing isolation and reduced population size. Our data based on 34 bontebok and 42 blesbok indicate that the classification of alpha taxonomy should be reconsidered in this genus (in support of earlier similar suggestions), and that careful management should seek to avoid hybridization and retain the remaining diversity in the bontebok.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDamaliscus 3aantelopes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aheterozygosity 3ahybridization 3aindigenous species 3aloci 3amitochondrial DNA 3apopulation size 3ataxonomy 3aSouth Africa1 aNel, L.

The results showed that mercury distribution in CLG was similar to that in conventional coal gasification. Compared to conventional coal gasification, the CuFe₂O₄ oxygen carrier promoted transformation of Hg(g) to particle-bound mercury (Hgᵖ) and elemental mercury (Hg⁰) to gaseous oxidized mercury (Hg²⁺). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicated the CuFe₂O₄ oxygen carrier can promote the Hg(g) transformation into Hgᵖ because of the adsorption and oxidation of mercury on their surface. Thermodynamic calculations showed that the oxygen carrier can affect the concentration of oxidizing gases (e.g., Cl₂, SO₂, or NO₂); this indirectly affected the transformation of Hg⁰ to Hg²⁺. In addition, 10 reducing–oxidizing cycles were investigated, and the reduced CuFe₂O₄ oxygen carriers were regenerated in an air reactor. The ability of the CuFe₂O₄ oxygen carrier to retain mercury increased slightly after 10 regeneration cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aair 3achlorine 3agasification 3alignite 3amagnetism 3amercury 3anitrogen dioxide 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aprocess design 3asulfur dioxide 3athermodynamics1 aMa, Jingjing1 aGuo Qingjie,0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Oct. 14, v. 58, no. 44 p.20481-20490dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b040143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012300161300001600284520094700300592002801247650001901275650001701294650001401311700002301325700001601348700002001364700001701384700002501401700001801426700001801444700002001462700002501482700002201507700002101529700002301550773016201573856007401735852000901809655001201818IND60501750420221116191306.0160223e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6050175042DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.136182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Hirofumi12aA conserved island of BAG6/Scythe is related to ubiquitin domains and participates in short hydrophobicity recognition  ap. 662-677.  aBAG6 (also called Scythe) interacts with the exposed hydrophobic regions of newly synthesized proteins and escorts them to the degradation machinery through mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. In this study, we provide evidence that BAG6 physically interacts with the model defective protein substrate CL1 in a manner that depends directly on its short hydrophobicity. We found that the N terminus of BAG6 contains an evolutionarily conserved island tentatively designated the BAG6 ubiquitin‐linked domain. Partial deletion of this domain in the BAG6 N‐terminal fragment abolished in cell recognition of polyubiquitinated polypeptides as well as the hydrophobicity‐mediated recognition of the CL1 degron in cell and in vitro. These observations suggest a mechanism whereby the BAG6 ubiquitin‐linked domain provides a platform for discriminating substrates with shorter hydrophobicity stretches as a signal for defective proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrophobicity 3apolypeptides 3aubiquitin1 aTakahashi, Toshiki1 aXie, Yiming1 aMinami, Ryosuke1 aYanagi, Yuko1 aHayashishita, Mizuki1 aSuzuki, Rigel1 aYokota, Naoto1 aShimada, Masumi1 aMizushima, Tsunehiro1 aKuwabara, Naoyuki1 aKatō, Ryūichi,1 aKawahara, Hiroyuki0 tFEBS journal.g2016 Feb., v. 283, no. 4 p.662-677dPublished by Blackwell Pub. on behalf of the Federation of European Biochemical Societiesx1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.136183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245011900166300001600285500002000301520206800321592002802389650001002417650002002427650001402447650001302461650001402474650001602488650001402504650002602518650002402544651001302568651001302581700002002594700002202614700001902636700001602655700005802671773014002729856007502869852000902944655001202953IND60772042920221121194231.0220331e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077204292DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.163442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiccardi, Christianna10aEtiology and outcome of extreme neutrophilic leukocytosis: A multi‐institutional retrospective study of 269 dogs  ap. 541-548.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The magnitude of diagnostic abnormalities can influence the perception of clinical outcome. Extreme neutrophilic leukocytosis (ENL) is an uncommon finding caused by markedly increased granulopoiesis. A lack of recent, large‐scale studies limits our understanding of the importance, causation, and prognosis associated with ENL in dogs. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Describe disease categories (DC) identified in dogs with ENL and identify variables associated with survival. We hypothesized that factors including fever, segmented and band neutrophil counts, and DC would be negatively associated with survival. ANIMALS: Two‐hundred sixty‐nine dogs with ENL (segmented neutrophils ≥50 × 10³ cells/μL) presented to the veterinary teaching hospitals at Auburn University (n = 164), the University of Missouri (n = 81), and Oklahoma State University (n = 24) between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019. METHODS: Retrospective study. Demographic data and outcome variables including temperature, CBC findings, DC, duration of hospitalization (DOH) and outcome were acquired from the medical record. Statistical analyses included chi‐squared and Kruskal‐Wallis tests, and Pearson product moment correlations with a P < .05 significance level. RESULTS: Mortality was 41%. Survival differed with DC (P = .002). Mortality was higher (P < .05) in dogs with neoplasia (56.2%) vs immune‐mediated disease (20.5%) or tissue damage/necrosis (19%). Weight (P = .001, r = −0.14) and total neutrophil count (P = .04, r = −0.02) were weakly negatively associated with survival whereas DOH was weakly positively associated with survival (P = .03, r = 0.14). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Mortality in dogs with ENL is high but differed according to DC. Only weak correlations between clinical or clinicopathologic variables and mortality were identified. Extreme neutrophilic leukocytosis should be interpreted in conjunction with the underlying disease process, and not broadly used to predict clinical outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3afever 3amedical records 3amortality 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3aneutrophils 3aprognosis 3aretrospective studies 3aveterinary medicine 3aMissouri 3aOklahoma1 aCohn, Leah, A.,1 aJanacek, Blakeley1 aGross, Jacklyn1 aNafe, Laura1 aGrobman, Megan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7695-55620 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2022 Mar., v. 36, no. 2 p.541-548dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.163443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01671naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010600161300001800267520050100285592002800786650002200814650001300836650003600849650002300885650001200908650001700920700002200937700002100959700002100980700002001001700001701021700001801038700002501056773013301081856007401214852000901288655001201297IND60617761420221118051407.0181026e20180809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061776142DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc03433h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Dipak Kumar10aSelective one- and two-electron reductions of a haloborane enabled by a π-withdrawing carbene ligand  ap. 9015-9018.  aA carbene-stabilised neutral boryl radical and a boryl anion are isolated via selective one- and two-electron reduction of a diamidocarbene (DAC) adduct of dibromo(pentafluorophenyl)borane.

However, the mechanism by which BARF1 elicits its biological effects is unclear. We investigated the effects of BARF1 silencing on cell proliferation and apoptosis in EBV-positive malignant cells. We observed that BARF1 silencing significantly inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis-mediated cell death by collapsing the mitochondrial membrane potential in AG876 and Hone-Akata cells. BARF1 knockdown up-regulates the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and down-regulates the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. In BARF1-down-regulated cells, the Bcl-2/BAX ratio is decreased. The caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk was found to rescue siBARF1-induced apoptosis in these cells. Immunoblot analysis showed significant increased levels of cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 9. We observed a significant increase in cytochrome c level as well as the formation of apoptosome complex in BARF1-silenced cells. In conclusion, siRNA-mediated BARF1 down-regulation induces caspase-dependent apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway through modulation of Bcl-2/BAX ratio in AG876 and Hone-Akata cells. Targeting BARF1 using siRNA has the potential to be developed as a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of EBV-associated malignancies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3anose 3amitochondrial membrane 3alymphoma 3amembrane potential 3astomach neoplasms 3acarcinoma 3acaspase-3 3agene silencing 3acytochrome c 3asmall interfering RNA 3acell proliferation 3aB-lymphocytes 3aapoptosis 3aHuman gammaherpesvirus 4 0aHuman herpesvirus 41 aNg, Ching Ching0 tJournal of biosciences.g2015 Mar., v. 40, no. 1 p.41-51dSpringer-Verlagx0250-59917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12038-015-9502-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245009700172520104900269592002801318650001801346650001601364650002001380650001001400650001601410650001501426650001101441650002101452650002001473650001301493653001301506653002001519653002201539653001501561653002101576700001601597700002501613700002001638700002001658773011901678856008801797852000901885655001201894IND60775986620221120170720.0220606e20220825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077598662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1556222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatish, Swathi10aRisk assessment of selected pharmaceuticals on wildlife with nanomaterials based aptasensors  aPharmaceuticals have improved human and veterinary health tremendously over the years. But the implications of the presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment on terrestrial, avian, and aquatic organisms are still not fully comprehended. The bioaccumulation and biomagnifications of these chemicals through the food chain have long-term effects on the wildlife. The detection and quantification of such pharmaceutical residues in the environment is a tedious process and quicker methods are needed. Aptasensors are one such quick and reliable method for the identification of pharmaceutical residues in the wildlife. Aptasensors are a class of biosensors that work on the principles of biological recognition of elements. The aptamers are unique biological recognition elements with high specificity and affinity to various targets. Their efficiency makes them a very promising candidate for such sensitive research. In this review, the pharmaceutical threats to wildlife and their detection techniques using aptasensors have been discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal health 3aaptasensors 3abioaccumulation 3abirds 3aenvironment 3afood chain 3ahumans 3aoligonucleotides 3arisk assessment 3awildlife 0aAptamers 0aPharmaceuticals 0aWildlife toxicity 0aBiosensors 0aVeterinary drugs1 aDey, Aayush1 aTharmavaram, Maithri1 aKhatri, Nitasha1 aRawtani, Deepak0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Aug. 25, v. 836 p.155622-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1556223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013000165300001800295520187100313592002802184650001002212650002102222650002302243650002002266650001002286650002502296650001502321650001502336650001502351650001302366650002202379650001302401650002302414700002402437700002302461700001702484700001602501700001802517700005902535773012402594856008302718852000902801655001202810IND60698976920221119034923.0220822e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069897692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-05498-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMete, Meltem13aAn investigation of the relationship between TMPRSS6 gene expression, genetic variants and clinical findings in breast cancer  ap. 4225-4231.  aBreast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women worldwide. The TMPRSS6 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 6) gene encodes matriptase-2, which plays an important role in iron hemostasis as the hepcidin regulator and may play a role in breast cancer susceptibility. In this study, we examined the expression levels of the TMPRSS6 gene in healthy tissues and tumor tissues of breast cancer patients; and the relationship between these levels and pathological findings. The relationship between TMPRSS6 polymorphisms (rs733655, rs5756506, rs2413450, rs855791, rs2235324, rs4820268) and patients’ hematological parameters. The gene expression study encompassed 47 breast cancer patients and the gene polymorphism study consisted of 181 breast cancer patients and 100 healthy controls. Gene expression analysis was performed by qRT-PCR. The genotyping of TMPRSS6 polymorphisms was performed by RT-PCR. TMPRSS6 gene expression levels in tumor tissues were found to be 1.88 times higher than the expression levels in the control tissues. We examined the relationship between TMPRSS6 gene expression levels and pathological data, statistically significant relationship was found between patient's estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 findings and TMPRSS6 gene expression (respectively p = 0.02, p = 0.002). When the relationship between TMPRSS6 gene polymorphisms related genotypes distributions and hematological findings was investigated, a significant relationship was identified between mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) parameter and the polymorphism of only the rs733655. According to our findings, the increase in TMPRSS6 gene expression in cancerous tissues shows that matriptase-2 may be effective in the cancer process. Thus TMPRSS6 gene polymorphisms may affect the disease process by affecting the blood parameters of patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3abreast neoplasms 3aestrogen receptors 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenotyping 3ahemoglobin 3ahemostasis 3ahepcidin 3amolecular biology 3apatients 3aserine proteinases1 aTrabulus, Didem Can1 aTalu, Canan Kelten1 aOzoran, Emre1 aMutlu, Tuba1 aTekin, Bulent1 aGüven, Mehmet,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8749-17080 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 June, v. 47, no. 6 p.4225-4231dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05498-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01613naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002000190245012800210300001800338506007600356520041400432592002800846506003700874650001600911650002400927650001800951650002200969650001100991700006001002773012101062856008301183852000901266655001201275IND60655544920221207080906.0190803e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065554492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b020562doi7 aPMC67463262pmcid7 a313050822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMizia, J.

Urban sprawl and development places pressure on forested areas, as they are often displaced or degraded in the name of economic development. This is problematic because environmental amenities are valued by the public, but traditional market analysis typically obscures the value of these goods and services that are not explicitly traded in a market setting. This research examines the non-market value of environmental amenities in Greenville County, SC, by utilizing a hedonic price model of home sale data in 2011. We overlaid home sale data with 2011 National Land Cover Data to estimate the value of a forest view, proximity to a forest, and proximity to agriculture on the value of homes. We then ran two regression models, an ordinary least squares (OLS) and a geographically weighted regression to compare the impact of space on the hedonic model variables. Results show that citizens in Greenville County are willing to pay for environmental amenities, particularly views of a forest and proximity to forested and agricultural areas. However, the impact and directionality of these variables differ greatly across space. These findings suggest the need for an integration of spatial dynamics into environmental valuation estimates to inform conservation policy and intentional city planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aecological value 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3aland cover 3aleast squares 3amarket analysis 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices 3apublic services and goods 3aurban planning 3aurbanization 3awillingness to pay 3aSouth Carolina1 aAllen, Karen 0 tLand.g2019 Oct. 11, v. 8, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land81001473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01767naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245006200160300001600222520091400238592002801152650001301180650002501193650001501218650002601233650002001259650001401279773010101293856007401394852000901468655001201477IND60439141720221119163855.0151024e199803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043914172DNAL7 a10.1007/BF025071632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoson, Takayuki10aApoplast as the site of response to environmental signals  ap. 167-177.  aWhen the life cycle of plants is influenced by various environmental signals, the mechanical properties of the cell wall are greatly changed. These signals also modify the levels and structure of the cell wall constituents and such modifications are supposed to be the cause of the changes in the wall mechanical properties. These changes in the cell wall, the major component of the apoplast, can be recognized as the response of plants to environmental signals. The analysis of the mechanism leading to the response suggests that the apoplast is involved not only in the response but also in the perception and transduction of environmental signals in concert with the receptors of signals located on the plasma membrane. Thus, the apoplast plays a principal role in the communication of plants with the outer world and enables the plants to adapt themselves and survive in the environment full of stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoplast 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3amechanical properties 3aplasma membrane 3areceptors0 tJournal of plant research.g1998 Mar., v. 111, no. 1 p.167-177dSpringer-Verlagx0918-94407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF025071633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03555naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245010500204300001600309500002000325520178500345592002802130650001402158650001302172650001702185650002402202650000902226650001702235650001802252650001902270650001402289650001302303650000902316650001702325650002602342650001302368650002402381651001302405700005902418700006202477700005702539700005402596700002102650700005702671700001602728700006902744773014002813856007502953852000903028655001203037IND60772043120221121222039.0220331e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077204312DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.163882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReczynska, Alicja I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6643-669X10aOutcome of stereotactic body radiation for treatment of nasal and nasopharyngeal lymphoma in 32 cats  ap. 733-742.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the treatment of localized nasal lymphoma in cats has not been described. HYPOTHESIS: Stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy is an effective and well‐tolerated treatment for localized nasal lymphoma in cats. ANIMALS: Thirty‐two client owned cats referred to Colorado State University for the treatment of nasal lymphoma. METHODS: Retrospective study of cats treated with SBRT between 2010 and 2020 at Colorado State University. Diagnosis of nasal lymphoma was obtained via cytology or histopathology. Signalment, radiation protocol, concurrent treatments, adverse effects, and survival were recorded. RESULTS: Progression free survival was 225 days (95% CI 98–514) and median survival time (MST) was 365 days (95% CI 123–531). No significant difference in survival was identified between cats that received 1 versus greater than 1 fraction (MST 427 vs. 123 days, P = 0.88). Negative prognostic factors included cribriform lysis (MST 121 vs. 876 days, P = 0.0009) and intracalvarial involvement (MST 100 vs. 438 days, P = 0.0007). Disease progression was noted in 38% (12/32), locally in 22% (7/32), and systemically in 16% (5/32). No cats developed acute adverse effects. Ten cats developed late adverse effects: keratitis/keratitis sicca (n = 2), alopecia (n = 4), and leukotrichia (n = 4). Twenty‐four cats (75%) had signs consistent with chronic rhinitis. CONCLUSIONS: SBRT is effective and well tolerated for treating localized nasal lymphoma in cats. Outcomes for cats with lower stage disease (canine modified Adam's stage 3 and lower) are comparable to historic data of cats treated with fractionated radiation therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aalopecia 3acell biology 3adisease progression 3adogs 3adrug therapy 3afractionation 3ahistopathology 3akeratitis 3alymphoma 3anose 3aradiotherapy 3aretrospective studies 3arhinitis 3aveterinary medicine 3aColorado1 aLaRue, Susan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4602-45721 aBoss, Mary‐Keara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7239-45021 aLee, Ber‐In1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3648-59461 aLeary, Del1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5517-26681 aPohlmann, Kelsey1 aGriffin, Lynn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0074-82331 aLana, Susan1 aWormhoudt Martin, Tiffany1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9258-48610 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2022 Mar., v. 36, no. 2 p.733-742dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.163883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245012200205300001600327520099800343592002801341650001101369650001201380650001101392650001201403650003501415650002501450650001501475650001701490650002201507650001501529650001201544651002501556651001001581653001601591653001301607653002401620653000801644653002501652700001901677700002701696773011601723856008301839852000901922655001201931IND60612547820221120055202.0190923e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061254782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2018.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVich, Guillem1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6419-191310aGreen exposure of walking routes and residential areas using smartphone tracking data and GIS in a Mediterranean city  ap. 275-285.  aThe aim of this study was to explore the exposure to green elements of residents in a compact and dense Mediterranean city, with a main focus on the exposure to traditional green elements such as parks and gardens and also less-explored elements such as public squares, boulevards, and beaches. Differences between walking and residential environments between morphologically distinct residential areas are also analysed. To achieve this, both residential and GPS-based exposure measures were obtained with GIS and smartphone tracking data for 129 adult individuals from Barcelona, Spain. Results have shown how using smartphone tracking data allows obtaining a higher density of green elements and the different types of these elements that residential buffers are not able to detect. Furthermore, research findings highlight the importance of urban form in the provision of green spaces in cities and that alternative greenness can be found in other types of open spaces beyond public parks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abeaches 3acities 3agardens 3ageographic information systems 3agreen infrastructure 3aopen space 3apublic parks 3aresidential areas 3atelephones 3awalking 3aMediterranean region 3aSpain 0aGreen space 0aExposure 0aSmartphone tracking 0aGPS 0aMediterranean cities1 aMarquet, Oriol1 aMiralles-Guasch, Carme0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2019 Apr., v. 40 p.275-285dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2018.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01263naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245007400131300001600205520050300221592002800724650001900752650001300771650002700784653000800811653001600819653001600835653002100851773010400872852000900976655001200985IND60764386820221118225131.0220130e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076438682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aApkaje, Kavita10aReproductive pattern in Taphozous Longimanus and Taphozous Kachhensis  ap. 437-439.  aTaphozouskachhensis (Dobson) is an exclusive Indian bat, belonging to family Emballonuridae.

In order to assess the species' potential for manipulation through breeding programs, more detailed spatial pattern analyses of fine-scale population structure was attempted in the two study sites (watershed 2 and 21) in the Coweeta River Basin of southern Appalachian mountains using allozyme markers. Of the 200 and 420 plants examined in watershed 21 and 2 respectively, 13 and 15 major genotypes of clone were distinguished. Within watersheds 2 and 21, 60% of the pairwise clone combinations had three or four loci differences out of the 8 loci investigated. No correlation between distance between clones and the number of allele difference was found. The similarity values (16 highest and 0 lowest value) among clones for watershed 2 and 21 were 12.82 and 10.19 respectively. Typical distances between clones on both watershed 2 and 21 were from 90 and 190 m, but the range varied from several meters up to 300 m. An average distance among clones were 140.9±66.0 m and 239.4±108.6 m in watershed 2 and 21 respectively, whereas an average distance within clone was 38.7±36.2 m and 145.0±123.6 m in watershed 2 and 21. Genotype diversity indices (DG) for watershed 2 and 21 were 0.89 and 0.86 respectively. The largest clones on both watersheds covered more than 100 m×100 m. On the other hand, some clones on watershed 2, which had a few fallen trees with many young sprouts (up to 200 individuals), were 45 m×30 m in size under the open habitat. Although clonal substructure and limited seed dispersal may cause near neighbor mating interaction, significant genetic patchiness among clones of black locust was not evident. Although the first establishment of a black locust population would have relied on an off-site seed source, it is more likely that asexual reproduction has occurred for many generations in these black locust populations because of the presence of many different sizes of trees (or ages) in one clone despite widespread opportunities for sexual reproduction. Presence of three or four different sizes of trees within a clone implies that the trees has developed from a clone at each different time. The current study suggested that the amount of sexual reproduction and dispersal rate (especially seed dispersal) should be determined. It would be useful to examine whether or not clonal strategies and patterns of clonal growth of black locust are influenced by density dependent regulation of ramet recruitment and death.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3aalleles 3aallozymes 3aasexual reproduction 3abreeding 3aclones 3adeath 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahabitats 3aloci 3apopulation 3apopulation structure 3aseed dispersal 3atrees 3awatersheds 3aAppalachian region 3aNorth Carolina1 aBongarten, Bruce1 aHamrick, James0 tJournal of plant research.g1998 Mar., v. 111, no. 1 p.17-24dSpringer-Verlagx0918-94407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF025071463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245014500171300001800316520133900334592002801673596008801701650002101789650001401810650001701824650003001841650001701871650002201888650002601910650002701936700006101963700006102024700002102085700003302106700006002139773012402199856008302323852000902406655001202415IND60698977220221119034823.0220822e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069897722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-020-05502-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrittanai, Supaluk10aExpression of actively soluble antigen-binding fragment (Fab) antibody and GFP fused Fab in the cytoplasm of the engineered Escherichia coli  ap. 4519-4529.  aThe expression of recombinant antibody fragments in the cytoplasmic space of Escherichia coli and the refolding process for restoring the structure and activity of such antibodies are not efficient. Herein, fragment antigen-binding (Fab) antibodies against miroestrol and deoxymiroestrol (MD-Fab) and their fusions with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) were expressed. The reactive MD-Fabs were successfully expressed as soluble and active forms in the cytoplasm of the SHuffle® T7 E. coli strain. Regarding the construct of MD-Fab alone, VH–CH1 could associate VL–CL into Fab in the oxidizing cytoplasm of the E. coli strain, and no additional in vitro refolding was needed. In the case of the fusions with GFP, when the C-terminus of VH–CH1 was linked with the N-terminus of GFP, the MD-Fab binding reactivity was retained, but the fluorescent activity of GFP interfered. When the C-terminus of GFP was linked to the N-terminus of VL–CL, the binding activity of MD-Fab was not observed. The constructed MD-Fabs had higher specificity toward deoxymiroestrol than the parental monoclonal antibody clone 12G11. In conclusion, MD-Fabs could be expressed using SHuffle® T7 E. coli cells. This process could be considered an economical, productive, and effective method to produce antibody fragments for immunoassay techniques.  aPublisher supplied data  a590H11cFaculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Graduate School of Khon Kaen University 3aEscherichia coli 3acytoplasm 3afluorescence 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aimmunoassays 3amolecular biology 3amonoclonal antibodies 3arecombinant antibodies1 aPutalun, Waraporn1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4010-06901 aSakamoto, Seiichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6871-522X1 aTanaka, Hiroyuki1 aJuengwatanatrakul, Thaweesak1 aYusakul, Gorawit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4575-49360 tMolecular biology reports.g2020 June, v. 47, no. 6 p.4519-4529dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-020-05502-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245014200172506010400314506007600418520163100494592002802125506003702153650001202190650001702202650002502219650002202244650003702266650001602303650001202319650001202331651001202343653002502355653001202380653001402392653001202406653001002418700001802428700001702446773011902463856008802582852000902670655001202679IND60775987020221207134200.0221004e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077598702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1556272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLahtela, Ville10aAssessment of critical factors in waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) plastics on the recyclability: A case study in Finland  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aExcessive waste is continually accumulating owing to increased consumption, and an excellent example is the consumption of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), which are eventually transformed into waste from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). WEEE is an interesting material stream because it includes various valuable materials that have great potential for recycling and reutilization. To maximize recycling and utilization potential, all fractions in WEEE must be reviewed from a sustainable perspective. Several WEEE contain plastic, which comprises approximately one-third of the total WEEE composition; thus, this plastic content is a good target for recycling purposes. However, the recycling of WEEE plastics might include some challenges, such as the treatment of harmful substances in the material, which can prevent effective and high-quality material recycling. This study investigates the polymer composition and critical elements of the material stream of WEEE polymer. These polymers were identified using portable near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) at an elemental level. The results showed that among various other polymers, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) was the main polymer identified in WEEE. The proportion of unidentified polymers was alarmingly large; specifically, when the presence of bromine was positively correlated with the presence of an unidentified WEEE polymer. This study also corroborated that bromine is actually not present in bromine-free plastics, demonstrating that industrial classification works with WEEE polymers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abromine 3acase studies 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectronic wastes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aenvironment 3astreams 3astyrene 3aFinland 0aElectronic equipment 0aPlastic 0aRecycling 0aSorting 0aWaste1 aHamod, Haruna1 aKärki, Timo0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 July 15, v. 830 p.155627-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1556273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03603naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245009200210300001500302506007600317520178200393592002802175506003702203650000802240650001502248650001502263650001402278650002502292650001002317650001402327650002402341650001102365650001102376650002602387650000902413650001802422650001302440650002202453650001502475700002402490700003102514700001902545700002202564700001902586700002102605700002202626700001902648700002002667700001802687700002002705700002302725700002802748700001502776773009602791856008102887852000902968655001202977IND60124414320221207112155.0150427e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012441432DNAL7 a10.1007/s12038-015-9508-62doi7 aPMC57796142pmcid7 a257401452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMittra, Indraneel10aCirculating nucleic acids damage DNA of healthy cells by integrating into their genomes  ap. 91-111.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhether nucleic acids that circulate in blood have any patho-physiological functions in the host have not been explored. We report here that far from being inert molecules, circulating nucleic acids have significant biological activities of their own that are deleterious to healthy cells of the body. Fragmented DNA and chromatin (DNAfs and Cfs) isolated from blood of cancer patients and healthy volunteers are readily taken up by a variety of cells in culture to be localized in their nuclei within a few minutes. The intra-nuclear DNAfs and Cfs associate themselves with host cell chromosomes to evoke a cellular DNA-damage-repair-response (DDR) followed by their incorporation into the host cell genomes. Whole genome sequencing detected the presence of tens of thousands of human sequence reads in the recipient mouse cells. Genomic incorporation of DNAfs and Cfs leads to dsDNA breaks and activation of apoptotic pathways in the treated cells. When injected intravenously into Balb/C mice, DNAfs and Cfs undergo genomic integration into cells of their vital organs resulting in activation of DDR and apoptotic proteins in the recipient cells. Cfs have significantly greater activity than DNAfs with respect to all parameters examined, while both DNAfs and Cfs isolated from cancer patients are more active than those from normal volunteers. All the above pathological actions of DNAfs and Cfs described above can be abrogated by concurrent treatment with DNase I and/or anti-histone antibody complexed nanoparticles both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results that circulating DNAfs and Cfs are physiological, continuously arising, endogenous DNA damaging agents with implications to ageing and a multitude of human pathologies including initiation of cancer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aantibodies 3aapoptosis 3abioactive properties 3ablood 3achromatin 3adeoxyribonuclease I 3agenome 3ahumans 3aintravenous injection 3amice 3ananoparticles 3apatients 3asequence analysis 3avolunteers1 aKhare, Naveen Kumar1 aRaghuram, Gorantla Venkata1 aChaubal, Rohan1 aKhambatti, Fatema1 aGupta, Deepika1 aGaikwad, Ashwini1 aPrasannan, Preeti1 aSingh, Akshita1 aIyer, Aishwarya1 aSingh, Ankita1 aUpadhyay, Pawan1 aNair, Naveen Kumar1 aMishra, Pradyumna Kumar1 aDutt, Amit0 tJournal of biosciences.g2015 Mar., v. 40, no. 1 p.91-111dSpringer-Verlagx0250-59917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12038-015-9508-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01869naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245010600178300001800284520063100302592002800933650002000961650001900981650001801000650002301018650002101041650001101062650001301073650002901086650001401115650002101129650002201150700002001172700002001192700005801212773012101270856008301391852000901474655001201483IND60655545320191010000000.0190803e20190711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065554532DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b020672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes, Alexandra Basilio10aTandem Double-Cross-Coupling/Hydrothiolation Reaction of 2-Sulfenyl Benzimidazoles with Boronic Acids  ap. 5943-5947.  aA new tandem palladium-catalyzed reaction involving a Suzuki–Miyaura coupling, a desulfenylative coupling, and a hydrothiolation of a triple bond is reported. Notably, the desulfenylative coupling occurs without copper(I) assistance and the hydrothiolation is totally regioselective and stereoselective. The overall process results in the double incorporation of the boronic acid and the reincorporation of the sulfenyl moiety into the product structure. Starting from 2-(bromobenzylsulfenyl)-1-propargyl benzimidazoles, the transformation led to variously substituted benzimidazoles bearing a stereodefined alkenyl sulfide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuzuki reaction 3abenzimidazoles 3aboronic acids 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3acopper 3amoieties 3aorganic sulfur compounds 3apalladium 3aregioselectivity 3astereoselectivity1 aChoury, Mickael1 aWagner, Patrick1 aGulea, Mihaela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2945-00780 tOrganic letters.g2019 July 11, v. 21, no. 15 p.5943-5947dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.9b020673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100002000186245007500206300001100281506007600292520203300368592002802401506003702429650001102466650001502477650000902492650002002501650001502521650001402536700002202550700002802572700001902600700002202619700001902641700002002660700002402680700002102704700002802725700002502753700001702778773009202795856007902887852000902966655001202975IND50071832420221207100548.0160319e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007183242DNAL7 aPMC38827792pmcid7 a243700022pmid7 a10.1186/1742-9994-10-802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHart, Vlastimil10aDogs are sensitive to small variations of the Earth’s magnetic field  ap. 80.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aINTRODUCTION: Several mammalian species spontaneously align their body axis with respect to the Earth’s magnetic field (MF) lines in diverse behavioral contexts. Magnetic alignment is a suitable paradigm to scan for the occurrence of magnetosensitivity across animal taxa with the heuristic potential to contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of magnetoreception and identify further functions of magnetosensation apart from navigation. With this in mind we searched for signs of magnetic alignment in dogs. We measured the direction of the body axis in 70 dogs of 37 breeds during defecation (1,893 observations) and urination (5,582 observations) over a two-year period. After complete sampling, we sorted the data according to the geomagnetic conditions prevailing during the respective sampling periods. Relative declination and intensity changes of the MF during the respective dog walks were calculated from daily magnetograms. Directional preferences of dogs under different MF conditions were analyzed and tested by means of circular statistics. RESULTS: Dogs preferred to excrete with the body being aligned along the North–South axis under calm MF conditions. This directional behavior was abolished under unstable MF. The best predictor of the behavioral switch was the rate of change in declination, i.e., polar orientation of the MF. CONCLUSIONS: It is for the first time that (a) magnetic sensitivity was proved in dogs, (b) a measurable, predictable behavioral reaction upon natural MF fluctuations could be unambiguously proven in a mammal, and (c) high sensitivity to small changes in polarity, rather than in intensity, of MF was identified as biologically meaningful. Our findings open new horizons in magnetoreception research. Since the MF is calm in only about 20% of the daylight period, our findings might provide an explanation why many magnetoreception experiments were hardly replicable and why directional values of records in diverse observations are frequently compromised by scatter.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreeds 3adefecation 3adogs 3amagnetic fields 3astatistics 3aurination1 aNováková, Petra1 aMalkemper, Erich Pascal1 aBegall, Sabine1 aHanzal, Vladimír1 aJežek, Miloš1 aKušta, Tomáš1 aNěmcová, Veronika1 aAdámková, Jana1 aBenediktová, Kateřina1 aČervený, Jaroslav,1 aBurda, Hynek0 tFrontiers in zoology.g2013 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.80-80dBioMed Centralx1742-99947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1742-9994-10-803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245014300209300002000352506007600372520151900448592002801967506003701995650002102032650002002053650001002073650001302083650001802096700003102114700002802145700002102173700003002194773017602224856008302400852000902483655001202492IND4481617720221207121634.0120502e20111011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448161772DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11078481082doi7 aPMC31932002pmcid7 a219695552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwartz, William J.10aDistinct patterns of Period gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus underlie circadian clock photoentrainment by advances or delays  ap. 17219-17224.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe circadian clock in the mammalian hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is entrained by the ambient light/dark cycle, which differentially acts to cause the clock to advance or delay. Light-induced changes in the rhythmic expression of SCN clock genes are believed to be a critical step in this process, but how the two entrainment modalities—advances vs. delays—engage the molecular clockwork remains incompletely understood. We investigated molecular substrates of photic entrainment of the clock in the SCN by stably entraining hamsters to T cycles (non–24-h light/dark cycles) consisting of a single 1-h light pulse repeated as either a short (23.33-h) or a long (24.67-h) cycle; under these conditions, the light pulse of the short cycle acts as "dawn," whereas that of the long cycle acts as "dusk." Analyses of the expression of the photoinducible and rhythmic clock genes Period 1 and 2 (Per1 and Per2) in the SCN revealed fundamental differences under these two entrainment modes. Light at dawn advanced the clock, advancing the onset of the Per1 mRNA rhythm and acutely increasing mRNA transcription, whereas light at dusk delayed the clock, delaying the offset of the Per2 mRNA rhythm and tonically increasing mRNA stability. The results suggest that the underlying molecular mechanisms of circadian entrainment differ with morning (advancing) or evening (delaying) light exposure, and such differences may reflect how entrainment takes place in nocturnal animals under natural conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acircadian rhythm 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahamsters 3amessenger RNA1 aTavakoli-Nezhad, Mahboubeh1 aLambert, Christopher M.1 aWeaver, David R.1 ade la Iglesia, Horacio O.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Oct. 11, v. 108, no. 41 p.17219-17224dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11078481083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011700169300001600286520143000302592002801732650004401760650002201804650001701826650002501843650002201868650001201890650002201902650001801924650001301942650001701955650003701972650001202009650001802021650001802039650002102057650002202078650003302100650001802133650001702151650001602168653002202184653003002206653003002236653001902266700001502285700001702300700001502317700001802332773011202350856008502462852000902547655001202556IND60561273320221121035514.0180830e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056127332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2016.09.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShan, Linglong10aSpray-assisted biomineralization of a superhydrophilic water uptake layer for enhanced pervaporation dehydration  ap. 183-191.  aThe membrane surface wettability is one of the most important factors influencing the solution-diffusion-controlled pervaporation process. In this work, a novel conceptual methodology for the construction of a superhydrophilic water uptake layer is proposed to overcome the limitation of trade-off effects. Rapid implementation of this strategy is possible by spray-assisted biomineralization of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) onto a (poly(acrylic acid)/poly(ethyleneimine))n/polyacrylonitrile ((PAA/PEI)n/PAN) membrane. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed the formation of a hierarchical lotus CaCO3 layer with calcite crystals on the outermost layer. The water contact angle dramatically decreased from 74° to 4.2° after biomineralizing CaCO3 micro-nano-particles. In the pervaporation separation of ethanol/water mixtures, the water content could be enriched from 5wt% to 98.8wt% while the permeate flux reached 1317g/(m²h), which is almost five times that of a pure polyelectrolyte membrane without biomineralizing CaCO3. This suggests that the CaCO3 water uptake layer plays a very important role in achieving high flux. These results indicate that biomineralization of micro-nano-particles is a facile strategy to fabricate a superhydrophilic surface and, in turn, improve the membrane performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacrylic acid 3aartificial membranes 3abiomineralization 3acalcite 3acalcium carbonate 3acontact angle 3acrystals 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aethanol 3aethyleneimine 3apervaporation 3apolyacrylic acid 3apolyacrylonitrile 3ascanning electron microscopy 3awater content 3awater uptake 3awettability 0aBiomineralization 0aSuperhydrophilic membrane 0aPervaporation dehydration 0aSpray assembly1 aGong, Lili1 aFan, Hongwei1 aJi, Shulan1 aZhang, Guojun0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 522 p.183-191dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2016.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01518naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008000167300001800247520050700265592002800772650002400800650001300824650001400837653001800851653003200869653005300901700002000954700001600974700001600990773012601006856005101132852000901183655001201192IND50087517320221121171349.0140412e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008751732DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2012.6756792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wen-Yan10aStability and control of the convergence point for two-strand yarn spinning  ap. 1228-1233.  aIn this paper, stability of the convergence point in Siro-spinning composite area and control of tension compensator (TC) to the unstable motion of the convergence point in Sirofil spinning are kinetically studied.

Furthermore, such food waste has serious environmental consequences. If household food waste reduction initiatives are to be successful they will need to be informed by people's motivations and barriers to minimising household food waste. This paper reports a qualitative study of the thoughts, feelings and experiences of 15 UK household food purchasers, based on semi-structured interviews. Two core categories of motives to minimise household food waste were identified: (1) waste concerns and (2) doing the ‘right’ thing. A third core category illustrated the importance of food management skills in empowering people to keep household food waste to a minimum. Four core categories of barriers to minimising food waste were also identified: (1) a ‘good’ provider identity; (2) minimising inconvenience; (3) lack of priority; and (4) exemption from responsibility. The wish to avoid experiencing negative emotions (such as guilt, frustration, annoyance, embarrassment or regret) underpinned both the motivations and the barriers to minimising food waste. Findings thus reveal potentially conflicting personal goals which may hinder existing food waste reduction attempts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemotions 3afood waste 3ahouseholds 3ainterviews 3amotivation 3apeople 3awaste reduction 3aUnited Kingdom 0aFood waste prevention 0aPro-environmental behaviour 0aMoral behaviour 0aSocial behaviour 0aGrounded theory1 aJessop, Donna C.1 aSparks, Paul0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2014 Mar., v. 84 p.15-23dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245014900173300001400322520190200336592002802238650003002266650001502296650001202311650001102323650001202334650001102346650002402357650001402381650001302395650002202408650001602430650001202446650001302458650001702471651001802488653001602506653003302522653003202555653003502587653001202622653003602634653002002670700001602690700001802706700001602724700002102740700001802761700001602779700001402795773015302809856008302962852000903045655001203054IND60114183020221118233316.0190401e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011418302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2013.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira-Filho, A.T.10aStability structures tropical woody plant diversity more than seasonality: Insights into the ecology of high legume-succulent-plant biodiversity  ap. 42-57.  aPhylogenies of legume taxa are ecologically structured along a tropical seasonality gradient, which suggests phylogenetic niche conservatism. This seasonality gradient spans Neotropical wet forests, savannas, and highly seasonal drought-prone woody vegetation known as the succulent biome. Ecological phylogenetic structure was investigated using a community phylogenetic approach. We further analyzed bioclimatic and other independent variables that potentially explained phylogenetic beta diversity among 466 floristic sites that spanned the savanna and succulent biomes in eastern South America. Explanatory variables were selected using variance inflation factors, information criteria, and the ability to explain both species and phylogenetic beta diversity. A model involving annual precipitation suggests that a threshold of <1200mm explains community phylogenetic structure along the savanna–succulent biome transition. Variables involving temperatures or measures of seasonality were notably lacking from top-ranked models. The abundance and diversity of legumes across the tropical seasonality gradient suggest that a high nitrogen metabolism confers an advantage in one of two ways, both of which are related to rapid growth rates. Legumes adapted to the succulent biome may be responding to regular post-dry-season leaf-flush opportunities. Legumes adapted to the savanna biome may be responding to intermittent post-disturbance growing opportunities. A seasonal predominance of leaf flushing by woody plants implicates the role of ecological stability in the succulent biome because of the need to recover the cost of regenerating short-lived leaves. Ecological stability may be the fundamental cause of ecological phylogenetic structure across the tropical seasonality gradient and required for maintaining high levels of both leaf-flushing legume and succulent plant biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aecosystems 3aforests 3aleaves 3alegumes 3amodels 3anitrogen metabolism 3aphylogeny 3asavannas 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3atropics 3avariance 3awoody plants 3aSouth America 0aLeguminosae 0aMean-nearest-taxon distances 0aPhylogenetic beta diversity 0aPhylogenetic community ecology 0aSavanna 0aSeasonally dry tropical forests 0aSucculent biome1 aCardoso, D.1 aSchrire, B.D.1 aLewis, G.P.1 aPennington, R.T.1 aBrummer, T.J.1 aRotella, J.1 aLavin, M.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2013 Nov., v. 89 p.42-57dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2013.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007500168300001600243520152600259592002801785650001101813650001901824650001601843650002001859650001501879650000901894650002001903650000901923650001001932650001601942650001001958650002101968650002501989700001702014700002102031700002102052773011402073856008202187852000902269655001202278IND60623728420221119055256.0181127e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062372842DNAL7 a10.1177/0898756410027003012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirard, Nicolas10aTooth Resorption and Vitamin D₃ Status in Cats Fed Premium Dry Diets  ap. 142-147.  aIt has been suggested that tooth resorption (TR) in cats is associated with vitamin D₃ status.

Serum 25-OH-D was measured, and cats received a single, complete periodontal examination, with periodontal probing of each tooth and exploration of the tooth surface using a dental explorer. A complete set of 10 dental radiographs was taken for each cat. There were 168 TRs diagnosed in 40 of 64 cats (85 were Type 1 TR and 83 were Type 2). The mean serum 25-OH-D concentration was 187.7 ± 87.3 nmol/L. The mean serum 25-OH-D in cats with one or more TR was 164.2 ± 78.8 nmol/L, compared with 226.8 ± 88.2 nmol/L for those without TR (p = 0.14). The mean serum 25-OH-D in the 13 cats with >5 TR was 131.2 ± 49.5 nmol/L, which was significantly less than in cats with no TR (p < 0.05). There was no relationship between TR type and serum 25-OH-D. There was no effect of age or sex on serum 25-OH-D. On the contrary, variations in serum 25-OH-D were observed according to the studied breeds. There was no relationship between TR type and serum 25-OH-D. TR prevalence was greater in cats with lower serum 25-OH-D concentrations. In conclusion, the hypothesis that higher serum 25-OH-D concentrations are associated with a higher prevalence of TR is not supported by this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanimal feeding 3ablood serum 3abone resorption 3acat breeds 3acats 3acholecalciferol 3adiet 3afoods 3aradiography 3ateeth 3atooth resorption 3aveterinary dentistry1 aServet, Eric1 aHennet, Philippe1 aBiourge, Vincent0 tJournal of veterinary dentistry.g, v. 27, no. 3 p.142-147dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26868x2470-40837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0898756410027003013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013600169300001600305520119800321592002801519650002301547650002101570650001901591650001801610650001201628650001101640650001901651650002601670650001501696650001701711650001501728653000901743653000801752653000801760653000801768653000801776653000801784653001301792653000801805653000801813653000801821653000801829653000901837653001201846653001001858653001501868653002301883653002501906653002201931700002201953700006501975700002302040700002502063700002002088700002702108773011102135856008602246852000902332655001202341IND60587074020221117235253.0190410e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058707402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2017.11.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchex, Roland10aHPLC-DAD-APCI/ESI-MSn analysis of carotenoids and α-tocopherol in Costa Rican Acrocomia aculeata fruits of varying maturity stages  ap. 645-653.  aCarotenoids and tocopherols were characterised in the meso- and exocarp of wild-growing Costa Rican Acrocomia aculeata fruits. Comprehensive profiling of these lipophilic micronutrients in fruits of three varying maturity stages was conducted for the first time. A method for the simultaneous extraction and quantitation of carotenoids and α-tocopherol was developed and validated. Detailed HPLC-DAD-APCI/ESI-MSn analyses enabled the identification of α-tocopherol and 25 carotenoids. The latter comprised antheraxanthin, β-carotene, lutein, luteoxanthin, neoxanthin, phytoene, phytofluene, violaxanthin, zeaxanthin, and several (Z)-isomers of the aforementioned compounds. Quantitation by HPLC-DAD/FLD revealed total carotenoid concentrations of 872±178 and 3075±407μg/100g fresh weight in the meso- and exocarp of fully ripe fruits, respectively. In both fruit fractions, progressing maturation resulted in the accumulation of phytoene, phytofluene, (all-E)-zeaxanthin, (all-E)-antheraxanthin, and (all-E)-violaxanthin. Carotenoid profiling was supported by multivariate data analysis. Carotenoid precursors and xanthophyll cycle pigments characterised Macauba fruits of full maturity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrocomia aculeata 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantheraxanthin 3abeta-carotene 3aexocarp 3alutein 3amaturity stage 3amultivariate analysis 3aneoxanthin 3aviolaxanthin 3azeaxanthin 0aAPCI 0aBHA 0aBHT 0aCID 0aESI 0aHCA 0aHPLC-DAD 0aLOD 0aLOQ 0aMSn 0aPCA 0atBME 0aMacauba 0aCoyol 0aPalm fruit 0aUnderutilised crop 0aCarotenoid precursor 0aXanthophyll cycle1 aLieb, Veronika M.1 aJiménez, Víctor M.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3771-60721 aEsquivel, Patricia1 aSchweiggert, Ralf M.1 aCarle, Reinhold1 aSteingass, Christof B.0 tFood research international.g2018 Mar., v. 105 p.645-653dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.11.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04008naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245016900208300001200377520267800389592002803067596002303095650002003118650001803138650001403156650001403170650002003184650001703204651001203221700005903233700005703292700005603349773016103405856008303566852000903649655001203658IND60753974920221118071148.0220603e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075397492DNAL7 a10.1186/s12966-021-01204-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinnafick, F.

However, for middle- to older-age females less is known about the benefits of sports participation on these outcomes. Further, the acceptability and feasibility of setting-up, implementing and maintaining sports-based programmes for an aging population is an understudied area of inquiry. The current study used the RE-AIM framework to investigate a nationwide Walking Netball (WN) programme. METHODS: The evaluation used a mixed-methods approach incorporating a multiple-baseline study, quasi-experimental study, programme monitoring data and qualitative studies to evaluate the programme in the Women’s Institutes (WI) in England. Data were analysed using multilevel growth modelling, mixed-design ANOVAs, multilevel regression, t-testing, and thematic analysis. Data were triangulated to address each dimension of the RE-AIM framework. FINDINGS: The programme reached 1.4% (n = 3148) of the WI population across 82.0% of WI regions in England and attracted inactive members at risk of ill-health. WN contributed to adaptations in physical function, mental health and wellbeing, social isolation, quality of life and increased physical activity. The adoption of the programme was successful with 87.7% WN groups’ maintaining participation beyond the 20-session initial delivery phase. Adoption was effective because of its set-up, peer-mentorship and long-term delivery; these factors likewise shaped implementation. Adapting and tailoring WN to the varying characteristics of participants within the WI and the facilities available, along with training delivery staff and providing resources are key programme components. The Walking Netball programme can be maintained through promotion within the local community, sustainable funding, inter-WI competitions, festivals and networks, multiple-hosts and continued host development. CONCLUSIONS: WN was found to be an acceptable, feasible and effective intervention to increase physical activity and improve health in middle- to older- aged women. Future programmes may consider adapted styles of set-up and delivery. These include adapting to people, places and spaces through personalised support and providing a range of resources. Future designs may seek to understand how participation can contribute to healthy aging through longitudinal research beyond 12-months.

Emerging new impacts that are characteristic of the anthropocene require more attention in current life cycle assessment (LCA), a framework in which many relevant impact assessment models are still missing. More attention, more data and more concern require the LCA community to intervene and to start or increase the modelling efforts to accommodate new impacts in LCA. To date the process of inclusion of new impacts in LCA has not yet been formalised. To deal with this process, a framework is here proposed and tested through the analysis of three emerging impact categories, noise, ecological light pollution (ELP) and radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF). We show that any development must start from a careful study of the theories and investigations from other specialist fields of science than the field of LCA. The gathering of such information is fundamental to assess the maturity of the impacts, their importance and the quality of the evidence that is available. In addition, this information has to be bridged to the computational structure of LCA, to check whether the physical properties of new impacts may be adjusted to the basics of LCA. We discuss the three new potential impact categories as a paradigm for action for any new development in LCA.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aelectromagnetic field 3alife cycle impact assessment 3amodels 3aphysical properties 3apollution 0aLCA 0aNon-toxic pollutants 0aEmerging pollutants 0aNoise 0aEcological light pollution 0aElectromagnetic fields1 aHeijungs, R.1 aPeijnenburg, W.J.G.M.1 aBolte, J.F.B.1 ade Snoo, G.R.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 78 p.152-163dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015900168520167800327592002802005653001802033653002002051653002002071653001602091653003302107653002702140700002202167700002302189773009002212856008502302852000902387655001202396IND60762481820221119052801.0220315e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076248182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meafoo.2022.1000232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Gopesh10aSteady and dynamic shear rheology of Indian Jujube (Ziziphus mauritiana Lam.) fruit pulp with physiochemical, textural and thermal properties of the fruit  aIndian jujube (Ziziphus mauritiana Lam.) is a globally underutilized fruit and is well-known for being a good source of total phenolics and a rich source of ascorbic acid with essential minerals such as calcium, phosphorus and iron. A rheometer was used to investigate the rheological characterization of Indian jujube pulp. It was found that Indian jujube pulp exhibit a shear thinning behaviour as viscosity (η) and shear stress (σ) of pulp significantly (p < 0.05) decreased as the shear rate (γ̇̇) increased. Pulp's behaviour was characterized efficiently by correlating Power-law, Carreau-Yasuda, and Cross models with flow curve. The Cross model was found more efficient (R²:0.99775) than the Power-law (R²:0.85995) and Carreau-Yasuda model (R²:0.97291). Dynamic shear rheology test of the Indian jujube pulp presented weak gel behaviour as storage modulus (G') surpassed loss modulus (G") value. The frequency dependency of both the storage G′ and loss G′′ moduli was evaluated using a power Law model with a determination coefficient (R²) greater than 0.9. The tan(δ) values (0.020 to 0.535) suggested that the Indian jujube pulp is elastic in nature. Textural properties of Indian jujube fruit like hardness, percentage deformation at the hardness and peak stress of Indian jujube fruit were 32.76 ± 5.00 N, 7.15 ± 1.06% and 17780.80 ± 3185.47 N/m². DSC curve showed glass transition phase of unprocessed Indian jujube fruit flesh at (98.29°C), and specific heat (Delta Cp) was found 193.96 J/g. The findings of this study will aid in the development of handling and processing machinery for the commercial manufacture of Indian jujube pulp.  aPublisher supplied data 0aIndian jujube 0aRheology models 0aPower law model 0aCross model 0aGlass transition temperature 0aDouble compresion test1 aMurakonda, Sahiti1 aDwivedi, Madhuresh0 tMeasurement.g2022 Feb., v. 5 p.100023-dElsevier LtdwJournal:27960x2772-27597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meafoo.2022.1000233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01898naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013500170300001800305520070300323592002801026650001501054650001401069650001901083650001501102650002201117650001801139700002001157700001701177700001801194700002101212700002001233700001501253700002101268773011001289856008101399990002301480852000901503655001201512IND60090744420221120075821.0141102e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009074442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2012.09.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuda, Takayoshi10aRapid biochemical synthesis of ¹¹C-labeled single chain variable fragment antibody for immuno-PET by cell-free protein synthesis  ap. 6579-6582.  aImmuno-PET is a promising approach for improved cancer diagnosis, by taking advantage of the high specificity of antibodies.

The approach combines transparent identification of sustainability principles, their regional contextualization through sub-principles (indicators), and the scoring of these indicators through deliberative dialogue within an interdisciplinary team of researchers, taking into account their various qualitative and quantitative research results. The approach was applied to a sustainability assessment of a complex water governance system in the Swiss Alps. We conclude that the applied approach is advantageous for structuring complex and heterogeneous knowledge, gaining a holistic and comprehensive perspective on water sustainability, and communicating this perspective to stakeholders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative analysis 3aresearchers 3astakeholders 3ateams 3awater management 3aAlps region 0awater governance 0awater management 0asustainability 0ainterdisciplinary assessment 0aindicators 0avisions1 aBonriposi, Mariano1 aGraefe, Olivier1 aHerweg, Karl1 aHomewood, Christine1 aHuss, Matthias1 aKauzlaric, Martina1 aLiniger, Hanspeter1 aRey, Emmanuel1 aReynard, Emmanuel1 aRist, Stephan1 aSchädler, Bruno,1 aWeingartner, Rolf0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2015 Sept. 2, v. 58, no. 9 p.1577-1600dRoutledgex1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2014.9388043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01858naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245008900158300001800247520044100265592002800706650001400734650002300748650000900771650001800780650001100798650003100809700002400840700013400864700002000998700011401018700002401132700002701156700002201183700002301205700002101228773012901249856007301378852000901451655001201460IND60657806520221120022708.0190816e20060615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065780652DNAL7 a10.1039/b602086k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmiglak, Marcin10aCombustible ionic liquids by design: is laboratory safety another ionic liquid myth?  ap. 2554-2556.  aThe non-flammability of ionic liquids (ILs) is often highlighted as a safety advantage of ILs over volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but the fact that many ILs are not flammable themselves does not mean that they are safe to use near fire and/or heat sources; a large group of ILs (including commercially available ILs) are combustible due to the nature of their positive heats of formation, oxygen content, and decomposition products.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosafety 3achemical reactions 3aheat 3aionic liquids 3aoxygen 3avolatile organic compounds1 aReichert, W.

More recently, the biological activity of 2′-substituted-3,3′,5,5′-tetrachloro-2-iodo-4,4′-bipyridines has been explored in the field of transthyretin (TTR) fibrillogenesis inhibition, and the anticancer cytotoxicity of some derivatives is currently under systematic investigation. In this frame, the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) enantioseparation of four atropisomeric 2,2′-disubstituted-4,4′-bipyridines (R, R’ = Ar, I), which contain multiple interaction sites, such as hydrogen bonding (HB) donors and acceptors, halogen bond (XB) donors, and π-extended electronic clouds, was explored by using n-hexane (Hex)/2-propanol (2-PrOH) 90:10 v/v as a mobile phase (MP), and eight chiral columns with coated and immobilized amylose- and cellulose-based selectors. The impact of subtle structural variations of analytes and selectors on their mutual intermolecular interactivity was evaluated in terms of retention (k) and selectivity (α) factors. On this basis, chromatographic analysis based on systematic screening of analytes and selectors was integrated with electrostatic potential (V) analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as computational techniques. The effect of temperature on retention, selectivity, and enantiomer elution order (EEO) of the analytes with coated and immobilized amylose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) was also considered by comparing the variation of the thermodynamic profile associated with each enantioseparation. Chromatographic responses proved to be strictly dependent on specific regions within the analyte, and functions of different interactions sites of the analytes as the structure of the chiral selector changes were significantly disclosed.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBipyridines 0aElectrostatic potential 0aEnantioseparation 0aHigh-performance liquid chromatography 0aMolecular dynamics 0aPolysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases1 aDessì, Alessandro,1 aSechi, Barbara1 aChankvetadze, Bezhan1 aCossu, Sergio1 aMamane, Victor1 aAubert, Emmanuel1 aRozzo, Carla1 aPalmieri, Giuseppe1 aSpissu, Ylenia1 aPeluso, Paola0 tJournal of chromatography open.g2022 Nov., v. 2 p.100030-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:28530x2772-39177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcoa.2022.1000303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245013800164500002200302520145200324592002801776650002101804650001301825650001101838650001001849650002401859650002101883650003801904650001201942650001201954650001301966650001801979650001401997653001602011653002502027653001002052653001302062653001202075653002002087653002702107700002602134700001802160700002002178773009302198856008102291852000902372655001202381IND60671642320221118094700.0191004e20190926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067164232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2019.1134632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarki, Sudeep10aInhibitor screening assay for neurexin-LRRTM adhesion protein interaction involved in synaptic maintenance and neurological disorders  aPre-press version  aSynaptic adhesion molecules, including presynaptic neurexins (NRXNs) and post-synaptic leucine-rich repeat transmembrane (LRRTM) proteins are important for development and maintenance of brain neuronal networks. NRXNs are probably the best characterized synaptic adhesion molecules, and one of the major presynaptic organizer proteins. The LRRTMs were found as ligands for NRXNs. Many of the synaptic adhesion proteins have been linked to neurological cognitive disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, making them targets of interest for both biological studies, and towards drug development. Therefore, we decided to develop a screening method to target the adhesion proteins, here the LRRTM-NRXN interaction, to find small molecule probes for further studies in cellular settings. To our knowledge, no potent small molecule compounds against the neuronal synaptic adhesion proteins are available. We utilized the AlphaScreen technology, and developed an assay targeting the NRXN-LRRTM2 interaction. We carried out screening of 2000 compounds and identified hits with moderate IC50-values. We also established an orthogonal in-cell Western blot assay to validate hits. This paves way for future development of specific high affinity compounds by further high throughput screening of larger compound libraries using the methods established here. The method could also be applied to screening other NRXN-ligand interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadhesion 3aautism 3abrain 3acognitive disorders 3adrug development 3ahigh-throughput screening methods 3aligands 3aneurons 3aproteins 3aschizophrenia 3ascreening 0aAlphaScreen 0aIn-cell western blot 0aLRRTM 0aNeurexin 0aSynapse 0aInhibitor assay 0aNeurological disorders1 aMaksimainen, Mirko M.1 aLehtiö, Lari1 aKajander, Tommi0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2019 Sept. 26, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2019.1134633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012300169300001600292520112100308592002801429650001801457650002001475650001801495650001301513650001401526650002101540650001401561650002101575650001101596650002701607650000901634650001601643650001901659650001101678650001601689653001601705653002001721653001601741653002001757653002101777700001601798700001701814773011101831856008601942852000902028655001202037IND60587074220221121031628.0190410e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058707422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2017.11.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Shinjae10aEffect of xanthan gum on lipid digestion and bioaccessibility of β-carotene-loaded rice starch-based filled hydrogels  ap. 440-445.  aThe aim of this study was to examine the effects of xanthan gum on the lipid digestibility, rheological properties, and β-carotene bioaccessibility of rice starch-based filled hydrogels. β-Carotene was solubilized within lipid droplets of emulsion that were then entrapped within rice starch hydrogels fabricated with different concentrations of xanthan gum. At a low concentration of xanthan gum (<0.5wt%), the viscous characteristics of the filled starch hydrogels increased. Furthermore, these hydrogels had a slower rate of lipid digestion than the β-carotene-loaded emulsion. As the concentration of xanthan gum was increased (to 1.0wt% and 2.0wt%), the filled starch hydrogels became more elastic gel-like than those without xanthan gum, and also had the fastest rate and highest final extent of lipid digestion. The addition of xanthan gum to the filled starch hydrogel lowered the bioaccessibility of β-carotene to varying degrees, depending on the xanthan gum concentration. The results obtained from this study can be useful in designing gel-like food products fortified with lipophilic nutraceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-carotene 3abioavailability 3adigestibility 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3afunctional foods 3ahydrogels 3alipid metabolism 3alipids 3arheological properties 3arice 3arice starch 3asolubilization 3astarch 3axanthan gum 0aβ-Carotene 0aFilled hydrogel 0aXanthan gum 0aLipid digestion 0aBioaccessibility1 aMun, Saehun1 aKim, Yong-Ro0 tFood research international.g2018 Mar., v. 105 p.440-445dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.11.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013100164300001400295520131500309592002801624650001301652650002201665650001301687650001201700650001401712650002501726653001901751653001301770653001601783653002601799653001401825700001801839700002001857700001301877700001401890773015301904856008302057852000902140655001202149IND60114183320221118233557.0190401e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011418332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2013.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, G.P.12aA 2013 linear sequence of legume genera set in a phylogenetic context — A tool for collections management and taxon sampling  ap. 76-84.  aThe Leguminosae (or Fabaceae) currently comprises 751 genera. In most of the world's herbaria the genera are arranged by old, non-phylogenetic, classification systems which, while offering insights into morphological similarity, make no explicit statement as to evolutionary relationships. While classifications based on morphology are useful tools for plant identification, they do not offer the predictive value that phylogenetically based linear sequences provide. The legume collection of c.750,000 specimens in the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew was moved to a new building between 2010 and 2011, which presented the opportunity to reorganise the collection by a linear sequence based on a number of relatively comprehensive published legume phylogenies. The numbered linear sequence adopted at Kew has been updated and emended to include generic changes that have been published up to March 2013. The linear sequence, together with an alphabetical list of genera, is presented here to serve as a management tool for future taxon sampling and herbarium curation. The process used to develop the linear sequence and to rearrange the legume collection at Kew is discussed together with plans for future dissemination of changes to the sequence as new phylogenies are published and incorporated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFabaceae 3abotanical gardens 3aherbaria 3alegumes 3aphylogeny 3aplant identification 0aClassification 0aFabaceae 0aLeguminosae 0aList of legume genera 0aPhylogeny1 aSchrire, B.D.1 aMackinder, B.A.1 aRico, L.1 aClark, R.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2013 Nov., v. 89 p.76-84dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2013.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012100170506011700291506007600408520135100484592002801835506003701863653001101900653001301911653003001924653002001954653001701974653002201991700002102013700002502034700002202059773010802081856008402189852000902273655001202282IND60762482020221207065125.0220802e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076248202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.afres.2021.1000392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJadhav, Harsh B.10aComparative assessment of thermo-oxidative stability of palm oil designer lipid and palm oil blends as frying medium  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe current study focuses on comparing the physico-chemical changes during frying of palm oil designer lipid (PODL) and two different blends of palm oil with medium chain triglycerides (MCT) over 48 frying cycles. The PV of PODL, F1 (blend of palm oil with MCT in 50:50 proportion) and F2 (blend of palm oil with MCT in 70:30 proportion) increased from 1.29 ± 0.02, 1.34 ± 0.00, 1.38 ± 0.01 to 1.36 ± 0.02, 1.83 ± 0.02, 1.94 ± 0.02 meq O₂ / kg respectively after 48 frying cycles. Similarly, p-AV and Totox values were 39.5 ± 0.01 and 42.22 ± 0.01, 52.8 ± 0.02 and 56.46 ± 0.03, 61.7 ± 0.01 and 65.58 ± 0.02 for PODL, F1 and F2 respectively after 48 frying cycles confirming that PODL showed higher thermo-oxidative stability in comparison with palm oil blends. The viscosity of all the frying medium increased and also there was a change in color of frying oil upon successive frying indicating accumulation of oxidative byproducts in the frying oil. Heat transfer coefficient was also elucidated to decrease with an increase in the frying cycle for all the blends and PODL. Overall, it was clearly demonstrated that the physicochemical properties and heat transfer quality of PODL was less affected as compared with palm oil blends demonstrating excellent potential of the PODL/interesterified fat as an alternative frying medium.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 0aFrying 0aPalm oil 0aMedium chain triglyceride 0aDesigner lipids 0aFrench fries 0aStructured lipids1 aGogate, Parag R.1 aWaghmare, Jyotsna T.1 aAnnapure, Uday S.0 tApplied food research.g2022 June, v. 2, no. 1 p.100039-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:28538x2772-50227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.afres.2021.1000393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01912naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012100168300001800289520071500307592002801022650000801050650001301058650001901071650001201090650001501102650002501117650002501142650002301167651001401190653002901204653001501233653002501248653001501273653002301288773012201311856008401433852000901517655001201526IND60340625420221118152903.0150803e20150902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034062542DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2014.9405152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Andy S.13aAn experimental study to explore WTP for aviation carbon offsets: the impact of a carbon tax on the voluntary action  ap. 1617-1634.  aAs Australia recently introduced a mandatory carbon price, this paper provides a rare perspective of how such institutional changes influence consumer preferences for voluntary climate action. When examined using three contingent valuation questions, the results show that the compliance mechanism induces a substantial reduction in the number of air travellers who are willing to pay extra for voluntary carbon offsets and in the payment amount, although the crowding-out effect is incomplete. A disproportionately larger welfare benefit is attached to the carbon offsets for a domestic flight than its international counterpart. Overall empirical findings advocate the continued role of voluntary programmes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaviation 3acarbon markets 3aclimate 3acompliance 3aconsumer preferences 3acontingent valuation 3awillingness to pay 3aAustralia 0avoluntary carbon offsets 0acarbon tax 0acontingent valuation 0aair travel 0awillingness to pay0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2015 Sept. 2, v. 58, no. 9 p.1617-1634dRoutledgex1360-05597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2014.9405153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011700171300001500288520168300303592002801986650001602014650001602030650001002046650003302056650001202089650000902101650001402110650001402124653002302138653002002161653001202181653001602193653002702209653001402236700002002250700001802270773015402288856008302442852000902525655001202534IND60114183520221118233815.0190401e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011418352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2013.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabineau, Marielle10aPhylogenetic utility of 19 low copy nuclear genes in closely related genera and species of caesalpinioid legumes  ap. 94-105.  aNumerous studies have identified low copy nuclear genes (LCNG) with phylogenetic potential throughout angiosperms, several specifically focused on Leguminosae. However, phylogenetic resolution at the species- to subspecies-level is often inferred based only on a small subset of taxa scattered throughout the higher level study group. This study aims to reassess the phylogenetic resolution of 19 previously published nuclear regions in Leguminosae using 18 species from two clades of the Caesalpinieae representing both distantly related genera and closely related species. Nuclear regions were amplified and aligned throughout the sampled taxa. Sequences were cloned when polymorphism was noted. The plastid loci matK, rps16, trnL, trnD–trnT and the nuclear ribosomal ITS regions were also analyzed for comparison. Phylogenetic analyses using parsimony were performed on individual matrices. Three nuclear regions were eliminated due to the non-specificity of the primers (RNAH, PTSB, GI). Four regions showed lower resolution than predicted from previous studies (MMK1, CYB6, RBPCO, EFGC), while three revealed greater resolution than anticipated (SQD1, AT103, EIF3E). Three other markers indicated previously unidentified duplication events for the genus Caesalpinia s.l. (ATCP and AROB) and at the base of the Caesalpinia and Peltophorum clades (CALTL). Phylogenies reconstructed from the intron-spanning regions AIGP, SHMT, AT103 and EIF3E are congruent with ITS and plastid data and show the best phylogenetic potential for studies of closely related species of caesalpinioid legumes. We present a screening strategy for the evaluation of LCNG for phylogenetic studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaesalpinia 3aPeltophorum 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alegumes 3aloci 3aphylogeny 3ascreening 0aCaesalpineae clade 0aCaesalpinia s.l 0aDelonix 0aDuplication 0aLow copy nuclear genes 0aPhylogeny1 aGagnon, Edeline1 aBruneau, Anne0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2013 Nov., v. 89 p.94-105dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2013.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01126naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002800138245007100166300001800237520022000255592002800475650002300503650002300526650001100549700002100560700001900581700002700600773012800627856007200755852000900827655001200836IND60657806820221117171527.0190816e20060516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065780682DNAL7 a10.1039/b602116f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJemmis, Eluvathingal D.10aBond length and bond multiplicity: σ-bond prevents short π-bonds  ap. 2164-2166.  aAnalysis of model compounds such as Fe₂(CO)₆, C₂ and HBBH shows that π-bonds left to themselves are shorter than σ-bonds; in many ways σ-bonds prevent π-bonds from adopting their optimal shorter distances.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3amodels1 aPathak, Biswarup1 aKing, R.

Mandible prototypes were produced with 10 oblique ventrorostral fractures (favorable) and 10 oblique ventrocaudal fractures (unfavorable). Three groups were established for each fracture type. Osteosynthesis with a pure titanium plate of double-arch geometry and blocked monocortical screws of free angulation were used. The mechanical resistance of the prototype with unfavorable fracture was lower than that of the favorable fracture. In both fractures, the deflection increased and the relative stiffness decreased proportionally to the diminishing screw number. The finite element analysis validated this plate study, since the maximum tension concentration observed on the plate was lower than the resistance limit tension admitted by the titanium. In conclusion, the double-arch geometry plate fixed with blocked monocortical screws has sufficient resistance to stabilize oblique fractures, without compromising mandibular dental or neurovascular structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomechanics 3abone fractures 3adogs 3afinite element analysis 3afracture fixation 3ageometry 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3aprototypes 3atitanium 3aveterinary dentistry1 aRahal, Sheila C.1 aGioso, Marco Antonio1 aVulcano, Luiz Carlos1 aShimano, Antonio Carlos1 aSilva, Jorge Vicente Lopes da,d1963-1 aNoritomi, Pedro Y.1 aWarrak, Alexander O.

The physiochemical properties and quality retention of coated tomato fruits were assessed for antioxidant properties (ABTS and DPPH), total phenolic content (TPC), enzyme activity (PPO), organoleptic properties, weight loss, firmness, and shelf-life of the fruits. Tomato fruits treated with Bee wax (BW) preserve the antioxidant activity, total phenolic content (TPC), organoleptic properties and resisted enzymes activities compared to the SB and CS. The results also suggest that bee wax (BW) treatment delayed ripening, weight loss, firmness, and extended the storage life of fruits compared to the SB and CS. Taking into consideration of the above physical and chemical properties, BW treatment will be a good postharvest technology for retaining the quality and extending the shelf life of fresh tomato fruits. The current findings will make available more information for selecting edible coatings for tomato storage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 0aOrganoleptic properties 0aBioactive compounds 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aEdible coating, shelf-life 0aTomato fruit1 aApaliya, Maurice Tibiru1 aAlolga, Raphael N.1 aKwaw, Emmanuel1 aOtu, Phyllis Naa Yarley1 aAkaba, Selorm0 tApplied food research.g2022 June, v. 2, no. 1 p.100041-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:28538x2772-50227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.afres.2022.1000413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245023800188300001800426520083900444592002801283650001501311650001801326650002101344650001201365650001801377650000901395650001101404650003701415650001201452650002801464650002701492650005001519650006401569650001101633650003201644650007301676650002701749650000901776650007201785650007201857650003601929700002101965700002201986700002402008700001902032700002202051700001802073700002002091700001802111700002502129700001802154700003002172700002502202700001902227700002002246700002202266700002002288773011002308856008102418990002302499852000902522655001202531IND60090744720221120065648.0141102e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009074472DNAL7 a230628242pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2012.09.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFushimi, Nobuhiko10aStructure–activity relationship studies of 4-benzyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl β-d-glucopyranoside derivatives as potent and selective sodium glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1) inhibitors with therapeutic activity on postprandial hyperglycemia  ap. 6598-6612.  aSodium glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1) plays a dominant role in the absorption of glucose in the gut and is considered a promising target in the development of treatments for postprandial hyperglycemia.

By altering the substitution groups at the 5-position of the pyrazole ring, and every position of the phenyl ring, we studied the structure–activity relationship (SAR) profiles and identified a series of potent and selective SGLT1 inhibitors.

The use of environmental indicators to measure process efficiency can help to reduce the impact and pollution generated in manufacturing processes.This article features a case study that analyzes the influence of the main operating parameters of the paper production process (specifically the drying section) in CO2 emissions. The plant was selected on the basis of its current low levels of CO2 emissions, which are lower than established by the European Commission product benchmark for the type of paper produced. Based on the information gathered by factory quality control system, a general linear regression and an experiment were designed (orthogonal arrays of Taguchi). Through a multi-factorial analysis of variance for the indicator ‘ton CO2/ton Paper’ the study reveals that the surface density and outside temperature have significant influence on the process and on CO2 emissions and can be set a value to minimize CO2 emissions and maximize production in the facility bottleneck. Thus, CO2 emissions can be a good indicator of the operating status of the drying section. The study identified new lines of study, with which can be achieved the overall target of reducing energy consumption and CO2 air pollution associated with paper manufacturing process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aanalysis of variance 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3adrying 3aenergy 3aenvironmental indicators 3aenvironmental protection 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alinear models 3amanufacturing 3apaper 3apapermaking 3aquality control 3atemperature 0aIndustrial process 0aCO2 emission 0aIndicator 0aPapermaking 0aDrying section 0aANOVA1 aDomingo, Rosario0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2015 June 01, v. 96 p.253-262dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03759naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013100171300001600302520205800318592002802376650001602404650001202420650001902432650001302451650001702464650001802481650001302499650001102512650002502523650002402548650002202572650002602594650001902620650003302639650002302672653002102695653002902716653002302745653002002768653002502788700006002813700006002873700002202933700002202955700005802977773011103035856008603146852000903232655001203241IND60587074620221121031629.0190410e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058707462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2017.11.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRicci, Annalisa10aVolatile profile of elderberry juice: Effect of lactic acid fermentation using L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. casei strains  ap. 412-422.  aIn this study we explored, for the first time, the lactic acid fermentation of elderberry juice (EJ). A total of 15 strains isolated from dairy and plant matrices, belonging to L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. casei, were used for fermentations. The volatile profile of started and unstarted EJ was characterized by HS-SPME/GC-MS technique after 48h of fermentation and 12days of storage at 4°C. All L. plantarum and L. rhamnosus strains exhibited a good capacity of growth while not all L. casei strains showed the same ability. The aromatic profile of fermented juices was characterized by the presence of 82 volatile compounds pertaining to different classes: alcohols, terpenes and norisoprenoids, organic acids, ketones and esters. Elderberry juice fermented with L. plantarum strains showed an increase of total volatile compounds after 48h while the juices fermented with L. rhamnosus and L. casei exhibited a larger increase after the storage. The highest concentration of total volatile compounds were observed in EJ fermented with L. plantarum 285 isolated from dairy product. Ketones increased in all fermented juices both after fermentation and storage and the most concentrated were acetoin and diacetyl. The organic acids were also affected by lactic acid fermentation and the most abundant acids detected in fermented juices were acetic acid and isovaleric acid. Hexanol, 3-hexen-1-ol (Z) and 2-hexen-1-ol (E) were positively influenced during dairy lactic acid bacteria strains fermentation. The most represented esters were ethyl acetate, methyl isovalerate, isoamyl isovalerate and methyl salicylate, all correlated with fruit notes. Among terpenes and norisoprenoids, β-damascenone resulted the main representative with its typical note of elderberry. Furthermore, coupling obtained data with multivariate statistical analyses, as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Classification Trees (CT), it was possible to relate the characteristic volatile profile of samples with the different species and strains applied in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aacetoin 3adairy products 3adiacetyl 3aelderberries 3aethyl acetate 3ahexanols 3ajuices 3alactic acid bacteria 3alactic fermentation 3amethyl salicylate 3amultivariate analysis 3anorisoprenoids 3aprincipal component analysis 3avolatile compounds 0aElderberry juice 0aLactic acid fermentation 0aVolatile compounds 0aHS-SPME/GC–MS 0aStatistical analysis1 aCirlini, Martina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6485-75891 aLevante, Alessia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1985-28631 aDall'Asta, Chiara1 aGalaverna, Gianni1 aLazzi, Camilla1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5759-51540 tFood research international.g2018 Mar., v. 105 p.412-422dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.11.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100002400189245011200213300001600325506007600341520091500417592002801332506003701360650001501397650001101412650001601423650001001439650002301449650002101472650005501493650003701548650002401585650001101609650001101620650000901631650002501640650001601665650001901681650003101700700002101731700001801752700002601770700001301796700002101809773011201830856008201942961001302024852000902037655001202046IND50060193920221207124647.0141110e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006019392DNAL7 a227279392pmid7 aPMC37644792pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2011.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicklas, Theresa A.10aValidity and Feasibility of a Digital Diet Estimation Method for Use with Preschool Children: A Pilot Study  ap. 618-623.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to assess the validity and feasibility of a digital diet estimation method for use with preschool children in Head Start. METHODS: Preschool children and their caregivers participated in validation (n = 22) and feasibility (n = 24) pilot studies. Validity was determined in the metabolic research unit using actual gram weight measurements as the reference method. Feasibility of using the digital diet estimation method was determined in Head Start and in the home by assessing 3 separate lunch and dinner meals. RESULTS: The average correlation between estimated weights and actual weights was 0.96 (P < .001), and the average mean difference was 10.6 g. The digital diet estimates were 5% lower than the actual weights. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The digital diet estimation method may be a valid and feasible method for assessing food intake of preschool children.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acaregivers 3adinner 3afood intake 3alunch 3apreschool children 2aChild, Preschool 2aDiet Surveysxinstrumentationxmethodsxstandards. 2aEarly Intervention, Educational. 2aFeasibility Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNutrition Assessment 2aPhotography 2aPilot Projects 2aReproducibility of Results1 aO'Neil, Carol E.1 aStuff, Janice1 aGoodell, Lora Suzanne1 aLiu, Yan1 aMartin, Corby K.0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2012 , v. 44, no. 6 p.618-623dElsevier Inc.x1499-40467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2011.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03626naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245006700171300001400238520219000252592002802442650002502470650000902495650001602504650001102520650002002531650002902551650001902580650000902599650002602608650001102634650001102645650002602656650001302682650001402695650000902709653001302718653002602731653002202757653002002779653002002799700001502819700001602834700002502850700001602875700002202891773009902913856008703012852000903099655001203108IND60546636220221118020555.0161027e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054663622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRigamonti, L.10aEnvironmental evaluation of plastic waste management scenarios  ap. 42-53.  aThe management of the plastic fraction is one of the most debated issues in the discussion on integrated municipal solid waste systems. Both material and energy recovery can be performed on such a waste stream, and different separate collection schemes can be implemented. The aim of the paper is to contribute to the debate, based on the analysis of different plastic waste recovery routes. Five scenarios were defined and modelled with a life cycle assessment approach using the EASEWASTE model. In the baseline scenario (P0) the plastic is treated as residual waste and routed partly to incineration with energy recovery and partly to mechanical biological treatment. A range of potential improvements in plastic management is introduced in the other four scenarios (P1–P4). P1 includes a source separation of clean plastic fractions for material recycling, whereas P2 a source separation of mixed plastic fraction for mechanical upgrading and separation into specific polymer types, with the residual plastic fraction being down-cycled and used for “wood items”. In P3 a mixed plastic fraction is source separated together with metals in a “dry bin”. In P4 plastic is mechanically separated from residual waste prior to incineration.A sensitivity analysis on the marginal energy was carried out. Scenarios were modelled as a first step assuming that marginal electricity and heat were based on coal and on a mix of fuels and then, in the sensitivity analysis, the marginal energy was based on natural gas.The study confirmed the difficulty to clearly identify an optimal strategy for plastic waste management. In fact none of the examined scenarios emerged univocally as the best option for all impact categories. When moving from the P0 treatment strategy to the other scenarios, substantial improvements can be obtained for “Global Warming”. For the other impact categories, results are affected by the assumption about the substituted marginal energy. Nevertheless, irrespective of the assumptions on marginal energy, scenario P4, which implies the highest quantities of specific polymer types sent to recycling, resulted the best option in most impact categories.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological treatment 3acoal 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3aenvironmental assessment 3aglobal warming 3aheat 3alife cycle assessment 3ametals 3amodels 3amunicipal solid waste 3aplastics 3arecycling 3awood 0aPlastics 0aLife cycle assessment 0aMaterial recovery 0aEnergy recovery 0aMunicipal waste1 aGrosso, M.1 aMøller, J.1 aMartinez Sanchez, V.1 aMagnani, S.1 aChristensen, T.H.0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2014 Apr., v. 85 p.42-53dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04153naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015000166300001600316520207000332592002802402650004402430650001502474650001202489650001302501650001202514650001902526650002602545650002002571650002602591650001102617650001302628650000902641650001302650650001302663650002002676650001802696650003102714650001502745650002202760650001902782650001802801650001402819650001502833650003302848650001702881650001602898650001102914650001102925653002202936653001402958653002002972653004102992653001803033653002603051700001703077700005703094700002403151700001703175700003003192700001603222773012503238856008303363852000903446655001203455IND60613163620221118033508.0181025e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061316362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2018.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbas, Qumber10aContrasting effects of operating conditions and biomass particle size on bulk characteristics and surface chemistry of rice husk derived-biochars  ap. 281-292.  aIn this study, the slow pyrolysis of rice husk was conducted by using a split-tube furnace under a nitrogen environment to investigate the influence of various pyrolysis conditions and biomass particle sizes on products yield distribution as well as physicochemical characteristics and surface chemistry of produced biochars. Results revealed that temperature has a more pronounced influence on products yield compared to the other operational conditions. The biochar yield decreases from 57.13 ± 5.37% to 37.19 ± 2.05% and gaseous phase yield increase from 25.64 ± 0.93% to 42.50 ± 4.58% with temperature increase from 300 °C to 700 °C. The surface chemistry of produced biochar varies widely as the distribution of different functional groups on its surface influenced by operational conditions and biomass particle size; above 500 °C the intensity of FTIR vibrational peaks reduces abruptly. FTIR, SEM, elemental composition and surface area results indicate that biochar synthesized under higher pyrolysis temperature, extended retention time and, lower heating and gas flow rates with fine biomass particle size has utility as a potential C-sequestration and remedial agent to mitigate global climate change and adsorption of environmental pollutants, respectively. Furthermore, biochar has potential application as a renewable solid bio-fuel source due to higher calorific values. A cost-benefit analysis indicates that the viability of biochar saleable product system is more economical with an annual profit of 138,533$ for the low scenario, when the presumed unit processes 2500 tons y⁻¹ of biomass. In a comparison to other presumed scenarios, this system is more feasible in areas where low-cost RH biomass waste is available abundantly such as in rice production and processing areas. The profitability of this system increases further by accounting pyrolysis-gas energy value that reduces operational cost. For the optimization of biochar economical yield with desired properties, this work provides insight knowledge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3acost benefit analysis 3acrop production 3aelemental composition 3aenergy 3afurnaces 3aheat 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3aoperating costs 3aparticle size 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollutants 3apollution control 3aproduct system 3aprofitability 3apyrolysis 3arice hulls 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3atemperature 3awastes 3ayields 0aSurface chemistry 0aRice husk 0aPyrolysis yield 0aBiochar/black carbon characteristics 0aParticle size 0aCost-benefit analysis1 aLiu, Guijian1 aYousaf, Balal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2732-21761 aAli, Muhammad Ubaid1 aUllah, Habib1 aMunir, Mehr Ahmed Mujtaba1 aLiu, Ruijia0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2018 Sept., v. 134 p.281-292dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2018.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245016400164300001600328520132100344592002801665650000901693650001301702650002001715650002401735650001801759650001501777650002401792650002501816650001201841650001401853650004301867650001501910650000901925650002401934650001001958651001001968700001901978700001701997700001602014700001902030700001802049700001802067700001702085700001502102700001602117700001102133700001802144700001402162700001202176700001802188700001102206700001502217700002302232773011902255856008502374990002302459852000902482655001202491IND60094918020221121051241.0141104e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009491802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diabres.2012.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Gang10aTianjin Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Prevention Program: Study design, methods, and 1-year interim report on the feasibility of lifestyle intervention program  ap. 508-517.  aOBJECTIVE: To assess whether lifestyle intervention can reduce type 2 diabetes risk in women with prior GDM in the Tianjin Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) Prevention Program. METHODS: 1180 women who were diagnosed with GDM from 2005 to 2009 were randomly assigned to either a lifestyle intervention (n=586) or a control group (n=594). Major elements of the intervention include six face-to-face meetings with study dietitians in the first year, and two additional sessions and two telephone calls in second year. RESULTS: During the first year, average body weight loss in the first 404 subjects was 1.40kg (2.1%) in the intervention group vs 0.21kg (0.3%) in the control group (P=0.001), and the decrease was more significant among baseline overweight women (body bass index [BMI]≥24kg/m²) in the intervention (2.91kg/4.2%) compared with that in the control group (0.51kg/0.7%) (P<0.001). In addition, women in the intervention group, compared with those in the control group, have decreased BMI, body fat, waist circumference, and plasma insulin levels, and have improved behaviors including increased leisure time activity and dietary fiber intake and decreased sedentary time and fat consumptions. CONCLUSION: The interim results support the efficacy and feasibility of the lifestyle intervention program.  aPublisher supplied data 3abass 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3abody weight changes 3adietary fiber 3adietitians 3aexperimental design 3agestational diabetes 3ainsulin 3alifestyle 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoverweight 3arisk 3awaist circumference 3awomen 3aChina1 aTian, Huiguang1 aZhang, Fuxia1 aLiu, Huikun1 aZhang, Cuiping1 aZhang, Shuang1 aWang, Leishen1 aLiu, Gongshu1 aYu, Zhijie1 aYang, Xilin1 aQi, Lu1 aZhang, Cuilin1 aWang, Hua1 aLi, Min1 aLeng, Junhong1 aLi, Yi1 aDong, Ling1 aTuomilehto, Jaakko0 tDiabetes research and clinical practice.g2012 Dec., v. 98, no. 3 p.508-517dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0168-82277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2012.09.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01617naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008000168300001600248520072300264592002800987650002501015650001201040650001601052650001201068650001701080650002501097773011401122856008201236852000901318655001201327IND60623729020221119055100.0181127e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062372902DNAL7 a10.1177/0898756410027004042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Tammy L.10aLip Avulsion and Mandibular Symphyseal Separation Repair in an Immature Cat  ap. 228-233.  aA 12-week-old kitten was presented for symphyseal separation, comminuted rostral fractures of the mandibles, avulsion of the mandibular lip, and fractured teeth.

In the present study, two commercially sold strains of ‘G. lucidum’, M9720 and M9724 from the company Mycelia bvba (Belgium), are compared for their fruiting body (basidiocarp) morphology combined with molecular phylogenetic analyses, and for their secondary metabolite profile employing an ultra-performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (UPLC–ESIMS) in combination with a high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS). According to basidiocarp morphology, the strain M9720 was identified as G. lucidum s.str. whereas M9724 was determined as Ganoderma lingzhi. In molecular phylogenetic analyses, the M9720 ITS and beta-tubulin sequences grouped with sequences of G. lucidum s.str. from Europe whereas those from M9724 clustered with sequences of G. lingzhi from East Asia. We show that an ethanol extract of ground basidiocarps from G. lucidum (M9720) contains much less triterpenic acids than found in the extract of G. lingzhi (M9724). The high amount of triterpenic acids accounts for the bitter taste of the basidiocarps of G. lingzhi (M9724) and of its ethanol extract. Apparently, triterpenic acids of G. lucidum s.str. are analyzed here for the first time. These results demonstrate the importance of taxonomy for commercial use of fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGanoderma lucidum 3aacids 3abasidiomata 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aethanol 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aionization 3amushrooms 3amycelium 3aphylogeny 3asecondary metabolites 3ataste 3ataxonomy 3atraditional medicine 3atubulin 3aBelgium 3aChina 0aGanoderma lucidum 0aGanoderma lingzhi 0aGanodermataceae 0aPolyporales 0aFungi 0aLing-zhi 0aLingzhi 0aReishi 0aTriterpenic acids 0aGanoderic acids1 aCheikh-Ali, Zakaria1 aLiebisch, Tim1 aMaciá-Vicente, Jose G.1 aBode, Helge B.1 aPiepenbring, Meike1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7174-72700 tPhytochemistry.g2016 July, v. 127 p.29-37dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2016.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245012600167300001600293520137200309592002801681650001701709650001601726650000901742650001401751650002401765653001401789653002001803653002701823653002901850653002301879653001401902700002901916700002301945700002401968700002301992773011002015856007902125852000902204655001202213IND60762483420221119052932.0220126e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076248342DNAL7 a10.2478/aopf-2021-00142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRożyński, Maciej10aEffects of functional feeds on hematological and biochemical indicators of juvenile sea trout (Salmo trutta m. trutta L.)  ap. 124-134.  aThe effects functional additives had on blood hematological and biochemical indicators of sea trout (body weight 74.6 g, standard length 17.2 cm) were studied. The fish were divided into four experimental groups. Two groups were fed experimental feeds (group TU basic feed; group TUB basic feed with Bioimmuno), and two groups were fed commercial feeds (group TB commercial feed; group TBF commercial feed with FOCUS Plus®). After 14 and 28 days of rearing (the end of the experiment) specimens were measured and blood was drawn from seven fish from each group for hematological and biochemical tests. No effects were confirmed on rearing parameters. After 14 days of rearing, decreased values of WBC, RBC, HGB, and HCT were noted in groups TU and TB, while after 28 days lower values of RBC and HCT persisted in these groups. Lower values of these parameters were also noted in group TUB. Increased ALP activity was noted in group TUB after 14 days, while in groups TU and TUB increased levels of TP and ALB were noted after 28 days. A significant increase in ALB was also noted in group TBF. The functional feeds positively affected the physiological state of the sea trout. The results indicated that it is necessary to conduct studies to determine the optimal dose of Bioimmuno for juvenile sea trout and the period during which functional feeds should be given.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo trutta 3abody weight 3afish 3ajuveniles 3aphysiological state 0aβ-glucan 0afunctional feed 0abiochemical indicators 0ahematological indicators 0arearing indicators 0asea trout1 aDemska-Zakęś, Krystyna1 aRożyński, Rafał1 aFormicki, Krzysztof1 aZakęś, Zdzisław0 tFisheries & Aquatic Life.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 29, no. 3 p.124-134dSciendowJournal:27109x2545-059X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aopf-2021-00143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012300166300001600289520121800305592002801523650002101551650002501572650001901597650001101616650001201627650002001639650002601659650001601685650001401701650002201715650001801737650001301755650001401768650001601782650001201798650001801810650002201828650000901850650001101859653001601870653001501886653002901901653001101930653001701941700002201958700002101980700001502001700001602016773009902032856008502131852000902216655001202225IND60340626020221118152907.0150803e20150818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034062602DNAL7 a10.1080/02757540.2015.10395262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Ajoy10aBehaviour of pendimethalin and oxyfluorfen in peanut field soil: effects on soil biological and biochemical activities  ap. 550-566.  aA field experiment was conducted to study the dissipation kinetics of herbicides pendimethalin and oxyfluorfen in black soil of peanut field at half recommended rate (HRE), recommended rate and double recommended rate as well as to assess their effects on soil microbial parameters and enzymatic activities. In addition, their role in the transformations and availability of some plant nutrients like nitrogen transformation (through ammonification and nitrification processes) and availability of phosphorous were also studied. Incorporation of these herbicides was found to stimulate the activity of soil microbial biomass carbon, fluorescein diacetate hydrolysing activity, alkaline phosphatase and ammonification rates, while dehydrogenase activity, acid phosphatase, nitrification rate and available phosphorous was adversely affected. However, urease remains almost unchanged except for little stimulation at later stages. Dissipation of pendimethalin and oxyﬂuorfen followed first-order reaction kinetics with half-life (T ₁/₂) of 13.7–20.1 and 21.5–27.4 days, respectively. Residues of both herbicides persisted up to 60 days in the soil at all the doses except 45 days for pendimethalin at HRE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aammonification 3acarbon 3aecology 3aenzyme activity 3afield experimentation 3afluorescein 3ahalf life 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aoxyfluorfen 3apeanuts 3apendimethalin 3areaction kinetics 3asoil 3aurease 0adissipation 0aherbicides 0amicrobial biomass carbon 0apeanut 0asoil enzymes1 aBhaduri, Debarati1 aPipariya, Ashvin1 aJain, N.K.1 aBasak, B.B.0 tChemistry in ecology.g2015 Aug. 18, v. 31, no. 6 p.550-566dTaylor & Francisx1029-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2015.10395263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013000171300001800301520166100319592002801980650002502008650001502033650001502048650001002063650001602073650002002089650002202109650003802131650004302169650001402212650001102226650001802237650002102255650001302276700001902289700002202308700005802330700002302388700005702411773012802468856008502596852000902681655001202690IND60768014720221119180505.0220222e20220210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076801472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c055322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAubret, Mathilde10aDevelopment of an Innovative Quantification Assay Based on Aptamer Sandwich and Isothermal Dumbbell Exponential Amplification  ap. 3376-3385.  aDetecting blood biomarkers such as proteins with high sensitivity and specificity is of the utmost importance for early and reliable disease diagnosis. As molecular probes, aptamers are raising increasing interest for biosensor applications as an alternative to antibodies, which are used in classical enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assays (ELISA). We have developed a sensitive and antibody-free molecular quantification assay that combines the specificity of aptamers and the sensitivity of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). For the proof-of-concept, we consider two types of biomarkers: (i) a model of oligonucleotide mimicking nucleic acid targets and (ii) the thrombin involved in the complex coagulation cascade as a model protein for which two relevant aptamers form a stable sandwich. The assay protocol is based on a few successive steps, similar to sandwich ELISA. First, aptamer-coated magnetic beads are added to the sample to specifically capture the targets. Then, the sandwich complex is formed by adding the second aptamer. This secondary aptamer is integrated in a larger oligonucleotide dumbbell sequence designed for LAMP detection using only two primers. After a proper rinsing step, the isothermal dumbbell exponential amplification is performed to detect and quantify a low amount of targets (limit of detection ∼ 1 pM for the oligonucleotide and ∼100 pM for thrombin). This study demonstrates that our innovative aptamero-LAMP assay could be relevant for the detection of different types of biomarkers and their quantification at physiological levels. This may also pave the way for antibody-free molecular assays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3ablood 3acoagulation 3adetection limit 3adisease diagnosis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3amagnetism 3amodels 3anucleic acids 3aoligonucleotides 3athrombin1 aSavonnet, Maud1 aLaurent, Patricia1 aRoupioz, Yoann1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1790-81411 aCubizolles, Myriam1 aBuhot, Arnaud1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7643-43050 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Feb. 10, v. 94, no. 7 p.3376-3385dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c055323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01559naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012800173300001600301520037400317592002800691650001600719650001400735650001300749650002200762650002200784700002200806700001800828700002100846700002200867700002400889700001800913700001800931773011900949856008501068990002301153852000901176655001201185IND60094918420221121051312.0141104e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009491842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diabres.2012.09.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakabe, Michinori10aC-peptide response to glucagon challenge is correlated with improvement of early insulin secretion by liraglutide treatment  ap. e32-e35.  aThe amelioration of glucose tolerance by liraglutide was associated with a significant improvement of early insulin-response during OGTT.

However, the mechanisms linking inhaled particulates with systemic vascular effects, resulting in worsened atherosclerosis, are not well defined. We assessed the potential role of macrophages in translating these effects by analyzing gene expression patterns in response to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) at the average cell level, using Affymetrix microarrays in peritoneal macrophages in culture (in vitro), and at the individual cell level, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in alveolar macrophages collected from exposed mice (in vivo). Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from C57BL/6J mice and treated with 25 μg/mL of a DEP methanol extract (DEPe). These cells exhibited significant (FDR < 0.05) differential expression of a large number of genes and enrichment in pathways, especially engaged in immune responses and antioxidant defense. DEPe led to marked upregulation of heme oxygenase 1 (Hmox1), the most significantly upregulated gene (FDR = 1.75E-06), and several other antioxidant genes. For the in vivo work, C57BL/6J mice were subjected to oropharyngeal aspiration of 200 μg of whole DEP. The gene expression profiles of the alveolar macrophages harvested from these mice were analyzed at the single-cell level using scRNA-seq, which showed significant dysregulation of a broad number of genes enriched in immune system pathways as well, but with a large heterogeneity in how individual alveolar macrophages responded to DEP exposures. Altogether, DEP pollutants dysregulated immunological pathways in macrophages that may mediate the development of pulmonary and systemic vascular effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant genes 3aatherosclerosis 3aetiology 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3aimmune response 3amacrophages 3amethanol 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3asequence analysis 3atranslation (genetics) 0aMacrophages 0aAir pollution 0aDiesel exhaust particles 0aOxidative stress 0aHeme oxygenase1 aOrozco, Luz D.1 aHong, Jason1 aDiamante, Graciel1 aMajid, Sana1 aBennett, Brian J.1 aAhn, In Sook1 aYang, Xia1 aLusis, Aldons J.1 aAraujo, Jesus A.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2019 Dec. 15, v. 678 p.108116-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2019.1081163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245016300169300001400332520120700346592002801553650002001581650000801601650001401609650001901623650001601642650001401658650001101672650003101683650001701714650002001731650001601751650001701767650002001784650002401804650001501828653002201843653002101865653002301886653002201909653001001931700002401941700002001965700002601985700002302011700002102034773009602055856008502151852000902236655001202245IND60546859320221119213843.0160903e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054685932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Sanjid13aAn experimental investigation of biodiesel production, characterization, engine performance, emission and noise of Brassica juncea methyl ester and its blends  ap. 74-81.  aDiminishing fossil fuel reserves and environmental concerns have stimulated research into biofuels as potential renewable and sustainable replacements for fossil diesel. The present research aimed to investigate the feasibility of using mustard biodiesel blends for energy generation in order to reduce air and noise pollution. Mustard biodiesel (MB) was produced from waste mustard oil and the physicochemical properties were investigated. MB showed a superior calorific value (40.40 MJ/kg), oxidation stability (16 h), cloud point (5 °C) and pour point (−18 °C) than any other conventional biodiesel. During engine performance tests, 10% and 20% MB blends showed 8–13% higher brake specific fuel consumption and 7–8% less brake power compared to diesel fuel. Engine emissions and noise tests showed 9–12% higher NO, 24–42% lower HC, 19–40% lower CO and 2–7% lower noise emission for MB blends compared to diesel fuel. Additionally, comparable engine performance and emission characteristics were found for 10% and 20% MB blends compared to same percentages of palm biodiesels, respectively. In conclusion, 10% and 20% MB blends can be used in diesel engines without modifications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aair 3abiodiesel 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3afossil fuels 3afuel production 3amustard oil 3anitric oxide 3anoise pollution 3aoxidative stability 3apour point 0aMustard biodiesel 0aCharacterization 0aEngine performance 0aEmission analysis 0aNoise1 aHassan, Masjuki Hj.1 aKalam, Md.

Specific findings pertain to the estimation of postnatal age at tooth emergence through the gingiva and to the age when a particular tooth is in functional occlusion. Fifty newborn degu pups were included in this study. The oral cavity endoscopy was carried out under isoflurane anesthesia in all animals 3 to 4 and 24-hours after birth, then at 1-day intervals until the age of 40-days, and subsequently at 2-day intervals until 75-days of age. Tooth emergence was considered to have occurred when any portion of the crown had penetrated the gingiva. The stage when the teeth come into occlusion was defined as the functional occlusion. The degus were born with completely erupted permanent incisors that were already in functional occlusion. All the premolar teeth and all the first molar teeth erupted on days 2–3 and 4–5 of life, respectively. The first signs of functional occlusion of all the first 2 cheek teeth were observed on days 9–11. Maxillary and mandibular second molar teeth emerged between days 17–19 and 18–20, respectively. First signs of functional occlusion were observed on days 30–31 and 31–33 for maxillary and mandibular second molar teeth, respectively. Maxillary third molar teeth emerged on days 38–44 and erupted into occlusion on days 48–58. Mandibular third molar teeth emerged on days 39–46 and erupted into occlusion on days 58–72.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOctodon degus 3aanesthesia 3aendoscopy 3agingiva 3aisoflurane 3aneonates 3apups 3ateeth 3aveterinary dentistry1 aHauptman, Karel1 aJeklova, Edita1 aKnotek, Zdenek0 tJournal of veterinary dentistry.g, v. 28, no. 1 p.16-20dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26868x2470-40837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0898756411028001033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011700169300001800286520155000304592002801854650001701882650001201899650001601911650001001927650000901937650001401946650001201960650001001972650001501982650001001997650002102007650001902028650001302047650002402060650001602084700001802100700001902118773009702137856004802234852000902282655001202291IND50070533820221122182241.0131109e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007053382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-013-9647-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTigreros, Natasha10aSex-specific response to nutrient limitation and its effects on female mating success in a gift-giving butterfly  ap. 1145-1158.  aAnimals with complex life cycles respond to early food limitation by altering the way resources are allocated in the adult stage. Response to food limitation should differ between males and females, especially in organisms whose mating systems include nutritional nuptial gifts. In these organisms, males are predicted to keep their allocation to reproduction (sperm and nuptial gift production) constant, while females are predicted to sacrifice allocation to reproduction (egg production) since they can compensate by acquiring nuptial gifts when mating. In this study, we investigated how dietary nitrogen limitation during the larval stage affects sex-specific resource allocation in Pieris rapae butterflies. Also, we tested whether nutrient-limited females increased nuptial gift acquisition as a way to compensate for low allocation to reproduction. We found that as predicted females, but not males, sacrifice allocation to reproduction when larval dietary nitrogen is limited. However, females were unable to compensate for this low reproductive allocation by increasing their mating rate to acquire additional gifts. Females reared on low nitrogen diets also reduced wing coloration, a potential signal of female fecundity status. We suggest that female mating frequency is constrained by male mate choice based on females’ wing coloration. This study provides new insights into how larval dietary nitrogen, a key nutritional resource for all herbivores, alters male and female allocation to reproduction as well as to ornamentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPieris rapae 3aanimals 3abutterflies 3acolor 3adiet 3afecundity 3afemales 3afoods 3aherbivores 3amales 3amating frequency 3amating systems 3anitrogen 3aresource allocation 3aspermatozoa1 aSass, Emma M.1 aLewis, Sara M.0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2013 Nov., v. 27, no. 6 p.1145-1158dSpringer-Verlagx0269-76537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-013-9647-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008300163300001100246520241300257592002802670596006302698650001902761650001402780650002502794650000902819650001902828700001802847700005902865773012702924856008303051852000903134655001203143IND60753976620221118070954.0220415e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075397662DNAL7 a10.1186/s13006-021-00426-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaes, Line10aExploring women’s perceptions of pain when breastfeeding using online forums  ap. 84.  aBACKGROUND: Despite numerous benefits, many mothers stop breastfeeding soon after birth. A common reason for this is the experience of pain or discomfort. One resource which women use to share their breastfeeding challenges and seek support are online forums. This study aimed to collect data from online forums to explore 1) usage of forums as social support for breastfeeding-related pain; 2) experiences of breastfeeding-related pain; 3) perceptions and strategies to deal with breastfeeding-related pain; and 4) the impact of pain on breastfeeding duration. METHODS: Data was gathered through searches of online forums based in the UK and USA: Netmums, What to Expect and Mumsnet using key terms: ‘painful breastfeeding’ and ‘sore breastfeeding’. Data extraction took place in July 2018 and included posts made between 2012 and 2018. Data included 123 posts and 193 replies, analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The first theme identified was ‘variation in types of pain’, highlighting the variety of painful experiences and their descriptions. In particular, this theme reveals the large variety of different types of pain women experience at different stages throughout their breastfeeding journey, as well as the different pain characteristic they focus on in the description of their experience (i.e., location, sensory or physical aspects). Secondly, the theme ‘perceived causes and explanations for pain’ revealed how women interpret pain experiences either due to a recognised condition or behavioural cause. The third theme ‘cessation of breastfeeding related to pain’ identified. How women experience both physical and psychological struggles (e.g., guilt) related to breastfeeding cessation, with pain being a main factor in considering cessation of breastfeeding. Finally, the theme ‘shared experiences and support’ identified women’s strong need for both practical and emotional support to deal with pain. Many women look for this support through the knowledge exchange offered on the online forums. CONCLUSIONS: Pain was a key reason for breastfeeding cessation, commonly associated with strong feelings of guilt. The online forums provide a unique form of social support for breastfeeding women to find ways to cope with the pain, while highlighting the urgent need for more appropriate antenatal education on realistic expectation surrounding breastfeeding.  aPublisher supplied data  aVAC007877cCarnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland 3abreast feeding 3aeducation 3ainformation exchange 3apain 3asocial support1 aAbbott, Katie1 aCurrie, Sinéad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7565-40120 tInternational breastfeeding journal.g2021 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.84-84dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001833x1746-43587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13006-021-00426-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245009600207300001600303520168000319592002801999650002702027650001502054650001702069650001002086650001102096650002002107650003102127650001002158650002502168650001102193650004302204650001202247650001302259650002002272650004302292650001702335650001302352650001002365650001602375650001202391650002902403650001002432653001602442653002802458653002202486653001902508653001802527653002302545700002002568700001902588700002102607773011102628856008602739852000902825655001202834IND60587075120221121032610.0190410e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058707512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2017.11.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConde, Artur1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7102-669510aPostharvest dehydration induces variable changes in the primary metabolism of grape berries  ap. 261-270.  aPostharvest dehydration causes changes in texture, color, taste and nutritional value of food due to the high temperatures and long drying times required. In grape berries, a gradual dehydration process is normally utilized for raisin production and for making special wines. Here we applied a raisin industry-mimicking dehydration process for eleven days at 50°C to intact berry clusters from cv. Sémillon plants, and a set of molecular, cellular and biochemical analyses were performed to study the impact of postharvest dehydration in the primary metabolism. Transcriptional analyses by real time qPCR showed that several aquaporins (VvTIP1;2 and VvSIP1) and sugar transporters (VvHT1, VvSWEET11, VvSWEET15, VvTMT1, VvSUC12) genes were strongly upregulated. Moreover, the study of key enzymes of osmolytes metabolism, including mannitol dehydrogenase (VvMTD) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (VvSDH), at gene expression and protein activity level, together with the transcriptional analysis of the polyol transporter gene VvPLT1, showed an enhanced polyol biosynthesis capacity, which was supported by the detection of sorbitol in dehydrated grapes only. The metabolism of organic acids was also modulated, by the induction of transcriptional and biochemical activity modifications in malate dehydrogenases and malic enzymes that led to organic acid degradation, as demonstrated by HPLC analysis. Taken together, this study showed that primary metabolism of harvested berries was severely influenced in response to dehydration treatments towards lower organic acid and higher sorbitol concentrations, while sugar transporter and aquaporin genes were significantly upregulated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aL-iditol dehydrogenase 3aaquaporins 3abiosynthesis 3acolor 3adrying 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglucose transporters 3agrapes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amalates 3amannitol 3anutritive value 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asmall fruits 3asorbitol 3ataste 3atemperature 3atexture 3atranscription (genetics) 3awines 0aGrape berry 0aPostharvest dehydration 0aMetabolic changes 0aSugars/polyols 0aOrganic acids 0aPrimary metabolism1 aSoares, Flavio,1 aBreia, Richard1 aGerós, Hernâni0 tFood research international.g2018 Mar., v. 105 p.261-270dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.11.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245018000160300001600340520120900356592002801565650001701593650001401610650002201624650002101646650000901667650002501676650001701701650002401718650002401742650001801766650002401784650001101808651001001819653002201829653001101851653002701862653001001889700005701899773011001956856007902066852000902145655001202154IND60762483920221119052704.0220126e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076248392DNAL7 a10.2478/aopf-2021-00192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJan, Kousar10aComparative study of length-weight relationships and biological indices of Himalayan snow trout, Schizothorax labiatus, inhabiting two lotic water bodies in the Kashmir Valley  ap. 176-184.  aThe length-weight relationship (LWR) plays an important role in fishery management as it can be used to estimate the average weight of a specific length group. The results of the current study revealed that the mean values of regression coefficient b for both sexes of Schizothorax labiatus (McClelland) in the Jhelum River indicated positive allometric growth, while in the Sindh River, the b value for males indicated positive allometric growth and for females negative allometric growth. The value of coefficient of determination r² for both sexes of S. labiatus was equal to or greater than 0.90 in both water bodies, except for females in the Sindh River. Higher significant (P < 0.05) average values of Fulton’s condition factor (K) and the hepatosomatic index (HSI) for both sexes of S. labiatus were noted in the Jhelum River than in the Sindh River. In contrast, higher significant (P < 0.05) values of the gonadosomatic index (GSI) were recorded in the Sindh River. The data generated during the current study provide basic information for researchers and fish biologists for the conservation and sustainable management of this commercially important food fish species in the Kashmir Valley.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchizothorax 3aallometry 3acomparative study 3acondition factor 3afish 3afisheries management 3afood animals 3agonadosomatic index 3ahepatosomatic index 3alotic systems 3aregression analysis 3arivers 3aIndia 0aAllometric growth 0aJhelum 0aRegression coefficient 0aSindh1 aAhmed, Imtiaz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4821-17070 tFisheries & Aquatic Life.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 29, no. 3 p.176-184dSciendowJournal:27109x2545-059X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aopf-2021-00193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02072naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245006700167300001800234520085000252592002801102650001701130650001201147650002001159650001301179650002401192650001001216650003501226650002201261650000901283650001601292650001901308650002001327650002601347700001701373700001701390700001501407700001701422773011701439856008501556852000901641655001201650IND60114184420221118233535.0141112e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011418442DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-2780(11)60048-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWU, Hui-Min10aFunction of Gene OsASIE1 in Response to Abiotic Stress in Rice  ap. 1771-1778.  aAP2/EREBP transcription factors play an important role in plant development, hormone response, and responses to biotic and abiotic stress. OsASIE1, a member of the EREBP subfamily of AP2/EREBP transcription factors in rice (Oryza sativa L.), is determined to be involved in abiotic stress response. OsASIE1 expression was induced by drought and salt stresses. In addition, an electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that the AP2 domain of the OsASIE1 protein can bind to both DRE (dehydration-responsive element) and GCC box (ethylene response element, ERE) in vitro. All these results indicate that OsASIE1 may participate in abiotic stress response by regulating the expression of downstream genes with DRE and GCC box binding. Overexpression of OsASIE1 in transgenic rice plants might be used to improve tolerance to salt stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3adrought 3aelectrophoresis 3aethylene 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aplant development 3arice 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3astress response 3atranscription factors1 aHUANG, Li-Yu1 aPAN, Ya-Jiao1 aJin, Peng,1 aFU, Bin-Ying0 tActa agronomica sinica.g2011 Oct., v. 37, no. 10 p.1771-1778dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000136x1875-27807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-2780(11)60048-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006000144245012000204300001600324520073400340592002801074650002201102650002201124650001601146650002601162650002201188651001101210653000901221653001001230653000801240653001501248653001001263700005801273700002401331700006501355773011001420856007901530852000901609655001201618IND60762484020221119052442.0220126e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076248402DNAL7 a10.2478/aopf-2021-00202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapusta, Andrzej1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8979-546810aLength-weight relationship and morphometrics of Osmerus eperlanus populations from two lakes of northeastern Poland  ap. 185-188.  aThis study provides the length-weight relationship (LWR) of European smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) occurring in two lakes in northeastern Poland. The morphometric characters of the two populations of this species in lakes Dargin and Dejguny were also compared.

Investigations were performed in 138 dogs with allergic skin diseases diagnosed in a private animal hospital. Of the 138 animals, 97 cases had positive reactions in LPT specific to food allergens. Of these 97 dogs, 67 animals were diagnosed with canine atopic dermatitis (CAD), but 30 dogs did not have IgE antibodies to environmental allergens. As 14 dogs out of 30 animals showed a positive result, 12 dogs underwent elimination diet trial based on the test results and all of them showed improvement in the pruritus score. Therefore, we conclude that LPT is an effective diagnostic test for allergic skin disease. Results of the lymphocyte test are useful in the identification of food allergens for the elimination diet trial  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergens 3aantibodies 3aatopic dermatitis 3adogs 3aimmunoglobulin E 3apruritus 0adog 0aallergy 0adermatitis 0aIgE 0alymphocytes1 aOumi, K.1 aAshida, Y.1 aHoriuchi, Y.1 aMizuno, T.0 tPolish journal of veterinary sciences.g2014 May 20, v. 16, no. 4 p.735-739dDe Gruyter Openx1505-17737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/pjvs-2013-01043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245015900165300001600324520135600340592002801696650001301724650002801737650001001765650002801775650002101803650001801824650004301842650001301885650003101898700001201929700001701941700001601958700001801974700001501992700001502007700001602022773011902038856008502157990002302242852000902265655001202274IND60094918820221121035208.0141104e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009491882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diabres.2012.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Feng10aCardiovascular safety and glycemic control of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for type 2 diabetes mellitus: A pairwise and network meta-analysis  ap. 386-395.  aAIMS: Integrating evidence from all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) to assess the safety of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and efficacy of glycemic control. METHODS: Besides performing pairwise meta-analysis, network meta-analysis of all RCTs was used to combine direct and indirect estimates of the effect of GLP-1 with placebo, active comparator drugs (ACD), or another GLP-1 agent with treatment duration ≥8 weeks in T2DM patients, 15,883 for CVD safety from 45 RCTs and 14,136 for glycemic control from 36 RCTs. RESULTS: For CVD safety, both of the results from pairwise and network meta-analysis failed to demonstrate significant difference between any two comparators. For glycemic control, the effect of any GLP-1 was better than placebo, but no difference was found between GLP-1s. We also found that liraglutide was the only GLP-1 drug shown to be more effective on improving glycemic control than ACD and exenatide. The results based on direct or indirect estimates were similar for two outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our network meta-analysis provides a complete picture of the associations between GLP-1s, ACD and placebo on CVD safety and glycemic control. The GLP-1s are promising candidates for the treatment of T2DM, but more long-term trials are needed to confirm potential CVD safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3acardiovascular diseases 3adrugs 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3aglycemic control 3ameta-analysis 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3arandomized clinical trials1 aYu, Kai1 aWu, Shanshan1 aZhang, Yuan1 aYang, Zhirong1 aShi, Luwen1 aJi, Linong1 aZhan, Siyan0 tDiabetes research and clinical practice.g2012 Dec., v. 98, no. 3 p.386-395dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0168-82277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2012.09.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245012600210300001300336520194600349592002802295650002902323650002102352650002202373650001502395650001302410650001502423650001202438650002802450653005602478653004402534653001502578653001902593653001702612700001902629700002502648700006002673700002502733700001402758700002002772700001902792700005502811773009502866856008502961852000903046655001203055IND60546919920221119192315.0160903e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054691992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.09.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLozano, Rodrigo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1441-755512aA review of commitment and implementation of sustainable development in higher education: results from a worldwide survey  ap. 1-18.  aDuring the last two decades, many higher education institutions have become involved in embedding sustainable development into their academic systems. The research for this paper was built upon discussions on declarations, charters, and other initiatives designed to commit their institutions to education for sustainable development. It analyses if such commitment leads to more sustainable development implementation within the academic institution. The research was performed using a survey, based upon a literature review of 60 peer-reviewed papers. The survey was divided into eight categories: background; institutional framework; campus operations; education; research; outreach and collaboration; on-campus experiences; and assessment and reporting. The survey was answered by 84 respondents from 70 institutions, worldwide. The responses were analysed via descriptive analysis, grounded theory, and inferential statistics. The results revealed that there were many examples of sustainable development implementation throughout the system; however, generally the efforts tended to be compartmentalised. The analyses also highlighted strong linkages between the institution's commitment to sustainability, implementation, and signing a declaration, charter, or initiative. The findings suggested that academic leadership's commitment was a leading cause for signing a declaration, charter, or initiative, and implementing sustainable development. The research team provided recommendations for higher educational leaders, including acknowledge that the higher education institution system is comprised of several inter-related elements; commit to sustainability by integrating it into policies and strategies; show the commitment by signing a declaration, charter, or initiative; establish short-, medium-, and long-term plans for its institutionalisation; and ensure that sustainable development is implemented throughout the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeducational institutions 3ahigher education 3aissues and policy 3aleadership 3aoutreach 3astatistics 3asurveys 3asustainable development 0aHigher education for sustainable development (HESD) 0aThe higher education institution system 0aCommitment 0aImplementation 0aDeclarations1 aCeulemans, Kim1 aAlonso Almeida, Mar,1 aHuisingh, Donald1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4062-15681 aLozano, Francisco J.1 aWaas, Tom1 aLambrechts, Wim1 aLukman, Rebeka1 aHugé, Jean1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4422-68990 tJournal of cleaner production.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 108 p.1-18dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.09.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012100167300001800288520114900306592002801455650002501483650001501508650001201523650002001535650001701555650002201572650001701594650001301611650001001624650001201634650002401646650001301670700005301683700001601736700001501752700001701767700001701784700001601801700001201817700001701829773012801846856008501974852000902059655001202068IND60768015220221119180916.0220222e20220209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076801522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c055992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yanping10aRational Design of ZIF-8 for Constructing Luminescent Biosensors with Glucose Oxidase and AIE-Type Gold Nanoclusters  ap. 3408-3417.  aThe development of modern technologies has acclimatized biosensors to complicated applicable scenarios with integrated properties as a whole instead of the pursuit of a single-point breakthrough. Here, we targeted a few concerns in the development of enzyme-based biosensors, including stability, analyte enrichment, and signal transduction, and developed a general biosensing model utilizing enzymes, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens, and stimuli-responsive framework materials as the units. We propose such proof-of-concept of glucose biosensors by coencapsulating glucose oxidase and AIE-type gold nanoclusters into acid-sensitive zeolite imidazolate framework (ZIF)-8 nanocrystals. The acid-activated degradation of ZIF-8 bridges the molecular signals produced by the enzyme-catalytic reaction of glucose and the photon signals generated by ZIF-8-induced AIE effects of gold nanoclusters, resulting in the “turn-off” model nanoprobes for glucose detection with high selectivity. After embedding the nanoprobes into hollow-out tapes, the formed paper biosensors can conveniently detect glucose with the help of a smartphone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiosensors 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3aluminescence 3amobile telephones 3ananocrystals 3ananogold 3apaper 3aphotons 3asignal transduction 3azeolites1 aShu, Tong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1438-86001 aMa, Jianxin1 aDai, Qiong1 aPeng, Peiwen1 aZhou, Ziping1 aZhou, Xiang1 aSu, Lei1 aZhang, Xueji0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 Feb. 09, v. 94, no. 7 p.3408-3417dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c055993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010900173300001600282520141200298592002801710650002101738650002001759650001401779650001301793650002101806650002501827650001501852650001701867650003001884650001801914650002201932650002001954650001801974650003001992650002202022650001002044700002202054700002002076700002202096700002402118700002202142700002302164700002102187773011902208856008502327990002302412852000902435655001202444IND60094918920221121051210.0141104e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009491892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diabres.2012.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalavigna, Maicon10aEffectiveness of gestational diabetes treatment: A systematic review with quality of evidence assessment  ap. 396-405.  aAIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of gestational diabetes (GDM) treatment compared to usual antenatal care, in the prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, to assess the quality of the evidence to support GDM treatment according to GRADE guidelines. METHODS: Fourteen electronic databases and reference lists of relevant literature were searched for articles published from inception to February, 2012. Controlled clinical trials comparing GDM treatment to usual antenatal care were included. Independent extraction of articles was done by two authors using predefined data fields. RESULTS: Seven trials involving 3157 women were included. We found high quality evidence that treatment of GDM reduces macrosomia (RR=0.47; 95% CI, 0.34–0.65; NNT=11.4) and large for gestational age birth (RR=0.57; 95% CI, 0.47–0.71; NNT=12.2); moderate quality evidence that treatment reduces preeclampsia (RR=0.61; 95% CI, 0.46–0.81; NNT=21.0) and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (RR=0.64; 95% CI, 0.51–0.81; NNT=18.1); and low quality evidence that treatment reduces shoulder dystocia (RR=0.41; 95% CI, 0.22–0.76; NNT=48.8). No statistically significant reduction was seen for caesarean section. No increase in small for gestational age or preterm birth was found. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of GDM is effective in reducing macrosomia (high quality evidence), preeclampsia and shoulder dystocia.  aPublisher supplied data 3acesarean section 3aclinical trials 3adatabases 3adystocia 3afetal macrosomia 3agestational diabetes 3aguidelines 3ahypertension 3alarge for gestational age 3apre-eclampsia 3apregnancy outcome 3apremature birth 3aprenatal care 3asmall for gestational age 3asystematic review 3awomen1 aSchmidt, Maria I.1 aTrujillo, Janet1 aAlves, Luísia F.1 aWendland, Eliana R.1 aTorloni, Maria R.1 aColagiuri, Stephen1 aDuncan, Bruce B.0 tDiabetes research and clinical practice.g2012 Dec., v. 98, no. 3 p.396-405dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0168-82277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2012.09.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014900163300001600312520146600328592002801794650002501822650001901847650001701866650002201883650002801905650002201933650003101955650001001986650001801996650002702014650001802041650005202059650002602111650001002137650001202147700001702159700001602176773011102192856008102303852000902384655001202393IND60121465220221120100120.0150304e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012146522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-014-0575-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPestana, M.10aEffect of chemical stress imposed by Solanum nigrum in calreticulin and beta-1,4- endoglucanase genes and in infectivity of Pratylenchus goodeyi  ap. 747-759.  aIsolation and expression of effector genes encoding proteins secreted by plant-parasitic nematodes into a host can be helpful in improving the understanding of parasitic interactions. In this study, calreticulin, a highly conserved Ca²⁺-binding and multifunctional protein, and beta-1,4-endoglucanase, a cell wall-degrading enzyme, both known to be secreted from oesophageal gland cells and injected through the nematode stylet into host tissue, were analysed. Full-length cDNAs from calreticulin (crt) and beta-1,4-endoglucanase (eng) with an estimated size of 1549 and 1342 bp, respectively, were isolated from the root-lesion nematode Pratylenchus goodeyi (Pg) by RT-PCR and RACE techniques. Pg-crt and Pg-eng cDNAs were characterized in silico, and their expression assessed by semi-quantitative PCR in nematodes exposed to a chemical stress provided by a Solanum nigrum extract showing nematicidal activity. It was demonstrated that the plant extract down-regulated the levels of Pg-crt mRNA, whereas the transcripts of Pg-eng mRNA held steady. This extract also affected nematode behaviour towards the roots since the number of nematodes that reached and penetrated the roots diminished when the exposure time rose. These observations indicate that the nematicidal compounds present in the plant extract were effective as a signal to influence the infection success of P. goodeyi in vitro and it might be tested against other phytoparasitic nematodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPratylenchus goodeyi 3aSolanum nigrum 3acalreticulin 3acomplementary DNA 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aexposure duration 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3anematicidal properties 3apathogenicity 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroot lesion nematodes 3aroots 3astylets1 aAbrantes, I.1 aGouveia, M.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2015 Apr., v. 141, no. 4 p.747-759dSpringer-Verlagx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-014-0575-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245005600156300001600212520186800228592002802096650001502124650002402139650002302163650001202186650002502198650003002223650002502253650001602278650001002294650001702304650001502321650001102336650001302347650001402360650002202374653001202396653001002408653001302418653001502431653001602446700001502462700002202477700001902499773013602518856007502654852000902729655001202738IND60764383420221118225431.0220130e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076438342DNAL7 a10.18805/ag.R-20532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerumal, R.10aTaxonomy and Grafting of Ornamental Cacti: A Review  ap. 445-449.  aNowadays, cacti and succulents are widely utilized in landscaping. These plants suit very effectively for both indoor and outdoor decorations. The family Cactaceae comprises of 130 genera with 2000 species and this is primarily divided into three tribes namely: Pereskieae, Opuntieae and Cereeae. Cactus flowers are very attractive and are diverse in size, number, form and color. The nocturnal flowers are always white, with light-yellow or red tones, whereas diurnal flowers are white, purple, yellow-orange, red or green. Basically, an areole is a transformed axillary bud situated over a tubercle with spines and often with hairs and trichomes. Due to their low maintenance requirements and their ability to withstand harsh environments, cacti are extremely popular as ornamental plants across the planet. Cacti can be propagated by seeds, cuttings, offsets and grafts. Grafted cacti are now regarded as one of the most admired ornamental indoor plants worldwide. In cacti, grafting has become a commercial method of propagation to accelerate and hasten the growth rate of slow growing species, to ensure the survival of the plants with poor root system, to ensure the survival of genetic aberration of variegated and bright coloured cacti (red and yellow caps) that lack chlorophyll, to accelerate the growth of plants for commercial use, in order to keep cristate and monstrose forms look attractive. Successful grafts have been obtained when the species like Trichocereus spachianus, Trichocereus macrogonus, Trichocereus pachanoi, Hylocereus trigonus, Hylocereus undatus, Selenicereus grandiflorus, Opuntia bergeriana, Opuntia ficus-indica are grafted onto Nopalea spp. The exogenous application of IBA has a positive effect on the vegetative growth of grafted plants using (Gymnocalycium mihanovichii scion grafted onto Trichocereus spachianus rootstock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinopsis 3aHylocereus trigonus 3aHylocereus undatus 3aNopalea 3aOpuntia ficus-indica 3aSelenicereus grandiflorus 3acacti and succulents 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3aroot systems 3arootstocks 3ascions 3ataxonomy 3atrichomes 3avegetative growth 0aAnatomy 0aCacti 0aGrafting 0aOrnamental 0aPropagation1 aPrabhu, M.1 aKaṇṇan̲ Em.,1 aSrinivasan, S.0 tAgricultural reviews.g2021 Dec., v. 42, no. 4 p.445-449dAgricultural Research Communication CenterwJournal:2002x0976-07417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ag.R-20533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001100139245017900150300001600329520182700345592002802172650001702200650001602217650002502233650002702258650002602285650002002311650001502331650001802346650002202364650002702386650002402413650001302437650001902450650001002469650002802479650001402507650004302521650000902564650002702573650001402600650001202614650001002626651001802636700001802654700001502672700001602687773016302703856007302866852000902939655001202948IND60342841720221117001858.0150810e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034284172DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.128312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, J.10aMolecular survey of occurrence and quantity of Legionella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and amoeba hosts in municipal drinking water storage tank sediments  ap. 278-288.  aAIMS: To examine the occurrence and quantity of potential pathogens and an indicator of microbial contamination in the sediments of municipal drinking water storage tanks (MDWSTs), given the absence of such data across the United States. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sediment samples (87 MDWST) from eighteen locations across ten states of the United States were collected and assayed by qPCR for a range of potential enteric and opportunistic microbial pathogens and a sewage‐associated Bacteroides marker. Potential opportunistic pathogens dominated, with the highest detection of occurrence (per cent positive detection; average cell equivalence (CE)) being Mycobacterium spp. (88·9%; 6·7 ± 8·5 × 10⁴ CE g⁻¹), followed by Legionella spp. (66·7%; 5·2 ± 5·9 × 10³ CE g⁻¹), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22·2%; 250 ± 880 CE g⁻¹) and Acanthamoeba spp. (38·9%; 53 ± 70 CE g⁻¹), with no detected Naegleria fowleri. Most enteric pathogens (Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Salmonella enterica, Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia duodenalis) were not detected, except for a trace signal for Campylobacter spp. There was significant correlation between the qPCR signals of Legionella spp. and Acanthamoeba spp. (R² = 0·61, n = 87, P = 0·0001). Diverse Legionella spp. including Leg. pneumophila, Leg. pneumophila sg1 and Leg. anisa were identified, each of which might cause legionellosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that potential opportunistic pathogens are common within MDWST sediments and could act as a source of microbial contamination, but need downstream growth to be of potential concern. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results imply that opportunistic pathogen risks may need to be managed by regular tank cleaning or other management practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthamoeba 3aBacteroides 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aGiardia lamblia 3aLegionella 3aMycobacterium 3aNaegleria fowleri 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSalmonella enterica 3acleaning 3adrinking water 3ahosts 3amicrobial contamination 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3asurveys 3atanks 3aUnited States1 aStruewing, I.1 aYelton, S.1 aAshbolt, N.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2015 July, v. 119, no. 1 p.278-288dPublished for the Society for Applied Bacteriology by Blackwell Sciencex1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.128313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03720naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245007400205506007600279520202300355592002802378506003702406650002502443650001102468650001302479650001202492650002402504650001802528650001002546650001502556650001102571650001902582650002402601650001702625650001202642650001402654650002402668650001402692650001402706650001002720650001002730650002302740650000902763650002002772650001302792650001202805650001102817650001002828700002002838700002002858700003102878773012102909856007903030852000903109655001203118IND60674508420221207103616.0191025e20191018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067450842DNAL7 a10.3390/insects101003572doi7 aPMC68353722pmcid7 a316353822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemic, Darija 10aOzone Effectiveness on Wheat Weevil Suppression: Preliminary Research  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInsect infestations within stored product facilities are a major concern to livestock and human food industries. Insect infestations in storage systems can result in economic losses of up to 20%. Furthermore, the presence of insects and their waste and remains in grain and stored foods may pose a health risk to humans and livestock. At present, pests in commercial storage are managed by a combination of different methods ranging from cleaning and cooling to treatment of the stored material with contact insecticides or fumigation. The availability of pesticides for the treatment of grain and other stored products is decreasing owing, in some cases, to environmental and safety concerns among consumers and society, thus emphasizing the need for alternative eco-friendly pest control methods. One of the potential methods is the use of ozone. Although the mechanism of action of ozone on insects is not completely known, the insect&rsquo;s respiratory system is a likely the target of this gas. The main goal of this investigation was to determine the efficacy of ozone in the suppression of adult wheat weevils Sitophilus granarius. In the experiments conducted, different durations of ozone exposure were tested. In addition to ozone toxicity, the walking response and velocity of wheat weevils were investigated. The results showed the harmful effects of ozone on these insects. In addition to mortality, ozone also had negative effects on insect speed and mobility. The efficiency of the ozone treatment increased with increasing ozone exposure of insects. The ability of ozone to reduce the walking activity and velocity of treated insects is a positive feature in pest control in storage systems, thereby reducing the possibility of insects escaping from treated objects.

METHODS: Wastewater sample was filtered through fabricated vermifiltration unit to study physio-chemical and biological properties of vermiaqua and uniform-sized Allium cepa (Onion) bulbs were kept for root germination at different concentrations (10⁻¹, 10⁻³, 10⁻⁵, 10⁻⁷, 10⁻⁹) of wastewater and vermiaqua at room temperature for 5 days to study impacts of vermiaqua on morphological and cytological characteristics of onion. RESULTS: Vermiaqua was odorless, pale yellow in appearance, lower in turbidity and highly nutritive as ammonia and nitrate contents were highly increased. In E. coli-free vermiaqua, BOD₅ loads were also reduced by 91%. Almost all vermiaqua-treated root germinations were ‘accelerated’, whereas all wastewater-treated root germinations were ‘retarded’. The highest number of germinated roots was counted at 10⁻⁵ concentration of vermiaqua, whereas at the same concentration of wastewater no germination was observed. Many types of chromosomal abnormalities were observed at metaphase and anaphase stages of wastewater-treated roots, whereas the single type of chromosomal abnormality was observed at anaphase stage of vermiaqua-treated roots. CONCLUSIONS: Earthworms upgraded the performance of fabricated systems having integrated methods (biological, chemical and physical) of wastewater purification. Morphological and cytological studies revealed vermiaqua highly promoted the root germination without any chromosomal abnormalities.  aPublisher supplied data  aRGNF-2012-13-SC-BIH-17081cUniversity Grants Commission 3aAllium cepa 3aambient temperature 3aammonia 3aanaphase 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3achromosome aberrations 3aearthworms 3afarmers 3agermination 3ametaphase 3anitrates 3aonions 3aroots 3aturbidity 3avermifiltration 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater reuse1 aGhosh, Ashok K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3602-23270 tInternational journal of recycling of organics waste in agriculture.g2019 Dec., v. 8, no. 4 p.405-415dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:21645x2195-32287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40093-019-0247-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245017000170300001600340520150900356592002801865650002501893650001901918650002001937650001901957650003101976650000902007650001702016650001302033650001502046650001502061650001402076653001702090653001002107653001902117653003902136700001502175700001602190700001802206700001202224700001602236773011202252856008502364852000902449655001202458IND60561270520221121035327.0180830e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056127052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2016.02.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chunfang10aPoly(ether-b-amide)/ethylene glycol monophenyl ether gel membrane with superior CO2/N2 separation performance fabricated by thermally induced phase separation method  ap. 136-145.  aPolymeric gel membranes contain poly(ether-b-amide) (Pebax) and ethylene glycol monophenyl ether (EPH) was prepared via thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) method for the first time. In the membranes, EPH was used as not only diluent to form the gel structure, but also functional liquid to enhance the CO2 permeability and CO2/N2 selectivity. Comprehensive investigation was carried out to study the phase separation behaviors and membrane performances. Phase diagrams and optical microscope results indicate that the crystallizition of Pebax from a one-phase solution is responsible for the physical network structure of the gel membranes. Meantime, the gel temperature shifted to the lower region with increasing EPH content. Both the pure CO2 permeability and CO2/N2 ideal selectivity of the membranes were simultaneously increased with the increase of EPH content, which can be ascribed to the multiple synergistic effect of (a) the increased solubility of CO2 by Lewis acid-base interactions between CO2 and ethylene oxide groups in EPH, (b) the barrier effect of EPH on the transport of N2 and (c) more permeable amorphous phase was formed in polymer matrix. The overall performance of gel membranes with 60 and 80wt% EPH fall within the attractive region beyond the “Robeson Upper Bound” for CO2/N2 gas pairs. The successful application of TIPS provides a new route to the structure modulation and performance enhancement of polymer gel membranes in the removal of CO2 from gas streams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acarbon dioxide 3aethylene glycol 3aethylene oxide 3agelatinization temperature 3agels 3apermeability 3apolymers 3aseparation 3asolubility 3asynergism 0aGel membrane 0aPebax 0aCO2 separation 0aThermally induced phase separation1 aWu, Yanyan1 aZhang, Ying1 aBai, Yunxiang1 aGu, Jin1 aSun, Yuping0 tJournal of membrane science.g2016 June 15, v. 508 p.136-145dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2016.02.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01907naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245007900165300001600244520095500260592002801215650002201243650002501265650001601290700002401306700002001330700002001350700001901370700001901389773009801408856007801506852000901584655001201593IND60501745620221116192041.0160223e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6050174562DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2015006672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeong, Yoong Kit10aThermoseparating aqueous two‐phase systems: Recent trends and mechanisms  ap. 640-647.  aHaving the benefits of being environmentally friendly, providing a mild environment for bioseparation, and scalability, aqueous two‐phase systems (ATPSs) have increasingly caught the attention of industry and researchers for their application in the isolation and recovery of bioproducts. The limitations of conventional ATPSs give rise to the development of temperature‐induced ATPSs that have distinctive thermoseparating properties and easy recyclability. This review starts with a brief introduction to thermoseparating ATPSs, including its history, unique characteristics and advantages, and lastly, key factors that influence partitioning. The underlying mechanism of temperature‐induced ATPSs is covered together with a summary of recent applications. Thermoseparating ATPSs have been proven as a solution to the demand for economically favorable and environmentally friendly industrial‐scale bioextraction and purification techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiobased products 3apurification methods 3aresearchers1 aLan, John Chi‐Wei1 aLoh, Hwei‐San1 aLing, Tau Chuan1 aOoi, Chien Wei1 aShow, Pau Loke0 tJournal of separation science.g2016 Feb., v. 39, no. 4 p.640-647dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2015006673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01450naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002800166245008300194300001400277520028300291592002800574650002100602650001900623650001900642650001900661651001700680651001300697651001200710651001400722653002100736653002000757653002900777653001300806653001200819773012200831856011400953852000901067655001201076IND60127640720221120164618.0151110e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012764072DNAL7 a10.3100/1043-4534(2005)10[53:BPSUAA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuarin, Fernando Alzate10aBomarea patinii ssp. umbellata (alstroemeriaceae), a new subspecies of bomarea  ap. 53-56.  aBomarea patinii (Alstroemeriaceae) is a species widely distributed in the Andes.

The synthesized material was carefully characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry, and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy to confirm the structure and components. The adsorption and desorption conditions of the adsorbent toward phenolic environmental estrogens were optimized in detailed to obtain the best extraction recovery and elution efficiency. Under the optimum conditions, the limits of detection of the method for ten phenolic environmental estrogens were in range of 0.15–1.5 ng/L, which was lower than the reported methods for phenolic environmental estrogens detection in literatures. This could be contributed to the unique structure and property of the as‐prepared material.

Leaves with and without necrosis were processed according to standard techniques for anatomical analyses. Leaves from the site with higher SUM00 presented thinner palisade parenchyma, fewer layers of spongy parenchyma, higher stomatal density, clusters of vessel elements in the midrib, erosion of cuticular waxes and stomatal damage. The sequence of microscopic events from the third day of exposure were condensation of the cytoplasm in parenchyma tissue, sinuosity of anticlinal walls, pectinaceous cell wall protrusions, chromatin condensation and changes in chlorophyll autofluorescence. On the 14th day of exposure, these events finally led to cell death in the palisade parenchyma and necrosis on the leaf. The markers observed indicated oxidative stress caused by ozone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepicuticular wax 3axylem vessels 3aoxidative stress 3acell walls 3aindicator species 3anecrosis 3aozone 3aNicotiana tabacum 3acytoplasm 3achromatin 3atobacco 3achlorophyll 3aleaves 3aBrazil 0aparenchyma 0acondensation1 aAlves, Edenise Segala0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2015 May, v. 22, no. 9 p.6535-6545dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-4025-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01514naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010400159300001600263500001500279520050600294592002800800650001900828650001200847650002400859650001400883650002000897650001700917650001400934650002600948653001800974773010100992856007401093852000901167655001201176IND60439139720221119162229.0151024e199706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043913972DNAL7 a10.1007/BF025093182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakagi, Shingo10aPhotoregulation of cytoplasmic streaming: Cell biological dissection of signal transduction pathway  ap. 299-303.  a2019-12-06  aIn mesophyll cells ofVallisneria gigantea Graebner, an aquatic angiosperm, induction and cessation of rotational streaming of the cytoplasm are under the control of light.

Increased data availability and developments in machine learning (ML) provide new possibilities for improving the accuracy and complexity of urban energy use models. This paper presents an integrated framework for urban energy use modeling (UEUM) that localizes energy performance data, considers urban socio-spatial context, and captures both urban building operational and transportation energy use through a bottom-up data-driven approach. The framework employs ML techniques for building operational energy use modeling at the urban scale with a travel demand model for transport energy use prediction. The framework is demonstrated using Chicago as a case study because it has significant variations in urban spatial patterns across its neighborhoods and it provides publicly available data that are essential for the framework. Results for Chicago suggest that, among the tested algorithms, k-nearest neighbor shows the best overall performance in terms of accuracy for a single-output model (i.e., for building or transportation energy use separately) and artificial neural network algorithm is the most accurate for the integrated model (i.e., building and transportation energy use combined). Exploratory analysis demonstrates that the urban attributes examined herein explain 41% and 96% of the variance in building and transportation energy use intensity, respectively. The UEUM framework has the potential to aid designers, planners, and policymakers in predicting urban energy use and evaluating robust theories and alternative scenarios for energy-driven planning and design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplanning 3aenergy 3aneural networks 3avariance 3aartificial intelligence 3atravel 3acities 3acase studies 3aalgorithms 3aprediction 0aurban socio-spatial patterns 0atransportation 0atransportation energy 0abuilding operational energy 0adata-driven 0amachine learning 0aUrban energy use modeling1 aAshayeri, Mehdi1 aAzari, Rahman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4844-639X1 aStephens, Brent1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0177-67031 aHeidarinejad, Mohammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3064-825X0 tApplied energy.g2019 July 13,  p.113550-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1135503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245006400159300001600223520130700239592002801546650003901574650002201613650002501635650001901660650003001679650001801709650001001727650002901737650001901766650001901785650001401804650001701818650001701835650001901852650001901871650001501890650001201905650002301917650002001940650001001960651001001970653002901980653001902009653001502028700001802043773013602061856007502197852000902272655001202281IND60764384020221118225612.0220130e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076438402DNAL7 a10.18805/ag.R-20452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelvakumar, S.10aConservation Agriculture: A Way for Soil Water Conservation  ap. 474-477.  aWorld population is going on increasing, it may be 2.4 billion by 2050, but stabilizing the yield of crop is questionable in Indian agriculture due to improper management o agricultural land. Excess tillage accelerate the organic matter oxidation present on th top soil, soil erosion and creates subsurface hard pan. This makes the field unsuitable for cultivation of crops in future. Climate change is worsening the situation by imposing water scarcity in India. So to evade these problems, conservation agriculture is th only way.Main objectives of conservation agriculture is reducing tillage, year round croppingcrop rotation, mulching may be live or residue. Due to reduced mechanical tillage, activity of micro flora and macro flora get increases that improves biological tillage of soil,that in turn improves soil structure and enhances the plant growth. Most of the studiesshowed that the cost of wheat production and CO2 emission from the field is reduced whenconservation agriculture was fallowed in rice-wheat cropping system. Crop rotation and alsomixed cropping improves soil fertility and also it reduces soil erosion. It can be a part of climate smart agriculture. It reduces greenhouse gas emission and also it can improve carbon sequestration. Considerably it can save 20-30% of water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural conservation practice 3aagricultural land 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aclimate-smart agriculture 3acrop rotation 3aflora 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amicroorganisms 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3aplant growth 3asoil erosion 3asoil fertility 3asoil structure 3asoil water 3atopsoil 3awater conservation 3awater shortages 3awheat 3aIndia 0aConservation agriculture 0aEffect on soil 0aPrinciples1 aSivakumar, K.0 tAgricultural reviews.g2021 Dec., v. 42, no. 4 p.474-477dAgricultural Research Communication CenterwJournal:2002x0976-07417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ag.R-20453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245009900179500002200278500002200300520187600322592002802198650002602226650001202252650002002264650001202284650001202296650002002308650002702328650001702355650001502372650001502387650001502402650002602417650001302443650000902456650000902465650002102474650001702495651001002512651001602522653002402538653002802562653002902590653004002619700005502659700002102714700002102735700002002756773016202776856008202938852000903020655001203029IND60612545620221120115105.0180905s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061254562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.njas.2018.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyamekye, Andy Bonaventure10aGovernance arrangements and adaptive decision-making in rice farming systems in Northern Ghana  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aClimate variability has consequences on water availability in rice farming systems. In Ghana, rice farmers in the Northern Savannah are amongst the most vulnerable to long periods of drought and erratic rainfall conditions. Within the Kumbungu district, farmers engaged in both rain-fed and irrigated rice farming are no exception. Coping with uncertain water availability conditions requires adaptive decision-making for sustained productivity in rice cropping. From an adaptive governance perspective, the extent to which formal and traditional governance arrangements enable adaptive decisions amongst rice farmers remains a key question. Using an exploratory research design, the study investigates three key questions; what water-dependent decisions rice farmers take and how these are adaptive to changing water availability conditions; what formal and informal governance arrangements rice cropping decisions are embedded in; and how existing governance arrangements enable or constrain adaptive decision-making. Rice farmers in twelve communities around the Bontanga Irrigation Scheme in the Kumbungu District in the Northern region were engaged through individual interviews and focus group discussions. The study reveals that farmers take six major water-dependent decisions throughout the cropping season; decision to or not to plant rice, land preparation, planting, weed control, fertilizer application and harvesting. Farmer decisions are most adaptive to water availability conditions during planting and fertilizer application. Both formal and traditional governance arrangements influence the extent to which farmers are able to adapt to changes in water availability conditions. The paper also reflects on the potential of hydro-climatic information and the place of Environmental Virtual Observatories (EVOs) in adaptive governance and decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural sciences 3aclimate 3adecision making 3adrought 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afertilizer application 3afocus groups 3agovernance 3aharvesting 3ainterviews 3airrigation management 3aplanting 3arain 3arice 3asite preparation 3aweed control 3aGhana 3aNetherlands 0aAdaptive governance 0aGovernance arrangements 0aAdaptive decision-making 0aEnvironmental virtual observatories1 aDewulf, Art1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4171-76441 aVan Slobbe, Erik1 aTermeer, Katrien1 aPinto, Cristina0 tNetherlands journal of agricultural science.g2018, dElsevier B.V.aRoyal Netherlands Society for Agricultural ScienceswJournal:J000000128x1573-52147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.njas.2018.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01673naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245013300177300001800310520068900328592002801017650001301045650002801058650001401086650001801100700006401118773012101182856008301303852000901386655001201395IND60655543020221119160308.0190803e20190717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065554302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b018972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamakrishna, Gujjula V.10aTotal Synthesis of the Sensitive Triyne Natural Product (4S,5S)-4,8-Dihydroxy-3,4-dihydrovernoniyne and All of Its Stereoisomers  ap. 5827-5831.  aAn efficient total synthesis of the revised structure of the sensitive triyne natural product, (4S,5S)-4,8-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydrovernoniyne, and all of its stereoisomers, that is, the previously proposed (4S,5R), (4R,5R), and (4R,5S), has been accomplished from chiral pool compounds l-mannonic-γ-lactone and d-glucono-δ-lactone. The key features involve a one-pot conversion of the chiral pool compounds into the γ-vinyl-β-hydroxy-γ-lactones, the heteroatom-directed Wacker oxidation, the Seyferth–Gilbert reaction, and Cadiot–Chodkiewicz coupling. The synthesis also involves minimal protecting groups (only tert-butyldimethylsilyl) and is completed in seven to eight steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3alactones 3aorganosilicon compounds 3aoxidation 3astereoisomers1 aFernandes, Rodney A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8888-09270 tOrganic letters.g2019 July 17, v. 21, no. 15 p.5827-5831dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.9b018973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
