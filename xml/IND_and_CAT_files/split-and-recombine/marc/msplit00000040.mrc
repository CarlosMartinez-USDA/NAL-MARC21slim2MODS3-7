Pesticides (imidacloprid and chlorpyrifos) as well as a metal salt (nickel chloride) were investigated for their toxic effect at different temperatures. Tests focused on the early development of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and larvae (from fertilization up to 168 h postfertilization) when exposed to the three respective chemicals at an optimum temperature (26°C) and three higher temperatures (up to 33.5°C). At all temperatures tested, the two pesticides did not have a significant impact on the early development of the zebrafish at the highest test concentrations (imidacloprid, 50 mg/l; chlorpyrifos, 1 mg/l). Nickel led to a significant decrease of hatching success at all temperatures; the combination of elevated temperature and nickel exposure revealed a synergistic effect of both stressors. 3aDanio rerio 3achlorides 3achlorpyrifos 3aearly development 3aembryogenesis 3aimidacloprid 3alarvae 3anickel 3asynergism 3atemperature 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aChlorpyrifosxtoxicity 2aEmbryo, Nonmammalianxdrug effects 2aEmbryonic Developmentxdrug effects 2aImidazolesxtoxicity 2aNickelxtoxicity 2aNitro Compoundsxtoxicity 2aPesticidesxtoxicity 2aTemperature 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 2aZebrafishxembryology1 aKöhler, Heinz-R.0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2009 Feb., v. 56, no. 2 p.238-243dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-008-9192-8 7aarticle03052naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245011500171300001600286500002400302520192700326650001102253650001402264650001302278650001302291650001402304650001102318650003302329650002302362650001302385650001402398650001302412700001502425700001302440700001502453700001202468773011002480852000902590856005502599655001202654IND4410622820221118104108.0080926e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441062282DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-459X.2008.00178.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEcheverria, G.10aPanel consonance in the sensory evaluation of apple attributes: influence of mealiness on sweetness perception  ap. 656-670.  aIncludes references  aSeventeen apple samples from nine different cultivars were evaluated by a trained panel of nine panelists. The first dimension of the raw principal component analysis models for each attribute (sweetness, sourness, juiciness, firmness, mealiness and crispness) accounted for more than 57% of the variance in sensory scores, except in the case of sweetness, for which the degree of explained variance was only 40%. A generalized procrustes analysis (GPA) was then applied to maximize the explained variance between the panelists. The final consonance results can be understood by looking at the interactions among the attributes: analysis of the GPA rotation matrix indicated that there was a rotation interaction between sweetness and mealiness that could explain the lower degree of consensus in the panel when evaluating sweetness. Conversely, the highest degree of consensus was observed for sourness, which showed the lowest correlation with the rest of the attributes. Our article shows that panel consonance results can be directly related to interactions among sensory attributes: an attribute with higher interactions with the rest of the properties reaches a lower consensus in its evaluation. There is no work reporting this conclusion from a particular set of sensory data. We would also like to highlight that evidencing this result is not trivial because not all the interactions among sensory properties respond to a correlation interaction. For instance, we show that there is a rotation interaction between sweetness and mealiness. This information is the result of a detailed analysis of values of rotation coefficients between each pair of sensory attributes for all the panelists. To our knowledge, this kind of interaction has not been explicitly described in the apple literature up to now. In the present study, this interaction is explained from the sensory perception mechanisms of both properties. 3aapples 3acultivars 3afirmness 3ahardness 3ajuiciness 3amodels 3aprincipal component analysis 3asensory evaluation 3asourness 3asweetness 3avariance1 aGraell, J.1 aLara, I.1 aLopez, ML.1 aPuy, J.0 tJournal of sensory studies.g2008 Oct., v. 23, no. 5 p.656-670dBlackwell Publishing Incx0887-82507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-459X.2008.00178.x 7aarticle02476naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001400169245012000183300001800303500002400321520127300345650001401618650001901632650002001651650001501671650001601686650001301702650001501715650001801730650001301748650001401761650002001775650002101795650001801816650003701834650000901871700001401880773009801894852000901992856005302001655001202054IND4406475020221118104139.0080606e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440647502DNAL7 a182916372pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnmar, G.10aAssessing the effect of biodegradable and degradable plastics on the composting of green wastes and compost quality  ap. 6738-6744.  aIncludes references  aAn assessment of the effect of the composting potential of Mater-Bi biodegradable plastic with green wastes, noted by GBIO, and degradable plastic (PDQ-H additive) with green wastes, noted by GDEG, was carried out in a lagged two-compartment compost reactor. The composting time was determined until constant mass of the composting substrates was reached. The green wastes composting process was used as control (G). After one week of composting, the biodegradable plastics disappeared completely, while 2% of the original degradable plastic still remained after about 8 weeks of composting. A net reduction in volatile solids contents of 61.8%, 56.5% and 53.2% were obtained for G, GBIO and GDEG, respectively. Compost quality was assessed in terms of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus contents, which were found to be highest for GBIO compost. From the phytotoxicity test, it has been observed that a diluted extract of GBIO compost has produced the longest length of radicle. From the respiration test, no significant difference in the amount of carbon dioxide released by the composting of GDEG and G was observed. This study showed that the quality of the compost is not affected by the presence of the biodegradable and degradable plastics in the raw materials. 3aadditives 3acarbon dioxide 3acompost quality 3acomposting 3agreen waste 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphytotoxicity 3aplastics 3apotassium 3aprocess control 3aprocessing waste 3araw materials 2aPlasticsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSoil1 aMohee, R.0 tBioresource technology.g2008 Oct., v. 99, no. 15 p.6738-6744dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.01.016 7aarticle03074naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100003700169245011700206300001800323500002400341520135600365650002401721650001501745650001201760650001901772650001501791650001201806650001201818650001501830650001801845650001301863650002501876650001601901650002001917650003401937650004401971650002802015650006302043650002402106650003102130650002402161650003902185650002502224650001702249650006002266700002402326700002202350773009802372852000902470856005302479655001202532IND4430938520221118104100.0100108e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443093852DNAL7 a200313982pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.11.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Rodríguez, Carlos E.10aDegradation of naproxen and carbamazepine in spiked sludge by slurry and solid-phase Trametes versicolor systems  ap. 2259-2266.  aIncludes references  aGrowth and activity of the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor on sewage sludge were assessed in bioslurry and solid-phase systems. Bioslurry cultures with different loads of sludge (10%, 25% and 38%, w/v) were performed. A lag phase of at least 2 d appeared in the 25 and 38%-cultures, however, the total fungal biomass was higher for the latter and lower for the 10%-culture after 30 d, as revealed by ergosterol determination. Detectable laccase activity levels were found in the 10 and 25%-cultures (up to 1308 and 2588 AUL⁻¹, respectively) while it was negligible in the 38%-culture. Important levels of ergosterol and laccase were obtained over a 60 d period in sludge solid-phase cultures amended with different concentrations of wheat straw pellets as lignocellulosic bulking material. Degradation experiments in 25%-bioslurry cultures spiked with naproxene (NAP, analgesic) and carbamazepine (CBZ, antiepileptic) showed depletion of around 47% and 57% within 24h, respectively. Complete depletion of NAP and around 48% for CBZ were achieved within 72h in sludge solid cultures with 38% bulking material. CBZ degradation is especially remarkable due to its high persistence in wastewater treatment plants. Results showed that T. versicolor may be an interesting bioremediation agent for elimination of emerging pollutants in sewage sludge. 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aanalgesics 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3aergosterol 3alaccase 3apellets 3apollutants 3asewage sludge 3aslurries 3awastewater treatment 3awheat straw 3awhite-rot fungi 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCarbamazepinexisolation & purification 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediationxinstrumentation 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLaccasexmetabolism 2aNaproxenxisolation & purification 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aTime Factors 2aTrametesxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aMarco-Urrea, Ernest1 aCaminal, Glòria.0 tBioresource technology.g2010 Apr., v. 101, no. 7 p.2259-2266dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.11.089 7aarticle02770naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001900169245007400188300001800262500002400280520110500304650001501409650001501424650001401439650001601453650001901469650002201488650001601510650001201526650001101538650001201549650002301561650002101584650001301605650001901618650002501637650003501662650001501697650002101712650001401733650003601747650002701783650003901810650001501849650001301864650002201877650002501899700002801924700002201952700002501974700002101999773009802020852000902118856005302127655001202180IND4405025820221118104101.0080428e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440502582DNAL7 a180633632pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2007.09.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOshel, Reed E.10aWater solubilization of DDGS via derivatization with phosphite esters  ap. 5193-5205.  aIncludes references  aEthanol production from corn starch in the corn dry milling process leaves Distillers' Dry Grains and Solubles (DDGS) as a major by-product from which additional ethanol may be economically obtained from its glucan content. A challenge in processing the cellulose content of this material lies in its extensive inter-cellulose chain hydrogen bonding, which inhibits access of enzymes capable of cleaving glycosidic bonds, a transformation required for providing fermentable sugars. The phosphitylation of cellulosic OH groups using a reactive bicyclic phosphite ester is utilized to disrupt cellulosic hydrogen bonds, thus providing access to cellulose chains for further processing. We describe a method of pretreating DDGS with commercially available trimethylolpropane phosphite [P(OCH₂)₃CEt] in the presence of a slight molar excess of water to afford greater than 90% DDGS solubility in the reaction mixture in methanol and in water. Preliminary results using a model compound [d-(+)-permethylated cellobiose] indicate that glycosidic bonds are cleaved as a consequence of this pretreatment. 3abyproducts 3acellobiose 3acellulose 3acorn starch 3aderivatization 3adistillers grains 3adry milling 3aenzymes 3aesters 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3ahydrogen bonding 3amethanol 3asolubilization 2aCellulosexchemistry 2aEstersxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHydrolysis 2aIndustrial Waste 2aIsomerism 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMolecular Conformation 2aPhosphitesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSolubility 2aSolvents 2aWaterxmetabolism 2aZea maysxmetabolism1 aNandakumar, Mecheril V.1 aUrgaonkar, Sameer1 aHendricker, David G.1 aVerkade, John G.0 tBioresource technology.g2008 Aug., v. 99, no. 12 p.5193-5205dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2007.09.036 7aarticle01635naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115245007200129300001400201500001500215520074600230650001500976650001300991651001101004651001801015653002501033653001601058653002501074700001901099773011201118852000901230939003301239945000801272946002901280655001201309991630397100742620221118103419.0820408e198201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE829200092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeyhl, J.10aUsing the recreation concept plan technique to assess public choice  ap. 38-43.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: This paper describes the environmental assessment of the development of the hydroelectric potential of the Upper Susitna River. The underlying concept is that recreational planning, while controlling the general nature of development and minimizing undersirable impacts, has another equally important function - controlling the type and quality of recreational opportunity to be offered to the public. The study team developed the "concept plan technique" which involves two basic steps, (1) inventorying the resource in terms of opportunity settings that can be sustained over the long run and, (2) assessing public interest for a range of recreational opportunities that are within the limits determined by the resource inventory. 3arecreation 3aplanning 3aAlaska 0aUnited States 0aPublic participation 0adevelopment 0aresource development1 aJubenville, A.0 tAgroborealis-Alaska, Agricultural Experiment Station, Fairbanks.g1982 Jan., v. 14 p.38-43x0002-18227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19820408c00000000  aAGE  aState experiment station 7aarticle02213naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245011100179300001600290520116100306592002801467650002701495650001701522650001401539650001901553650001801572650001901590650001701609650003701626650001301663650001701676700001801693773009501711856004801806852000901854655001201863IND50059574520221118104032.0160229e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005957452DNAL7 a10.1007/s12223-012-0161-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBirteksöz-Tan, Ayşe Seher10aPostantibiotic effect of various antibiotics on Legionella pneumophila strains isolated from water systems  ap. 495-499.  aThe postantibiotic effects (PAE) of azithromycin, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin were investigated against Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) strains isolated from several hot water systems of different buildings in Istanbul. Each strain in logarithmic phase of growth was exposed to concentrations of antibiotics equal to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and 4× MIC for 1 h.

The mean values of PAEs for the strains of L. pneumophila, azithromycin at a concentration equal to and 4 times of MIC values were found 1.75 ± 0.28 h and 4.06 ± 0.44 h, for clarithromycin 2.98 ± 0.70 h and 4.18 ± 0.95 h, for ciprofloxacin 2.97 ± 0.63 h and 4.70 ± 0.63 h, for levofloxacin 2.05 ± 0.33 h and 3.78 ± 0.46 h, respectively. All of the antibiotics showed increased PAE values in a concentration-dependent manner. The findings of our study may play useful role in selecting the appropriate timing of doses during therapy with antimicrobials to treat patients infected with L. pneumophila.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLegionella pneumophila 3aazithromycin 3abuildings 3acentrifugation 3aciprofloxacin 3aclarithromycin 3alevofloxacin 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apatients 3atherapeutics1 aZeybek, Zuhal0 tFolia microbiologica.g2012 Nov., v. 57, no. 6 p.495-499dSpringer-Verlagx0015-56327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12223-012-0161-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001300157245009700170300001800267520145400285650001701739650001001756650001501766650001701781650002501798650001801823650002201841653001201863653001001875700001701885700001801902700002001920773008701940852000902027856007802036939003302114946001302147655001202160IND9203796320221118103648.0920615e199004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920379632DNAL7 a242637192pmid7 a10.1007/BF010210182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPage, M.10aCuticular hydrocarbons of eight species of North American cone beetles, Conophthorus Hopkins  ap. 1173-1198.  aA study to determine the degree of similarity and/or diversity among eight of the 15 described species of Conophthorus is reported. Cuticular hydrocarbons were evaluated for C. conicolens, C. ponderosae, C. cembroides, C. edulis, C. radiatae, C. coniperda, C. resinosae, and C. banksianae. Seventy-eight individual and isomeric mixtures of hydrocarbons were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, including n-alkanes, alkenes, alkadienes, 2- or 4-methylalkanes, 3-methylalkanes, and single-component and isomefic mixtures of internally branched mono-, di-, and trimethylalkanes. Differences in alkenes and mono-, di-, and trimethylalkanes can be used easily to separate the eight species. Conophthorus conicolens and C. ponderosae contain the most complex blends. Hydrocarbon patterns in three geographically separated populations of C. ponderosae, each from a different host, are qualitatively identical with the exception of a homologous series of 3,7-dimethylalkanes from adults collected from Pinus lambertiana cones. The latter could comprise a sibling species. Hydrocarbon mixtures of two eastern species, C. resinosae and C. banksianae, are qualitatively identical, supporting the suspicion that C. banksianae may not be a valid species. Closely related C. cembroides and C. edulis have similar combinations of hydrocarbons except for a unique and abundant alkene (C27:1) in C. edulis and two dimethyhexacosanes in C. cembriodes. 3aConophthorus 3aPinus 3aintegument 3ahydrocarbons 3achemical composition 3achemotaxonomy 3aspectral analysis 0acuticle 0acones1 aNelson, L.J.1 aHaverty, M.I.1 aBlomquist, G.J.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1990 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.1173-1198x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF010210183Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01245naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245012300130300001800253520033900271650001800610650001900628650001200647650001400659650002000673650001200693650001400705650002200719700001600741700002000757773008700777852000900864939003300873946001300906655001200919IND9203796120221118103650.0920615e199004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920379612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoolittle, R.E.10aSex pheromones of Manduca Sexta (L.) stereoselective synthesis of (10E, 12E, 14Z)-10,12,14-hexadecatrienal and isomers  ap. 1131-1153.  aThree isomeric conjugated triene aldehydes, (10E, 12E, 14Z)-10, 12-14-hexadecatrienal (IX), (10E, 12Z, 14E)-10, 12, 14-hexadecatrienal (XX), and (10E,12E,14E)-10,12,14-hexadecatrienal (X), two of which are components of the Manduca sexta (L.) sex pheromone, have been stereoselectively synthesized and spectroscopically characterized. 3aManduca sexta 3asex pheromones 3afemales 3asynthesis 3astereochemistry 3aisomers 3aaldehydes 3aspectral analysis1 aBrabham, A.1 aTumlinson, J.H.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1990 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.1131-1153x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01926naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001900157245009100176300001800267500001500285520084600300650002201146650002101168650002101189650001201210653001801222653001801240653002001258653001901278700001701297700001801314773008701332852000901419856007801428939003301506946001301539655001201552IND9203796520221118095509.0920615e199004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920379652DNAL7 a242637212pmid7 a10.1007/BF010210202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolldobler, B.10aChemical communication in the dacetine ant Daceton armigerum (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)  ap. 1207-1219.  a2019-12-04  aContrary to previous assumptions, Daceton armigerum, the largest ant in the myrmicine tribe Dacetini, employs trail communication. We identified two anatomical sources of trail pheromones: Trails drawn with poison gland contents can last for more than seven days. Trails drawn with the newly discovered sternal glands (in the VIth and VIIth abdominal sternites) are effective but relatively short-lived. In addition, our bioassays revealed that the contents of the mandibular glands elicit alarm behavior, and secretions from the pygidial gland release attraction. When tested with artificial poison gland trails from seven other myrmicine species, Daceton did not exhibit trail following behavior. We confirmed, however, previous findings that Atta respond to Daceton poison gland trails and Solenopsis follow Daceton Dufour's gland trails. 3amandibular glands 3atrail pheromones 3aalarm pheromones 3aFormica 0aanimal glands 0apoison glands 0apygidial glands 0asternal glands1 aPalmer, J.M.1 aMoffett, M.W.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1990 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.1207-1219x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF010210203Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02235naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245015700173300001800330500001500348520103000363650001901393650002301412650002101435650001901456650001701475650002301492653001701515653001701532653001601549653001701565700001901582700001601601773008701617852000901704856007801713939003301791946001301824655001201837IND9203796920221118095550.0920615e199004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920379692DNAL7 a242637252pmid7 a10.1007/BF010210242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeath, R.R.10aEffect of release rate and ratio of (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol from synthetic pheromone blends on trap capture of Heliothis subflexa (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 1259-1268.  a2019-12-04  aResponse of male Heliothis subflexa to pheromone-baited traps containing blends of tetradecanal, (Z)-9-tetradecanal, hexadecanal, (Z)-7-hexadecenal, (Z)-9-hexadecenal, (Z)-11-hexadecenal, hexadecan-1-ol acetate, (Z)-7-hexadecen-1-ol acetate, (Z)-9-hexadecen-1-ol acetate, (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol acetate, (Z)-9-hexadecen-1-ol, and (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol was evaluated. Analysis of trap capture data indicated that (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol was a critical component of the pheromone blend. It was determined from emission rate data and measurements of the ratio of pheromone components emitted from rubber septa tested that a significant increase in trap capture of male H. subflexa occurred when the blends investigated released the alcohol in a narrow range relative to the total amount of pheromone emitted. The optimum range of release ratio of the alcohol for the capture of males in sticky traps was determined to be 0.9-3.5% of the pheromone blend.

(Homoptera: Psylloidea) takes place only on female catkins of Salix repens L. and close phenological synchrony is crucial because development times of catkins and nymphs are similar. Eggs are laid on catkins as soon as they develop and close synchrony between oviposition and budburst maximizes time available for nymphal development. Sampling adult C. moscovita in the field revealed little synchrony between egg development and budburst, with over 60% of females containing mature eggs four weeks before catkins first appeared. In the laboratory, egg development was influenced by both temperature and photoperiod. At 10 °C, egg development occurred approximately one month earlier than at 5 °C and two weeks earlier than in the field. Adult survival in the laboratory was substantially reduced at increased temperature, with only 20% of adults surviving longer than two weeks at 10 °C, compared with over 95% at 5 °C. Body condition (weight corrected for size) of males and females decreased significantly in the field over winter. However, body condition of females levelled off before budburst, coincident with egg development implying that females had resumed feeding. We discuss our results in relation to regulation of phenological synchrony between oviposition and catkin appearance. 3aCacopsylla 3aSalix repens 3aadults 3abody condition 3acatkins 3aeggs 3afemales 3amales 3anymphs 3aoviposition 3aphenology 3atemperature 3awinter1 aHodkinson, I.D.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1996 Feb., v. 78, no. 2 p.143-147dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw26091x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1996.tb00775.x 7aarticle01469naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245006100169300001400230500002400244520063500268650001300903650001300916650001500929650001100944650001800955700001800973773012200991852000901113856005701122655001201179IND4460583020221118100336.0110729e197501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446058302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.1975.tb00678.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPANT, D.D.10aMorphological studies in Argyreia Lour.

Across spatial scales, there was very little support for models with structural habitat features, such as tree canopy cover and conifer diameter. Model-averaged 95% confidence intervals for regression coefficients and associated odds ratios indicated that the occurrence of Siskiyou Mountains salamanders was positively associated with rocky soils and Pacific madrone (Abutus menziesii) and negatively associated with elevation and white fir (Abies concolor); these associations were consistent across 3 spatial scales. The occurrence of this species also was positively associated with hardwood density at the medium spatial scale. Odds ratios projected that a 10% decrease in white fir abundance would increase the odds of salamander occurrence 3.02-4.47 times, depending on spatial scale. We selected the model with rocky soils, white fir, and Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana) as the best model across 3 spatial scales and created habitat suitability maps for Siskiyou Mountains salamanders by projecting habitat suitability scores across the landscape. Our habitat suitability models and maps are applicable to selection of priority conservation areas for Siskiyou Mountains salamanders, and our approach can be easily adapted to conservation of other rare species in any geographical location. 3aAbies concolor 3aArbutus menziesii 3aPlethodon 3aQuercus garryana 3acanopy 3acase studies 3aconfidence interval 3aconservation areas 3ageographic information systems 3ahabitats 3ahardwood 3alandscapes 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3amountains 3aodds ratio 3asalamanders and newts 3aUnited States1 aOlson, Deanna H.1 aReilly, Edward C.0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2008 Aug., v. 17, no. 9 p.2197-2218dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-007-9281-4 7aarticle03616naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002000157245024500177300001600422500002400438500001500462520155100477650002502028650001802053650001902071650002202090650001702112650001802129650001402147650002502161650001102186650001902197650001902216650001902235650001602254650001302270650005702283650003902340650003202379650004302411650001702454650003102471650001402502650004602516650006902562650001402631653002602645700002602671700001902697700002202716700002302738700002102761700002002782773011302802852000902915856007802924655001203002IND4388518020221118100330.0070304e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438851802DNAL7 a171386242pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erl2082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerger, Susanne10aVisualization of dynamics of plant-pathogen interaction by novel combination of chlorophyll fluorescence imaging and statistical analysis: differential effects of virulent and avirulent strains of P. syringae and of oxylipins on A. thaliana  ap. 797-806.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPathogen infection leads to defence induction as well as to changes in carbohydrate metabolism of plants. Salicylic acid and oxylipins are involved in the induction of defence, but it is not known if these signalling molecules also mediate changes in carbohydrate metabolism. In this study, the effect of application of salicylic acid and the oxylipins 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and jasmonic acid on photosynthesis was investigated by kinetic chlorophyll fluorescence imaging and compared with the effects of infection by virulent and avirulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae. Both pathogen strains and OPDA caused a similar change in fluorescence parameters of leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana. The response to OPDA appeared faster compared with that to the pathogens and persisted only for a short time. Infiltration with jasmonic acid or salicylic acid did not lead to a localized and distinct fluorescence response of the plant. To capture the faint early symptoms of the plant response, a novel algorithm was applied identifying the unique fluorescence signature--the set of images that, when combined, yield the highest contrast between control and infected leaf segments. Unlike conventional fluorescence parameters, this non-biased approach indeed detected the infection as early as 6 h after inoculation with bacteria. It was posssible to identify distinct fluorescence signatures characterizing the early and late phases of the infection. Fluorescence signatures of both infection phases were found in leaves infiltrated with OPDA. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aplanting date 3aimage analysis 3aavirulent strains 3afluorescence 3ajasmonic acid 3apathogens 3aPseudomonas syringae 3aleaves 3aplant response 3asalicylic acid 3aphotosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3abacteria 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aChlorophyllxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCyclopentanesxpharmacology 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxpharmacology 2aFluorescence 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aOxylipins 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 2aPseudomonas syringaexclassificationxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aVirulence 0anonpathogenic strains1 aBenediktyová, Zuzana1 aMatouš, Karel1 aBonfig, Katharina1 aMueller, Martin J.1 aNedbal, Ladislav1 aRoitsch, Thomas0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2007 Mar., v. 58, no. 4 p.797-806dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erl2083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03324naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245020300202300001800405500002400423506007600447520164500523506003702168650001102205650001102216650002402227650002602251650001502277650003302292650001302325650002202338650001902360650003002379650000902409650002202418650002202440650003702462700001902499700002402518700001902542700002002561700002302581773013702604852000902741856008002750655001202830IND4438094720221207141909.0100604e20100615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443809472DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02951-092doi7 aPMC28934832pmcid7 a204184242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKönig, Stephan.10aTaqMan Real-Time PCR Assays To Assess Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Responses to Field Manipulation of Grassland Biodiversity: Effects of Soil Characteristics, Plant Species Richness, and Functional Traits  ap. 3765-3775.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLarge-scale (temporal and/or spatial) molecular investigations of the diversity and distribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) require considerable sampling efforts and high-throughput analysis. To facilitate such efforts, we have developed a TaqMan real-time PCR assay to detect and identify AMF in environmental samples. First, we screened the diversity in clone libraries, generated by nested PCR, of the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of AMF in environmental samples. We then generated probes and forward primers based on the detected sequences, enabling AMF sequence type-specific detection in TaqMan multiplex real-time PCR assays. In comparisons to conventional clone library screening and Sanger sequencing, the TaqMan assay approach provided similar accuracy but higher sensitivity with cost and time savings. The TaqMan assays were applied to analyze the AMF community composition within plots of a large-scale plant biodiversity manipulation experiment, the Jena Experiment, primarily designed to investigate the interactive effects of plant biodiversity on element cycling and trophic interactions. The results show that environmental variables hierarchically shape AMF communities and that the sequence type spectrum is strongly affected by previous land use and disturbance, which appears to favor disturbance-tolerant members of the genus GLOMUS: The AMF species richness of disturbance-associated communities can be largely explained by richness of plant species and plant functional groups, while plant productivity and soil parameters appear to have only weak effects on the AMF community.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlomus 3aclones 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental factors 3agrasslands 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aland use 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anuclear genome 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asoil 3asoil productivity 3aspecies diversity 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aWubet, Tesfaye1 aDormann, Carsten F.1 aHempel, Stefan1 aRenker, Carsten1 aBuscot, François.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2010 June 15, v. 76, no. 12 p.3765-3775dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02951-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03580naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245010100192300001800293500002400311520205300335650002202388650001602410650001402426650002602440650001702466650001302483650001202496650000902508650005202517650003302569650004702602650002202649650002102671651001802692651001802710653002602728653002702754653002302781653002802804653001802832653002002850653001602870700001802886773010602904852000903010856005503019655001203074IND4413337920221118095617.0081205e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441333792DNAL7 a187988602pmid7 a10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01058.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSEVERNS, PAUL M.10aIntraspecific Chromosome Number Variation: a Neglected Threat to the Conservation of Rare Plants  ap. 1641-1647.  aIncludes references  aThe effectiveness of rare plant conservation will increase when life history, demographic, and genetic data are considered simultaneously. Inbreeding depression is a widely recognized genetic concern in rare plant conservation, and the mixing of genetically diverse populations in restoration efforts is a common remedy. Nevertheless, if populations with unrecognized intraspecific chromosome variation are crossed, progeny fitness losses will range from partial to complete sterility, and reintroductions and population augmentation of rare plants may fail. To assess the current state of cytological knowledge of threatened and endangered plants in the continental United States, we searched available resources for chromosome counts. We also reviewed recovery plans to discern whether recovery criteria potentially place listed species at risk by requiring reintroductions or population augmentation in the absence of cytological information. Over half the plants lacked a chromosome count, and when a taxon did have a count it generally originated from a sampling intensity too limited to detect intraspecific chromosome variation. Despite limited past cytological sampling, we found 11 plants with documented intraspecific cytological variation, while 8 others were ambiguous for intraspecific chromosome variation. Nevertheless, only one recovery plan addressed the chromosome differences. Inadequate within-species cytological characterization, incomplete sampling among listed taxa, and the prevalence of interspecific and intraspecific chromosome variation in listed genera, suggests that other rare plants are likely to have intraspecific chromosome variation. Nearly 90% of all recovery plans called for reintroductions or population augmentation as part of recovery criteria despite the dearth of cytological knowledge. We recommend screening rare plants for intraspecific chromosome variation before reintroductions or population augmentation projects are undertaken to safeguard against inadvertent mixtures of incompatible cytotypes. 3achromosome number 3achromosomes 3acytotypes 3ainbreeding depression 3alife history 3aplanning 3aprogeny 3arisk 2aBreedingxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aGenetic Variation 2aPlantsxgenetics 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0aconservation genetics 0aEndangered Species Act 0alandscape genetics 0apopulation augmentation 0arecovery plan 0areintroductions 0arestoration1 aLISTON, AARON0 tConservation biology.g2008 Dec., v. 22, no. 6 p.1641-1647dBlackwell Publishing Incx0888-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.01058.x 7aarticle02727naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002200169245011300191300001800304500002400322520097100346650001901317650001901336650001101355650001801366650002801384650001401412650001101426650001101437650002101448650001401469650000701483650002601490650001401516650001101530650000901541650002201550650001301572650002001585650001201605650001201617650001101629650003101640650002101671650005101692650001001743650002401753650002101777650002001798650003401818700002601852700002001878700001901898700002301917773009901940852000902039856005302048655001202101IND4439978320221118100226.0100716e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443997832DNAL7 a206246032pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.05.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArawindara Kaura.10aCocomposting with and without Eisenia fetida for conversion of toxic paper mill sludge to a soil conditioner  ap. 8192-8198.  aIncludes references  aPresent study was envisaged for fast bioremediation of toxic paper mill sludge into a soil ameliorating agent. Although a rich source of organic carbon this sludge cannot be directly applied in fields and is recycled very slowly in landfills as it is deficient in other nutrients. Therefore it was mixed with cattle dung in various proportions and subjected to aerobic cocomposting (without worms) and vermicocomposting (with Eisenia fetida). It was observed that mixing cattle dung with the sludge improved physico-chemical characteristics (with transition metals in the permissible range for manures) of the products of both the processes and enhanced its acceptability for worms. Higher decline in organic carbon and higher content of nitrogen and phosphorous along with lower electrical conductivity and higher pH of the products of vermicomposting indicated that E. fetida helped in fast conversion of toxic paper mill sludge into a soil conditioner in 100days. 3aEisenia fetida 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3acattle manure 3aelectrical conductivity 3alandfills 3ametals 3amixing 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3apH 3apulp and paper sludge 3arecycling 3asludge 3asoil 3asoil conditioners 3atoxicity 3avermicomposting 2aAnimals 2aBiomass 2aCattle 2aIndustrial Wastexanalysis 2aManurexanalysis 2aOligochaetaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPaper 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSewagexanalysis 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aTransition Elementsxanalysis1 aJasawindara Siṅgha.1 aVig, Adarsh Pal1 aDhaliwal, S.S.1 aRup, Pushpinder J.0 tBioresource technology.g2010 Nov., v. 101, no. 21 p.8192-8198dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.05.041 7aarticle02107naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001300184245009500197300001400292506007600306520088100382506003701263650001801300650001001318650000901328650002501337650001501362650002901377650002601406650002201432700001501454700002501469773012201494852000901616856008301625946001301708655001201721IND4439407020221207143541.0100702e20100702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443940702DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11889892doi7 aPMC29353002pmcid7 a205956142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Long13aAn Early T Cell Lineage Commitment Checkpoint Dependent on the Transcription Factor Bcl11b  ap. 89-93.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe identities of the regulators that mediate commitment of hematopoietic precursors to the T lymphocyte lineage have been unknown. The last stage of T lineage commitment in vivo involves mechanisms to suppress natural killer cell potential, to suppress myeloid and dendritic cell potential, and to silence the stem cell or progenitor cell regulatory functions that initially provide T cell receptor-independent self-renewal capability. The zinc finger transcription factor Bcl11b is T cell-specific in expression among hematopoietic cell types and is first expressed in precursors immediately before T lineage commitment. We found that Bcl11b is necessary for T lineage commitment in mice and is specifically required both to repress natural killer cell-associated genes and to down-regulate a battery of stem cell or progenitor cell genes at the pivotal stage of commitment.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3agenes 3amice 3anatural killer cells 3astem cells 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3azinc finger motif1 aLeid, Mark1 aRothenberg, Ellen V.0 tScience.g2010 July 2, v. 329, no. 5987 p.89-93dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11889893Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02178naa a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245008500132300002000217300002800237500002300265500001500288520086800303650001301171650001601184650001601200650001801216650001701234650001401251650002601265650003501291650001201326650001001338650002001348650001901368653001601387653002001403653001801423653002301441653002401464653001301488653001301501773009401514852001301608939003301621945000801654946001301662852000901675655001201684991630381670742620221118095753.0911115e199106  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910034612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBouchard, C.10aCurrent understanding of the etiology of obesity: genetic and nongenetic factors  ap. 1561S-1565S.  ap. 1561S-1565S. charts.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-05  aFour types of human obesities are defined topography of fat deposition. The focus of the paper is on the genetic determinants and the nongenetic correlates of the first type, which is commonly defined as excess weight-for-height or excess body fat without a particular concentration of fat in a given area of the body. The heritability of fat mass or percent body fat derived from underwater-weighing assessment of body density reaches approximately 25% of the age- and gender-adjusted phenotypic variance. The within-identical-twin-pair resemblance in the response to a standardized overfeeding protocol emphasizes the importance of the genotype in determining individual differences in body weight and body composition. In this regard, the proneness to store energy primarily as fat or as lean tissue is a major determinant of the response to a caloric surplus. 3aetiology 3aoverfeeding 3aweight gain 3aenergy intake 3abody regions 3aphenotype 3abody fat distribution 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3aobesity 3atwins 3abody mass index 3alean body mass 0abody weight 0agenetic factors 0afat free mass 0aliterature reviews 0anutrient partioning 0azygosity 0abody fat0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1991 June, v.  53 p.1561S-1565Sx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245004700133300002000180300002800200500001500228520107200243650002801315650001101343650000801354650001001362650001501372650002201387650001201409650002301421650001101444650001101455650001401466651001801480653003601498653001801534653001301552773009401565852001301659930003301672945000801705946001301713852000901726655001201735991630381250742620221118095730.0911115e199106  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910034542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBennett, E.M.10aWeight-loss practices of overweight adults  ap. 1519S-1521S.  ap. 1519S-1521S. charts.  a2019-12-05  aData from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 1985-1988, were used to assess differences in weight-loss practices of overweight adults by sex and race. Data were available for 112,108 respondents from 21 states, aged greater than or equal to 18 y. Overweight was defined as body mass index greater than or equal to 27.3 for women and greater than or equal to 27.8 for men. Weight-loss practices were defined as increasing physical activity only, eating fewer calories only, increasing physical activity and eating fewer calories, and not trying to lose weight. The weight-loss practice most frequently reported by overweight women was increasing physical activity and eating fewer calories (blacks, 32%; whites, 33%). Overweight men most frequently reported not trying to lose weight (blacks, 55%; whites, 49%). Although the prevalence of overweight for black women was twice that for white women, weight-loss practices were similar for both groups. Prevalence of overweight was similar for black and white men but weight-loss practices differed slightly. 3aepidemiological studies 3aincome 3amen 3awomen 3aoverweight 3aphysical activity 3adieting 3agender differences 3aWhites 3aBlacks 3aeducation 3aUnited States 0anationalities and ethnic groups 0aweight losses 0abehavior0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1991 June, v.  53 p.1519S-1521Sx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245011600130300002000246500001500266520105600281650002001337650001601357650001101373650000801384650001001392650001601402650005301418650002501471650001301496650001101509650001101520650002001531650001401551653001801565653003601583700002101619773009401640852001301734939003301747945000801780946001301788852000901801655001201810991630380500742620221118100306.0911115e199106  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910034622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKahn, H.S.10aIs race associated with weight change in US adults after adjustment for income, education, and marital factors?  ap. 1566S-1570S.  a2019-12-05  aWe examined the 10-y change in body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2) of black and white adults who entered the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Followup Study at ages 25-44 y. In women the mean change in BMI was greater for blacks than for whites despite multiple adjustments. However, the risk of major weight gain (MWG; BMI change greater than or equal to +5) was nearly identical in black and white women. Womens' MWG was independently associated with low income [odds ratio (OR) = 1.7] and with becoming married (OR = 1.8). The risk of major weight loss (MWL; BMI change less than or equal to -2.5) was lower in black women than in white women (OR = 0.6). In men mean BMI change, MWG (BMI change greater than or equal to +4) and MWL (BMI change greater than or equal to -2) were not associated with race, but there were effects associated with low income, low education, and marital changes. Black race does not increase the risk of weight gain; in women it may be associated with a reduced likelihood of weight loss. 3abody mass index 3aweight gain 3aincome 3amen 3awomen 3abody weight 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3alongitudinal studies 3amarriage 3aWhites 3aBlacks 3adietary surveys 3aeducation 0aweight losses 0anationalities and ethnic groups1 aWilliamson, D.F.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1991 June, v.  53 p.1566S-1570Sx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245010500171300001600276500002400292500001500316520065700331650001800988650002001006650002501026650002001051650002201071650002401093650001801117650001801135650001401153650001301167650001001180650001601190650002001206650002201226650002001248650002101268653002201289700001801311700001801329700001401347700001901361700002001380773011801400852000901518856005501527655001201582IND4399021020221118100016.0071216e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439902102DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7917.2007.00172.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSHANG, JIN-YAN10aExpression of two types of acetylcholinesterase gene from the silkworm, Bombyx mori, in insect cells  ap. 443-449.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aComplementary DNAs encoding two types of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were isolated from the silkworm, Bombyx mori.

The objectives of this study were to determine (1) whether 3-ADON isolates differ in aggressiveness, as measured by the FHB index, and DON production from 15-ADON isolates under field conditions, and (2) whether the performance of resistant host cultivars was stable across isolates. Field tests of all isolates were conducted with three replicates at each of two locations in Canada and Germany in 2008 with three host genotypes differing in FHB resistance level. The resistant host genotype showed resistance regardless of the chemotype or location. The differences between mean FHB indices of 3-ADON and 15-ADON isolates were not significant for any wheat genotype. In contrast, average DON production by the 3-ADON isolates (10.44 mg kg⁻¹) was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than for the 15-ADON isolates (6.95 mg kg⁻¹) at three of the four locations where moderately resistant lines were tested, and at both locations where susceptible lines were evaluated. These results indicate that 3-ADON isolates could pose a greater risk to food safety. However, as the mean aggressiveness and DON production of 3-ADON and 15-ADON chemotypes was similar on highly resistant lines, breeding and use of highly resistant lines is still the most effective measure of reducing the risks associated with DON in wheat. 3aFusarium graminearum 3acultivars 3arisk 3achemotypes 3ahosts 3abreeding 3aspring wheat 3aFusarium head blight 3afield experimentation 3adeoxynivalenol 3aGermany 3aCanada 0aGibberella zeae 0aDON 0aFHB index 0aChemotype1 aGauthier, Victoria1 aTamburic-Ilincic, Lily1 aBrule-Babel, Anita1 aFernando, W.

Antioxidant or not?  ap. 268S-276S.  aFoods and beverages rich in phenolic compounds, especially flavonoids, have often been associated with decreased risk of developing several diseases. However, it remains unclear whether this protective effect is attributable to the phenols or to other agents in the diet. Alleged health-promoting effects of flavonoids are usually attributed to their powerful antioxidant activities, but evidence for in vivo antioxidant effects of flavonoids is confusing and equivocal. This may be because maximal plasma concentrations, even after extensive flavonoid intake, may be low (insufficient to exert significant systemic antioxidant effects) and because flavonoid metabolites tend to have decreased antioxidant activity. Reports of substantial increases in plasma total antioxidant activity after flavonoid intake must be interpreted with caution; findings may be attributable to changes in urate concentrations. However, phenols might exert direct effects within the gastrointestinal tract, because of the high concentrations present. These effects could include binding of prooxidant iron, scavenging of reactive nitrogen, chlorine, and oxygen species, and perhaps inhibition of cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases. Our measurements of flavonoids and other phenols in human fecal water are consistent with this concept. We argue that tocopherols and tocotrienols may also exert direct beneficial effects in the gastrointestinal tract and that their return to the gastrointestinal tract by the liver through the bile may be physiologically advantageous. 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeverages 3abile 3achlorine 3adiet 3aflavonoids 3agastrointestinal system 3ahealth promotion 3ahumans 3airon 3aliver 3ametabolites 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aphenols 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprotective effect 3arisk reduction 3atocopherols 3atocotrienols1 aRafter, Joseph1 aJenner, Andrew0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2005 Jan., v. 81 p.268S-276Sx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/81/1/268S.abstract3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140708  aOther US 7aarticle03263naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245010200131300001800233520176400251650001502015650001102030650001702041650001402058650002002072650001002092650001902102650000902121650002202130650001402152650001402166650001502180650001602195650001502211650001402226650001102240650001402251650001602265650001602281650001902297650002202316650001402338650000802352650001202360700002102372700002202393700002902415700002502444773009102469852000902560856009402569939003302663946001302696655001202709IND4482866120221118100059.0140708e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448286612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManach, Claudine10aBioavailability and bioefficacy of polyphenols in humans. I. Review of 97 bioavailability studies  ap. 230S-242S.  aPolyphenols are abundant micronutrients in our diet, and evidence for their role in the prevention of degenerative diseases is emerging. Bioavailability differs greatly from one polyphenol to another, so that the most abundant polyphenols in our diet are not necessarily those leading to the highest concentrations of active metabolites in target tissues. Mean values for the maximal plasma concentration, the time to reach the maximal plasma concentration, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, the elimination half-life, and the relative urinary excretion were calculated for 18 major polyphenols. We used data from 97 studies that investigated the kinetics and extent of polyphenol absorption among adults, after ingestion of a single dose of polyphenol provided as pure compound, plant extract, or whole food/beverage. The metabolites present in blood, resulting from digestive and hepatic activity, usually differ from the native compounds. The nature of the known metabolites is described when data are available. The plasma concentrations of total metabolites ranged from 0 to 4 μmol/L with an intake of 50 mg aglycone equivalents, and the relative urinary excretion ranged from 0.3% to 43% of the ingested dose, depending on the polyphenol. Gallic acid and isoflavones are the most well-absorbed polyphenols, followed by catechins, flavanones, and quercetin glucosides, but with different kinetics. The least well-absorbed polyphenols are the proanthocyanidins, the galloylated tea catechins, and the anthocyanins. Data are still too limited for assessment of hydroxycinnamic acids and other polyphenols.

Lymphocyte differentiation and maturation are altered by deficiency, delayed-type hypersensitivity responses are reduced, and antibody production may be indirectly impaired. Although repletion of the vitamin restores these functions, megadoses do not produce benefits beyond those observed with moderate supplementation. Additional human studies indicate that vitamin B6 status may influence tumor growth and disease processes. Deficiency of the vitamin has been associated with immunological changes observed in the elderly, persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and those with uremia or rheumatoid arthritis. Future research efforts should focus on establishing the mechanism underlying the effects of vitamin B6 on immunity and should attempt to establish safe intake levels that optimize immune response. 3apyridoxine 3aimmunocompetence 3avitamin deficiencies 3amen 3awomen 3aanimal experimentation 2aAgingximmunology 2aAnimals 2aAntibody Formation 2aHumans 2aImmunity, Cellular 2aImmunocompetence 2aPyridoxinexphysiology 2aVitamin B 6 Deficiencyximmunology 0aliterature reviews1 aMeydani, S.N.0 tNutrition reviews.g1993 Aug., v. 51, no. 8 p.217-225x0029-66437nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdJFM  aOther US 7aarticle02610naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010600128300001600234500001500250520159800265650001601863650001801879650002301897650001701920650001301937650001901950650002501969650001101994650001202005651001902017653002002036700001702056773009702073852000902170930003302179945001302212946001102225655001202236IND2035529520221118095855.0931025e199309  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203552952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarbottle, L.10aDietary assessment in Asian children--a comparison of the weighted inventory and diet history methods  ap. 666-672.  a2019-12-04  aA cross-sectional study of the dietary intake of Indo-Asian children, in Sheffield, aged 4-40 months, was carried out during a 1 year period. Weighed dietary inventories (facilitated by use of the PETRA electronic recording scale) and diet histories were completed, and analysis was carried out on the records of 117 children. This number is equivalent to a quarter of the estimated target population and 53% of those approached. The diet history method gave higher estimates of the dietary intake of most nutrients than the weighed inventory method (Wilcoxon's rank sum method), the differences represented 7%, 9%, 3%, 9% and 6% of the mean intakes of energy, protein, fat, iron and vitamin C respectively, and were significant for energy, protein and iron. Analysed by age group, differences were significant for energy at 12 to < 18 months; for iron at 6 to < 12 months and 12 to < 18 months; and for vitamin C at <6 months. There were no significant differences between the estimates of standardised energy or protein intakes, nor in the estimates, by the two methods, of total energy (%) derived from protein or fat. Mean energy intake per kg was equivalent to basal metabolic rate (BMR)* 1.49 by weighed inventory and BMR*1.58 by diet history. Energy intake was expressed as a ratio of age-adjusted 'reference' energy expenditure [A.M. Prentice et aL (1988) The Lancet 2, 1066-1069], the modal ratio energy intake/energy expenditure was 0.75 to <1.0 for both weighed inventory and diet history methods, suggesting that the observed levels of energy intake were within a reasonable range. 3afood intake 3aenergy intake 3aenergy expenditure 3adiet history 3achildren 3aprotein intake 3anutrition assessment 3aAsians 3ainfants 3aUnited Kingdom 0anutrient intake1 aDuggan, M.B.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1993 Sept., v. 47, no. 9 p.666-672x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01328naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010800128300001400236520050000250650002400750650002300774650001900797650003900816651001800855653000900873653001400882773008700896852000900983939003300992946001301025655001201038IND9203798820221118095907.0920615e198204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920379882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, F.D.10aGeneralized variables for controlling government transfer services with respect to performance measures  ap. 71-82.  aThe term Government Transfer Services is used in reference to any of the organized streams of public resources that flow into private economic activity.

Infectious clones corresponding to these two isolates and their chimeric clones resulting from swapping different regions of genomic cDNA between L and L-RB were constructed. Only L-RB or chimeras containing the middle fragment of L-RB cDNA showed virulence on Rsv4–genotype soybean. Sequence comparison analysis revealed that the middle genomic region of L and L-RB encodes four different amino acids. Point mutagenesis demonstrated that a single amino acid substitution (Q1033K) in the P3 protein determined virulence toward Rsv4 resistance. In addition, six new SMV Rsv4 resistance-breaking isolates, variants of the second passage on Williams 82 infected with the chimeras or mutants noninfectious on soybean carrying Rsv4, were obtained. Sequencing data indicated that these new isolates contain either the Q1033K mutation or a new substitution (G1054R) in P3. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the virulence role of the G1054R mutation on Rsv4-genotype soybean. Taken together, these data suggest that P3 of the SMV G2 strain is an avirulent determinant for Rsv4 and one single nucleotide mutation in P3 may be sufficient to compromise its elicitor function. 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3aSoybean mosaic virus 3aplant viruses 3aviral proteins 3amutation 3avirulence 3agenetic resistance 3adisease resistance 3agenotype 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3achimerism 3acomplementary DNA 3asequence analysis 3astrain differences 0aresistance-breaking strains 0amolecular sequence data1 aSun, Haiyue1 aChen, Hongyan1 aPoysa, Vaino1 aLing, Hong1 aGijzen, Mark1 aWang, Aiming0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2011 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.37-43dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-07-10-01583Available from publisher's Web site  a20110403b20110507c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/01/25  aOther US 7aarticle03055naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125072000900143072000900152100002100161245013700182300001400319500002400333500001500357520144700372650001801819650001801837650003101855650001401886650002601900650001301926650003701939650001601976650001901992650001902011650002302030650001402053650001202067650001402079650002802093653001602121653002602137653002102163653002102184700002002205700002202225773010302247852000902350856008302359930003302442945002502475946001302500655001202513IND4447127820221118095351.0110102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444712782DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-04-10-00892doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF833 0aF6001 aAngel, Carlos A.10aComparative Analysis of the Capacity of Tombusvirus P22 and P19 Proteins to Function as Avirulence Determinants in Nicotiana species  ap. 91-99.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe have used an agroinfiltration assay for a comparative study of the roles of tombusvirus P22 and P19 proteins in elicitation of hypersensitive response (HR)-like necrosis and the role of P19 in silencing suppression in Nicotiana species. The advantage of agroinfiltration rather than expression in plant virus vectors is that putative viral avirulence proteins can be evaluated in isolation, eliminating the possibility of synergistic effects with other viral proteins. We found that tombusvirus P22 and P19 proteins elicited HR-like necrosis in certain Nicotiana species but, also, that Nicotiana species could recognize subtle differences in sequence between these proteins. Furthermore, Nicotiana species that responded with systemic necrosis to virion inoculations responded to agroinfiltration of tombusvirus P19 with a very weak and delayed necrosis, indicating that the rapid HR-like necrosis was associated with putative resistance genes and a plant defense response that limited the spread of the virus. Tombusvirus P19 proteins also appeared to differ in their effectiveness as silencing suppressors; in our assay, the P19 proteins of Cymbidium ringspot virus and Tomato bushy stunt virus were stronger silencing suppressors than Cucumber necrosis virus P20. Finally, we show that agroinfiltration can be used to track the presence of putative plant resistance genes in Nicotiana species that target either tombusvirus P19 or P22. 3aplant viruses 3aplant tissues 3agene-for-gene relationship 3aNicotiana 3alaboratory techniques 3anecrosis 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aTombusvirus 3agene silencing 3aviral proteins 3adisease resistance 3asynergism 3astrains 3avirulence 3ahypersensitive response 0amethodology 0aresistance mechanisms 0aresistance genes 0aagroinfiltration1 aHsieh, Yi-Cheng1 aSchoelz, James E.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2011 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.91-99dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-04-10-00893Available from publisher's Web site  a20110403b20110507c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/01/25  aOther US 7aarticle02432naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009500127300001600222500025000238520136600488650001901854650001501873650001701888650001001905653001601915653001801931700001401949700002001963773008001983852000902063939003302072946001302105655001202118IND9203800120221118095422.0920616e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920380012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamsay, T.G.10aIn vitro systems for the analysis of the development of adipose tissue in domestic animals  ap. 806-817.  aPresented at the 56th Annual Poultry Nutrition Conference on "In Vitro Approaches to Understanding Growth and Development" held at the 75th Annual Meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, April 21, 1991, Atlanta.  aIn vitro models have been used for many years to assess processes that regulate metabolic activity of adipocytes or that regulate proliferation and differentiation of precursor cells for adipocytes (preadipocytes). The results of these studies have been useful in characterizing the role of various hormones and growth factors in regulating the cellular activities of preadipocytes and adipocytes from domestic animals. Mechanisms that regulate the proliferation and differentiation of the preadipocyte are currently being evaluated with the use of a variety of cell culture systems: matrix suspension, coverslip, micromass, clonal etc. Isolated cell culture of adipose tissue and the tools of molecular biology have allowed direct examination of the effects of potential regulatory hormones of adipogenesis upon gene expression during the development of adipose tissue in domestic animals. Much information has been collected by combining the use of in vivo animal manipulations and in vitro assay techniques to elucidate the mechanisms that affect adipocyte function or formation. The development of in vitro tools to manipulate the development of adipose tissue should result in an increase in our knowledge of the regulation of adipose tissue formation and thus should permit the development of methods to produce leaner and more efficient domestic animals. 3aadipose tissue 3aadipocytes 3acell culture 3aswine 0adevelopment 0apreadipocytes1 aRao, S.V.1 aWolverton, C.K.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1992 Mar., v. 122, no. 3S p.806-817x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02283naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006200126300001600188500019700204520139000401650002001791650002301811650001201834650001501846650000901861773008001870852000901950939003301959946001301992655001202005IND9203799320221118095346.0920615e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920379932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarbach, U.10aParacellular calcium transport across the small intestine  ap. 672-677.  aPresented at a symposium on "Current Concepts of Calcium Absorption" given at the 75th Annual Meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, April 22, 1991, Atlanta.  aConcentration and voltage dependence of unidirectional 45Ca transport measurements indicated that approximately 60-70% of the mucosa-to-serosa calcium flux measured across the short-circuited rat duodenum, jejunum and ileum is paracellular, with only 30-40% of the mucosa-to-serosa calcium transport cellular. The calcium flux from serosa to mucosa was purely paracellular in all segments. Duodenal calcium serosal-to-mucosal flux was of the same order of magnitude as the mucosal-to-serosal paracellular movement. However, the serosal-to-mucosal flux of jejunum and ileum was twice as high. Therefore, net calcium absorption occurs only in the duodenum, whereas calcium is secreted in the jejunum and ileum by a passive paracellular route, presumably involving an anomalous solvent drag effect. Administration of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-(OH)2D3) led to an increase in the transcellular mucosa-to-serosa flux in the duodenum only. It also led to a stimulation of paracellular calcium flux in both directions in all three intestinal segments, with no change in net paracellular calcium absorption. Thus, the only vitamin D-related increase in calcium absorption was due to the increase in duodenal transcellular absorption. The mechanism by which 1,25-(OH)2D3 increased paracellular flux is not known but may have resulted from an osmotic effect on the intercellular spaces. 3asmall intestine 3anutrient transport 3acalcium 3acalcitriol 3arats0 tJournal of nutrition.g1992 Mar., v. 122, no. 3S p.672-677x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01992naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008900126300001600215500025000231520099700481650001701478650001701495650001001512650001501522650001101537700001901548773008001567852000901647939003301656946001301689655001201702IND9203800020221118095844.0920616e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920380002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeach, R.M.14aThe use of avian epiphyseal chondrocytes for in vitro studies of skeletal metabolism  ap. 802-805.  aPresented at the 56th Annual Poultry Nutrition Conference on "In Vitro Approaches to Understanding Growth and Development" held at the 75th Annual Meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, April 21, 1991, Atlanta.  aChondrocytes from the postembryonic avian epiphyseal growth plate are easily obtained and can be successfully cultured for a considerable length of time. Under the proper culture conditions, the chondrocytes will become confluent and achieve a hypertrophic morphology followed by mineralization of the extracellular matrix. Although this can be accomplished with a serum-free medium, the process is accelerated in the presence of serum. Minimal growth factor requirements for the serum-free medium include fibroblast growth factor and insulin-like growth factor. Transforming growth factor-beta and parathyroid hormone are also mitogenic for chondrocytes. Chondrocytes may have more critical requirements for amino acids because further supplementation of a conventional medium such as Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium results in improved performance of the cultured cells. Ascorbic acid in the medium is very important for matrix vesicle production and mineralization of cartilage nodules. 3achondrocytes 3acell culture 3abones 3ametabolism 3achicks1 aRosselot, G.E.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1992 Mar., v. 122, no. 3S p.802-805x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02929naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245008900192300001600281500002400297500001500321520139200336650002401728650001501752650001501767650001501782650001301797650001501810650001401825650001501839650001501854650001401869650001401883650001201897650001001909650001401919650002101933650001501954650001501969650001201984650002001996650001702016650001602033650002302049650002402072650001202096650001702108653001402125700001902139700002102158773010802179852000902287856005502296655001202351IND4456334520221118095830.0110408e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445633452DNAL7 a212509902pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01800.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, Zachary T.10aFood chain length and omnivory determine the stability of a marine subtidal food web  ap. 586-594.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  a1. Using a subtidal marine food web as a model system, we examined how food chain length (predators present or absent) and the prevalence of omnivory influenced temporal stability (and its components) of herbivores and plants. We held the density of top predators constant but manipulated their identity to generate a gradient in omnivory prevalence. 2. We measured temporal stability as the inverse of the coefficient of variation of abundance over time. Predators and omnivory could influence temporal stability through effects on abundance (the ‘abundance' effect), summed variance across taxa (the ‘portfolio effect') or summed covariances among taxa (the ‘covariance effect'). 3. We found that increasing food chain length by predator addition destabilized aggregate herbivore abundance through their cascading effects on abundances. Thus, predators destabilized herbivores through the overyielding effect. We also found that the stability of herbivore abundance and microalgae declined with increasing prevalence of omnivory among top predators. Aggregate macroalgae was not affected, but the stability of one algal taxon increased with the prevalence of omnivory. 4. Our results suggest that herbivores are more sensitive than plants to changes in food web structure because of predator additions by invasion or deletions such as might occur via harvesting and habitat loss. 3ahabitat destruction 3aharvesting 3amacroalgae 3amicroalgae 3avariance 3aherbivores 3apredators 3afood chain 3acovariance 3aomnivores 2aAmphipoda 2aAnimals 2aBiota 2aEcosystem 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFood Chain 2aFundulidae 2aIsopoda 2aOceans and Seas 2aPalaemonidae 2aPerciformes 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSeaweed 2aTime Factors 0afood webs1 aBruno, John F.1 aDuffy, J.

Therefore, we assessed whether MET-h/week of total physical activity (moderate-to-vigorous intensity), walking, or vigorous physical activity, and h/week of standing or sitting were associated with plasma concentrations of several hormones. We examined levels of estrogens, androgens, progesterone, prolactin, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), IGF binding protein-3, and growth hormone (GH) in 565 premenopausal women, ages 33-52 years, from the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII). About 87% of women had both timed follicular and luteal samples; other women had one untimed sample. In general we observed few associations between sex hormone or IGF levels and measures of physical activity or inactivity. However, free testosterone was modestly inversely associated with total physical activity (p-trend = 0.02). Luteal estradiol, free estradiol, and estrone also were inversely associated with total physical activity (p-trend = 0.10, 0.04, 0.01, respectively); however, the trend was substantially attenuated when excluding women with anovulatory cycles or irregular cycles. These cross-sectional results suggest that physical activity and inactivity have limited associations with premenopausal sex hormone and growth factor levels, except possibly luteal estrogens. 3aphysical activity 3asex hormones 3aprolactin 0aPremenopausal women 0aIGF-11 aMissmer, Stacey A. 1 aEliassen, A.

Polymorphic variation in CYP1A1 activity may modify susceptibility to endometrial cancer through the oxidative metabolism of estradiol and the activation of tobacco-smoke constituents. We prospectively evaluated the associations between three common CYP1A1 polymorphisms and endometrial cancer risk, as well as the potential modification of these associations by cigarette smoking, in a case-control study nested within the Nurses' Health Study. We investigated the MspI restriction-site polymorphism, a C [rightward arrow] A transversion at nucleotide 4887 (Thr461Asn) and a A [rightward arrow] G transition at nucleotide 4889 (Ile462Val) among 456 women with endometrial cancer and 1,134 matched controls. We used conditional logistic regression to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to quantify the risk of endometrial cancer among subjects who had at least one variant allele compared with that of subjects homozygous for the wild-type allele. We did not observe any statistically significant associations between the MspI, Thr461Asn or Ile462Val polymorphisms and endometrial cancer risk or any significant effect modification by cigarette-smoking status. These data suggest that these three polymorphisms are not important in determining genetic susceptibility to endometrial cancer, although larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings. 3asmoking (habit) 3aepidemiology 2aAdult 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP1A1xgenetics 2aEndometrial Neoplasmsxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHumans 2aHydrocarbons, Aromaticxadverse effects 2aMiddle Aged 2aNurses 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aProspective Studies 2aRetrospective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aSmokingxadverse effects 0aUnited States 0aEndometrial cancer 0aCytochrome P4501A11 aHankinson, Susan E. 1 aDe Vivo, Immaculata 0 tCancer causes & control.g2007 Dec., v. 18, no. 10 p.1123-1130dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-007-9051-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20070930b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02874naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245012000154300002200274500002400296520142300320650001101743650001901754650002801773650001001801650001601811650001301827650002201840650001601862650001701878650001101895650001401906650001801920650002101938650002001959653002401979700002002003700002202023700002202045773018002067852000902247856007702256930003302333945002502366946001302391655001202404IND4447355820221118095816.0110114e20101208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444735582DNAL7 a10.1021/jf10322622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Jingsong10aTuber-Specific Silencing of the Acid Invertase Gene Substantially Lowers the Acrylamide-Forming Potential of Potato  ap. 12162–12167.  aIncludes references  aSome popular processed foods including French fries contain small amounts of toxic acrylamide. Efforts to lower the accumulation of this reactive compound by modifying the production process have a negative effect on sensory characteristics and are not broadly applicable. This study optimized a method developed more than a decade ago to lower the accumulation of the acrylamide precursors glucose and fructose in cold-stored tubers. In contrast to the original application, which lowered hexose content by one-third through constitutive expression of an antisense copy of the cold-inducible acid invertase (Inv) gene, the current approach was based on tuber-specific expression of an Inv-derived inverted repeat. Stored tubers of transgenic plants contained as little as 2% of the reducing sugars that accumulated in controls. This decline in glucose and fructose formation is counterbalanced by increased sucrose and starch levels. However, it did not trigger any phenotypic changes and also did not affect the formation of free asparagine, ascorbic acid, phenylalanine, and chlorogenic acid. Importantly, French fries from the low-invertase tubers contained up to 8-fold reduced amounts of acrylamide. Given the important role of processed potato products in the modern Western diet, a replacement of current varieties with the low-hexose potatoes would reduce the average daily intake of acrylamide by one-fourth. 3atubers 3agene silencing 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3agenes 3aacrylamides 3apotatoes 3aSolanum tuberosum 3afood safety 3aFrench fries 3asugars 3acultivars 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3agene expression 0aacid invertase gene1 aShakya, Roshani1 aShrestha, Pradeep1 aRommens, Caius M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Dec. 8, v. 58, no. 23 p.12162–12167-12162–12167dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf10322623Available from publisher's Web site  a20110512b20110603c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/04/29  aOther US 7aarticle02626naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001300137245006500150300002200215500002400237500001500261520110500276650002101381650001901402650001701421650001101438650001701449650001901466650001701485650002201502650001001524650002001534651001001554653001901564653001601583653002401599700001501623700002001638700001701658700001901675700002001694700001501714700001201729700001801741773018001759852000901939856007701948930003302025945002502058946001302083655001202096IND4447355720221118095938.0110114e20101208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444735572DNAL7 a10.1021/jf103366g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Gang10aDiterpenoid Constituents of the Roots of Salvia digitaloides  ap. 12157–12161.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSalvia digitaloides, belonging to the economically and medicinally important genus Salvia, is distributed in the northwest of Yunnan Province, People's Republic of China. The roots of this plant were soaked in alcohol by local Tibetans to make a special traditional “red wine”, and many local people like to drink this traditional “red wine” to strengthen physical health. To investigate the bioactive diterpenoid constituents of the roots, a detailed phytochemical study was carried out, and 13 diterpenoids including two new norditerpenoids, dihydroneotanshinlactone (1) and 16,17-dinorpisferal A (2), were isolated. Their structures were established on the basis of detailed spectroscopic analysis. In addition, computational methods were applied to validate the stereochemistry of compound 1. For the bioassay to inhibit the growth of five tumor cell lines, neotanshinlactone (3) exhibited selective cytotoxic activity toward the human breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3, while the other four tanshinones (4−7) showed significant toxicity effects against all of the tested five cell lines. 3ahuman cell lines 3aplant pigments 3acell culture 3aSalvia 3acytotoxicity 3aplant extracts 3aditerpenoids 3atraditional foods 3aroots 3astereochemistry 3aChina 0aphytochemicals 0atanshinones 0aSalvia digitaloides1 aYang, Jing1 aWang, Yuan-Yuan1 aPeng, Li-Yan1 aYang, Xian-Wen1 aPan, Zheng-Hong1 aLiu, En-De1 aLi, Yan1 aZhao, Qin-Shi0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Dec. 8, v. 58, no. 23 p.12157–12161-12157–12161dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf103366g3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110512b20110603c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/04/29  aOther US 7aarticle03179naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245011800155300002200273500002400295500001500319520171800334650002102052650001702073650002002090650001702110650001902127650002002146650002402166650001702190650002002207650002302227650001402250653001402264653003802278653002602316653001702342700002502359773018002384852000902564856007702573930003302650945002502683946001302708655001202721IND4447355620221118100021.0110114e20101208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444735562DNAL7 a10.1021/jf103306k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGasmi, Jihane10aGrowth Inhibitory, Antiandrogenic, and Pro-apoptotic Effects of Punicic Acid in LNCaP Human Prostate Cancer Cells  ap. 12149–12156.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aProstate cancer is a commonly diagnosed cancer in men, and dietary chemoprevention by pomegranate (Punica granatum) extracts has shown noticeable benefits. In this study, we investigated the growth inhibitory, antiandrogenic, and pro-apoptotic effects of 13 pure compounds found in the pomegranate in androgen-dependent LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. Cells deprived of steroid hormones were exposed to increasing concentrations (1−100 μM) of pomegranate compounds in the presence of 0.1 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and the inhibition of cell growth was measured by WST-1 colorimetric assay after a 4 day exposure. Four compounds, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), delphinidin chloride, kaempferol, and punicic acid, were found to inhibit DHT-stimulated cell growth at concentrations of 10 μM and above. These four pomegranate compounds inhibited DHT-stimulated androgen receptor nuclear accumulation and the expression of the androgen receptor-dependent genes prostate specific antigen and steroid 5α-reductase type 1 at concentrations ≥10 μM. We determined the possible contribution of apoptosis to the observed decrease in cell growth and found that three compounds, EGCG, kaempferol, and, in particular, punicic acid, induced DNA fragmentation after a 24 h treatment, at concentrations in the 10−100 μM range. Punicic acid, an important fatty acid in pomegranate seeds, was further found to induce intrinsic apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway. In conclusion, punicic acid, the main constituent of pomegranate seed (70−80%), exhibited potent growth inhibitory activities in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells, which appear to be mediated by both antiandrogenic and pro-apoptotic mechanisms. 3ahuman cell lines 3apomegranates 3aPunica granatum 3acell culture 3afruit extracts 3agene expression 3aprostatic neoplasms 3atestosterone 3aenzyme activity 3acell proliferation 3aapoptosis 0aandrogens 0aLNCaP human prostate cancer cells 0aantiandrogenic effect 0apunicic acid1 aSanderson, J.

Methods This multi-center case-control study included 2,056 male and 576 female lung cancer incidence cases diagnosed from 1998 to 2001 and 2,144 male and 727 female controls frequency-matched for sex and age. Unconditional regression models were applied to calculate the odds ratios after controlling for potential confounders including age (5-year groups), study center (15 centers), and tobacco pack-years. Results Elevated odds ratios (ORs) were found for men employed as production workers (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.22-1.72), bookkeepers and cashiers (1.81, 1.03-3.24), general farmers (1.67, 1.08-2.60), livestock workers (2.54, 1.09-5.88), miners (2.17, 1.47-3.23), toolmakers and metal patternmakers (2.56, 1.34-4.94), glass formers (2.55, 1.18-5.50), dockworkers, and freight handlers (1.49, 1.04-2.12). Industries with elevated risk among men included mining (1.75, 1.20-2.57), manufacture of cement, lime, or plaster (3.62, 1.11-12.00), casting of metals (2.00, 1.17-3.45), manufacture of electric motors (2.18, 1.24-3.86). For women, elevated ORs were found for medical, dental, veterinary doctors (2.54, 1.01-6.31), librarians and curators (7.03, 1.80-27.80), sewers 3.63 (1.12-10.23). Conclusions This study identifies new areas for further, explanatory analyses, especially in production work, and indicates new possible sources of exposure to cancer risk for women. 3alung neoplasms 2aAdult 2aAged 2aCase-Control Studies 2aConfidence Intervals 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInterviews as Topic 2aLung Neoplasmsxepidemiology 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOccupational Diseasesxepidemiology 2aOccupational Exposure 2aOccupationsxclassification 2aOdds Ratio 2aRisk Factors 0aEurope, Easternxepidemiology. 0aOccupational exposures 0aISCO 0aNACE Classifications1 aLissowska, Jolanta 1 aZaridze, David 1 aSzeszenia-Dąbrowska, Neonila.1 aRudnai, Peter 1 aFabianova, Eleonora 1 aMates, Dana 1 aNavratilova, Marie 1 aBencko, V.1 aJanout, Vladimir 1 aFevotte, Joelle 1 aFletcher, Tony 1 a't Mannetje, Andrea 1 aBrennan, Paul 1 aBoffetta, Paolo 0 tCancer causes & control.g2007 Aug., v. 18, no. 6 p.645-654dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-007-9010-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03323naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245011100191300001600302520189600318650001802214650000902232650002502241650001202266650002502278650001102303650000902314650001102323650002202334650001102356650003502367650000902402650000902411650001502420650001202435650000902447650001002456653001902466700001902485700002102504700001802525700001402543773012102557852000902678856008602687930003302773946001102806655001202817IND4391952820221118095956.0070529e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439195282DNAL7 a172429802pmid7 a10.1007/s10552-006-0104-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaramawi, Mohammed F. 10aConsumption of different types of meat and the risk of renal cancer: meta-analysis of case-control studies  ap. 125-133.  aBackground Kidney cancers account for almost 2% of all cancers worldwide, with 150,000 new cases and 78,000 deaths from the disease occurring annually. An increase in the incidence of kidney neoplasm in western countries was noticed in the past few years. Between 1988 and 1992, the incidence of renal cancer per 100,000 person-year among males in USA, Norway, and France was 34.1, 9.00, and 16.10, respectively. Among females in the same countries, it was 5.70, 5.00, and 7.30, respectively. Although several individual case-control studies examined the association of meat intake and renal cancer risk, the results were inconsistent because of the insufficient statistical power of the individual studies. Therefore, the following meta-analysis was designed to help in clarifying the association. Methods Electronic search of MEDLINE, OVID, and PUBMED databases which have articles published between (1966 and 2006) was conducted to select studies for this meta-analysis. Statistical analysis Fixed and random-effects meta-analytical techniques were used to estimate the overall association between meat consumption and kidney cancer. Results Thirteen case-control studies were found. This meta-analysis supported a positive relationship between meat consumption and risk of renal cancer. Summary results indicated that there was from 20% to 22% higher risk of renal cancer among those in the highest relative to the lowest category of poultry and processed meat consumption. Consumption of all meat and red meat was associated with 27% and 30% higher risk, respectively. The increased risks were statistically significant. Conclusions Increased consumption of all meat, red meat, poultry, and processed meat is associated with an increase risk of kidney cancer. Reduction of meat consumption is an important approach to decreasing the incidence of kidney cancer in the general population. 3ameta-analysis 3ameat 3acase-control studies 2aAnimals 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCattle 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aFood Preservation 2aHumans 2aKidney Neoplasmsxepidemiology 2aMale 2aMeat 2aOdds Ratio 2aPoultry 2aRisk 2aSwine 0aRenal neoplasm1 aJohnson, Eric 1 aFry, M.

To gain more insight on the role of urinary tract diseases in bladder cancer risk, we analyzed data from a large case-control study of bladder cancer. Methods Epidemiological data were collected via in-person interview. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate BC risk in association with prior history of urinary tract diseases. Results A total of 659 BC patients and 689 age-, gender-, -ethnicity matched controls were included in the analyses. Increased bladder cancer risk was associated with history of cystitis (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.12, 2.06), however, the risk was attenuated for infections diagnosed >1 year from the time of BC diagnosis or interview. In contrast, a history of four or more kidney infections was associated with a significant decreased risk of BC (OR=0.17, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.69), and there was a significant dose-response relationship between number of episode and BC risk (P for trend = 0.002). The joint effect of smoking with cystitis, kidney infection, bladder stone, kidney stone, and prostate infection was studied but revealed no significant interaction between smoking and these urinary tract diseases. Conclusion This study does not support the concept that urinary tract infections play a major role in the development of BC. Our study has the strength of collecting diagnosis time data of urinary tract diseases to allow analyzing the impact of timing of diagnosis between cancer and urinary tract diseases. This enables us to effectively address the issue of detection bias in case-controls studies of prior urinary diseases and BC. 3aurinary tract diseases 3acase-control studies 2aCase-Control Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aRisk Factors 2aSmoking 2aUrinary Bladder Neoplasmsxepidemiology 2aUrologic Diseasesxcomplications 0aBladder cancer1 aLin, Jie 1 aBallow, Rebecca 1 aKamat, Ashish M. 1 aGrossman, H.

A total of 232 beers were fingerprinted and classified through multivariate data analysis. The selected beer was clearly distinguished from beers of different brands, while only 3 samples (3.5% of the test set) were wrongly classified when compared with other types of beer of the same Trappist brewery. The fingerprints were further analyzed to extract the most discriminating variables, which proved to be sufficient for classification, even using a simplified unsupervised model. This reduced fingerprint allowed us to study the influence of batch-to-batch variability on the classification model. Our results can easily be applied to different matrices and they confirmed the effectiveness of LC-MS profiling in combination with multivariate data analysis for the characterization of food products. 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3aproduct authenticity 3abeers 3atraditional technology 3aprovenance 3afood quality 3abrewing industry 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aclassification 3atraceability 3acountry of origin labeling 0aTrappist beers1 aStocchero, Matteo1 aMoreno-Rojas, Jose Manuel1 aGiordano, Giuseppe1 aReniero, Fabiano1 aGuillou, Claude0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Dec. 8, v. 58, no. 23 p.12089–12095-12089–12095dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf102632g3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110512b20110603c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/04/28  aOther US 7aarticle02961naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245009900178300001800277500002400295520141200319650004301731650002401774650000901798650001401807650001201821650001701833650001301850650001901863650002801882650002401910650002201934650001301956650002301969650002701992650002702019650001302046650001902059650002802078650004602106651002802152700002102180700001702201700002102218700001702239700001502256773010302271852000902374856004802383655001202431IND4384219020221118100244.0061010e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438421902DNAL7 a168967072pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-006-0372-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStich, B.12aA new test for family-based association mapping with inbred lines from plant breeding programs  ap. 1121-1130.  aIncludes references  aAssociation mapping holds great promise for the detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in plant breeding populations. The main objectives of this study were to (1) adapt the quantitative pedigree disequilibrium test to typical pedigrees of inbred lines produced in plant breeding programs, (2) compare the newly developed quantitative inbred pedigree disequilibrium test (QIPDT) with the commonly employed logistic regression ratio test (LRRT), with respect to the power and type I error rate of QTL detection, and (3) demonstrate the use of the QIPDT by applying it to flowering data of European elite maize inbreds. QIPDT and LRRT were compared based on computer simulations modeling 55 years of hybrid maize breeding in Central Europe. Furthermore, we applied QIPDT to a cross-section of 49 European elite maize inbred lines genotyped with 722 amplified fragment length polymorphism markers and phenotyped in four environments for days to anthesis. Compared to LRRT, the power to detect QTL was higher with QIPDT when using data collected routinely in plant breeding programs. Application of QIPDT to the 49 European maize inbreds resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) association located at a position for which a consensus QTL was detected in a previous study. The results of our study suggested that QIPDT is a promising QTL detection method for data collected routinely in plant breeding programs. 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3acomputer simulation 3acorn 3aflowering 3ahybrids 3ainbred lines 3apedigree 3aplant breeding 3aquantitative trait loci 3aregression analysis 3asimulation models 2aBreeding 2aChromosome Mapping 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aLinkage Disequilibrium 2aPedigree 2aPilot Projects 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aZea maysxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 3aCentral European region1 aMelchinger, A.E.1 aPiepho, H.P.1 aHeckenberger, M.1 aMaurer, H.P.1 aReif, J.C.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2006 Oct., v. 113, no. 6 p.1121-1130dSpringerx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-006-0372-5 7aarticle03238naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002300186245008200209300001600291520131200307650002001619650002401639650001001663650002101673650000901694650003801703650002501741650002501766650004401791650001101835650001101846650001401857650002401871650000901895650001601904650002801920650005701948650001502005650006502020650003202085650001702117650002902134653001602163653001902179653002002198700002302218700002402241700001902265700003202284700002102316700002202337773011502359852000902474856008502483930003302568946001102601655001202612IND4394012420221118100204.0070812e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439401242DNAL7 a176470852pmid7 aPMC21399002pmcid7 a10.1007/s10552-007-9026-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorse, Douglas E. 10aSmoking and drinking in relation to oral cancer and oral epithelial dysplasia  ap. 919-929.  aObjective Risks associated with smoking and drinking are not necessarily constant over the multistage pathway to oral cancer. We investigated whether smoking and drinking patterns differ for persons with oral cancer (OC) relative to those with oral epithelial dysplasia (OED), a precancerous condition. Methods Incident cases of OC and OED were interviewed using a questionnaire containing questions on smoking and drinking. Odds ratios (ORs) compared the odds of smoking and drinking among persons with OC relative to OED. Results No adjusted ORs for smoking achieved statistical significance; however, most were <1.0. The odds of OC relative to OED increased with drinking level; the adjusted OR for 19+ drinks/week was 3.03 (1.56-5.87). Age drinking began and years of drinking were not notably different for OC and OED cases; a higher proportion of OC cases reported discontinuing alcohol for 9+ years before diagnosis. Conclusions The relationship between smoking and OED was at least as strong as that for smoking and OC, suggesting that smoking may have its greatest impact on oral carcinogenesis prior to malignant transformation. Drinking was more strongly associated with OC than OED, particularly at elevated consumption levels; the role of alcohol does not appear limited to a late-stage effect. 3asmoking (habit) 3aalcoholic beverages 2aAdult 2aAge Distribution 2aAged 2aAlcohol Drinkingxadverse effects 2aCase-Control Studies 2aConfidence Intervals 2aEthnicityxstatistics & numerical data. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aInterviews as Topic 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMouth Mucosaxpathology 2aMouth Neoplasmsxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxpathology. 2aOdds Ratio 2aPrecancerous Conditionsxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxpathology. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aSmokingxadverse effects 0aOral cancer 0aOral dysplasia 0aMouth neoplasms1 aPsoter, Walter J. 1 aCleveland, Deborah 1 aCohen, Donald 1 aMohit-Tabatabai, Mireseyed 1 aKosis, Diane L. 1 aEisenberg, Ellen 0 tCancer causes & control.g2007 Nov., v. 18, no. 9 p.919-929dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-007-9026-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20070812b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03604naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245012200161300001600283500002400299520198800323650002602311650001502337650001202352650001102364650002402375650002702399650001002426650001402436650001502450650001002465650002102475650001102496650001402507650001502521650001302536650001902549650001302568650002002581650001002601650002802611650002102639650002002660650002202680651001002702700001702712700001702729700001702746773010002763852000902863856008502872930003302957945002502990946001103015655001203026IND4447458320221118095923.0110114e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444745832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-010-9361-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, J.

Haloxylon ammodendron is an ecologically important component of the desert ecosystem and is one of the main shrub species used for ecological restoration. We compared the genetic variation in seed and seedling traits among six H. ammodendron provenances arrayed from east to west in China. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse in well-prepared seedling beds (lines 1.5 m apart and seeds with in lines 1.0 m apart, 2.0 cm deep) with five lines (seven seeds per line) per provenance in a randomized block design with six replicates. The seed traits of fruit wing length, kernel weight, germination rate, and survival rate were compared, as were the seedling traits of internode length, branch number, assimilation shoot diameter, height, collar diameter, new shoot length, main root number, main root length, aboveground fresh weight, and underground fresh weight. Moreover, correlations between each seed and seedling trait and climate and geographical factors were assessed. The results show that the seeds from Dengkou County, Inner Mongolia had the best performance. Germination rate and survival rate were significantly positively correlated with longitude; and fruit wing length, kernel weight, seedling height, and new shoot length were significantly negatively correlated with latitude. Fruit wing length was significantly correlated with altitude. Among the climatic factors, the temperature in January had a strong direct effect on fruit wing length, germination rate, seedling height, and new shoot length. The mean annual rainfall had a strong direct effect on collar diameter. Humidity had a strong direct effect on survival rate. Seedling height, aboveground weight, and collar diameter could be important criteria for early provenance selection in the seedling stage. This study provides a reference for the selection of high-quality H. ammodendron seeds for drylands of northwest China. 3aHaloxylon ammodendron 3axerophytes 3adeserts 3ashrubs 3aconservation plants 3ageographical variation 3aseeds 3aseedlings 3aprovenance 3ashape 3aseed germination 3aweight 3amortality 3ainternodes 3abranches 3aphotosynthesis 3adiameter 3aseedling growth 3avigor 3adry matter partitioning 3aclimatic factors 3aair temperature 3arelative humidity 3aChina1 aWang, Y.

Fish assemblage, water chemistry, and aquatic habitat data from 66 locations in the Limberlost watershed, Indiana, were collected in August 2003 to evaluate the condition of the watershed. Anthropogenic stressors were identified from a numerical classification analysis of fish assemblage data using a biological integrity response gradient. Physical and chemical stressors were evaluated relative to the biological integrity response gradient using the Kruskal Wallis analysis of variance by ranks test. Three water chemistry variables (sodium, chloride, and barium) were associated with biological integrity. The percent run habitat, channel morphology score, and Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index score varied with the degree of dredging. We observed a negative response between the number of species and the biological integrity gradient and a positive response with the percent tolerant individuals. This local-scale in situ approach to physical and chemical data analysis, combined with concurrent biological data collection, provided correlative relations to the impaired condition with localized environmental stressors.

From a Saxonian water reservoir we isolated a cyanobacterial species which was classified as Phormidium sp. Under laboratory conditions it produced an earthy-musty smell due to the synthesis of geosmin. The only genes shown to be involved in geosmin biosynthesis are cyc2 and geoA of STREPTOMYCES: Based on the alignment of Cyc2 with a putative sesquiterpene synthase of Nostoc punctiforme, a degenerate primer pair was designed. By PCR, we could amplify two similar genes in Phormidium sp., which we named geoA1 and geoA2. Their expression was studied by reverse transcription-PCR. This revealed that both genes are expressed at 20°C and a light-dark cycle of 12 h. Expression was not detectable at the end of a 24-h dark period. To analyze the prevalence of geoA1 and geoA2 in samples from the phytobenthos, we generated PCR fragments with the same degenerate primer pair. Fifty-five different sequences that might represent geoA variants were obtained. The GC content ranged from 42% to 67%, suggesting that taxonomically very different bacteria might contain such genes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNostoc punctiforme 3aPhormidium 3aStreptomyces 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3adrinking water 3agenes 3aodors 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ascotophase 3asmell 3ataste 3awater reservoirs 3awater supply1 aMedger, Anja1 aBörnick, Hilmar1 aOpitz, Michael1 aLang, Kathrin1 aGöttfert, Michael1 aRöske, Isolde.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2007 Nov. 1, v. 73, no. 21 p.6988-6993dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01197-073Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle03164naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245011600164300001600280500002400296500001500320520157200335650002301907650001801930650001701948650001701965650002401982650001802006650001302024650002002037650002002057650001802077650001202095650001502107650001002122650002802132650002202160650001602182650001402198650001102212653001802223653001002241653001602251700001602267700001902283700001602302700001702318773010002335852000902435856008502444930003302529945002502562946001102587655001202598IND4447458520221118095930.0110114e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444745852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-010-9319-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarella, A.

It produces a continuous, uniform reduced light environment. Shade cloth and a slatted structure were compared in relation to the inability to represent the light regime and plant responses of an agroforestry system. The split-split-plot randomised block experiment had main plots as covering status (with or without radiata pine trees), subplots as artificial shade (none, shade cloth or wooden slats) and sub-subplots as growth rotation, over sown alfalfa, in three replicates. The quantity of light transmittance was 49% under trees, 41% under cloth and 44% under slats. Temporal changes and spectral composition under trees were more accurately reproduced under the slats than shade cloth. The red to far red ratio was 0.64 under tree shade and 0.74 during the shaded period under slats. This compared with 1.31 in open pasture, 1.28 under shade cloth in open and 1.26 under slats during sunny periods. To compensate for low light quantity and quality, alfalfa had elongated stems and internodes. In open pasture and under cloth in the open, it produced short stems. The mean dry matter yield under trees was 68% of the 30.3 t ha⁻¹ in open pasture, 56% under cloth and 57% under slats. The slats induced similar morphological responses in alfalfa to those in the agroforestry system. The magnitude of changes had little effect on growth and yield responses. The artificial slatted structure approximated the intermittent light environment and consequent plant responses observed in an agroforestry system. 3atemporal variation 3afar-red light 3aplant growth 3aforest trees 3aexperimental design 3aPinus radiata 3apastures 3aMedicago sativa 3alight intensity 3alight quality 3aalfalfa 3ainternodes 3ashade 3adry matter accumulation 3aspatial variation 3aphotoperiod 3ared light 3ayields 0aslatted shade 0astems 0ashade cloth1 aMoot, D.

  1 aMoula, N.10aEvaluation of the Production Performances of an Endangered Local Poultry Breed, the Famennoise  ap. 389-396.  a2019-12-04  aThe Famennoise is a Belgian poultry breed which is greatly endangered. Like most of the local breeds in this situation, the Famennoise remains largely unknown and is representative of the continuous loss of genetic diversity that is threatening the future of animal production. From preliminary results, egg production traits in this breed showed valuable economic assets. The present study is, thus, aimed at assessing its production performances with the prospect that it might be conserved for future valorization. Egg production as well as growth traits were estimated. Both aspects showed exploitable performances. In absence of past selection for these traits, eggs presented a mean weight of 55.43 ± 3.03 g, so being in the middle class of marketable eggs, a yolk to albumen ratio of 50.7 ± 5.02 %, an eggshell resistance (maximal force of breakage of 36.03 ± 3.3 N) equal to commercial strains and superior to already valorized local breeds. In broilers, a mean weight 980.67 ±16.62 g was reached at 8 weeks, 1815.90 ± 36.55 g at week 12 and 2191.90 ± 48.31 g at week 15. The Famennoise is, therefore, suggested for use as a dual-purpose breed with a good potential of selection for both productions. It could further serve in crosses for improvement of commercial strains. In conclusion, it appears to be highly urgent to screen endangered local poultry breeds for economically exploitable traits which would motivate conservation programs of biodiversity, before this extraordinary scientific and economic potential get irremediably lost. 3abroiler chickens 3abreed differences 3aovalbumin 3adual-purpose breeds 3achicken breeds 3aegg shell quality 3aegg weight 3aegg yolk 3aegg production 3agenetic variation 3arare breeds 3aegg composition 3aBelgium 0aanimal genetic resources 0aFamennoise (chicken breed)1 aAntoine-Moussiaux, N.1 aFarnir, F.1 aLeroy, P.0 tInternational journal of poultry science.g2009, v. 8, no. 4 p.389-396x1682-83567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.pjbs.org/ijps/back.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/02  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03177naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001700178245011800195300001600313500001500329520149000344650002301834650002201857650001801879650001101897650002101908650002301929650003001952650001601982650002301998650002002021650001102041650002102052650002102073650002102094650002002115650002002135650001902155650001602174650001702190650002202207650000702229650001602236653001602252700002302268700001602291773009202307852000902399856007502408930003302483945002502516946001102541990002302552655001202575IND4427646220221118095911.0091023s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442764622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Two hundred day old broiler chicks were allotted to one of the four groups (n = 50); 1) control [no supplements], 2) NaHC03, 0.5%, 3) KCl, 0.15% and 4) acetic acid, 1.5 mL/Liter. All chicks were kept in a controlled environmental chamber maintained at 33±2oC from day one to 6 weeks (wks) of age. Significantly higher weight gains coincided with decreased feed conversion ratios for all the supplemented groups as compared to control group at 2, 4 and 6 wks of age. Bursal index, percentage weights of thymus and spleen in relation to body weight and natural agglutinin levels, an indicator of humoral immunity were higher but the heterophil:lymphocyte ratio, an indicator of stress was lower for the supplemented groups as compared to control group. Total aerobic spore formers and Enterobactraecae counts in the intestinal swab samples were higher in control group than supplemented groups. Intestinal pH was lower at 2, 4 and 6 weeks of age but water consumption at 5 and 6 wks of age tended to be higher in acetic acid treated group as compared to other groups. Overall, the results indicated significant improvement in the performance and immune response of chronically heat-stressed broiler chicks given the water supplements, acetic acid being slightly superior to NaHCO3 and KCl. 3apotassium chloride 3aintestinal mucosa 3atissue weight 3achicks 3abroiler chickens 3abursa of Fabricius 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aheat stress 3asodium bicarbonate 3aliveweight gain 3aspleen 3afeed supplements 3achronic exposure 3ahumoral immunity 3afeed conversion 3aimmune response 3adrinking water 3aacetic acid 3athymus gland 3along term effects 3apH 3aagglutinins 0abody weight1 aAbdelAzeem, H.

Macrophages express inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and produce NO after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Gallotannins are water-soluble polyphenols with wide-ranging biological activities. Various chemical structures of gallotannins occurring in medicinal and food plants that are used worldwide showed several remarkable biological and pharmacological activities. In the present study, we examined the inhibitory effects of gallotannin 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-β-D-allopyranose (GT24) isolated from Euphorbia jolkini on the LPS-induced NO production and underlying mechanisms of action. GT24 dose-dependently decreased LPS-induced NO production and iNOS expression in J774A.1 macrophages. In addition, GT24 inhibited LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB as indicated by inhibition of degradation of I-κBα, nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and NF-κB dependent gene reporter assay. Our results suggest that GT24 possesses an inhibitory effect on the LPS-induced inflammatory reaction. 3aEuphorbia 3abioactive properties 3achemical structure 3aimmunity 3amacrophages 3amechanism of action 3amedicinal plants 3anitric oxide 3apolyphenols 3areporter genes 3avasodilation1 aKim, Mi-sun.1 aLee, Hee Sang1 aLee, Seung Ho1 aKim, Sang Hyun.0 tPhytotherapy research.g2010 Sept., v. 24, no. 9 p.1329-1333dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.3110 7aarticle02789naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245017100155300002200326500002400348500001500372520125000387650001601637650002501653650002001678650001701698650001801715650001401733650000901747650001801756653001501774700001801789700002001807700001901827700002001846700001401866700001601880700003501896700002101931700001801952773018001970852000902150856007702159930003302236945002502269946001302294655001202307IND4447358120221118095605.0110114e20101208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444735812DNAL7 a10.1021/jf10284482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Gwi Deok10aComparison of the Content of Bioactive Substances and the Inhibitory Effects against Rat Plasma Oxidation of Conventional and Organic Hot Peppers (Capsicum annuum L.)  ap. 12300–12306.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the chemical compositions and antioxidative activities of hot pepper fruits cultivated with strict management by organic and conventional agricultural practices. The ascorbic acid content in the organically grown hot pepper (OGP) was significantly higher than that of conventionally grown hot pepper (CGP) in both green and red fruits. The content of other bioactive compounds such as flavonoids (apigenin, luteolin, quercetin) and total phenolics in OGP was typically higher than in CGP regardless of fruit color. In addition, the ABTS+ radical-scavenging activity of OGP red fruits was significantly higher than that of CGP red fruits. Moreover, regardless of the color of the fruits, a higher antioxidative activity was observed in blood plasma from rats administered the OGP fruit extracts than in blood plasma from rats administered the CGP fruit extracts. It was hypothesized that the higher antioxidant activity of the OGP fruits may have resulted from the higher antioxidant content in the OGP fruits. These results suggest that consumption of pepper fruits may increase antioxidant activity in the blood, and OGP fruits may be more effective in increasing this antioxidant activity than CGP fruits. 3ahot peppers 3abioactive properties 3aCapsicum annuum 3ablood plasma 3aanimal models 3aoxidation 3arats 3aorganic foods 0ainhibitors1 aLee, You Seok1 aCho, Jeong-Yong1 aLee, Young Han1 aChoi, Kyeong Ju1 aLee, Youn1 aHan, Tae-Ho1 aLee, Paul S.q(Paul Sang Hyun)1 aPark, Keun-Hyung1 aMoon, Jae-Hak0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Dec. 8, v. 58, no. 23 p.12300–12306-12300–12306dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf10284483Available from publisher's Web site  a20110512b20110603c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/04/29  aOther US 7aarticle02746naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002200137245012400159300002200283500002400305520124200329650001701571650002701588650002001615650001801635650002201653650001701675650002001692650002101712650001501733653001601748653004201764700002301806700002301829700002601852700001901878700002801897700002601925773018001951852000902131856007702140930003302217945002502250946001302275655001202288IND4447357920221118095653.0110114e20101208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444735792DNAL7 a10.1021/jf10376952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoskela, Ali K.J.10aVariation in the Anthocyanin Concentration of Wild Populations of Crowberries (Empetrum nigrum L subsp. hermaphroditum)  ap. 12286–12291.  aIncludes references  aCrowberry (Empetrum nigrum L.) is a relatively under-utilized wild berry that occurs widely throughout the northern hemisphere such as in Canada, Eurasia, and northern Europe. In this work, the anthocyanins of crowberries were analyzed from four geographically distinct crowberry populations in Finland using HPLC-DAD and HPLC-ESI/MS/MS. A total number of 15 anthocyanins were detected; 15 (11 structure elucidated) in all samples in order to profile-specific anthocyanin compositions throughout Finland. The major anthocyanin found in the samples collected from central and eastern Finland was delphinidin 3-galactoside accounting for more than 24% of the total anthocyanin content, while the cyanidin 3-galactoside was the major anthocyanin in the northernmost and in the western samples. Significant variation in the concentrations of different anthocyanins between and within crowberry populations were found suggesting that the synthesis of anthocyanins is modified by site-specific environmental conditions. The suitability of the crowberries as a potential source of health-promoting ingredients for incorporation into pharmaceutical and food industrial products is highlighted in this work due to the diverse anthocyanin profile. 3aanthocyanins 3achemical concentration 3aEmpetrum nigrum 3afood analysis 3afruit composition 3asmall fruits 3anutritive value 3anutrient content 3awild foods 0acrowberries 0aEmpetrum nigrum subsp. hermaphroditum1 aAnttonen, Mikko J.1 aSoininen, Tuula H.1 aSaviranta, Niina M.M.1 aAuriola, Seppo1 aJulkunen-Tiitto, Riitta1 aKarjalainen, Reijo O.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Dec. 8, v. 58, no. 23 p.12286–12291-12286–12291dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf10376953Available from publisher's Web site  a20110512b20110603c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/04/29  aOther US 7aarticle02558naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002200137245012100159300002200280500002400302520111300326650001101439650001901450650000901469650001001478650002801488650001701516650002001533650001301553650001801566650002101584650001601605650002301621650003101644650002501675700001801700700002701718700001801745773018001763852000901943856007701952930003302029945002502062946001302087655001202100IND4447357520221118095441.0110114e20101208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444735752DNAL7 a10.1021/jf102838j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSetiawan, Stephen10aEffects of Drying Conditions of Corn Kernels and Storage at an Elevated Humidity on Starch Structures and Properties  ap. 12260–12267.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this study was to understand effects of sun drying (35 °C) and machine drying (80 °C) of corn kernels followed by storage at 27 °C and 85−90% relative humidity for up to 6 months on starch structures and properties. The peak viscosity and starch hydrolysis rate using porcine pancreatic α-amylase of finely ground samples decreased with storage of both sun-dried and machine-dried corn kernels. The rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of the isolated starch obtained from the sun-dried corn increased with storage time, but that from the machine-dried corn decreased. The gelatinization temperature, pasting temperature, and percentage crystallinity of the isolated starch increased but the gelatinization enthalpy-change and peak viscosity of the starch decreased with storage time. Numbers of damaged starch granules and starch granules with pinholes increased but the molecular weight of starch and long branch-chains of amylopectin decreased with storage time. The results indicated that endogenous enzyme activity remained after sun drying, which hydrolyzed starch and reduced viscosity. 3adrying 3adrying quality 3acorn 3aseeds 3afood processing quality 3afood storage 3astorage quality 3ahumidity 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3acorn starch 3achemical structure 3aphysicochemical properties 3aenzymatic hydrolysis1 aWidjaja, Hany1 aRakphongphairoj, Vinai1 aJane, Jay-lin0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Dec. 8, v. 58, no. 23 p.12260–12267-12260–12267dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf102838j3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110512b20110603c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/04/29  aOther US 7aarticle02144naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245007400168300001600242500002400258520111800282650002301400650001301423650002201436650001101458650001701469650001501486650002901501650001401530650001701544650002101561650000901582651001801591773011601609852000901725856004801734655001201782IND4422173520221118095438.0090619e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442217352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-009-9221-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJessup, Russell W.10aDevelopment and status of dedicated energy crops in the United States  ap. 282-290.  aIncludes references  aThe biofuel industry is rapidly growing because of increasing energy demand and diminishing petroleum reserves on a global scale. A multitude of biomass resources have been investigated, with high-yielding, perennial feedstocks showing the greatest potential for utilization as advanced biofuels. Government policy and economic drivers have promoted the development and commercialization of biofuel feedstocks, conversion technologies, and supply chain logistics. Research and regulations have focused on the environmental consequences of biofuels, greatly promoting systems that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and life-cycle impacts. Numerous biofuel refineries using lignocellulosic feedstocks and biomass-based triglycerides are either in production or pre-commercial development phases. Leading candidate energy crops have been identified, yet require additional efforts to realize their full potential. Advanced biofuels, complementing conventional biofuels and other renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, provide the means to substantially displace humanity's reliance on petroleum-based energy. 3abioenergy industry 3abiofuels 3acommercialization 3aenergy 3aenergy crops 3afeedstocks 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3apetroleum 3asupply chain 3atriacylglycerols 3awind 3aUnited States0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2009 June, v. 45, no. 3 p.282-290dSpringer-Verlagx1054-54767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-009-9221-y 7aarticle03286naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001300161245006200174300001600236520200100252650002102253650002002274650002102294650001102315650001602326650001802342650001402360650001002374650002002384650001502404650002302419700001602442700001302458700001602471700001202487700001802499700001902517773009202536852000902628856007502637930003302712945002502745946001102770990002302781655001202804IND4427652020221118095458.0091023s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442765202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWang, Z.10aEvaluation of Nupro® Yeast Product in Diets for Broilers  ap. 515-520.  aTwo trials with identical experimental design were conducted approximately 20 months apart to evaluate the response of broiler chickens to the addition of NuPro®, a yeast product rich in nucleotides. In both trials, four dietary treatments were compared. The first treatment contained no NuPro®. For the second treatment, the diet with 2% NuPro® was fed only the first 7 days of life while for the third treatment, 2% NuPro® was fed for the first 14 d. For the fourth treatment, 2% NuPro® was fed for the first 7 days and also during the finisher period of 35-42 d of age. In both studies, each treatment was fed to six replicate groups of 60 male broilers of a commercial strain. Response to the addition of NuPro® varied between the two experiments. In the first study, addition of 2% NuPro® to the diet resulted in improvement in feed conversion. Response varied by age of bird and time during which the NuPro® was fed. At 7 d of age, there were no significant differences between birds that had been fed NuPro® and those fed the negative control diet. At 14 d of age, there were no significant differences in feed conversion among birds fed the various treatments, but feed conversion was numerically better for those birds that had been fed NuPro® for the first 7 or 14 d. At 35 d, birds that had been fed NuPro® for the first 7 d had significantly better feed conversion than those fed the control diet with birds fed NuPro® for the first 14 d being intermediate between these two groups. At 42 d, birds fed diets with 2% NuPro® for the first 7 d or for the first 7 d followed by feeding from 35-42 d had significantly lower feed conversion than those fed the control, with those fed NuPro® for the first 14 d being intermediate between these groups. However, in the second trial there was no significant effect of inclusion of NuPro on any of the parameters evaluated. There may be nutritional differences between batches of the product that influence the response of chicks. 3abroiler chickens 3abroiler feeding 3afeed supplements 3ayeasts 3anucleotides 3astarter diets 3afinishing 3amales 3afeed conversion 3aanimal age 3atemporal variation1 aCerrate, S.1 aCoto, C.1 aSacakli, P.1 aYan, F.1 aCosta, F.G.P.1 aWaldroup, P.W.0 tInternational journal of poultry science.g2009, v. 8, no. 6 p.515-520x1682-83567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.pjbs.org/ijps/back.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/02  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02272naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245013600145300001600281500001500297520124900312650002501561650001901586650001601605650002001621650001701641650002001658650001001678650001801688653001701706653001401723700001401737700001801751773007401769852000901843939003301852946001301885655001201898IND9203928120221118095535.0920619e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920392812DNAL7 a166686822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoole, K.L.10aPartial purification and characterization of complex I, NADH:ubiquinone reductase, from the inner membrane of beetroot mitochondria  ap. 588-594.  a2019-12-04  aA NADH dehydrogenase was isolated from an inner membrane-enriched fraction of beetroot mitochondria (Beta vulgaris L.) by solubilization with sodium deoxycholate and purified using gel filtration and affinity chromatography. The NADH dehydrogenase preparation contained a minor ATPase contamination. Beetroot mitochondria were chosen as the isolation material for purifying the enzymes responsible for oxidizing matrix NADH due to the absence of the externally facing NADH dehydrogenase in the variety we have used. The purified NADH dehydrogenase complex catalyzed the reduction of various electron acceptors with NADH as the electron donor, was not sensitive to rotenone inhibition, and had a slow NADPH-ubiquinone 5 reductase activity. The isolated complex contained 14 major polypeptides. It was concluded that the dehydrogenase represented a form of the plant mitochondrial complex I and not the internally facing rotenone-insensitive NADH dehydrogenase found in plant mitochondria because of its complex structure, its cross-reactivity with antisera raised against bovine heart mitochondrial complex I, and the similarity of its kinetics and inhibitor responses to rotenone-sensitive NADH oxidation by beetroot submitochondrial particles. 3achemical composition 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aubiquinones 3aoxidoreductases 3amitochondria 3aenzyme activity 3aroots 3aBeta vulgaris 0apurification 0amembranes1 aDry, I.B.1 aWiskich, J.T.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Feb., v. 98, no. 2 p.588-594x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02686naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245012100187300001400308500002400322520117400346650002601520650001501546650001401561650001701575650001501592650002201607650001401629650002201643650001101665650001401676650001501690650004901705650004701754650006401801650002501865650004301890650002901933650004801962700002102010700002702031773010102058852000902159856004802168655001202216IND4435958420221118095518.0100423e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443595842DNAL7 a202322502pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-010-9424-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrejo, Fernando M.10aCo-culture with potentially probiotic microorganisms antagonises virulence factors of Clostridium difficile in vitro  ap. 19-29.  aIncludes references  aToxigenic strains of Clostridium difficile were co-cultured with different strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Spent culture supernatants were tested for biological activity on cultured Vero cells. Co-culture of C. difficile with some potentially probiotic strains lead to a reduction of the biological activity of spent culture supernatants. The observed effects cannot be ascribed either to secreted factors from the probiotic strains or to toxin adsorption by bacterial cells. Immunological assays showed that there was significant diminution of both clostridial toxins (TcdA and TcdB) in spent culture supernatants of co-cultures as compared with pure clostridial cultures. Even though co-cultured clostridial cells showed a slight increase of intracellular toxins, this increase did not completely explains the reduction of toxin concentration in culture supernatants. The evidence suggests that the antagonism could be due to the diminution of the synthesis and/or secretion of both clostridial toxins. Our findings provide new insights into the possible mechanisms involved in the protective effect of probiotics in the context of C. difficile infection. 3aClostridium difficile 3aadsorption 3acoculture 3aimmunoassays 3aprobiotics 3aprotective effect 3asecretion 3atoxigenic strains 3atoxins 3avirulence 2aAntibiosis 2aBacterial Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitors 2aBacterial Toxinsxantagonists & inhibitors 2aClostridioides difficilexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCoculture Techniques 2aEnterotoxinsxantagonists & inhibitors 2aProbioticsxpharmacology 2aVirulence Factorsxantagonists & inhibitors1 aPérez, Pablo F.1 aDe Antoni, Graciela L.0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2010 June, v. 98, no. 1 p.19-29dSpringer Netherlandsx0003-60727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-010-9424-6 7aarticle02184naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245010700148300001600255520121900271650001301490650001401503650001001517650001501527650001501542650002301557650002001580650002001600650002001620650002001640700001501660700001801675773007401693852000901767939003301776946001301809655001201822IND9203928420221118095538.0920619e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920392842DNAL7 a166686852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiTomaso, J.M.10aTransport kinetics and metabolism of exogenously applied putrescine in roots of intact maize seedlings  ap. 611-620.  aPutrescine metabolism, uptake, and compartmentation were studied in roots of hydroponically grown intact maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings. In vivo analysis of exogenously applied putrescine indicated that the diamine is primarily metabolized by a cell wall-localized diamine oxidase. Time-dependent kinetics for putrescine uptake could be resolved into a rapid phase of uptake and binding within the root apoplasm, followed by transport across the plasma membrane that was linear for 30 to 40 minutes. Concentration-dependent kinetics for putrescine uptake (between 0.05 and 1.0 millimolar putrescine) appeared to be nonsaturating but could be resolved into a saturable (Vmax 0.397 micromoles per gram fresh weight per hour; Km 120 micromolar) and a linear component. The linear component was determined to be cell wall-bound putrescine that was not removed during the desorption period following uptake of [(3)H]putrescine. These results suggest that a portion of the exogenously applied putrescine can be metabolized in maize root cell walls by diamine oxidase activity, but the bulk of the putrescine is transported across the plasmalemma by a carrier-mediated process, similar to that proposed for animal systems. 3aZea mays 3aseedlings 3aroots 3aputrescine 3ametabolism 3anutrient transport 3anutrient uptake 3aenzyme activity 3aoxidoreductases 3aplasma membrane1 aHart, J.J.1 aKochian, L.V.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Feb., v. 98, no. 2 p.611-620x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02148naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245006000145300001600205500001500221520053800236650002000774650001100794650001900805650002000824650001400844650001700858650001100875650002300886650002400909650001500933650001000948650001600958650001200974650002200986650002901008650001001037650002201047650002101069650000901090650001101099650004901110650001101159650001101170650001101181650000901192650000901201650002901210650000901239650004701248651001801295653002301313653001601336773010201352852000901454930003301463945001301496946001301509655001201522IND2035546420221118095733.0931026e199310  ncu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203554642DNAL7 a82632632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlodin, N.W.10aLysine supplementation of cereal foods: a retrospective  ap. 486-500.  a2019-12-04  aDuring the period 1950-1975, protein and amino acid metabolism and its application to world nutrition problems constituted a major focus of nutrition research.

  1 aAdenkola, A.Y.10aEffects of Ascorbic Acid on Rectal Temperature Fluctuations in Indigenous Turkeys During the Hot-Dry Season  ap. 457-461.  aExperiments were performed on 40 indigenous turkeys with the aim of investigating, fluctuations in their rectal temperature (RT) and the effect of ascorbic acid (AA) on during the hot-dry season. Twenty turkeys which served as experimental birds were administered AA orally at the dose of 52 mg kg-1, while the remaining 20 turkeys which served as control were given ordinary water. Measurements of RT were taken for 3 days, one week apart and every hour from 06:00-19:00 h. The results showed that RT values in both experimental and control turkeys significantly (p<0.01) fluctuated with the hours of the day (r = 0.614, 0.612, respectively) and the dry-bulb temperature (r = 0.794, 0.928, respectively). The RT value of 41.2±0.03oC recorded in experimental turkeys was significantly lower (p<0.05) than the corresponding value of 41.5±0.03oC obtained in control turkeys. The results demonstrated that AA significantly reduced RT values in experimental turkeys. In conclusion, AA administration may be of value in turkeys subjected to unavoidable stressful conditions during the hot-hours of the day. 3aturkeys 3aascorbic acid 3abody temperature 3arectum 3alandraces 3aseasonal variation 3aheat stress 3aair temperature 3adry season 3afeed supplements 3aturkey feeding 3adosage 3adiurnal variation 0arectal temperature1 aAyo, J.O.0 tInternational journal of poultry science.g2009, v. 8, no. 5 p.457-461x1682-83567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.pjbs.org/ijps/back.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/01  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01845naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010200127300001400229520107100243650001301314650002001327650001901347650002301366700001401389773009801403852000901501930003301510945001301543946001101556655001201567IND2035546120221118095726.0931026e199310  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203554612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNerbrink, E.10aEvaluation of bacterial contamination at searate processing stages in emulsion sausage production  ap. 37-44.  aThe contamination with spoilage bacteria at separate production steps during the production of emulsion sausages was evaluated using a special sampling and evaluation method. Heat processed and chilled sausages were aseptically transferred directly to cold storage, cutting down or packing. Upon completion of the particular production step the sausages were vacuum-packed and stored at 8 degrees C. During storage, the microbial growth of the sausages was followed and the area under the plot of aerobic count versus storage time was calculated. No correlation was found between the total aerobic count of unstored samples and bacterial growth during storage, defined as area under growth curves. Furthermore, the count of lactic acid bacteria on unstored sausages was often below the detection limit. However, the area reflected the extent of contamination during processing with bacteria able to grow on cold-stored vacuum-packed sausages. Storage in a cold storage room was identified as a critical point with respect to bacterial recontamination and shelf-life. 3asausages 3afood processing 3aheat treatment 3afood contamination1 aBorch, E.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g1993 Oct., v. 20, no. 1 p.37-44x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02693naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245005000144300001600194500001500210520150100225650001501726650001201741650001501753650002301768650002501791650001601816650003601832650001501868650002401883650001501907650001001922650004601932650002101978650001101999650001102010650000902021650001702030653001802047773010202065852000902167930003302176945001302209946001302222655001202235IND2035546720221118095804.0931026e199310  ncu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203554672DNAL7 a82632642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, D.C.10aBody image and eating behavior in adolescents  ap. 505-510.  a2019-12-04  aApproximately two-thirds of adolescent girls at any age are dissatisfied with their weight, the proportion increasing with actual weight. Slightly more than half of all girls are dissatisfied with the shape of their bodies, an attitude which also is positively correlated with body weight. Girls are most likely to be distressed about excess size of their thighs, hips, waist and buttocks, and inadequate size of their breasts. Those who are dissatisfied with their bodies are more likely to engage in potentially harmful weight control behaviors, such as dieting, fasting, self-induced vomiting, diuretic use, laxative use and diet pill use. Those who diet are more likely to begin in early adolescence, to be white than black, to be of higher socioeconomic status, to engage in other eating-related practices and to have a poor body image and self esteem. Boys who are underweight are most likely to be dissatisfied with their weight and many with normal weight wish to weigh more. Approximately one-third of boys are dissatisfied with their body shape, desiring larger upper arms, chest and shoulders. Dieting and purging are less likely than exercise to be chosen by boys as methods of weight control. Dieting among boys is more likely to be associated with increased body weight and some sports, such as wrestling. Body consciousness and altered body image are widespread among adolescents, and may be associated with potentially harmful eating practices in both sexes, but more so in girls. 3abody image 3adieting 3aoverweight 3agender differences 3asocioeconomic status 3aadolescents 3anationalities and ethnic groups 2aAdolescent 2aAdolescent Behavior 2aBody Image 2aChild 2aFeeding and Eating Disordersxpsychology. 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aSelf Concept 0aeating habits0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g1993 Oct., v. 12, no. 5 p.505-510x0731-57247nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdJFM  aOther US 7aarticle02719naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001600161245011600177300001600293500001500309520130300324650001101627650001701638650002001655650002001675650001901695650002001714650001801734650001601752650001701768650001801785650002101803650001701824653001701841653001601858700002001874700001501894700001601909700002001925773009201945852000902037856007502046930003302121945002502154946001102179990002302190655001202213IND4427648220221118095801.0091023s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442764822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Body Weight (BW) was increased gradually in all treatments when compared to the control group with the highest level for oxymetholone and testosterone alone respectively. Feed Intake (FI) during 12 weeks of study decline slightly in all treatments with the lowest level for oxymetholone + ZnSO4 and the highest level for control group. Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) at the end of study was 4.77 for control group and 4.15, 4.32, 4.50 and 4.69 for different treatments, respectively. Growth Rate (GR) differed for each week and treatment. Overall, the treatment groups showed higher GR when compared to control group in every week. The percentage of Carcass Weight (%CW) was increased significantly (p<0.05) in all treatments in comparison with control group with highest level for testosterone + ZnSO4. The treatments did not influence significantly on the internal organs by the end of study. Oxymetholone induced BW and %CW (p<0.05) with less FI and FCR when compared to testosterone and control group in turkey chicks. 3apoults 3azinc sulfate 3afeed conversion 3amedicated feeds 3acarcass weight 3aliveweight gain 3aanimal organs 3afeed intake 3atestosterone 3atissue weight 3afeed supplements 3afeed rations 0aoxymetholone 0abody weight1 aHeydar-Poor, M.1 aZarghi, H.1 aPilevar, M.1 aEsmailzadeh, M.0 tInternational journal of poultry science.g2009, v. 8, no. 5 p.470-474x1682-83567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.pjbs.org/ijps/back.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/01  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02882naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245008600147300001600233520171500249650002201964650001601986650001702002650002202019650001702041650002802058650002802086650003102114650001102145650001102156650009602167650000902263650001602272650002402288650001702312773007502329852000902404930003302413945001302446946001302459655001202472IND2035543520221118100218.0931026e199308  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203554352DNAL7 a83024972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaefer, E.J.10aNew recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of plasma lipid abnormalities  ap. 246-252.  aElevated total blood cholesterol levels (at or above 240 mg/dL) due to increased low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol values (at or above 160 mg/dL) have been associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). It has been shown in controlled prospective studies that when LDL cholesterol is lowered with diet or diet and drug treatment, subsequent risk of CHD morbidity and, in some cases, mortality can be reduced. New guidelines have recently been released by the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP II) of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). Risk factors for CHD in addition to elevated LDL cholesterol now include: 1) male 45 years or older; 2) female 55 or older, or with premature menopause and not on estrogen replacement; 3) high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol less than 35 mg/dL; 4) hypertension; 5) cigarette smoking; 6) diabetes mellitus; and 7) a family history of premature CHD. After screening with total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol measurements, patients with total cholesterol values at or above 200 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol below 35 mg/dL, and/or CHD should have a fasting cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol measurement. Candidates for diet therapy are those with LDL cholesterol values at or above 1) 160 mg/dL; 2) 130 mg/dL in the presence of two or more CHD risk factors; or 3) 100 mg/dL in the presence of CHD. Candidates for drug therapy after diet treatment are those with LDL cholesterol values at or above 1) 190 mg/dL; 2) 160 mg/dL in the presence of two or more CHD risk factors; or 3) 130 mg/dL in the presence of CHD. Effective cholesterol-lowering medications include anion exchange resins, niacin, and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. 3adisease diagnosis 3acholesterol 3ablood lipids 3amedical treatment 3ablood plasma 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aCoronary Diseasexetiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypercholesterolemiaxbloodxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxdiet therapyxdrug therapyxtherapy. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Factors0 tNutrition reviews.g1993 Aug., v. 51, no. 8 p.246-252x0029-66437nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdJFM  aOther US 7aarticle02051naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245006500143300001600208520080900224650001601033650001701049650002101066650001301087650001201100650001301112650001601125650001601141650001601157650002301173650001001196650002101206650002501227650002701252650001101279650003301290650001101323650000901334650001601343650003301359650001601392700001701408773006601425852000901491930003301500945001301533946001101546655001201557IND2180585920221118100210.0981021e199706  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218058592DNAL7 a92180972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPliner, P.10aTemperament and food neophobia in children and their mothers  ap. 239-254.  aWe obtained measures of behavioral neophobia, rated neophobia, temperament, and liking for novel and familiar foods for 81 pairs of siblings (ranging in age from 5-11 years) and their mothers.

The data revealed little evidence of family resemblance (mother-child or sibling-sibling) in food neophobia. 3anovel foods 3afood choices 3afeeding behavior 3achildren 3amothers 3asiblings 3acorrelation 3atemperament 2aAge Factors 2aAvoidance Learning 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aExploratory Behavior 2aFamily Characteristics 2aFemale 2aFood Preferencesxpsychology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPersonality 2aPhobic Disordersxpsychology 2aSex Factors1 aLoewen, E.R.0 tAppetite.g1997 June, v. 28, no. 3 p.239-254x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02368naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002100128245008200149300001400231520125600245650002101501650002201522650002001544650001001564650000901574650002801583650003801611650001101649650002201660650001101682650000901693650001601702650002201718650001701740651001801757700001701775700001201792773006401804852000901868930003301877945001301910946001101923655001201934IND2180583820221118100232.0981021e199708  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218058382DNAL7 a92684252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLongnecker, M.P.10aEating frequency in the Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (U.S.A), 1987-1988  ap. 55-59.  aThis study was done to provide basic descriptive data on the variation in meal frequency in the U.S. The data analysed were from the 1987-1988 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS), a stratified random sample of American households. Participants were asked to provide one 24-h diet recall and two 1-day diet records. Individuals who were pregnant, lactating, or younger than 19 years old were excluded. If more than one eligible subject per household participated, one subject was selected at random. Of the 4,078 eligible participants, data for 3,182 were complete for all three days and were included in the analyses. On average participants ate 3.47 times daily (SD 0.90). When eating occasions during which 70 or fewer kcal were excluded (tea, coffee, or diet beverages, primarily), the mean was 3.12 (SD 0.74), and over 90% of subjects ate between 1.50 and 4.49 times daily. The ratio of within- to between-person variance in number of eating times daily was 1.17 (less than or equal to 70 kcal excluded). The day-to-day variation in an individual's eating frequency was relatively large compared with the between-subject variation, suggesting that data for multiple days are needed to measure an individual's eating frequency with precision. 3afood consumption 3afeeding frequency 3adietary surveys 2aAdult 2aAged 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDietxstatistics & numerical data 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Surveys 2aTime Factors 3aUnited States1 aHarper, J.M.1 aKim, S.0 tAppetite.g1997 Aug., v. 29, no. 1 p.55-59x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01341naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245004600143300001400189520027500203650001600478650001600494650001700510650002000527650001300547650001000560650001100570650003400581650001100615650002800626650000900654650001200663650001600675650001700691651001500708653001100723653001600734700001500750773006400765852000900829930003300838945001300871946001100884655001200895IND2180583120221118100222.0981021e199708  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218058312DNAL7 a92684222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSommer, R.10aSocial effects on duration in restaurants  ap. 25-30.  aA nonreactive observational study in full-service restaurants showed group size to be positively correlated with length of stay.

Two thousand senior secondary school students (mean age 16 years), from 52 schools in South Australia, participated in a two part survey. The findings show that teenage vegetarianism is primarily a female phenomenon, ranging in prevalence, according to definition, from 8 to 37% of women and 1 to 12% of men. Support for vegetarian practices was high especially from mothers (63%) and classmates (46%). Generally, "teenage vegetarians" consumed fewer red meats than non-vegetarians but ate more chicken. They cited health, animal welfare and environmental reasons in support of their habits. The importance of operational definitions of vegetarianism is emphasized and the findings are discussed in relation to likely motivational influences. 3afood beliefs 3avegetarian diet 3aattitudes and opinions 3agirls 3asupport systems 3ahigh school students 3agender differences 3asocioeconomic status 3aadolescents 3afood choices 3afamilial incidence 3aboys 3adietary surveys 3aprediction 2aAdolescent 2aAttitude 2aDiet, Vegetarianxpsychologyxstatistics & numerical data. 2aEatingxpsychology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPrevalence 2aSelf Disclosure 2aSex Factors 2aSocial Class 2aSocial Support 3aSouth Australia 0aSouth Australia 0adiet 0avalues 0afeeding habits 0asemi-vegetarians1 aSkrzypiec, G.0 tAppetite.g1998 Apr., v. 30, no. 2 p.151-170x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02998naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245005500146300001600201520121200217650000801429650002001437650001101457650001701468650001901485650001701504650002301521650001801544650001701562650001201579650001001591650004101601650001901642650006801661650005901729650001201788650005801800650005401858650001101912650002301923650003201946650001101978650000901989650002401998650003602022650001702058651001102075653001502086700001702101700001502118700001802133700001702151700001502168700001502183700001802198773006602216852000902282930003302291945001302324946001102337655001202348IND2196024420221118095718.0981216e199804  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219602442DNAL7 a95734482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoannic, J.L.10aPlasma leptin and hunger ratings in healthy humans  ap. 129-138.  aLeptin, the ob gene product, is considered as a signal involved in the regulation of energy stores through centrally mediated effects on ingestive behavior and metabolism. To investigate the relationships between appetite-related sensations and circulating leptin in humans, 12 healthy male volunteers were served two test lunches (1200 kcal, 38% carbohydrate, 50% fat, 12% protein) with comparable palatability but resulting in different postprandial hunger ratings, and plasma leptin concentrations were monitored during 8 h after meal ingestion. Whereas postprandial hunger ratings (assessed by visual analog scales) and plasma insulin patterns differed significantly between meals, no significant difference in postprandial plasma leptin concentrations was observed between the two meals. A moderate but significant increase in mean plasma leptin was found over time. We conclude that postprandial plasma leptin concentrations do not significantly differ between two meals inducing different effects on hunger subjective feelings. These data are in agreement with a role for leptin in the regulation of energy balance as a long-term adiposity-related signal rather than a short-term meal-related factor. 3amen 3aanimal proteins 3ahunger 3ablood plasma 3aenergy balance 3ayoung adults 3aexperimental diets 3ablood glucose 3apalatability 3asatiety 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucosexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCohort Studies 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosagexclassification. 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosagexclassification. 2aFasting 2aFatty Acids, Monounsaturatedxadministration & dosage 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxadministration & dosage 2aHumans 2aHungerxphysiology 2aInsulinxbloodxmetabolism. 2aLeptin 2aMale 2aProspective Studies 2aProteinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 3aFrance 0aregulation1 aOppert, J.M.1 aLahlou, N.1 aBasdevant, A.1 aAuboiron, S.1 aRaison, J.1 aBornet, F.1 aGuy-Grand, B.0 tAppetite.g1998 Apr., v. 30, no. 2 p.129-138x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03398naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245008100143300001400224500001500238520135000253650001001603650001001613650001701623650002001640650001501660650001401675650001801689650001301707650001001720650002001730650001101750650001701761650002701778650002001805650001201825650001401837650002001851650001401871650001501885650001301900650000901913650001401922650002501936650001001961650002101971650003801992650003102030650003702061650001102098650003502109650003202144650001102176650002002187650002202207650000902229650001402238650003802252650002602290650005402316651001102370653000902381653001102390653002302401653001702424700001502441700001802456773006402474852000902538930003302547945001302580946001102593655001202604IND2196047020221118095201.0981217e199802  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219604702DNAL7 a95008032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeshem, M.10aNeonatal diuretic therapy may not alter children's preference for salt taste  ap. 53-64.  a2019-12-05  aHuman neonates are occasionally treated with diuretics, and we investigated whether this causes a long-term enhancement of salt preference. Salt preference was examined in children aged 4-11 years. Twenty one of the children had received furosemide therapy as preterm neonates, and 24 were preterm neonates from the same ward that had no furosemide therapy. No differences were found between the two groups in preferred concentration of NaCl in soup, in consumption of salty items, and in blood and urine sodium and creatinine. However, in a tested subsample fractional excretion of sodium (FE(Na)) was higher in the neonatally treated children, suggesting increased salt intake. Reported severity of morning sickness in the mother when pregnant with the child, the child's history of diarrhoea and vomiting and degree of dietary salt exposure were obtained by questionnaire. These variables also did not influence salt preference, or blood and urine sodium and creatinine, except for a correlation between dietary salt exposure and blood sodium concentration. We conclude that while the physiological evidence suggests increased salt intake in children treated neonatally with furosemide, more sensitive tests of salt preference at this age are required to reveal any influence early mineralofluid loss may have on salt preference in childhood. 3afoods 3aurine 3adrug therapy 3asalt preference 3acreatinine 3asweetness 3adose response 3adiarrhea 3agirls 3apremature birth 3asodium 3ablood plasma 3aenvironmental exposure 3amaternal effect 3asucrose 3apregnancy 3asodium chloride 3aexcretion 3afurosemide 3avomiting 3aboys 3asaltiness 2aCase-Control Studies 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aDiarrhea, Infantilexdrug therapy 2aDiureticsxtherapeutic use 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aFood Preferencesxdrug effects 2aFurosemidextherapeutic use 2aHumans 2aInfant, Newborn 2aInfant, Premature 2aMale 2aPregnancy 2aPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects 2aSodiumxbloodxurine. 2aSodium Chloride, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 3aIsrael 0asalt 0aintake 0amineralofluid loss 0afood choices1 aMaroun, M.1 aWeintraub, A.0 tAppetite.g1998 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.53-64x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01756naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245006100157300001600218520070900234650002000943650001100963650001200974650002100986650001101007650001701018650002301035650001501058650001101073651001001084700002301094700002101117700002301138700002301161773014501184856004401329852000901373655001201382IND4527096020221118094719.0151105s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452709602DNAL7 a10.13031/aea.31.110302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPari, Luigi11aAMower-Conditioner to Improve Fiber Sorghum Plant Drying  ap. 733-740.  aFiber sorghum [( L.

However, due to the considerable amount of biomass produced, the harvesting presents some drawbacks. In Italy the cultivation of fiber sorghum is concentrated in the North where the harvesting occurs at the end of summer, on plants having, on average, 70% of moisture. For allowing the storage in bales, a product with at least 30% of moisture is required.

Restrained eaters ate significantly more than did unrestrained eaters after exposure to the food cues. There was no difference in food intake when there was no pre exposure to the cues. Although baseline subjective ratings were equivalent for both groups of subjects, after cue pre-exposure, restrained subjects, in keeping with their increased consumption, indicated a significantly greater craving, liking, and desire to eat the cued food (pizza) than did the unrestrained subjects. These findings suggest that restrained eaters are more sensitive and reactive to food cues than are unrestrained eaters. The food cues appeared to generate an appetitive urge to eat in restrained eaters. 3afood intake 3awomen 0aolfactory stimulation 0afeeding habits1 aPolivy, J.1 aHerman, C.P.0 tAppetite.g1997 Feb., v. 28, no. 1 p.33-47x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01959naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011500125300002000240520102500260650001401285650002101299650001601320650001601336650000901352650001401361650001801375653001501393700001601408700003101424773009801455852000901553930003301562945001301595946001301608655001201621IND2035615020221118094454.0931029e199306  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203561502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGray, J.M.10aEstrogens and antiestrogens: actions and interactions with fluphenazine on food intake and body weight in rats  ap.

Longer-term (2 wk) treatment with tamoxifen resulted in similar transient changes in food intake and body weight gain, as did treatment with E2B. Daily administration of 50 micrograms fluphenazine (FLU) led to significant decreases in body weight, although there was no change in food intake. Concurrent administration of FLU with either E2B or tamoxifen led to additive effects on body weight and food intake change.

A survey of food preferences and the Eating Disorders Inventory were completed by a three-generation sample of 42 Black and 61 White women. No significant main effects or interactions were detected for race or generation for any of the EDI subscales, except for Interpersonal Distrust, with Black subjects scoring significantly higher than Whites on Interpersonal Distrust. A number of culturally preferred foods were identified, including fried meats and grits for Blacks and coffee for Whites.

Unfortunately, up to now this hypothesis has not been investigated in a straightforward manner. In this study, during acquisition, children consumed a series of evaluatively neutral colored and flavored drinks, while simultaneously they watched a videotaped model synchronically drinking identical drinks and facially expressing his evaluation (neutral or dislike) of the liquids. In one condition, the presence of a particular flavor in the drinks was designated to function as the CS+ or the CS-, whereas in the other condition it was the color of the drinks which was the critical CS+ or CS-. Next, the children evaluated a series of drinks containing the critical CSs. A clear evaluative learning effect was obtained when the flavor but not when the color of the drinks was systematically paired with the model's facial expression of dislike. Moreover, the flavor conditioning effect was dependent on the presence in the test drinks of the local context cues (c.q. the colors of the drinks) which were used during acquisition. Finally a double dissociation was observed between explicit beliefs and the "evaluative knowledge" expressed in the ratings of the drinks, in that none of the children in the CS= Flavor groups evidenced any explicit knowledge about the crucial CS-US' contingency but showed evaluative conditioning, whereas the majority of the children in CS= Color groups were aware of the CS-US' relation but failed to demonstrate an evaluative CS+/CS- differentiation. 3aschool children 3alearning 3aflavor 3afood acceptability 2aAttitude 2aChild 2aColor 2aConditioning, Psychological. 2aFacial Expression 2aFemale 2aFood Preferencesxpsychology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aRandom Allocation 2aTaste 2aVideotape Recording 0abehavior modeling 0afood choices 0avideotapes1 aVansteenwegen, D.1 aHouwer, J. de.1 aCrombez, G.0 tAppetite.g1996 Dec., v. 27, no. 3 p.235-250x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02920naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245008500145300001600230520154900246650001001795650001601805650002501821650002101846650001801867650001901885650002201904650001201926650001401938650001001952650005101962650004202013650002502055650001802080650001102098650002902109650001102138650000902149650005902158650001602217700001402233700001602247700001902263773006602282852000902348930003302357945001302390946001102403655001202414IND2055106920221118094504.0970128e199610  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205510692DNAL7 a89376202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoltin, R.W.10aEffect of fluoxetine on food intake of humans living in a residential laboratory  ap. 165-181.  aTen male and one female normal-weight research volunteers, participating in a 16-day residential study, received oral fluoxetine (40 mg) or placebo at 0930 daily. Food intake, performance and subjective ratings were measured throughout the day. The interaction between fluoxetine and carbohydrate consumption was examined by providing subjects diets that engendered varied levels of carbohydrate intake. When subjects received placebo and had access to a regular diet, they consumed 3400 kcal day-1 (53% carbohydrate, 34% fat, 13% protein); and fluoxetine decreased caloric intake to 2770 Kcal, without affecting macronutrient contribution. Caloric intake (2730 Kcal; 67% carbohydrate) under the high-carbohydrate condition when subjects received fluoxetine was not different from intake under the regular-diet fluoxetine condition. Subjects reported that the high-fat (low-carbohydrate) diet was less palatable and consumed 2975 Kcal under placebo conditions (35% carbohydrate); fluoxetine decreased caloric intake by an additional 400 Kcal without affecting macronutrient contribution. There was no evidence that carbohydrate intake modulated the effects of fluoxetine. Fluoxetine decreased food intake by decreasing the number of eating occasions. Performance and subjective measures were not significantly altered by fluoxetine compared to placebo. Thus, there was no evidence of a specific effect of fluoxetine on macronutrient consumption, nor were the effects of fluoxetine altered by the macronutrient composition of the available diet. 3adrugs 3afood intake 3adietary carbohydrate 3afood consumption 3aenergy intake 3ahuman behavior 3amedical treatment 3aobesity 3acognition 2aAdult 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aFluoxetinexpharmacology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitorsxpharmacology. 2aWeight Loss1 aHaney, M.1 aComer, S.D.1 aFischman, M.W.0 tAppetite.g1996 Oct., v. 27, no. 2 p.165-181x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19970303b19970307c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02387naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014000127300001600267520152600283650002101809650001601830650001301846650002501859651001601884700001801900700001701918773008201935852000902017930003302026945001302059946001302072655001202085IND2035612420221118095221.0931029e199306  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203561242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillig, M.R.10aStructural and taxonomic components of habitat selection in the neotropical folivore Lamponius portoricensis (Phasmatodea: Phasmatidae)  ap. 634-641.  aLamponius portoricensis Rhen is a folivorous neotropical walkingstick that is a common light-gap inhabitant of the tabonuco forest in Puerto Rico. Little is known concerning the spatial distribution of this phasmatid or the manner in which it selects habitats. Based on multiple regression analysis of a suite of taxonomic and structural characteristics of understory flora, we determined that the density of walkingsticks was associated with patches that exhibit high apparency values for Piper treleaseanum Britton & Wilson and Symplocos martinicensis Jacq., and low apparency values for Dryopteris deltoidea (Sw.) Kuntze. The total development of the understory regardless of taxonomic composition at 76 cm (2.5 ft) and 107 cm (3.5 ft) also contributes to high walkingstick density, based on correlative analyses. Moreover, nonparametric analysis suggests that L. portoricensis disproportionately occurs on P. treleaseanum (approximately twice as often as expected based on plant apparency). Despite these associations, only a third of the variation in walkingstick density is accounted for by this suite of floral characteristics. The low vagility of L. portoricensis may result in its having incomplete information about the abundance and distribution of forage plants, whereas patch-dynamic processes involving changes in quality of forage can confound the significance of apparency alone in predicting density. The production of aromatic attractants by Piper may act as the proximate cue affecting patch selection. 3atropical forests 3aPhasmatidae 3ahabitats 3aspatial distribution 3aPuerto Rico1 aSandlin, E.A.1 aGannon, M.R.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1993 June, v. 22, no. 3 p.634-641x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle01817naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009100129300001600220500012400236520076200360650001401122650001801136650002401154650003101178650001601209650002501225650002101250650001701271650002601288653001701314773007001331852000901401930003301410945001301443946001101456655001201467IND2035608220221118095222.0931029s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203560822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamilton, R.J.10aStructure and general properties of mineral and vegetable oils used as spray adjuvants  ap. 141-146.  aPaper presented at the "Third International Symposium on Adjuvants for Agrochemicals," August 3-7, 1992, Cambridge, UK.  aThe abiogenic and biosynthetic origins of mineral and vegetable oils are contrasted and the importance of soybean, palm, rape seed and sunflower as the major source of fatty acids is highlighted.

Fruit Shelling Machine for Kernel Recovery in Biodiesel Production  ap. 755-765.  aThe presence of shells and husks during the process of oil extraction can affect oil yield and output quality. A shelling machine has been developed at the Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) to supersede the time-consuming manual method to remove shells and husks directly from the whole fruits for kernel recovery. The output kernels are in broken forms that ease the oil extraction process. The machine basically consists of cracking rollers, a vibratory sieve as the first stage separator, and a blower as the second stage separator. The performance of the machine was evaluated using five different blower air speeds (3.5, 6.2, 9.5, 12.6, and 13.4 ms-1) and the size of the mesh on the sifter was fixed. The 9.5 ms-1 speed was selected as optimal as the highest separation efficiency of 66.98% could be achieved. The considerations to determine the separation efficiencies included kernel recovery, the percentage of shells and the percentage of husks removed. At the optimal setting, the shell and husk removal achieved 97.17% and 55.21%, respectively, while the kernel recovery achieved 87.88%. A total of 12.12% kernels were lost and most of the losses were kernels in tiny broken form. The results indicated that a further improvement of the machine is necessary with the application of strategies to create highly different physical properties between the kernels and other impurities to enhance the effectiveness of the removal of impurities while maintaining a low kernel loss. 3aJatropha curcas 3aair 3abiodiesel 3acracking 3afruits 3ahulls 3aoils 3aseeds 3ashelling 3aMalaysia1 aShamsudin, Rosnah1 aBaharudin, B.T.

Two endpoints were measured to evaluate cytotoxicity: colony-forming ability (CF), and cell viability of the attached monolayer (CV), evaluated as total macromolecular content. The CF test provided the most sensitive endpoint, due to the lower number of exposed cells in comparison with the CV test. Using the CF assay, the Hep G2 cell line showed higher sensitivity than the HTC cell line to some chemicals known to be metabolised in vivo. The IC50s obtained under the different experimental conditions varied as a consequence of phenotypic differences between the cell lines, and of the nature of the endpoints. The most toxic chemicals were malathion, diazepam and amitriptyline (IC50: 0.001- 0.1 mM). The solvents tested produced the lowest toxic effects (IC50: > 10 mM). These findings suggest that hepatoma cell lines possessing various specific enzyme activities could be usefully employed in a battery of tests designed to reproduce in vitro the wide range of biochemical properties expressed by the cells in the whole organism. 3aanimal use alternatives 3acytotoxicity 3achemical substances1 aBosco, O.1 aBrenci, S.1 aAdamo, D.1 aPenco, S.1 aPiana, S.1 aFerro, M.1 aNanni, G.0 tAlternatives to laboratory animals.g1993 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.65-72x0261-19297nnas  aDNAL  a19931201b19931207c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02739naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002000143245009300163300001400256500002400270500001500294520125200309650001801561650002801579650002701607650002301634650001401657650002801671650001001699650002401709650002501733650002201758650001501780650002301795650002601818651000901844651001301853653001401866653002801880700001901908700002001927700001801947773010501965852000902070856008302079930003302162945002502195946001302220655001202233IND4448657520221118094612.0110201e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444865752DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-05-10-03552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlasa, Miroslav10aGenetic Diversity of Watermelon mosaic virus in Slovakia and Iran Shows Distinct Pattern  ap. 38-42.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAlthough Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV) is one of the main cucurbit pathogens and has a worldwide distribution, reliable data on its molecular variability is still limited to some geographical regions. The genetic diversity of 36 WMV isolates from Slovakia and Iran were studied by sequence analysis targeting two opposite genomic regions (P1 and NIb-CP). Phylogenetic analysis using partial sequences of the P1 gene showed that Slovak WMV isolates had greater diversity, representing two groups (group 1 and group 2), whereas all Iranian isolates belonged to a single group (group 2), with relatively low divergeance. Interestingly, in the NIb-CP region, all analyzed Slovak and Iranian isolates clustered within the group 1, thereby illustrating the phylogenetic discrepancies between the two analyzed genomic regions. Based on these data, one-half of analyzed Slovak isolates and all Iranian WMV isolates showed a switch in affiliation based on considered genomic region, clearly indicating their recombinant nature. This work provides further evidence of the significant contribution of recombination to the evolutionary history of WMV and outlines the necessity to target more than a single genome fragment for accurate typing of WMV isolates. 3aplant viruses 3aWatermelon mosaic virus 3ageographical variation 3astrain differences 3aphylogeny 3apathogen identification 3agenes 3apopulation genetics 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 3apathotypes 3amicrobial genetics 3agenetic recombination 3aIran 3aSlovakia 0aevolution 0amolecular sequence data1 aBananej, Kaveh1 aPredajna, Lukas1 aVahdat, Aisan0 tPlant disease.g2011 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.38-42dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-05-10-03553Available from publisher's Web site  a20110416b20110507c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/03/02  aOther US 7aarticle03077naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001900143245015000162300001400312500002400326500001500350520144700365650002501812650001901837650001501856650002301871650001901894650002301913650002601936650002701962650002201989650001802011650002302029650002802052650001702080650001402097650002402111650001902135650001302154653002002167700001902187700002102206773012302227852000902350856008302359856004602442930003302488945002502521946001302546655001202559IND4448657020221118094618.0110201e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444865702DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-03-10-01672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorevaj, Peter10aResistance in Winter Wheat Lines to Initial Infection and Spread Within Spikes by Deoxynivalenol and Nivalenol Chemotypes of Fusarium graminearum  ap. 31-37.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHead blight of wheat in the United States is caused primarily by the deoxynivalenol (DON)-producing chemotype of Fusarium graminearum. However, the discovery of the nivalenol (NIV) chemotype of F. graminearum in Louisiana and Arkansas necessitates having resistance in wheat to both chemotypes. The objectives of this research were to quantify resistance of selected winter wheat lines to initial infection and pathogen spread within spikes, to determine whether wheat lines selected for resistance to the DON chemotype also have resistance to the NIV chemotype, and to improve the methods for quantifying resistance to initial infection. A susceptible check (Coker 9835) and 15 winter wheat lines, which are adapted to the southeastern United States and possess diverse sources of head blight resistance, were evaluated for head blight resistance in a series of greenhouse and growth-chamber experiments. Significant levels of resistance to both initial infection and spread within a spike were found among the lines, and lines with resistance to isolates of the DON chemotype had even higher levels of resistance to isolates of the NIV chemotype. Quantifying resistance to initial infection was improved by standardizing the inoculum and environmental conditions. Additional information related to resistance to spread within a spike was obtained by calculating the area under the disease progress curve from 7 to 21 days after inoculation. 3aFusarium graminearum 3ainflorescences 3achemotypes 3agenetic resistance 3adisease course 3astrain differences 3aenvironmental factors 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aTriticum aestivum 3ascab diseases 3adisease resistance 3aplant genetic resources 3awinter wheat 3anivalenol 3agermplasm screening 3adeoxynivalenol 3ainoculum 0aGibberella zeae1 aGale, Liane R.1 aMilus, Eugene A.0 tPlant disease.g2011 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.31-37dAmerican Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-03-10-01673Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-03-10-0167  a20110416b20110507c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/03/02  aOther US 7aarticle02801naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002400143245006700167300001400234500002400248500001500272520117700287650002201464650001801486650001901504650002301523650002001546650003001566650001401596650001801610650001801628650002701646650002301673650002801696650002701724650002401751653001101775653002001786653001001806653002101816700002101837700002501858700002301883700002101906773012301927852000902050856008302059856004602142930003302188945002502221946001302246655001202259IND4448656820221118094620.0110201e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444865682DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-02-10-00962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Boyle, Patrick D.10aGenetic Characterization of Barley Net Blotch Resistance Genes  ap. 19-23.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNet blotch, caused by Pyrenophora teres f. teres, is one of the most devastating diseases of barley (Hordeum vulgare). Efficient utilization of available resistance sources is dependent upon successful characterization of genes conditioning resistance in diverse sources. Five net-blotch-resistant parents and one susceptible parent were intercrossed to identify novel resistance genes and postulate gene number and mode of inheritance. Seedling response to isolate ND89-19 was evaluated in a greenhouse test. Results indicate that the resistant spring barley lines CIho 2291 and CIho 5098 and the winter barley cv. Nomini each have single dominant genes for resistance. Resistance in CIho 5098 is governed by the same dominant gene conferring resistance in Nomini. Resistance in CIho 2291 is controlled by one dominant gene which, putatively, is the same gene conferring resistance in ND B112 but differs from the resistance genes carried by the other parents in this study. The resistance gene in Nomini or CIho 5098 could be pyramided with the resistance gene in CIho 2291 or ND B112 to enhance the durability of resistance against a wide spectrum of P. teres isolates. 3aPyrenophora teres 3aspring barley 3adominant genes 3agenetic resistance 3aHordeum vulgare 3afungal diseases of plants 3aseedlings 3awinter barley 3ahybridization 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3aplant genetic resources 3ainheritance (genetics) 3agermplasm screening 0abarley 0agene pyramiding 0agenes 0aresistance genes1 aBrooks, Wynse S.1 aSteffenson, Brian J.1 aStromberg, Erik L.1 aGriffey, Carl A.0 tPlant disease.g2011 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.19-23dAmerican Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-02-10-00963Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-02-10-0096  a20110416b20110507c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/03/02  aOther US 7aarticle03464naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128072000900137100001500146245012600161300001600287500002400303500002300327520220100350650002102551650001502572650001402587650002302601650001102624650002002635650001002655650001402665700002002679700002002699700001502719773012702734852000902861856009102870930003302961945002502994946001103019655001203030IND4448648820221118094935.0110130e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444864882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL400 0aL500 0aR3001 aHorn, N.L.10aGut morphology and nutrient retention responses of broiler chicks and White Pekin ducklings to dietary threonine deciency  ap. 513-520.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aGrowth performance, villi length and width, nutrient digestibility, basal short-circuit current, and glutamine transport were investigated in male broilers and White Pekin ducklings offered diets containing 3.3, 5.8, or 8.2 g of threonine (Thr) kg-1 in four studies. Seventy-two birds of each species were fed a standard broiler starter diet from 1 to 14 d of age followed by assignment to three dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design for a 7-d feeding trial in exp. 1 (broilers) and exp. 2 (ducklings). The dietary treatments consisted of an isonitrogenous, corn-soybean-meal-based diet with the addition of crystalline amino acids and graded levels of Thr. Dietary formulation and experimental design for exp. 3 (broilers) and exp. 4 (ducklings) were similar to exps. 1 and 2 except that birds were fed 3.3 or 8.2 g Thr kg-1 for a duration of 14 d. Chromic oxide was added to the dietary treatments as an indigestible marker. Excreta were collected on day 19 to 21 of age for exps. 1 and 2, and from day 26 to 28 of age for exps. 3 and 4. For chicks, there was no effect of dietary treatment on gain for birds fed treatments for 7 d, whereas gain increased (P < 0.001) as dietary Thr increased in birds fed dietary treatments for 14 d. Dry-matter retention increased (P < 0.05) as dietary Thr increased in chicks fed for 7 and 14 d. Threonine increased P retention (P = 0.02), but not Ca or N retention in chicks fed dietary treatments for 14 d. Increasing dietary Thr increased gain (P < 0.05) for ducklings fed dietary treatments for 7 and 14 d. Furthermore, DM retention increased (P < 0.05) as dietary Thr increased for ducklings fed dietary treatments for 7 and 14 d. Nitrogen retention increased (P = 0.04) as dietary Thr increased in ducklings fed dietary treatments for 14 d, but there was no effect of dietary treatment on P or Ca retention. There was no effect of dietary treatment on villi characteristics, basal short-circuit current, or glutamine transport in chicks or ducklings. The data established a link between dietary Thr and nutrient retention in broiler chicks and ducklings, although villi characteristics and permeability measurements were not altered. 3abroiler chickens 3aintestines 3athreonine 3anutrient retention 3achicks 3apoultry feeding 3aPekin 3aducklings1 aRadcliffe, J.S.1 aApplegate, T.J.1 aAdeola, O.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2010 Dec., v. 90, no. 4 p.513-520dAgricultural Institute of Canada.x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/aic-journals/cjas.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110406b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/02/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02110naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245006000144300001600204500001500220520100500235650000901240650001801249650002201267650002501289650002901314650001401343650001601357650001601373650001101389650004001400650002601440650001801466651001401484651001401498653001601512700001601528773006601544852000901610930003301619945001301652946001101665655001201676IND2180586420221118095335.0981021e199706  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218058642DNAL7 a92180992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoveney, J.12aA question of balance: nutrition, health and gastronomy  ap. 267-277.  a2019-12-05  aGiven the higher proportion of manufactured foods now available which meet current dietary recommendations, the food supply in developed countries like Australia could be said to be "healthier". Yet the "health" of the diet is often achieved at the expense of the "health" of the environment since ecological problems created by current food production and distribution methods remain unaddressed. Further, nutritional modifications which produce foods that are low in fat, sugar, salt and high in fibre do not necessarily address the concerns consumers have about the food supply. An emphasis solely on the physical health of populations, through improved diet, is out of keeping with current views on health which recognise the importance of overall well-being. Through the development of the concept of "sustaining gastronomy", consumers, food manufacturers and producers, and food regulators can better address the problems inherent in the food system, including those of an environmental nature. 3adiet 3afood industry 3afood availability 3aenvironmental impact 2aCommunity Participation. 2aEconomics 2aEnvironment 2aFood Supply 2aHumans 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aPublic Healthxtrends 2aPublic Policy 3aAustralia 0aAustralia 0afood supply1 aSantich, B.0 tAppetite.g1997 June, v. 28, no. 3 p.267-277x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01628naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115245009700129300001600226300002400242500002300266520074500289650001201034650001901046650001401065650001301079650002001092650002501112651001901137773008501156852000901241939003301250945000801283946001101291655001201302991630342870742620221118095332.0880610s1987    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880011502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuise, W.10aSocial and psychological aspects of breast feeding with special reference to sex differences  ap. 391-415.  ap. 391-415. charts.  aLiterature review.  aThis study examines factors related to breast feeding incidence and duration in 1019 infants in Norwich, England; special reference to the sex of the infant is considered as a possible determinant.

To evaluate the function of spo0A, an isogenic spo0A knock-out mutant was constructed. The spo0A mutant was unable to form endospores and produce enterotoxin, however, these defects could be restored by complementing the mutant with a recombinant plasmid carrying the wild-type spo0A gene. These results provide evidence that spo0A expression is essential for sporulation and enterotoxin production in C. perfringens. 3aenterotoxins 3abiosynthesis 3asporulation 3atranscription factors 3amicrobial genetics 0agenetic disruption1 aWaters, M.1 aGrau, R.R.1 aSarker, M.R.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2004 Apr. 15, v. 233, no. 2 p.233-240aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  aINDdGHKe2004/04/21  aNon-US 7aarticle01963naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002500127245012500152300001600277520096800293650001901261650002801280650002401308650002601332650003001358653004701388700001901435700001201454773013801466852000901604945002501613946001101638655001201649IND4362173520221118095658.0040420e20040415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436217352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The targets of this single tube reaction were the 23S rDNA and hly genes of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes, respectively. Our assay was efficient, 100% selective (i.e., it allowed accurate simultaneous identification of 52 L. monocytogenes and 120 Listeria spp. strains through the FAM-labelled hly and the VIC-labelled 23S rDNA probes, respectively); and had a detection limit of one target molecule in 100% (23S rDNA) and 56% (hly) of the reactions. Simultaneous quantification was possible along a 5-log dynamic range, with an upper limit of 30 target molecules and R2 values >0.995 in both cases. Our results indicate that this assay based on the amplification of the 23S rDNA gene can accurately quantify any mixture of Listeria species and simultaneously unambiguously quantify L. monocytogenes. 3afood pathogens 3apathogen identification 3amicrobial detection 3aquantitative analysis 3apolymerase chain reaction 0aduplex real time polymerase chain reaction1 aHernández, M.1 aPla, M.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2004 Apr. 15, v. 233, no. 2 p.257-267aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  aINDdGHKe2004/04/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02466naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001300144245016600157300001600323500001500339520118200354650002601536650001501562650003001577650004201607650001901649650001901668653004001687653002001727653001501747653001701762700001701779700001401796700001801810700001601828700001701844773013801861852000901999945002502008946001102033655001202044IND4362174720221118095614.0040420e20040415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436217472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The strain contained the constructed plasmid pGN2 which encoded genes for 2-CB oxidation (cbdA) and the green fluorescent protein (gfp). P. putida GN2 numbers were assessed by plating onto 2-CB minimal media and also by RTm-PCR detection of cbdA and gfp. Addition of P. putida GN2 decreased the time required to degrade 2-CB in all tested soils by more than 7 days. The RTm-PCR estimations of P. putida GN2 numbers strongly correlated with those obtained from plate count methods during active 2-CB degradation. However, after 2-CB degradation in the soils had ceased, RTm-PCR estimations of cbdA and gfp genes were generally one order of magnitude lower than those from plate counts. These results indicate the potential for RTm-PCR to rapidly determine degrader numbers in soil following bioaugmentation but also the need to exercise caution when attempting to determine cell numbers of degraders from the RTm-PCR quantification of plasmid encoded genes after substrate is depleted. 3aquantitative analysis 3abiomarkers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3agenetically engineered microorganisms 3abiodegradation 3apolluted soils 0areal-time polymerase chain reaction 0abioaugmentation 0asoil types 0acontaminants1 aGentry, T.J.1 aGrass, G.1 aJosephson, K.1 aRensing, C.1 aPepper, I.L.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2004 Apr. 15, v. 233, no. 2 p.307-314aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  aINDdGHKe2004/04/22  aNon-US 7aarticle01886naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245013700141300001600278520091900294650002001213650001101233650001901244650001601263650001701279653001801296700001501314700001701329773013601346852000901482930003301491945002501524946001101549655001201560IND4362572020221118095617.0040519e20040501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436257202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

To better understand the oxygen-stress responsive mechanism of P. chrysosporium, the metabolomic differential display analysis was performed using metabolites isolated from fungal cells grown under either air or 100% O2 atmosphere. In the GC¡MS total ion chromatogram of methanol-extracts from fungal cells, at least 183 peaks were detected and 53 compounds were identified. Among them, veratryl alcohol (VA), threonate, and erythronate were identified as oxygen-stress responsive metabolites. The intracellular concentration of VA increased dramatically within 1 h after an oxygen purge, indicating that VA production is sensitive to the oxygen stress in P. chrysosporium. 3awhite-rot fungi 3aoxygen 3aabiotic stress 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 0aoxygen stress1 aTanaka, H.1 aWariishi, H.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2004 May 1, v. 234, no. 1 p.111-116aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20040525b00000000c00000000  aINDdGHKe2004/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle01740naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001800127245011600145300001200261520085700273650003001130650002701160650002301187700001701210700001301227773013201240852000901372930003301381945002501414946001101439655001201450IND4362571020221118095634.0040519e20040501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436257102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The stability of short sequence DNA repeat (SSR) numbers was investigated to determine the suitability of this marker for strain differentiation. The number of SSR units was found to be stable under laboratory and certain stress conditions. This meets the requirements for a suitable genetic marker that should be stable upon cultivation of strains. Therefore, this SSR marker was used for strain differentiation from SSR-3 to SSR-15 and a large number of E. amylovora strains from Austria was screened for their SSR numbers for epidemiological identification purposes. Traceability was possible if strains had very high or very low SSR numbers. 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3amicrosatellite repeats 3astrain differences1 aStoger, A.R.1 aKeck, M.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2004 May 1, v. 234, no. 1 p.1-8aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20040525b00000000c00000000  aINDdGHKe2004/05/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03468naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014900168500001900317520182400336592002802160650002102188650001402209650001402223650001202237650001402249650001202263650000902275650000902284650001502293650002102308650001402329650001602343650002002359650002902379650001302408650001102421650001302432650001102445650002502456651001502481653004002496653002802536653001202564653001902576653001402595653002102609700001302630700001602643700001602659700001702675773010302692856008602795852000902881655001202890IND60717668620221119004746.0210212e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071766862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2020.1058012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThayer, J.A.10aInter-annual variability in forage fish population size structure: Comparison of selectivity of traditional vs. non-traditional sampling devices  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDespite the crucial role of forage fish in ecosystem functions globally, data on population demographic structure are often not readily available for many forage fish stocks. Data to characterize variability in population size structure can be highly informative for population monitoring and management, as such data can be used to estimate cohort strength and recruitment, variation in growth rates, and for body-size dependent broadcast spawners such as anchovy, variation in reproductive capacity. In this study, Anchovy Length Indices (ALI) were developed for the central California portion of the central stock of Northern anchovy using predator- and trawl-derived samples. Five different data sources were examined: seabird, sea lion and salmon diet, and midwater and acoustic-trawl surveys. Seabird and midwater trawl surveys had the longest time-series of data. Seabird and midwater trawl methods differed somewhat in their relative selectivity patterns, yet both sampled all age classes of anchovy and reflected similar patterns of inter-annual variability in length frequency. The combined seabird-trawl ALI (1998–2017) was used to characterize anchovy size structure for years when the fishery was not sampled (< 2014). The overall bimodal distribution of anchovy size was divided at 94 mm, suggesting that separation of age 0 and age 1+ anchovy in central California in summer (June) during this timespan was smaller than historic means for the region. The predator-based ALI provided further information prior to the initiation of anchovy length sampling during midwater trawl surveys (1993–1997). The ALIs encompassed periods of extremely high and low anchovy biomass, as well as extreme warm and cold ocean climate events; small mean anchovy lengths appeared to be related to warm conditions (ENSO).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEngraulis mordax 3aOtariidae 3aanchovies 3abiomass 3abody size 3aclimate 3acold 3adiet 3aecosystems 3afish communities 3afisheries 3aforage fish 3apopulation size 3areproductive performance 3aresearch 3asalmon 3aseabirds 3asummer 3atime series analysis 3aCalifornia 0aNorthern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) 0aPredator-based sampling 0aSeabird 0aMidwater trawl 0aIndicator 0aLength-frequency1 aBurr, Z.1 aField, J.C.1 aCarle, R.D.1 aWarzybok, P.0 tFisheries research.g2021 Feb., v. 234 p.105801-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2020.1058013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013300159300001600292500002000308520100000328592002801328596016501356596005901521596007101580650002901651650002601680650001201706650002301718650001701741650001301758650003901771650001601810650001501826650001001841650001101851700002001862700001501882700002101897700001401918700002001932700002001952700002101972700001401993700002202007700005202029773015002081856007402231852000902305655001202314IND60626805620221119212109.0181229e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062680562DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.139102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Yu‐Ting14aThe glycerol and ethanol production kinetics in low‐temperature wine fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains  ap. 102-110.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIncreasing glycerol production in low‐temperature wine fermentation is of concern for winemakers to improve the quality of wines. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of 10 different Saccharomyces cerevisiae on the kinetics of production of glycerol, ethanol and the activities of glycerol‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in low‐temperature fermentation. Ethanol production was influenced by temperature, and it was slightly higher at 13 °C than at 25 °C. Glycerol yields were significantly affected by both temperature and strains. More glycerol was produced at 25 °C than at 13 °C because the activity of GPD was higher at 25 °C than at 13 °C. Glycerol production of the different yeast strains was up to 3.19 and 3.18 g L⁻¹ at 25 and 13 °C, respectively. Therefore, isolating the yeast strains with high glycerol production and adaptation to low‐temperature fermentation is still the best method in winemaking.  aPublisher supplied data  aTD13‐5087cthe 13th Five‐Year innovation team “study on new processing technology and related mechanism of agricultural products storage and processing”  a31701172cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a16JCQNJC14600cTianjin Municipal Science and Technology Commission 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3aglycerol 3aglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3atemperature 3awinemaking 3awines 3ayeasts1 aZhang, Yu‐Shu1 aWen, Xiang1 aSong, Xiao‐Wan1 aMeng, Dan1 aLi, Bing‐Juan1 aWang, Mei‐Yan1 aTao, Yong‐Qing1 aZhao, Hui1 aGuan, Wen‐Qiang1 aDu, Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2405-04780 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2019 Jan., v. 54, no. 1 p.102-110dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.139103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04127naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100006300141242008300204245005900287300001300346500001900359520278700378592002803165650001103193650001403204650001003218650001603228650001503244650000903259650001203268650001703280650001403297650001003311650001403321650001603335650002203351653001403373653001303387653002403400653002703424700002703451773010703478856007503585852000903660655001203669IND60710508820221120235221.0200910e20200508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071050882DNAL7 a10.1093/auk/ukaa0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRotenberry, John T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0864-167610aEstimación de las relaciones entre masa del huevo y masa corporal en las aves10aEstimating egg mass–body mass relationships in birds  ap. 1-11.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe mass of a bird's egg is a critical attribute of the species' life history and represents a fundamental component of reproductive effort. Indeed, the tradeoff between the number of eggs in a clutch and clutch mass lies at the heart of understanding how environmental attributes such as nest predation or adult mortality influence reproductive investment. However, egg masses have not been reported for the majority of avian species. We capitalized on the strong allometric relationship between avian body mass and egg mass to produce egg mass estimates for over 5,500 species previously lacking such information. These estimates are accompanied by measures of the robustness of the regressions used to produce them (e.g., sample size, root mean square error [RMSE] of estimation, coefficient of determination, and degree of extrapolation), thus allowing independent evaluation of the suitability of any estimate to address a particular research question relating to avian life history. Most estimates (∼5,000) were based on family-level egg mass–body mass regressions, with the remainder derived from other relationships such as ordinal regressions. We compared estimating regressions based on adult vs. female body masses and, after finding little difference between the 2, based our final estimates on adult masses as those were more numerous in the literature. What small differences between adult- and female-based regressions that did occur were not related to sexual size dimorphism across families. These new estimates, coupled with ∼5,000 egg masses reported in the literature, provide a foundation of over 10,000 species for wider investigations assessing variation in reproductive effort in birds over a broad array of ecological and evolutionary contexts. LAY SUMMARY The mass of a bird's egg is a critical attribute of the species' life history but has not been reported for the majority of avian species. We capitalized on the strong statistical relationship between egg mass and avian body mass (known for almost all bird species) to produce new egg mass estimates for over 5,500 species previously lacking such information. Most estimates (∼5,000) were based on family level regressions of egg mass on body mass, with the remainder derived from other relationships such as order regressions. We found little difference between egg mass relationships calculated from adult vs. female-only body masses and based our final estimates on adult masses as those were more numerous in the literature. These new estimates, coupled with ∼5,000 egg masses reported in the literature, provide a foundation of over 10,000 species for wider investigations examiniing variation in reproductive effort in birds over a broad array of ecological and evolutionary contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aallometry 3abirds 3abody weight 3aegg masses 3aeggs 3afemales 3alife history 3amortality 3anests 3apredation 3asample size 3asexual dimorphism 0abody mass 0aegg mass 0areproductive effort 0asexual size dimorphism1 aBalasubramaniam, Priya0 tAuk.g2020 May 8, v. 137, no. 3 p.1-11dUniversity of California PresswJournal:19765x1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/auk/ukaa0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04051naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245013500166300001400301520234400315592002802659650002702687650001102714650002202725650002002747650002602767650002302793650002202816650001902838650002002857650001802877650002102895650005002916650002702966650001502993650002303008650002203031650001603053653002003069653002203089653002703111653002203138653001103160700001603171700001603187700001703203700001503220700001603235700001703251700001603268773010403284856008803388852000903476655001203485IND60538107020221121234304.0190319e20150510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053810702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.01.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Min14aThe effects of constraining variables on parameter optimization in carbon and water flux modeling over different forest ecosystems  ap. 30-41.  aThe ability of terrestrial biogeochemical models in predicting land-atmospheric carbon and water exchanges is largely hampered by the insufficient characterization of model parameters. The direct observations of carbon/water fluxes and the associated environmental variables from eddy covariance (EC) flux towers provide a notable opportunity to examine the underlying processes controlling carbon and water exchanges between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. In this study, we applied the Metropolis simulated annealing technique to conduct parameter optimization analyses of a process-based biogeochemical model, simplified PnET (SIPNET), using a variety of constraining variables from EC observations and leaf area index (LAI) from MODIS at three ChinaFLUX forest sites: a temperate mixed forest (CBS), a subtropical evergreen coniferous plantation (QYZ) and a subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest (DHS). Our analyses focused on (1) identifying the key model parameters influencing the simulation of carbon and water fluxes with SIPNET; (2) evaluating how different combinations of constraining variables influence parameter estimations and associated uncertainties; and (3) assessing the model performance with the optimized parameterization in predicting carbon and water fluxes in the three forest ecosystems. Our sensitivity analysis indicated that, among three different forest ecosystems, the prediction of carbon and water fluxes was mostly affected by photosynthesis-related parameters. The performances of the model simulations depended on different parameterization schemes, especially the combinations of constraining variables. The parameterization scheme using both net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and evapotranspiration (ET) as constraining variables performed best with most well-constrained parameters. When LAI was added to the optimization, the number of well-constrained model parameters was increased. In addition, we found that the model cannot be well-parameterized with only growing-season observations, especially for those forest ecosystems with distinct seasonal variation. With the optimized parameterization scheme using both NEE and ET observations all year round, the SIPNET were able to simulate the seasonal and inter-annual variations of carbon and water exchanges in three forest ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroadleaved evergreens 3acarbon 3adeciduous forests 3aeddy covariance 3aenvironmental factors 3aevapotranspiration 3aforest ecosystems 3agrowing season 3aleaf area index 3amixed forests 3amodel validation 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3anet ecosystem exchange 3aprediction 3aseasonal variation 3asimulation models 3auncertainty 0aEddy covariance 0aModel data fusion 0aParameter optimization 0aForest ecosystems 0aSIPNET1 aHe, Honglin1 aRen, Xiaoli1 aSun, Xiaomin1 aYu, Guirui1 aHan, Shijie1 aWang, Huimin1 aZhou, Guoyi0 tEcological modelling.g2015 May 10, v. 303 p.30-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.01.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245012900171300001800300520175600318592002802074650001502102650001902117650001502136650001102151650001402162650001202176650006602188650001902254650002502273650001302298650002902311650001502340650001402355650002002369650001502389650002602404650005802430650002302488651001702511700002502528700002102553700002102574700006402595773016302659856008202822852000902904655001202913IND60687078020221123034119.0200324e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068707802DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-019-02508-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoohi-Shalmaee, N.10aEcological adaptation of the Persian Gulf polychaete in a polluted area: proteomics concerning dominant defensive biomarkers  ap. 1937-1946.  aMarine species are negatively affected by wastewater. Based on our field observation along the Persian Gulf coastal areas, a widespread colony of polychaete worms, Galeolaria sp. lived in an area polluted with municipal wastewater. Accordingly, we hypothesized that a probable ecological adaption to bacterial pollutants has occurred. To test this hypothesis, protein profiling of coelomic fluid in the polychaetes collected from polluted and non-polluted areas was compared by RP-HPLC and 2DE, followed by MALDI-TOF analyses. The identical spots were selected as biomarkers, and the function of those proteins was determined by searching in databases in order to annotate their homologs using bioinformatics analyses by BLASTP, InterPro, PROSITE, Panther, and CDD servers. Twenty six and 17 HPLC fractions were extracted from the samples of polluted and non-polluted areas, respectively. Bacterial load in the water of polluted area was 2.8-fold higher than non-polluted area. The protein content of the samples of polluted area (3.65 µg/µL) was significantly greater than the samples of non-polluted (2.50 µg/µL) ones. MDS analysis of the HPLC profiles discriminated molecular pattern of polluted and non-polluted samples. Quantitative analysis of 2-DE results showed 65 and 23 spots in the polluted and non-polluted areas, respectively. Homology analyses of the peptide fragments derived from three biomarkers in the samples from polluted area, respectively, showed similarity with keratin, cyanelle 30S ribosomal protein, and peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, suggesting a reaction against bacterial pollution. The dominant biomarkers confirmed that probably a conditional adaptation has been happened in the polychaetes lived in the polluted area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolychaeta 3abioinformatics 3abiomarkers 3acoasts 3adatabases 3akeratin 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amicrobial load 3amunicipal wastewater 3apeptides 3apeptidylprolyl isomerase 3apollutants 3apollution 3aprotein content 3aproteomics 3aquantitative analysis 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aribosomal proteins 3aPersian Gulf1 aMousavi-Nadushan, R.1 aMostafavi, P.

A Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating totals for finite populations is proposed. A nonparametric linear model is assumed to explain the relationship between the dependent variable of interest and covariates. The regression coefficients in the linear model are allowed to vary as a function of a subset of covariates nonparametrically based on B-splines. The generality of this approach makes it robust and applicable to data collected using a variety of sampling techniques, provided the sample is representative of the finite population. A simulation study is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed model for the estimation of the population total. Results indicate accurate estimation of population totals using the approach. The modeling approach is used to estimate the total production of avocado for a large group of groves in Mexico.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3acrop production 3adata collection 3agroves 3alinear models 3aregression analysis 3aMexico1 aContreras-Cruz, Luis Fernando1 aSmith, Eric P.1 aRodríguez, José E.,0 tJournal of agricultural, biological, and environmental statistics.g2016 Sept., v. 21, no. 3 p.548-568dSpringer USx1085-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13253-016-0250-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245006800169300001800237500001500255520187500270592002802145650001102173650003302184650001802217650004302235650001802278650001602296650001702312650002202329650001502351650001602366653002602382700003502408700002502443700001502468700002102483773012802504856007302632852000902705655001202714IND60529588720170412000000.0160717e20130319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052958872DNAL7 a10.1021/ac303255h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarhuenda-Egea, Frutos C.10aNew Approach for Chemometric Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data  ap. 3053-3058.  a2019-12-06  aThe search of metabolites which are present in biological samples and the comparison between different samples allow the construction of certain biochemical patterns. The mass spectrometry (MS) methodology applied to the analysis of biological samples makes it possible for the identification of many metabolites. Each obtained signal (m/z) is characteristic of a particular metabolite. However, the mass data (m/z) interpretation is difficult because of the large amount of information that they contain. In this work, we present a relatively simple tool that allows us to deal with the whole of the mass information from the chemometric analysis. The statistical analysis is a key stage in order to identify the metabolites involved in a particular biochemical pattern. We transformed the mass data matrix in a vector. By having the data as a vector, it was possible to keep all the information and also avoid the signals overlapping, which is the major problem when the total ion chromatogram (TIC) is obtained. In the approach proposed here, the mass data (m/z) matrix was split in 100 different TIC in order to avoid the signal overlapping. The 100 chromatograms were concatenated in a vector. This vector, which can be plotted as a continuous (2D pseudospectrum), greatly simplifies for one to understand the subsequent dimensional multivariate analysis. To validate the method, 19 samples from two human embryos culture medium were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS).

However, after the SMAP radar became inoperable, NASA decided to utilize the Sentinel 1A/1B C-band SAR data in its place. The new version of baseline brightness temperature (Tb) downscaling algorithm for SMAP is tested using L-band airborne data to evaluate the capabilities of the C-band Sentinel-1A SAR relative to L-band radar data in downscaling the SMAP Tb for achieving high resolution brightness temperature. In this study, the downscaling algorithm used L-band airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter (σ) collected from the fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5) in south-eastern Australia to downscale 36 km L-band SMAP radiometer Tb pixels to 3 km and 9 km. The downscaling results were then compared with the published results using Sentinel-1A C-band backscatter, and evaluated against airborne 1 km resolution L-band passive microwave brightness temperature collected from SMAPEx-5. The results show that for vertical polarization the average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of downscaled Tb when compared with reference airborne Tb across 4 days at 9 km resolution were 4.9 K for L-band and 6.0 K for C-band, and increased to 9.3 K for L-band and 9.6 K for C-band at 3 km spatial resolution. Moreover, the correlation coefficient (R) of downscaled and reference Tb across the 4 days was 0.92 for L-band and 0.88 for C-band at 9 km, decreasing to 0.75 for L-band and 0.72 for C-band at 3 km spatial resolution. Accordingly, the RMSE increased and the correlation coefficient decreased when using C-band radar data in place of that at L-band. However, overall there is expected to be only a slight decrease in performance of the downscaling algorithm by using the Sentinel 1A data in place of the SMAP radar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Aeronautics and Space Administration 3aalgorithms 3aenvironment 3asatellites 3asoil water 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atemperature 3aAustralia 0aDownscaling 0aBrightness temperature 0aBackscatter 0aL-band 0aC-band 0aSMAP 0aSentinel-1A 0aSMAPEx1 aWalker, Jeffrey P.1 aDas, Narendra N.1 aDavary, Kamran1 aFaridhosseini, Alireza1 aWu, Xiaoling1 aZhu, Liujun0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 251 p.112111-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1121113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03596naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245012600173300001400299520171900313592002802032650002502060650001102085650002302096650001302119650001802132650001002150650002402160650001902184650001002203650001602213650002902229650001302258650002402271650002102295650001602316650001902332650001102351650001202362650001302374650002902387653002102416653001802437653002502455653002202480653001602502700002502518700005802543700002502601700002302626700002102649700006102670700006002731773011002791856008402901852000902985655001202994IND60637955820221117012958.0190530e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063795582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2019.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDmitrović, Slavica10aNepetalactone-rich essential oil mitigates phosphinothricin-induced ammonium toxicity in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.  ap. 87-94.  aActive ingredient of the commercial herbicide BASTA (B), phosphinothricin, acts as an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase (GS), a key enzyme in ammonium assimilation. The treatment with BASTA leads to an elevation of ammonium levels in plants and further to various physiological alterations, ammonium toxicity and lethality. Results of the present study emphasize the complexity underlying control mechanisms that determine BASTA interaction with essential oil (EO) from Nepeta rtanjensis (NrEO), bioherbicide inducing oxidative stress in target plants. Simultaneous application of NrEO and BASTA, two agents showing differential mode of action, suspends BASTA-induced ammonium toxicity in Arabidopsis thaliana plants. This is achieved through maintaining GS activity, which sustains a sub-toxic and/or sub-lethal ammonium concentration in tissues. As revealed by the present study, regulation of GS activity, as influenced by BASTA and NrEO, occurs at transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and/or posttranslational levels. Two genes encoding cytosolic GS, GLN1;1 and GLN1;3, are highlighted as the main isozymes in Arabidopsis shoots contributing to NrEO-induced overcoming of BASTA-generated ammonium toxicity. The effects of NrEO might be ascribed to its major component nepetalactone, but the contribution of minor EO components should not be neglected. Although of fundamental significance, the results of the present study suggest possible low efficiency of BASTA in plantations of medicinal/aromatic plants such as Nepeta species. Furthermore, these results highlight the possibility of using NrEO as a bioherbicide in BASTA-treated crop fields to mitigate the effect of BASTA residues in contaminated soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aNepeta 3aactive ingredients 3aammonium 3abiopesticides 3adeath 3aessential oil crops 3aessential oils 3agenes 3aglufosinate 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aisozymes 3amechanism of action 3aoxidative stress 3aplantations 3apolluted soils 3ashoots 3atissues 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 0aPhosphinothricin 0aEssential oil 0aGlutamine synthetase 0aAmmonium toxicity 0aArabidopsis1 aDragičević, Milan,1 aSavić, Jelena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8385-75491 aMilutinović, Milica1 aŽivković, Suzana1 aMaksimović, Vuk1 aMatekalo, Dragana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6565-45801 aMisic, Danijela,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5419-07730 tJournal of plant physiology.g2019 June, v. 237 p.87-94dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2019.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245012800170500001900298520105400317592002801371650002301399650001701422650001501439650000901454650001901463650001101482653002201493653001501515653002901530653002501559700001401584700001301598700001901611700001401630773009101644856009001735852000901825655001201834IND60717428720221120223717.0201202e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071742872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2020.1061942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hongyu10aInfluences of crosslinkable crystalline copolymer on the polymer network and filler dispersion of NR/ESBR/CB nanocomposites  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aConsidering that the short service life and frequent replacement of the off-the-road tires (OTR) have raised critical environmental problems, the development of long service life OTR with low rolling resistance, high resistance to abrasion and fatigue holds great potential in resolving both environmental and resource issues. Herein, crystalline trans-1, 4-poly (butadiene-co-isoprene) (TBIR) is introduced into the traditional formula of the OTR tire tread stocks (natural rubber (NR)/emulsion polymerized styrene-butadiene rubber (ESBR)). The effects of TBIR on polymer aggregation structures, crosslinking networks, filler-rubber interactions and filler dispersion are examined and discussed in detail. It has been revealed that the TBIR-incorporated nanocomposites present reduced heat build-up and rolling resistance, outstanding abrasion and fatigue resistance.

Recently, it was shown that isolated edge information is sufficient to elicit a body pattern very similar to that used when a whole object is present. Here, we examined contour completion in cuttlefish by assaying body pattern responses to artificial backgrounds of ‘objects’ formed from fragmented circles, these same fragments rotated on their axis, and with the fragments scattered over the background, as well as positive (full circles) and negative (homogenous background) controls. The animals displayed similar responses to the full and fragmented circles, but used a different body pattern in response to the rotated and scattered fragments. This suggests that they completed the broken circles and recognized them as whole objects, whereas rotated and scattered fragments were instead interpreted as small, individual objects in their own right. We discuss our findings in the context of achieving accurate camouflage in the benthic shallow-water environment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSepia officinalis 3aanimals 3abenthic zone 3aphenotypic plasticity 3asensation 2aAdaptation, Biologicalxphysiology 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aColor 2aForm Perceptionxphysiology 2aPattern Recognition, Visualxphysiology 2aPhotic Stimulation 2aSepiaxphysiology 2aVision, Ocularxphysiology 0aFrance1 aDarmaillacq, Anne-Sophie1 aShashar, Nadav0 tProceedings.g2012 June 22, v. 279, no. 1737 p.2386-2390dRoyal Societyx0962-84527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2012.0026  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245008100154520187300235592002802108650003102136650001102167650001902178650001502197650002302212700001402235700001902249700001702268700001802285700001802303773012802321856007402449852000902523655001202532IND60651319120221120032011.0190711e20190527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065131912DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111012562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, Bao 10aAnalysis of Factors Affecting Asynchronous RTK Positioning with GNSS Signals  aFor short baseline real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning, the atmosphere and broadcast ephemeris errors can be usually eliminated in double-differenced (DD) processing for synchronous observations. However, in the case of possible communication latency time, these errors may not be eliminated in DD treatments due to their variations during latency time. In addition, the time variation of these errors may present different characteristics among GPS, GLONASS, BDS, and GALILEO due to different satellite orbit and clock types. In this contribution, the formulas for studying the broadcast orbit and clock offset errors and atmosphere error in asynchronous RTK (ARTK) model is proposed, and comprehensive experimental analysis is performed to numerically show time variations of these errors and their impacts on RTK results from short-baselines among four systems. Compared with synchronous RTK, the degradation of position precision for ARTK can reach a few centimeters, but the accuracy degradation to a different degree by different systems. BDS and Galileo usually outperform GPS and GLONASS in ARTK due to the smaller variation of broadcast ephemeris error. The variation of broadcast orbit error is generally negligible compared with the variation of broadcast clock offset error for GPS, BDS, and Galileo. Specifically, for a month of data, the root mean square (RMS) values for the variation of broadcast ephemeris error over 15 seconds are 11.2, 16.9, 7.3, and 3.0 mm for GPS, GLONASS, BDS, and Galileo, respectively. The variation of ionosphere error for some satellites over 15 seconds can reach a few centimeters during active sessions under a normal ionosphere day. In addition, compared with other systems, BDS ARTK shows an advantage under high ionosphere activity, and such advantage may be attributed to five GEO satellites in the BDS constellation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglobal positioning systems 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3atemporal variation1 aLiu, Hui 1 aFeng, Yanming 1 aXu, Longwei 1 aQian, Chuang 1 aYang, Zhixin 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 May 27, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111012563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03974naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141242011600158245009400274300001300368500001900381520268100400592002803081650001203109650001403121650001003135650001403145650000903159650001803168650001103186653001503197653001403212653001303226653001503239653001303254653001503267700002003282700005903302773010703361856007503468852000903543655001203552IND60710508920221121005010.0200910e20200506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071050892DNAL7 a10.1093/auk/ukaa0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHays, Ian R.10aForme des œufs d'oiseaux: évaluation d'une nouvelle mesure pour quantifier la conicité des coquilles d'œufs14aThe shape of avian eggs: Assessment of a novel metric for quantifying eggshell conicality  ap. 1-14.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aStudying the avian egg, its shape, and other aspects of its morphology, has recently undergone a renaissance. Yet most studies rely solely on 2, albeit multicomponent, metrics for the quantification of egg shape: elongation and asymmetry. The difficulty of quantifying an additional trait, the curvature, of an eggshell has yielded many attempts, including several with complex equations or spatial modeling techniques based on digitized images. Yet most of these approaches have lacked an independent single-variable metric, hampering comparative studies especially. We propose a metric for one common quality of egg shape, conicality, which is notably variable across different species' calcareous shells, including shorebirds and non-avian theropods. This metric utilizes multiple measurements of the slope along an egg's profile to produce a distribution of angular measurements, which can be analyzed with a kurtosis value. We tested this metric with sets of computer-generated and 3-dimensional-printed egg forms, where elongation, the percentage of conicality, and the relative curvature of the shell profile were systematically manipulated. For applicability to natural eggs and their diversity across taxa, the kurtosis value was used to quantify the gradient of conicality across a focal avian family, Alcidae, where the extreme ranges of kurtosis values successfully identified eggs qualitatively described as most conical in previous studies. Given the significance of egg morphology and profile curvature to eggshells' structural integrity, surface area-to-volume ratio, mobility/stability, nesting behavior, embryonic development, and individual recognition, our proposed measure of conicality could prove a useful variable to the study of avian and non-avian egg-producing species. LAY SUMMARY Avian eggs are shaped in diverse ways and the form of bird's eggshell can be influenced by its nesting requirements, parenting strategies and flight abilities. Most previous studies used only 2 metrics to study avian egg shape: (1) the width-to-length ratio and (2) the position along its length where the widest part of the egg is located (asymmetry). We propose a novel metric (conicality) for quantifying how straight/curved the profile of an eggshell is between its outermost dimensions by assessing how much either half of the profile resembles a cone. The novel conicality measure was also applied to a group of closely related birds with eggs that ranged from more elliptical to more conical. This new conicality metric successfully predicted the relative level of curvature known from casual observations of each species, which supports the method's validity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlcidae 3aasymmetry 3abirds 3aegg shell 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3aflight 0aconicality 0aegg shape 0akurtosis 0amorphology 0apyriform 0aUria aalge1 aLjubičić, Iva1 aHauber, Mark E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2014-49280 tAuk.g2020 May 6, v. 137, no. 3 p.1-14dUniversity of California PresswJournal:19765x1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/auk/ukaa0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245019000163300001800353520169700371592002802068650002902096650001602125650001302141650001402154650001602168650002902184650001702213650002202230650001602252650001402268650001302282650002002295650003602315650001302351650001602364650001902380650001902399650001202418700002402430700001602454700002002470700002302490773011002513856007502623852000902698655001202707IND60529588820221120093158.0160717e20130319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052958882DNAL7 a10.1021/ac30328382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDykstra, Andrew B.,10aCharacterizing the Range of Extracellular Protein Post-Translational Modifications in a Cellulose-Degrading Bacteria Using a Multiple Proteolyic Digestion/Peptide Fragmentation Approach  ap. 3144-3151.  aPost-translational modifications (PTMs) are known to play a significant role in many biological functions. The focus of this study is to optimize an integrated experimental/informatics approach to more confidently characterize the range of post-translational modifications of the cellulosome protein complex used by the bacterium Clostridium thermocellum to better understand how this protein machine is tuned for enzymatic cellulose solubilization. To enhance comprehensive characterization, the extracellular cellulosome proteins were analyzed using multiple proteolytic digests (trypsin, Lys-C, Glu-C) and multiple fragmentation techniques (collisionally activated dissociation, electron transfer dissociation, decision tree). As expected, peptide and protein identifications were increased by utilizing alternate proteases and fragmentation methods, in addition to the increase in protein sequence coverage. The complementarity of these experiments also allowed for a global exploration of PTMs associated with the cellulosome based upon a set of defined PTMs that included methylation, oxidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and signal peptide cleavage. In these experiments, 85 modified peptides corresponding to 28 cellulosome proteins were identified. Many of these modifications were located in active cellulolytic or structural domains of the cellulosome proteins, suggesting a level of possible regulatory control of protein function in various cellulotyic conditions. The use of complementary proteolytic digestion/peptide fragmentation processes allowed for independent verification of PTMs in different experiments, thus leading to increased confidence in PTM identifications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium thermocellum 3aacetylation 3abacteria 3acellulose 3acellulosome 3adecision support systems 3adissociation 3aelectron transfer 3amethylation 3aoxidation 3apeptides 3aphosphorylation 3apost-translational modification 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3asignal peptide 3asolubilization 3atrypsin1 aRodríguez, Miguel,1 aRaman, Babu1 aCook, Kelsey

We discovered a cytoskeletal structure that prevents damage to the nucleus during migration in confined microenvironments. The formin-family actin filament nucleator FMN2 associates with and generates a perinuclear actin/focal adhesion (FA) system that is distinct from previously characterized actin/FA structures. This system controls nuclear shape and positioning in cells migrating on 2D surfaces. In confined 3D microenvironments, FMN2 promotes cell survival by limiting nuclear envelope damage and DNA double-strand breaks. We found that FMN2 is upregulated in human melanomas and showed that disruption of FMN2 in mouse melanoma cells inhibits their extravasation and metastasis to the lung. Our results indicate a critical role for FMN2 in generating a perinuclear actin/FA system that protects the nucleus and DNA from damage to promote cell survival during confined migration and thus promote cancer metastasis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aactin 3aadhesion 3acell movement 3acell viability 3acytoskeleton 3ahumans 3amelanoma 3ametastasis 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3anuclear membrane 0aactin 0acell migration 0aconfined migration 0aformin 0aventral actin bundle 0afocal adhesion 0astress fiber 0amelanoma 0ametastasis 0aDNA damage1 aFischer, Robert S.1 aGurel, Pinar1 aThiam, Hawa Racine1 aTubbs, Anthony1 aBaird, Michelle A.1 aDavidson, Michael W.1 aPiel, Matthieu1 aAlushin, Gregory M.1 aNussenzweig, Andre1 aSteeg, Patricia S.1 aWaterman, Clare M.0 tCell.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 167 p.1571-1585.e18dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02175naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245015300166300001600319520115300335592002801488653002901516653001101545653001201556653001701568700001501585700002001600700001501620700002601635773010801661856008301769852000901852655001201861IND60554019420221122034114.0161023e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055401942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejmhg.2012.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJyoti, Smita10aEvaluation of micronucleus frequency by acridine orange fluorescent staining in bucccal epithelial cells of oral submucosus fibrosis (OSMF) patients  ap. 189-193.  aOral submucosus fibrosis (OSMF) is a collagen-related disorder seen in habitual betel quids and smokers. This is a high risk precancerous condition in which the connective tissue fibers of the lamina propria and deeper parts of the mucosa becomes stiff with restricted mouth opening. Patients with severe cases have symptoms like difficulties in chewing, swallowing and speaking. In the present study 25 individuals were gutkha chewers and 25 were OSMF patients (chewing gutkha along with smoking) and 25 individuals were taken as controls. A significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei was observed in OSMF patients (34.4±1.79) as compared to gutkha chewers (14.4±0.73) and controls (4.36±0.27). The number of micronucleated cells in OSMF, gutkha chewers and control groups were 19.84±0.69, 12.6±0.51 and 4.20±0.27, respectively and are significantly different at p<0.05. Acridine orange is used due its fluorescence nature and easier visibility of the micronucleus present in the buccal epithelial cells. It is concluded that chewing gutkha along with smoking is more dangerous for human health as it hastens the incidence of OSMF.  aPublisher supplied data 0aOral submucosus fibrosis 0aGutkha 0aSmoking 0aMicronucleus1 aKhan, Saif1 aAfzal, Mohammad1 aNaz, Falaq1 aSiddique, Yasir Hasan0 tEgyptian Journal of Medical Human Genetics.g2013 Apr., v. 14 p.189-193dElsevier B.V.x1110-86307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmhg.2012.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03653naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245013300173506002800306520225400334592002802588506003702616650001902653650001702672650003002689650001002719650001102729650001802740650001102758650001502769650001202784650001502796650003602811650001502847650001902862650001002881650001602891650001502907650001002922650001802932700002302950700002202973773009602995856008303091852000903174655001203183IND60740065620221207133616.0201009s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074006562DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202025020162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatiana, Guguchkina10aNew grape varieties for production of high-quality wines, and assessment methodology for varietal characteristics of the product  aResource is Open Access  aIn recent years, Russian and international breeders have produced a great many of new varieties of Vitis vinifera grapes as well as interspecies hybrids, distinguished by a high quality of fruit and other useful economic and biological features. Having a big reserve of technologically important substances and hygienic factors of grapevine, the resistant varieties may prove especially efficient for the production of premium-class wines. The appearance of high-end Russian wines with protected geographical indication (PGI) and protected appellation of origin (PAO), first of all, fits in with the requirements of international markets. It is a necessary criterion for product quality and safety assurance at the highly competitive global market, and development of universally recognized brands. It also helps resolve a number of socio-economic issues, such as formation of winemaking culture, and production of wines of guaranteed quality from own grapes. This study is devoted to substantiating the necessity for development of methods of formation of single information databases on characteristic features of PGI and PAO wines, including their distinctive organoleptic, physical and chemical properties (extract components – the cation-anion composition, organic acids, total phenolic and anthocyanin content; unique colour characteristics), as well as the application of the system of organoleptic assessment of wines with the use of descriptive analysis of wine colour, flavour and taste. It is well-timed and relevant to determine the regularities of realization of the varietal potential of a grapevine plant in terms of climatic conditions of growing and geographical origin based on the study of the endogenous and exogenous components of wines with the use of the methods of high-performance capillary electrophoresis, spectral photometry, organoleptic analysis, and statistical techniques. This research generalizes and puts forth a contemporary view of varietal and geographical identification of wines. It is shown that the proposed research guideline is highly sought-after, and it is of fundamental and practical importance for the development of regional and national selection, genetic, viticultural and winemaking industries.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVitis vinifera 3aanthocyanins 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acolor 3aflavor 3afruit quality 3agrapes 3aguidelines 3ahygiene 3aphotometry 3aprotected designation of origin 3aprovenance 3asocioeconomics 3ataste 3aviticulture 3awinemaking 3awines 3aworld markets1 aMikhail, Antonenko1 aYelena, Yakimenko0 tBIO web of conferences.g2020, v. 25 p.02016-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202025020163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013900173300001600312520137200328592002801700650004401728650002201772650001901794650001501813650001801828650001501846650001401861650002301875650001101898650001701909650002301926650001301949650002201962650002001984650001602004650001302020650003102033650001202064650003302076650001102109650002102120651001202141653001402153653001902167653003102186653002102217700001902238700002002257700001802277700005802295773009902353856008402452852000902536655001202545IND60606254420221120100904.0180725e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060625442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2016.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenkacem, Tassadit10aPhysicochemical characterization of a diatomaceous upon an acid treatment: a focus on surface properties by inverse gas chromatography  ap. 498-507.  aNatural diatomite from Sig/Algeria was treated with 0.5, 1.0, 3.0 and 5.0M nitric acid solutions for 2h under reflux at 333K in order to improve its performance as support of catalyst. The purified silica powders obtained from frustules can also be used to reinforce composites. The solids obtained were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermal analyses, and nitrogen adsorption–desorption at 77K. Treatment of diatomite earth with nitric acid reduced mineral impurities, such as Fe2O3 and alkali metal oxides (CaO, MgO), eliminated carbonates and increased SiO2 ratio from 88% to 98%. The SEM micrographs showed the original geometry of the pores to be preserved. The surface properties were also evaluated using inverse gas chromatography at infinite dilution (IGC-ID) and finite concentration (IGC-FC). The interest here was to establish whether the technique is sufficiently sensitive to detect variations in the surface properties of the diatomite due to this chemical treatment. The IGC analysis permitted to reach several surface energy components with organic probes. Between them, the distribution function of the adsorption energy sites obtained with the isopropanol probe revealed a silica structure after the 5M nitric acid treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacid treatment 3aadsorption 3acalcium oxide 3acarbonates 3acatalysts 3adiatomaceous earth 3aenergy 3aferric oxide 3agas chromatography 3ageometry 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amagnesium oxide 3anitric acid 3anitrogen 3aphysicochemical properties 3apowders 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3athermal analysis 3aAlgeria 0aDiatomite 0aAcid treatment 0aInverse gas chromatography 0aCatalyst support1 aHamdi, Boualem1 aChamayou, Alain1 aBalard, Henri1 aCalvet, Rachel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5515-09760 tPowder technology.g2016 June, v. 294 p.498-507dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2016.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008200167300001600249520107600265592002801341650002101369650001401390650001601404650001201420650002601432650001901458650001701477650001801494650001201512650001701524650001101541650001601552650002301568650001601591653003201607653003801639653002901677653000901706653000901715653001601724653002101740653002601761653001401787653002301801653000901824700001901833700002001852700001801872700001601890773010801906856008602014852000902100655001202109IND60540835820221120102909.0190318e20150122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054083582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.08.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, J.S.10aEffect of cellulose nanocrystals and gelatin in corn starch plasticized films  ap. 215-222.  aCellulose at the nanoparticle scale has been studied as a reinforcement for biodegradable matrices to improve film properties. The goal has been to investigate the properties of starch/gelatin/cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) films. Eleven treatments were considered using RCCD (rotatable central composite design), in addition to four control treatments. For each assay, the following dependent variables were measured: water vapor permeability (WVP), thickness, opacity and mechanical properties. The microstructure and thermal properties of the films were also assessed. Increases in gelatin and CNC concentrations lead to increases in film thickness, strength and elongation at break. The films containing only gelatin in their matrix displayed better results than the starch films, and the addition of CNC had a positive effect on the assessed response variables. The films exhibited homogeneous and cohesive structures, indicating strong interactions between the filler and matrix. Films with low levels of gelatin and CNC presented the maximum degradation temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acellulose 3acorn starch 3agelatin 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3aopacity 3apermeability 3astarch 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3awater vapor 0aGlycerol (PubChem CID: 753) 0aSulfuric acid (PubChem CID: 1118) 0aWater (PubChem CID: 962) 0aCNWs 0aCNCs 0aBiopolymers 0aNanobiocomposite 0aMechanical properties 0aPackaging 0aBarrier properties 0aRCCD1 ados Reis, K.C.1 aMenezes, E.G.T.1 aPereira, F.V.1 aPereira, J.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 Jan. 22, v. 115 p.215-222dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.08.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02027naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245007600133300001400209500001900223520109700242592002801339650001501367650001601382650002801398653001401426653002201440653001301462653002101475700002501496773019501521852000901716655001201725IND60716727320221120224104.0201224e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071672732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Lakhwinder10aCapacity Building: A Pathway for Changing Behaviour of Self help Groups  ap. 36-42.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCapacity building is an action plan to give training to improve skills of the members of self help groups to upgrade them.

Two simulations of the weather research and forecasting regional model have been analysed, with two different land-surface models. One resolves the hydrology and is able to simulate summer dryness, while the other prescribes constant and high soil moisture and hence no soil moisture deficit. The sensitivity analysis conducted for all heatwave episodes highlights different soil moisture-temperature responses (1) over low-elevation plains, (2) over mountains and (3) over coastal regions. In the plains, soil moisture deficit induces less evapotranspiration and higher sensible heat flux. This has the effect of heating the planetary boundary layer and at the same time of creating a general condition of higher convective instability and a slight increase of shallow cloud cover. A positive feedback is created which increases the temperature anomaly during the heatwaves. In mountainous regions, enhanced heat fluxes over dry soil reinforce upslope winds producing strong vertical motion over the mountain slope, first triggered by thermal convection. This, jointly to the instability conditions, favors convection triggering and produces clouds and precipitation over the mountains, reducing the temperature anomaly. In coastal regions, dry soil enhances land/sea thermal contrast, strengthening sea-breeze circulation and moist cold marine air advection. This damps the magnitude of the heatwave temperature anomaly in coastal areas, expecially near the Mediterranean coast. Hence, along with heating in the plains, soil dryness can also have a significant cooling effect over mountains and coastal regions due to meso-scale circulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aclimate 3acloud cover 3acoasts 3acold 3acooling 3aevapotranspiration 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3amountains 3asoil water 3asoil water deficit 3asummer 3atemperature 3awind 3aFrance 3aWestern European region1 aDrobinski, Philippe1 aD’Andrea, Fabio1 aLebeaupin-Brossier, Cindy1 aBastin, Sophie0 tClimate dynamics.g2014 Mar., v. 42, no. 5-6 p.1309-1324dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-013-1794-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011600171300001600287520151600303592002801819650001801847650001401865650002401879650001101903650001101914650003001925650002201955650001701977650001301994650001202007700002402019773010602043856008602149852000902235655001202244IND60087753420221122032308.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008775342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBessaud, Maël10aDevelopment of a simple and rapid protocol for the production of customized intertypic recombinant polioviruses  ap. 104-108.  aThe three attenuated strains Sabin are used as oral vaccine to immunize against poliomyelitis in many countries. Low vaccine coverage can allow these strains to circulate among non-immunized people, accumulating genetic modifications through nucleotide substitutions and recombination with non-polio enteroviruses. These modifications can induce a loss of attenuation, so promoting the emergence of pathogenic vaccine-derived polioviruses responsible for poliomyelitis outbreaks. In vitro-engineered chimeric viruses containing both Sabin and non-polio sequences constitute a powerful tool for understanding the constraints that drive and limit the recombination events between the Sabin strains and other enteroviruses and to understand the consequences on the viral phenotypic properties of substitutions of large genomic regions due to recombination events. A method was optimized that allowed the rapid production of customized Sabin-derived viruses. By using sequences from Sabin 2 and 3 polioviruses and from non-polio field enteroviruses, several recombinant genomes were engineered by using fusion PCR. The corresponding viruses were recovered after cell transfection. This method was found able to generate rapidly a wide range of unnatural viruses with multiple breakpoints that can be chosen precisely. Furthermore, this method is also suitable to engineer nucleotide deletions, insertions and/or substitutions within a given genome, so increasing the number of unnatural viruses that can be studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterovirus C 3achimerism 3agenetic engineering 3agenome 3apeople 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence deletion 3atransfection 3avaccines 3aviruses1 aDelpeyroux, Francis0 tJournal of virological methods.g2012 Dec., v. 186, no. 1-2 p.104-108dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2012.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245007300165300001800238520135600256536008701612592002801699596005401727650001501781650001701796650003101813650001501844650001901859650001501878650001201893650002901905651001801934700001501952700002001967700001901987773013702006856008602143852000902229655001202238IND60677679520221123014412.0210101e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067767952DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2019.16970072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hua10aReal-time extraction of water surface boundary using shipborne radar  ap. 2739-2758.  aReal-time water boundary extraction with high accuracy is still a challenging problem in remote-sensing field. This article presents a shipborne water surface boundary extraction technique by integrating civilian marine radar and GPS compass. Meanwhile, a framework is developed to automatically extract water boundary from radar image. In this framework, direct transformation is adopted to rectify the geometric distortion of the radar image, morphological operation is used to fill holes and filter speckles in image, an edge tracing algorithm is design to extract image boundaries, visibility analysis and optimizations are conducted to recognize the real water surface boundary and to produce a vector map. A case study in Nanjing reach of Yangtze River are intended to validate performances of the method, and the final output of this method is verified using synchronous and detailed GPS-RTK (real-time kinematics) survey points. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed water boundary extraction method can reach a positioning accuracy within ±1 m, which is significantly better than that of satellite-based optical remote-sensing and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) techniques, and the algorithm is computationally efficient and has the capability of real-time, full-automatic water boundary generation for various applications.  aThis work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC1502600].  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFC1502600cNational Key R&D Program of China 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3aglobal positioning systems 3akinematics 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asurveys 3asynthetic aperture radar 3aYangtze River1 aYang, Biao1 aJiang, Jianping1 aZhou, Jianhong0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2020 Apr. 2, v. 41, no. 7 p.2739-2758dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2019.16970073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008800166300001600254520158600270592002801856650001901884650001501903650001501918650001001933650001201943650001801955650000901973650001001982650001701992650001402009650002502023650001402048650001402062650001602076651001802092700002002110700002402130700002502154700002002179700002202199700002202221773009602243856008102339852000902420655001202429IND60477651820221118064302.0160303e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047765182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-015-3436-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCass, Bodil N.10aConditional fitness benefits of the Rickettsia bacterial symbiont in an insect pest  ap. 169-179.  aInherited bacterial symbionts are common in arthropods and can have strong effects on the biology of their hosts. These effects are often mediated by host ecology. The Rickettsia symbiont can provide strong fitness benefits to its insect host, Bemisia tabaci, under laboratory and field conditions. However, the frequency of the symbiont is heterogeneous among field collection sites across the USA, suggesting that the benefits of the symbiont are contingent on additional factors. In two whitefly genetic lines collected from the same location, we tested the effect of Rickettsia on whitefly survival after heat shock, on whitefly competitiveness at different temperatures, and on whitefly competitiveness at different starting frequencies of Rickettsia. Rickettsia did not provide protection against heat shock nor affect the competitiveness of whiteflies at different temperatures or starting frequencies. However, there was a strong interaction between Rickettsia infection and whitefly genetic line. Performance measures indicated that Rickettsia was associated with significant female bias in both whitefly genetic lines, but in the second whitefly genetic line it conferred no significant fitness benefits nor conferred any competitive advantage to its host over uninfected whiteflies in population cages. These results help to explain other reports of variation in the phenotype of the symbiosis. Furthermore, they demonstrate the complex nature of these close symbiotic associations and the need to consider these interactions in the context of host population structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBemisia tabaci 3aRickettsia 3aarthropods 3acages 3afemales 3agenetic lines 3aheat 3ahosts 3ainsect pests 3aphenotype 3apopulation structure 3asymbionts 3asymbiosis 3atemperature 3aUnited States1 aHimler, Anna G.1 aBondy, Elizabeth C.1 aBergen, Jacquelyn E.1 aFung, Sierra K.1 aKelly, Suzanne E.1 aHunter, Martha S.0 tOecologia.g2016 Jan., v. 180, no. 1 p.169-179dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3436-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001500190245008700205500002200292520143800314592002801752653000901780653001501789653001401804653001701818653002101835653001601856700001501872700001601887700001701903700002901920700001401949700002101963700005801984773005802042856008302100852000902183655001202192IND60561523220221121033747.0170124s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056152322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.01.0152doi7 aPMC54744402pmcid7 a281172772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chao10aLoss of MyoD Promotes Fate Transdifferentiation of Myoblasts Into Brown Adipocytes  aPre-press version  aBrown adipose tissue (BAT) represents a promising agent to ameliorate obesity and other metabolic disorders. However, the abundance of BAT decreases with age and BAT paucity is a common feature of obese subjects. As brown adipocytes and myoblasts share a common Myf5 lineage origin, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the fate choices of brown adipocytes versus myoblasts may lead to novel approaches to expand BAT mass. Here we identify MyoD as a key negative regulator of brown adipocyte development. CRISPR/CAS9-mediated deletion of MyoD in C2C12 myoblasts facilitates their adipogenic transdifferentiation. MyoD knockout downregulates miR-133 and upregulates the miR-133 target Igf1r, leading to amplification of PI3K–Akt signaling. Accordingly, inhibition of PI3K or Akt abolishes the adipogenic gene expression of MyoD null myoblasts. Strikingly, loss of MyoD converts satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts to brown adipocytes through upregulation of Prdm16, a target of miR-133 and key determinant of brown adipocyte fate. Conversely, forced expression of MyoD in brown preadipocytes blocks brown adipogenesis and upregulates the expression of myogenic genes. Importantly, miR-133a knockout significantly blunts the inhibitory effect of MyoD on brown adipogenesis. Our results establish MyoD as a negative regulator of brown adipocyte development by upregulating miR-133 to suppress Akt signaling and Prdm16.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMyoD 0aMyogenesis 0aRepressor 0aAdipogenesis 0aBrown adipocytes 0aCRISPR-Cas91 aLiu, Weiyi1 aNie, Yaohui1 aQaher, Mulan1 aHorton, Hannah Elizabeth1 aYue, Feng1 aAsakura, Atsushi1 aKuang, Shihuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9180-31800 tEBioMedicine.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x2352-39647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100006200183245009300245506007600338520126100414592002801675506003701703650002401740650002401764650000901788650001701797650001101814650002201825650001501847650001301862650001101875650002701886651001701913651001801930651001101948651001801959651001001977651001201987651001201999651001802011700002802029700002202057700001702079700001802096700002402114700002102138700006302159700002302222773010202245856007602347852000902423655001202432IND60666703420221207062104.0190919e20190902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066670342DNAL7 a10.1155/2019/92826902doi7 aPMC67451422pmcid7 a315654262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKone, Abdoulaye K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4101-539110aVisceral Leishmaniasis in West Africa: Clinical Characteristics, Vectors, and Reservoirs  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVisceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most serious form of human leishmaniasis. VL is understudied in West Africa. The increasing number of patients at-risk, including persons living with HIV and other chronic immunosuppressive diseases, and likely underreporting of VL related to diagnostic challenges advocate for review of existing data to understand VL regional epidemiology. Our review aims to describe the clinical characteristics and epidemiology of Human VL (HVL) in West Africa. We conducted a literature search to identify peer-reviewed articles and grey literature sources using the search terms “Visceral leishmaniasis West Africa”, “Leishmania donovani West Africa”; and “Leishmania infantum West Africa”. Thirty published articles report HVL from seven countries, including The Gambia, Niger, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Togo, Burkina Faso, and Guinea Bissau. Three countries report cases of Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis (CVL), including The Gambia, Senegal, and Burkina Faso. Niger, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast report the greatest number of HVL cases. As VL is present in West Africa, active surveillance, increased diagnostic capacity, and studies of vectors and reservoirs are essential to better understand VL epidemiology in the region.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeishmania donovani 3aLeishmania infantum 3adogs 3aepidemiology 3ahumans 3aimmunosuppression 3amonitoring 3apatients 3apeople 3avisceral leishmaniasis 3aBurkina Faso 3aCote d'Ivoire 3aGambia 3aGuinea-Bissau 3aNiger 3aNigeria 3aSenegal 3aTogo (Africa)1 aNiaré, Doumbo Safiatou1 aPiarroux, Martine1 aIzri, Arezki1 aMarty, Pierre1 aLaurens, Matthew B.1 aPiarroux, Renaud1 aThera, Mahamadou A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2679-035X1 aDoumbo, Ogobara K.0 tJournal of parasitology research.g2019 Sept. 2, v. 2019dHindawiwJournal:21566x2090-00317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/92826903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245012300164506002800287520088100315592002801196506003701224650001901261650000901280650000901289650001101298650001701309653002001326653001601346653002201362653001001384653001601394700002001410700002801430700001801458773015701476856007901633852000901712655001201721IND60774940220221207140157.0160115e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077494022DNAL7 a10.19113/sdufbed.823012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSARIBAŞ, Rafet10aYağ Gülü (Rosa damascena Mill.)'nde Çırpma Budama Yüksekliğinin Gül Yağı Verim ve Kalitesi Üzerine Etkileri  aResource is Open Access  aPruning is one of the factors affecting the yield and quality in cultivation of perennial woody plant. Whipping pruning is used in the oil-bearing rose growing unlike traditional pruning methods applied to perennial woody plants. Growers, who cultivated oil-bearing rose in the Isparta region, were done between November and March to whipping pruning practices regardless of plant growing status and bud number on branch. In this study aimed to determine effects of different whipping pruning heights on the rose oil yield and quality in oil-bearing rose. It was planned as three replicate, five different pruning heights (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 cm) and control (no pruning) treatments. Pruning heights significantly effected on rose yield (decare), oil percentage, oil yield (decare) and pruning waste.

The data have a resolution of 50 m and 10 min with an overlapping height of about 150 m. The maximum range depends on the meteorologic situation. Up to 1000 m altitude the data availability is better than 71%. We found that the highest wind speeds occur in November and December, the lowest ones in June and July, up to 500 m altitude the wind is channelled strongly in ESE to NW direction parallel to the fjord axis and the synoptic conditions above 1000 m altitude already dominate. While the fraction of windy days (v>10ms) varies significantly from month to month, there is no overall trend of the wind visible in our data set. We define gusts and jets by the requirement of wind maxima v>2ms above and below a wind maximum. In total, more than 24,000 of these events were identified (corresponding to 6% of the time), of which 223 lasted for at least 100 min (“Long Jets”). All of these events are fairly equally distributed over the months relatively to the available data. Further, gusts and jets follow different distributions (in terms of altitude or depths) and occur more frequently for synoptic flow from roughly a southerly direction. Jets do not show a clear correlation between occurrence and synoptic flow. Gusts and jets are not related to cloud cover. We conclude that the atmosphere from 400 m to 1000 m above Ny-Ålesund is dominated by a turbulent wind shear zone, which connects the micrometeorology in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) with the synoptic flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acloud cover 3adata collection 3amicrometeorology 3atroposphere 3avillages 3awind speed 3aArctic region 3aNorway1 aRitter, Christoph 1 aSchulz, Alexander 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 05, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141537713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01370naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009200157300002000249520037400269592002800643650001300671650001700684650001500701650001300716650000700729700002200736700002100758700002100779700002400800773013600824856007500960852000901035655001201044IND60754440520221121055049.0211023e20211021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075444052DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc04525c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandal, Raki10aMembrane transport inspired hydrolysis of non-activated esters at near physiological pH  ap. 11088-11091.  aA positively charged micelle loaded with substrates was transported selectively to the reaction site (cathode) to promote the proximity and localization of the reactants (ester and hydroxide).

Nutrition represents a host of key modifiable factors that influence chronic inflammation. Dietary inflammatory scores were developed to assess the inflammatory potential of the diet and have been associated with inflammatory biomarkers in cross-sectional and short-term longitudinal studies. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the dietary inflammatory index (DII), the alternate dietary inflammatory index (ADII) and long-term C-reactive protein (CRP). We also tested age as an effect modifier of this relationship. Participants were selected in the Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants study, which included subjects aged 45–60 years old for men and 35–60 years old for women in 1994. Participants with ≥3 24-h dietary records at baseline and a CRP measurement at the 12-year follow-up evaluation were included in the present study (n 1980). The relationships between the DII and ADII and elevated CRP (>3 mg/l) were investigated using logistic multivariable regression. All analyses were stratified by age (cut-off at median age=50 years old). The overall associations between DII and ADII and long-term CRP were not statistically significant (P ₜᵣₑₙd across tertiles=0·16 for DII and 0·10 for ADII). A quantitative interaction was found between ADII score and age (P=0·16 for ADII, 0·36 for DII). In stratified analyses the ADII was significantly prospectively associated with CRP only in younger participants: OR tertile 3 v. tertile 1: 1·79 (95 % CI 1·04, 3·07). Pro-inflammatory diets may have long-term effect on CRP only in younger subjects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3abiomarkers 3achronic diseases 3adiet 3ainflammation 3along term effects 3alongitudinal studies 3amen 3aneoplasms 3awomen 0aDietary scores1 aAssmann, Karen E.1 aShivappa, Nitin1 aHebert, James R.1 aWirth, Michael D.1 aHercberg, Serge1 aTouvier, Mathilde1 aKesse-Guyot, Emmanuelle0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2017 Jan. 28, v. 117, no. 2 p.306-314dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145170000343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03946naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008800167300001600255506002800271520246200299592002802761506003702789650001002826650002102836650000902857650002302866650001802889650001802907650002202925650001302947650002702960650000902987650001902996650002103015651000903036653002203045653001703067653001803084700002403102700001603126700002903142700001803171700002903189773014003218856008503358852000903443655001203452IND60740065820221207133824.0210215e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074006582DNAL7 a10.22103/jab.2020.14869.11782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aazizi, zahra12aA review of the status of the native cattle and its conservation strategies in Iran  ap. 142-166.  aResource is Open Access  aObjective Animal genetic resources are playing a vital role in ensuring food security and maintaining genetic diversity. Iran has a variety of livestock genetic resources and So far there are about 8.44 million registered cows. The number of native cattle is 2044000 head, which accounts for about 27% of the animal population. These breeds are adapted to different climatic conditions of Iran and their genetic diversity is due to their domestication process over the centuries. Native breeds have unique features such as the disease resistance gene and the presence of the A2 variant in the milk of some native cows has been confirmed. According to reports, there has been a 27% decrease in the native breed from 2003 to 1977.Crossbreed populations have increased over the past few decades, and they have grown by about 22 percent. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to review the situation of native cattle and conservation strategies in the country. Preservation and conservation of native cow breeds In order to conserve of native breed, activities have done include the establish of native cattle stations, the implementation of composite breed projects to conserve blood percent of native cattle, native cattle genomic projects, cooperation with the private sector to purify native populations, the allocation of subsidies, save of genetic material at the Gene Banks of the Animal Breeding Center and the National Center for Genetic Resources and these actions have not been successful. Results The animal genetic conservation programs in developing countries are confounded by different challenges and the efforts of conservation of animal genetic resources are minimal. So the future strategy for native breeds should be a combination of breedimprovement and genetic conservation. Conclusions Developing a medium-term and long-term strategy for breeding, considering the potential of each breed in different regions separately, and policy-making and presenting strategic plans is a suitable solution. The following factors are needed to economizethe native livestock such as establishment of regional gene banks in accordance with the principles of conservation, cooperation animal husbandry, governmental and non-governmental organizations, appropriate coordination and cooperation between different organizations, research institutes, Academic and animal science associations and breeding companies are required.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood 3acomposite breeds 3acows 3adisease resistance 3adomestication 3afood security 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3agermplasm conservation 3amilk 3aprivate sector 3aresistance genes 3aIran 0agenetic diversity 0aconservation 0anative cattle1 aabbasi, mokhtar ali1 aKazemi, Ali1 aNazari, Behrouz Mohammad1 aTaheri, Amir,1 aBafarani, Alireza Hasani0 tBiyutiknuluzhī-i kishāvarzī.g2021 Jan., v. 12, no. 4 p.142-166dShahid Bahonar University of KermanwJournal:27822x2228-65007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22103/jab.2020.14869.11783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03989naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010900171300001800280520202400298536020602322592002802528596012202556596011602678650002902794650002002823650002502843650002102868650002102889650001102910650005002921650001502971650004302986650000903029650001903038650000903057650001903066650002503085650002503110650001303135650001503148650002103163700002103184700002203205700002403227773013703251856008603388852000903474655001203483IND60677679620221123014402.0210101e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067767962DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2019.16970082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMutti, Pedro R.10aNDVI time series stochastic models for the forecast of vegetation dynamics over desertification hotspots  ap. 2759-2788.  aLand degradation in semi-arid natural environments is usually associated with climate vulnerability and anthropic pressure, leading to devastating social, economic and environmental impacts. In this sense, remotely sensed vegetation parameters, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), are widely used in the monitoring and forecasting of vegetation patterns in regions at risk of desertification. Therefore, the objective of this study was to model NDVI time series at six desertification hotspots in the Brazilian semi-arid region and to verify the applicability of such models in forecasting vegetation dynamics. We used NDVI data obtained from the MOD13A2 product of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor, comprising 16-day composites time series of mean NDVI and NDVI variance for each hotspot during the 2000–2018 period. We also used rainfall measured by weather stations as an explanatory variable in some of the tested models. Firstly, we compared Holt-Winters with Box-Jenkins and Box-Jenkins-Tiao (BJT) models. In all hotspots the Box-Jenkins and BJT models performed slightly better than Holt-Winters models. Overall, model performance did not improve with the inclusion of rainfall as an exogenous explanatory variable. Mean NDVI series were modelled with a correlation of up to 0.94 and a minimum mean absolute percentage error of 5.1%. NDVI variance models performed slightly worse, with a correlation of up to 0.82 and a minimum mean absolute percentage error of 22.0%. After the selection of the best models, we combined mean NDVI and NDVI variance models in order to forecast mean-variance plots that represent vegetation state dynamics. The combined models performed better in representing dry and degraded vegetation states if compared to robust and heterogeneous vegetation during wet periods. The forecasts for one seasonal period ahead were satisfactory, indicating that such models could be used as tools for the monitoring of short-term vegetation states.  aThis work was supported by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico - CNPQ [309165/2010-5]; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - CAPES [1765923].  aPublisher supplied data  a309165/2010-5cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológicodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003593  a1765923cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superiordhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002322 3aanthropogenic activities 3adesertification 3aenvironmental impact 3aland degradation 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3arain 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3asemiarid zones 3astochastic processes 3atime series analysis 3avariance 3avegetation 3aweather stations1 aLúcio, Paulo S.1 aDubreuil, Vincent1 aBezerra, Bergson G.0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2020 Apr. 2, v. 41, no. 7 p.2759-2788dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2019.16970083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008600163300001600249520132400265592002801589650004401617650001701661650001201678650001301690650001601703650001901719650002301738650001501761650001701776650001001793650004301803650001201846650001301858650001301871650001201884650001401896650002001910650001601930650002101946700001501967700001901982700001902001773011502020856008202135852000902217655001202226IND60085253620221116142028.0141101e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008525362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2011.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Shun10aPyrolysis behavior of pectin under the conditions that simulate cigarette smoking  ap. 232-240.  aIn this paper, the formation mechanism of pyrolysis gases released during the pyrolysis of pectin under the conditions that simulate cigarette smouldering was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis coupled to Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (TG–FTIR). Moreover, the combustion behavior of pyrolysis gases was studied by micro-scale combustion calorimetry (MCC). TG–FTIR results illustrated that the composition of the gaseous products was mainly composed of CO₂, H₂O, CO, methanol, methane and carbonyl compounds. MCC results demonstrated that the combustion of pectin was mainly determined by the prolysis gases formed in the temperature range of 200–300°C. Flash pyrolysis experiment in combination with high performance liquid chromatography (FPy–HPLC) was used to study the pyrolytic formation of eight carbonyl compounds (i.e. formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, acrolein, propionaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, methyl ethyl ketone and butyraldehyde) during the pyrolysis of pectin under the pyrolysis conditions of cigarette puffing. Results demonstrated that pyrolysis temperature influenced the formation of acetaldehyde, acrolein, propionaldehyde and butyraldehyde greatly, while nitrogen flow affected the generation of formaldehyde, acetone, crotonaldehyde and methyl ethyl ketone deeply.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetone 3aacrolein 3acalorimetry 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonyl compounds 3acombustion 3aformaldehyde 3agases 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amethane 3amethanol 3anitrogen 3apectins 3apyrolysis 3asmoking (habit) 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry1 aXu, Yingbo1 aWang, Chenghui1 aTian, Zhenfeng0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2011 May, v. 91, no. 1 p.232-240dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2011.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01716naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002000136245010900156300001400265520084100279592002801120653002101148653002701169653002101196653002301217653001301240773010401253856007201357852000901429655001201438IND60125519420221121101609.0151104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012551942DNAL7 a10.2179/11-0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorgan, Eric C.10aStand Dynamics of a 46-Year Invasion by Phellodendron amurense Rupr. in an Eastern North American Forest  ap. 21-27.  aAn invasion by Phellodendron amurense Rupr. (Amur corktree) provided an opportunity to examine the subsequent changes in the forest composition that took place since the invasion began. Through the removal of 278 individual trees of P. amurense, tree ring analysis allowed a re-creation of the forest over the 46 yr since the species first arrived at the site. This analysis shows that P. amurense demonstrates the ability to invade additional areas and, over time, increases both its relative density and relative dominance. Through an analysis of both living and standing dead individual trees, P. amurense appears to be poised to continue its gradually increased influence over the forest. This highlights the need for better recognition of the species as an invasive plant, and a more vigorous effort to control existing invasions.  aPublisher supplied data 0aInvasive species 0aPhellodendron amurense 0arelative density 0arelative dominance 0aRutaceae0 tCastanea.g2012 Mar., v. 77, no. 1 p.21-27dSouthern Appalachian Botanical Societyx0008-74757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2179%2F11-0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003100144245012800175506002800303520121800331592002801549506003701577650001701614650001101631650000901642650002801651650001001679653006801689700001801757700002001775700001901795700001901814700002601833773015701859856007902016852000902095655001202104IND60774423620221207144407.0160115e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077442362DNAL7 a10.19113/sdufbed.337052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aASL, Hojjat GHAHRAMANZADEH10aTibia Kırıklarında Kullanılan Kilitli ve Kilitsiz Plak Fiksasyon Sistemlerinin Sonlu Elemanlar Yöntemiyle İncelenmesi  aResource is Open Access  aThe plate-screw fixation is widely used in the treatment of tibia diaphysis fractures. Also the structural differences such as design variables and the connection type, locked and unlocked fixation, in plate-screw system affect biomechanical behavior of bone-implant structure. In this study, the mechanical effects of locked and unlocked plate-screw fixation systems on bone-implant structures and their effects on healing period were investigated by finite element method. For this purpose, 3D (three dimensional) fractured tibia models were constituted by considering two fracture angle (60° ve 90°) and different callus structures and then, fixations were performed. The obtained models were analyzed under axial load via ANSYS 14.0. In consequence of the performed analyses, it was obtained that locked fixation system provided more stabilization than unlocked fixation system with respect to stresses and displacements on bone-implant structures. It was observed that stresses and displacements increased in the event of fracture angle 90° instead of 60°. Also, it was concluded that the most effective parameter on the bone-implant structure was found that the mechanical properties of callus structure  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomechanics 3acallus 3afens 3afinite element analysis 3atibia 0aLocked plate Unlocked plate Callus Stress Finite element method1 aKOVACI, Halim1 aAKSARAN, Akgün1 aKAYMAZ, İrfan1 aÇELİK, Ayhan1 aYILDIRIM, Ömer Selim0 tSüleyman Demirel üniversitesi fen bilimleri enstitüsü dergisi.g2015 Jan., v. 18, no. 3dSuleyman Demirel UniversitywJournal:27744x1308-65297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.19113/sdufbed.337053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03613naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245018600172300001400358506002800372520226200400592002802662506003702690650001502727650002502742650002802767650001902795650001602814650001102830650001102841653001602852653002002868653002802888653001502916653002002931653002402951700003102975773010303006856008503109852000903194655001203203IND60774940320221207140146.0170901e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077494032DNAL7 a10.22167/r.ipecege.2017.3.282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelloso, Gustavo,10aViabilidade econômica da implantação de um banco de capacitores em unidade armazenadora de grãos = Economic feasibility of the installation of capacitor banks in a grain storage  ap. 28-39.  aResource is Open Access  aAs unidades de armazenagem de grãos apresentam elevado consumo de energia elétrica e o aumento do seu preço tem aumentado o custo operacional delas.

One alternative is the correction of the power factor through the installation of capacitor banks. This work aimed to evaluate the economic feasibility of a capacitor installation in a grain storage located in Brasília, Distrito Federal. The cost of deploying the capacitor bank was compared to the values saved in the monthly payments with the reactive energy consumption. To purchase the capacitor bank, financing was simulated with an interest rate of 8.5% per year. The minimum attractive rate of return [MARR] was fixed on 4.46% per semester [p.s.]. Economic indicators estimated were Net Present Value [NPV], Internal Rate of Return [IRR] and simple Payback. The total project cost was R$ 26,772.03. The investment presented a NPV of R$ 7,228.63. IRR was 9.34% p.s., higher than the MARR (4.46% p.s.). Payback period was three years and four months.

Surendran10aElectron Spin Density Distribution in the Special Pair Triplet of Rhodobacter sphaeroides R26 Revealed by Magnetic Field Dependence of the Solid-State Photo-CIDNP Effect  ap. 5921-5930.  aPhoto-CIDNP (photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization) can be observed in frozen and quinone-blocked photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) as modification of magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR signal intensity under illumination. Studying the carotenoidless mutant strain R26 of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, we demonstrate by experiment and theory that contributions to the nuclear spin polarization from the three-spin mixing and differential decay mechanism can be separated from polarization generated by the radical pair mechanism, which is partially maintained due to differential relaxation (DR) in the singlet and triplet branch. At a magnetic field of 1.4 T, the latter contribution leads to dramatic signal enhancement of about 80 000 and dominates over the two other mechanisms. The DR mechanism encodes information on the spin density distribution in the donor triplet state. Relative peak intensities in the photo-CIDNP spectra provide a critical test for triplet spin densities computed for different model chemistries and conformations. The unpaired electrons are distributed almost evenly over the two moieties of the special pair of bacteriochlorophylls, with only slight excess in the L branch.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodobacter sphaeroides 3aelectrons 3alighting 3amagnetic fields 3amixing 3amodels 3amutants 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphotosynthetic reaction centers 3aspinning1 aBode, Bela E.1 aPrakash, Shipra1 aSai Sankar Gupta, Karthick

Cheap hydrated metal nitrates and urea were adopted as precursors to prepare Fe₂O₃/Al₂O₃ OC at the molar ratio to unity (Fe1Al1), which was characterized through various means, including Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffractor (XRD), and N₂ isothermal adsorption/desorption method. FTIR analysis on the chemical structure of the dried gel of Fe1Al1 indicated that urea was partly hydrolyzed and the hydrated basic carbonate was formed by the combination of groups such as (Fe(₁₋yAly)₁₋ₓO₁₋₃ₓ, CO₃ ²⁻ and –OH–. By analyzing the staged products during SGCS, calcination was found as a necessary step to produce Fe₂O₃/Al₂O₃ OC with separate phases of α-Fe₂O₃ and α-Al₂O₃. Through TGA–DTA, the decomposition of the dried gel was found to undergo five stages. The analysis of the evolved gases from the gel decomposition using FTIR partially confirmed the staged decomposition and assisted a better understanding of the mechanism of SGCS. XRD identification further substantiated the necessity of calcination to synthesize Fe₂O₃/Al₂O₃ OC with separate phases of α-Fe₂O₃ and α-Al₂O₃, though it was not necessary for the synthesis of single phase α-Fe₂O₃ and α-Al₂O₃. Structural characterization performed on N₂ adsorption analyzer displayed that the pore shape of Fe1Al1 particles was heterogeneous. Finally, H₂ temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of Fe1Al1 products in TGA indicated that the reduction reaction of Fe1Al1 OC after calcination was a single step reaction from α-Fe₂O₃ to Fe, and calcination benefited to improve the transfer rate of the lattice oxygen from the OC to fuel H₂. Furthermore, four times of reduction and oxidization (redox) reaction by alternating with H₂ and air demonstrated the synthesized OC had good reactivity and sintering-resistance, much suitable to be used in the realistic CLC. Overall, the SGCS method was found superior to other existent methods to prepare Fe₂O₃/Al₂O₃ OC for CLC application.  aPublisher supplied data 3athermogravimetry 3agels 3aX-radiation 3airon 3aair 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acombustion 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen 3achemical structure 3aadsorption 3aferric oxide 3aX-ray diffraction 3anitrogen 3aaluminum oxide 3achemical analysis 3adesorption 3aurea 3apyrolysis 3anitrates 0athermal analysis1 aYan, Rong1 aLee, Dong Ho1 aZheng, Ying1 aZhao, Haibo1 aZheng, Chuguang0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2011 May, v. 91, no. 1 p.105-113dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2011.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003100149245008400180506002800264520114700292592002801439506003701467650002301504650001301527650002401540650001001564650002401574650002001598650001101618650001501629650001001644650001401654650001301668650002501681650001901706650002101725651001301746653002101759653002401780653002001804653002501824653001301849700002901862700002601891773016101917856008402078852000902162655001202171IND60774423720221207143409.0190122e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077442372DNAL7 a10.21068/bc.v15iSupl. 2.3572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaravito, Mauricio Aguilar10aSeed dispersal by bats across four successional stages of a subandean landscape  aResource is Open Access  aThe mutual relationships between bats and vegetation, in addition to the individual benefits, are significant contributors to the tropical forest regeneration through seed dispersal. As the bats eat the fruits of pioneer plants they provide secondary succession dispersing the ingested seeds into the forest as well as in the degraded areas. This study compared the structure and composition of the fruit bats and the seeds dispersed in different successional habitats (mature forest, secondary growth with seven years of regeneration, secondary growth with one year of regeneration and pasture) in the Forest Reserve Bremen-La Popa (Filandia-Quindío, Colombia). Mist nets were used to capture the bats and samples of their feces were also obtained. Abundance, richness and equity of the fruit bats and the seeds dispersed were higher in those habitats with older regeneration. The bats Artibeus lituratus and Sturnira lilium were more abundant in the pasture and in the early successional stages of one and seven years. The seeds most dispersed by bats were Cecropia telealba, Solanum undullata, Solanum aphydendron and Solanum acerifolium.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArtibeus lituratus 3aCecropia 3aSolanum acerifolium 3afeces 3aforest regeneration 3aforest reserves 3afruits 3alandscapes 3amists 3aorganisms 3apastures 3asecondary succession 3aseed dispersal 3atropical forests 3aColombia 0aFrugivorous bats 0aForest regeneration 0aPioneer species 0aSecondary succession 0aColombia1 aRenjifo M., Luis Miguel,1 aPérez-Torres, Jairo,0 tBiota Colombiana.g2014 Dec., v. 15, no.

Volcanic ashfall layers (tephras) provide chronostratigraphic markers that can be used to estimate age offsets. We describe the first recorded occurrence of a visible tephra in a lacustrine sequence in the central Northwest Territories. The tephra, observed in Pocket Lake, near Yellowknife, is geochemically and stratigraphically attributed to the White River Ash east lobe (WRAe; 833–850 CE; 1117–1100cal BP), which originated from an eruption of Mount Churchill, Alaska. We also observed the WRAe as a cryptotephra in Bridge Lake, 130km to the NE, suggesting that records of this tephra are potentially widespread in CNT lakes. The identification of this tephra presents opportunities for use of the WRAe as a dating tool in the region and to quantify the magnitude of the FRE in order to correct radiocarbon age-depth models. Two well-dated sediment cores from Pocket Lake, containing a visible WRAe record, indicate a FRE of ~200years at the time of the ash deposition, which matches closely with the estimated FRE of ~245years at the lake sediment-water interface. Although additional results from other lakes in the region are required, this finding implies that FRE estimates for the late Holocene in the region, may be based either on down-core WRAe/radiocarbon age model offsets, or on radiocarbon dates obtained from the sediment-water interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreshwater 3alakes 3amodels 3aradiocarbon dating 3arivers 3atephra 3aAlaska 3aNorthwest Territories 0aTephra 0aCryptotephra 0aLakes 0aRadiocarbon dating 0aAge-depth models 0aNorthwest Territories1 aCrann, Carley A.1 aCutts, Jamie A.1 aCourtney Mustaphi, Colin J.1 aNasser, Nawaf A.1 aMacumber, Andrew L.1 aGalloway, Jennifer M.1 aSwindles, Graeme T.1 aFalck, Hendrik0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.03.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01744naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245008800172300001800260520050700278592002800785650001600813650002400829650002300853650002300876650002300899650002300922650002700945650001300972650002500985650001101010650001301021650001101034700002701045700001901072700002001091700002301111773010601134856008501240852000901325655001201334IND60578964120221119081545.0170815e20151002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057896412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b022402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsley, Nicholas

Use of a “benign-by-design” nonionic surfactant, TPGS-750-M, in water enables nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles to participate in SNAr reactions.

The effects of different nitrogen concentrations (N0, N1, N2, and N3 with 0, 2, 4, and 8 mmol l⁻¹, respectively) on main and lateral roots were evaluated. A moderate nitrogen concentration (N2, 4 mmol l⁻¹) promotes root growth. Lateral roots responded quickly to changes in nitrogen concentrations. Compared with N0 treatment, N2 treatment resulted in significantly greater main root volume after 12 days as well as increased lateral root length, root projected area, root surface area, and root volume after 8 days. Nitrogen significantly decreased abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), and isopentenyladenine (iP) content, which were the lowest in N2 treatment (33.92% lower than N0). The ABA and SA content were negatively correlated with root morphology. This shows that a moderate nitrogen concentration (4 mmol l⁻¹) significantly decreased ABA and SA content in the main and lateral roots and promoted root growth in cotton plants. These results will contribute to root growth theory regarding efficient nitrogen utilization by cotton plants and will provide a theoretical basis to ensure nitrogen resources are utilized efficiently.  aThis work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Public Welfare Research Institutes of the Institute of Cotton Research of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (161012018030), as well as by the National Key Research and Development Program (2018YFD0100406).  aPublisher supplied data  a161012018030  a2018YFD0100406 3aabscisic acid 3acotton 3ahydroponics 3aisopentenyladenine 3alateral roots 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aroot growth 3asalicylic acid 3asurface area 0aNitrogen concentration 0amain root 0alateral root 0ahormone content1 aLiu, Shaodong1 aZhang, Siping1 aGe, Changwei1 aShen, Qian1 aMa, Huijuan1 aZhang, Xiaomeng1 aDong, Helin1 aZhao, Xinhua1 aPang, Chaoyou0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 67, no. 12 p.1722-1738dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4585x1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2020.18075183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001800158245013600176300001900312520141300331592002801744650001301772650002501785650001801810650002001828650001001848650000901858650001101867650002801878650002001906650001801926650001501944650001001959650001601969653001101985653001401996653001302010653000902023700001702032700001802049700001502067700001602082700002002098700001502118700001802133773010002151856009302251852000902344655001202353IND60558424920221117195213.0190318e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055842492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Zhuoheng10aEffective production of recipient male pigs for spermatogonial stem cell transplantation by intratesticular injection with busulfan  ap. 365-373.e2.  aGerm cell transplantation has facilitated spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) and spermatogenesis research and shown great potential in the seed-breeding of domestic livestock. However, little progress has been made in large animals, primarily reflecting the difficulties in preparing sterile recipients. Here, we developed a novel protocol to prepare recipient pigs through the direct injection of busulfan into the cavum vaginale of the scrotums of Landrace-Large bi-crossbreeding male pigs and Seghers male pigs, two economically-important types of pigs, to eliminate endogenous spermatogonia. No severe diseases or weight loss was observed in either pig type after the injection with busulfan. Histologic analysis showed an advanced and dose-dependent germ cell loss, with complete germ cell loss observed in the highest dose group, 3.0 mg/kg in the Landrace-Large bi-crossbreeding pigs and 2.0 mg/kg in the Seghers pigs. A smaller seminiferous tubule diameter, a vacuolized seminiferous epithelium and the overproliferation interstitial cells, frequently observed in mouse germ cell deficiency models, were present in the most of the high-dose busulfan-treated groups. Molecular markers detected in Seghers pigs further confirmed the depletion of endogenous germ cells, providing an accessible niche for exogenous SSCs. This study provides a basis to prepare the transplantation recipients of SSCs in pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusulfan 3acell transplantation 3adose response 3agenetic markers 3amales 3amice 3amodels 3aseminiferous epithelium 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatogonia 3astem cells 3aswine 3aweight loss 0aTestis 0aGerm cell 0aBusulfan 0aPigs1 aBao, Jiajing1 aKong, Qunfang1 aBai, Yaofu1 aLuo, Fenhua1 aZhou, Songyang,1 aWu, Yingji1 aHuang, Junjiu0 tTheriogenology.g2017 Feb., v. 89 p.365-373.e2dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2016.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002100136245015900157300001600316520145800332592002801790650001901818650001101837650002101848650002101869650002401890650001201914650001301926650001901939650001401958650001801972650001301990650002102003650001402024650001302038650002002051650000902071650001202080651001702092653002002109653002702129653002102156653001802177700002202195773010602217856007202323852000902395655001202404IND60125519620221121101605.0151104e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012551962DNAL7 a10.2179/11-0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCessna, Jason F.10aInfluences of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid–Induced Stand-Level Mortality on Nitrogen Cycling and Stream Water Nitrogen Concentrations in Southern Pennsylvania  ap. 127-135.  aHemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae, is spreading throughout the northeastern United States, causing large-scale dieback of the eastern hemlock, Tsuga canadensis. This study examined soil nitrogen transformations and stream water nitrogen content at five hemlock-dominated stands in southern Pennsylvania, spanning a spectrum of hemlock mortality, from no mortality to total A. tsugae–induced mortality with subsequent regrowth. Organic content, extractable nitrate, and net nitrification and mineralization rates, as well as nitrate and ammonium movement through the soil were significantly higher at sites with high mortality. Our results suggest that stand-level hemlock mortality is leading to increased nitrogen inputs to stream water. Stream water nitrate concentrations were lowest at the site with little to no mortality (0.035 mg/L NO₃⁻) and highest at the site with intermediate mortality (0.69 mg/L NO₃⁻). In the sites with the longest time since infestation and highest mineralization and nitrification rates, regenerative seedling growth (Betula spp. in particular) is leading to increased uptake of nitrate, likely reducing nitrate leaching rates once substantial regeneration occurs. However, for a period of several years after infestation, hemlock dieback may be a significant source of nitrate in headwater streams, potentially altering headwater aquatic community composition and increasing downstream nutrient pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdelges tsugae 3aBetula 3aTsuga canadensis 3aammonium nitrate 3acommunity structure 3adieback 3aleaching 3amineralization 3amortality 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apollution 3aregrowth 3aseedling growth 3asoil 3astreams 3aPennsylvania 0aEastern hemlock 0ahemlock woolly adelgid 0anitrogen cycling 0astream water.1 aNielsen, Caroline0 tCastanea.g2012 , v. 77, no. 2 p.127-135dthe Southern Appalachian Botanical Societyx0008-74757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2179%2F11-0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010900157300002000266520099300286592002801279650001501307650001701322650002101339650001801360650001101378650001001389650001601399700001901415700001701434700001601451700001801467700001601485700001701501700001501518700001601533773012401549856007401673852000901747655001201756IND60640804020221118071545.0190505e20160705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064080402DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra08488e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yajie14aThe byproduct generation analysis of the NOₓ conversion process in dielectric barrier discharge plasma  ap. 63946-63953.  aAbatement of NOₓ through non-thermal plasma (NTP) processes has been developed over the past several years. Since discharge plasma contains a large amount of highly active species during the reaction process, NOₓ is removed during our desired conversion reaction, as well as production of other byproducts, such as O₃ and N₂O. The effect of reaction conditions, such as oxygen content, discharge power, operation time, initial NO concentration and gas residence time, on generation characteristics of O₃ and N₂O was investigated. Results showed that, with increasing oxygen concentration and discharge power, the production of N₂O and O₃ increases. Additionally, O₃ concentration decreases with increasing operation time; the higher input power, the higher the temperature increases, causing a greater reduction rate of O₃, which also leads to a reduction of NO₂ production. NO concentration and gas residence time also exert effects on the generation of byproducts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen dioxide 3anitrous oxide 3aoxygen 3aozone 3atemperature1 aTang, Xiaolong1 aYi, Honghong1 aYu, Qingjun1 aWang, Jiangen1 aGao, Fengyu1 aGao, Yueming1 aLi, Dianze1 aCao, Yumeng0 tRSC advances.g2016 July 05, v. 6, no. 68 p.63946-63953dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra08488e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04227naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245013300162300001400295520223100309592002802540650002102568650002702589650002702616650001502643650002602658650001902684650002002703650001802723650001002741650002602751650003102777650002902808650001302837650001302850650003002863650001802893650003702911650001302948650002302961650001302984650001402997650001703011650002103028650001803049650001703067650001703084651001003101653002403111653000903135653000903144653002803153653002903181653001703210700002003227700001803247700001303265700001703278700001803295773013203313856007803445961000903523852000903532655001203541IND60666703620221119025941.0200114e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066670362DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2019.26712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jingxian10aPrevalence and Characterization of Antimicrobial Resistance in Salmonella enterica Isolates from Retail Foods in Shanghai, China  ap. 35-43.  aThis study characterized the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance characteristics of foodborne Salmonella isolates from March 2016 to February 2017 in Shanghai, China. A total of 147 (14.2%) nonduplicate foodborne Salmonella isolates were obtained from 1035 food samples. The Salmonella isolates were most frequently identified in fresh meat samples (28.0%), followed by ready-to-eat foods (9.0%), frozen convenience foods (7.1%), and fresh produce (4.5%). The top 3 serovars were Salmonella Enteritidis (46.3%; 68/147), Salmonella Typhimurium (32.7%; 48/147), and Salmonella Derby (6.8%; 10/147). The majority of isolates were resistant to sulfisoxazole (93.9%; 138/147) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (61.2%; 90/147). Interestingly, frozen convenience food isolates exhibited an extremely high multidrug resistance rate (86.7%; resistant to ≥3 classes of antimicrobials). Among 81 quinolone-resistant isolates, aac(6′)-Ib-cr (100%), oqxAB (84.0%), qnrS1 (23.5%), D87Y (49.4%), and D87N (33.3%) mutations in GyrA, and T57S in ParC (12.3%) were observed. The β-lactamase genes blaTEM₋₁ (100%) were present in 63 ampicillin-resistant isolates. Polymerase chain reaction-based plasmid replicon typing revealed that 147 isolates represented 6 plasmid incompatibility groups (IncFIIs, IncHI2, IncI1, IncP, IncFIC, and IncA/C), among which, IncFIIs (59.2%) and IncHI2 (26.5%) were predominant. The genetic relationship of isolates was elucidated using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). MLST results indicated that ST34 and ST11 were predominate types in Salmonella Typhimurium (56.3%; 27/48) and Salmonella Enteritidis (95.6%; 65/68), respectively. Importantly, 96.3% (26/27) of ST34 Salmonella Typhimurium isolates possessed the ACSSuT resistance pattern (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline). PFGE analysis of ST34 isolates showed clonal dissemination across all four types of retail foods. Our findings highlight the high prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella isolates in retail foods in Shanghai, especially the clonal expansion of ST34 isolates with MDR-ACSSuT resistance, which might pose a public health threat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Derby 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3abeta-lactamase 3achloramphenicol 3afresh produce 3agenes 3agenetic relationships 3amultilocus sequence typing 3amultiple drug resistance 3amutation 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apublic health 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3araw meat 3aready-to-eat foods 3areplicon 3aserotypes 3astreptomycin 3asulfamethoxazole 3asulfisoxazole 3atetracycline 3atrimethoprim 3aChina 0aSalmonella enterica 0aMLST 0aPFGE 0aplasmid replicon typing 0aantimicrobial resistance 0aretail foods1 aZhang, Zengfeng1 aZhou, Xiujuan1 aCui, Yan1 aShi, Chunlei1 aShi, Xianming0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 17, no. 1 p.35-43dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2019.26713Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002800166245016800194300001600362520172200378592002802100650002702128650002002155650001802175650002802193650002002221650001602241650002002257650003002277650002502307650001202332650001802344650002202362650002402384650001002408653003102418653001602449700001802465700002202483700002402505700002002529700001802549773013602567856008102703852000902784655001202793IND60650350320221120214401.0190710e20170128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065035032DNAL7 a281668592pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145170000582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKesse-Guyot, Emmanuelle10aProspective association between consumption frequency of organic food and body weight change, risk of overweight or obesity: results from the NutriNet-Santé Study  ap. 325-334.  aA lower BMI has been reported among consumers of organic foods, but this relationship has never been examined in a prospective design study. Our aim was to prospectively investigate the association between frequency of organic food consumption and weight change. We analysed data from 62 224 participants of the NutriNet-Santé cohort (78 % women, mean age=45 years) with information on consumption frequency of organic foods, dietary intake and repeated anthropometric data. For sixteen products, participants reported their consumption frequency of labelled organic foods (never, occasionally, most of the time). An organic score (OS) with a maximum of thirty-two points was computed. The associations of the OS (modeled as quartiles (Q)) with change in BMI during follow-up (on average 3·1 years) and with the risk of overweight and obesity were estimated by ANCOVA and multivariable logistic regression. A lower BMI increase was observed across quartiles of the OS (mean difference Q4 v. Q1=−0·16 (95 % CI −0·32, −0·01). An increase in the OS was associated with a lower risk of overweight and obesity (among non-overweight and non-obese participants at inclusion): OR for Q4 v. Q1 were 0·77 (95 % CI 0·68, 0·86) and 0·69 (95 % CI 0·58, 0·82), respectively. Concerning obesity risk, the association was stronger among participants with higher adherence to nutritional guidelines. This study supports a strong protective role of consumption frequency of organic foods with regard to the risk of overweight and obesity that depends on overall dietary quality. Upon confirmation, these results may contribute to fine-tune nutritional guidelines by accounting for farming practices in food production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of covariance 3abody mass index 3adata analysis 3adietary recommendations 3afarming systems 3afood intake 3afood production 3anutrition risk assessment 3anutritional adequacy 3aobesity 3aorganic foods 3aprotective effect 3aregression analysis 3awomen 0aProspective cohort studies 0aWeight gain1 aBaudry, Julia1 aAssmann, Karen E.1 aGalan, P.q(Pilar),1 aHercberg, Serge1 aLairon, Denis0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2017 Jan. 28, v. 117, no. 2 p.325-334dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145170000583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02021naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013000172300001600302520075500318592002801073650002101101650001701122650002201139650001101161650001901172650003701191650005201228650003601280700002001316700002201336700002201358700002301380773012801403856008401531990002301615852000901638655001201647IND60090053520221120045121.0141110e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009005352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbamcr.2012.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaugé, Catherine10aRegulatory mechanism of transforming growth factor beta receptor type II degradation by interleukin-1 in primary chondrocytes  ap. 983-986.  aInterleukin-1β (IL-1β), a key-cytokine in osteoarthritis, impairs TGFβ signaling through TβRII down-regulation by increasing its degradation. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism that controls TßRII fate in IL-1ß treated cells. Chondrocytes were treated with IL-1ß in the presence of different inhibitors. TßRII and Cav-1 expression were assayed by Western blot and RT-PCR. We showed that IL-1ß-induced degradation of TßRII is dependent on proteasome and on its internalization in caveolae. In addition, IL-1ß enhances Cav-1 expression, a major constituent of lipid raft. In conclusion, we enlighten a new mechanism by which IL-1ß antagonizes TGFß pathway and propose a model of TßRII turnover regulation upon IL-1ß treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3achondrocytes 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amodels 3aosteoarthritis 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atransforming growth factor beta1 aGirard, Nicolas1 aLeclercq, Sylvain1 aGaléra, Philippe1 aBoumédiene, Karim0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

Here we report on an interesting event that occurred on 16 January between 12.00 and 00.00 UTC, when a striking aerosol stratification was observed on the site. Aerosol transport events are studied starting from lidar characterization of different aerosol masses. From lidar signals at 355 and 532 nm, integrated on 30 min, the aerosol characterization is done in terms of aerosol depolarization ratio with a spatial resolution of 60 m and color ratio; these parameters allow for highlighting a phenomenon of aerosol transport from the Tibetan plateau planetary boundary layer and from northern India. The initial layer is composed of a mixture of aerosols characterized by average values of the aerosol depolarization ratio and the color ratio of (30 ± 2)% and (0.9 ± 0.2), respectively, indicating a large non-spherical aerosol composition. Then, the deposition of this aerosol load ensues, and aerosols with such features are progressively observed at lower altitudes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair quality 3acase studies 3acolor 3alidar 3aresearch institutions 3atelemetry 3atroposphere 3aChina 3aIndia1 aAmoruso, Salvatore 1 aBoselli, Antonella 1 aWang, Xuan 1 aZhao, Yiming 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 05, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141537733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002000136245008700156300001600243520153900259592002801798650001001826650002001836650001701856650001201873650002901885650001901914650002001933650001401953650001401967650000901981650001601990650002102006650001302027650001202040650001202052651001902064653001802083653001702101653001902118653000702137653001702144700002002161773010602181856007202287852000902359655001202368IND60125519720221121101551.0151104e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012551972DNAL7 a10.2179/11-0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaggart, John B10aSoil Factors in Three Populations of Endangered Golden Sedge (Carex lutea LeBlond)  ap. 136-145.  aThree sites with populations of federally endangered golden sedge (Carex lutea LeBlond) were sampled to investigate whether circumneutral soil conditions were associated with a species distribution restricted to 208 km² within two adjacent counties of the lower North Carolina Coastal Plain. Populations were selected to include different soil series found in a state-owned natural area. Observed golden sedge rhizome and root depths among three specimens, one per site, ranged from 6 to 8 cm below the soil surface, which suggested primarily topsoil influence. A total of 96 soil samples, 48 topsoil and 48 subsoil, were collected in transects and analyzed. Mean pH values within populations were very strongly (4.7) to moderately (5.7) acid for topsoils and moderately (5.8) to slightly (6.5) acid for subsoils. These values did not differ significantly inside versus immediately outside each population, but varied among topsoils and subsoils between populations. Other soil variables associated with marl and limestone parent material influence (i.e., cation exchange capacity, base saturation, calcium, and magnesium) did not exhibit any consistent trends either inside versus outside, or between populations. A prior study found a mean soil pH of 6.7 within golden sedge populations, but choices of sample sites and analysis techniques were questionable. Lack of soil specificity for this species encourages both searches for golden sedge populations outside the known range and restoration or enhancement of local populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarex 3abase saturation 3abiogeography 3acalcium 3acation exchange capacity 3acoastal plains 3aedaphic factors 3alimestone 3amagnesium 3amarl 3amethodology 3apublic ownership 3arhizomes 3asoil pH 3atopsoil 3aNorth Carolina 0aCircumneutral 0agolden sedge 0anarrow endemic 0apH 0asoil factors1 aLong, Zachary T0 tCastanea.g2012 , v. 77, no. 2 p.136-145dthe Southern Appalachian Botanical Societyx0008-74757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2179%2F11-0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011800158300002000276520133000296592002801626650004401654650002201698650001401720650002301734650000901757650001101766650003701777650004101814650002201855650000901877650001901886650001201905650001801917650002001935650000701955650003301962650001701995700002102012700001802033700001902051700002402070700002202094773012402116856007402240852000902314655001202323IND60640804120221118071630.0190505e20160826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064080412DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra08491e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahmani, Amir10aProduction of martite nanoparticles with high energy planetary ball milling for heterogeneous Fenton-like process  ap. 81219-81230.  aNatural martite microparticles (NMMs) were prepared with a high energy planetary ball mill to form a nanocatalyst for a Fenton-like process. Martite nanoparticles (MNs) of different scales are formed when the milling time ranges from 1 to 5 h at the milling speed of 300 rpm. The catalytic performances of MNs are higher than the NMMs for the degradation of acid blue 5 (AB5) in a heterogeneous Fenton-like process. The NMMs and the MNs were characterized by SEM, EDX, BET, XRD and FT-IR analyses. The size distribution of the 5 h milled martite nanoparticles (MN₃) is in the range of 20 nm to 100 nm, and these have the highest surface area (19.23 m² g⁻¹). The influence of the main operational parameters, including initial pH, MN₃ dosage, H₂O₂ and initial dye concentration, were investigated on the AB5 degradation. The treatment process obeys pseudo first order kinetics and some of the degradation intermediates were recognized by the GC-MS method. The environmentally-friendly production of the MNs, low amount of leached iron and repeated catalyst usage are the significant advantages of this research. Finally, an artificial neural network (ANN) is expanded to estimate the degradation efficiency of AB5 on the basis of the experimental results, which indicates the appropriate performance (R² = 0.955).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adyes 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3amicroparticles 3amilling 3ananoparticles 3aneural networks 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area1 aKhataee, Alireza1 aKaymak, Baris1 aVahid, Behrouz1 aFathinia, Mehrangiz1 aDindarsafa, Mahsa0 tRSC advances.g2016 Aug. 26, v. 6, no. 84 p.81219-81230dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra08491e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245007600170300001600246520143800262592002801700650001801728650001801746650001101764650001701775650002501792650000901817650001301826650001601839650001101855650002201866650002101888650001201909651001101921653000801932653001801940653001701958653002801975653002502003700002602028700003002054700002602084700001902110700002202129700002302151700004402174773008802218856007702306852000902383655001202392IND60555511120221122024811.0171213e20160908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055551112DNAL7 a10.1139/gen-2015-01662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarreto, Silvia Britto10aIs Nematocharax (Actinopterygii, Characiformes) a monotypic fish genus?  ap. 851-865.  aThe combination of DNA barcodes and geometric morphometrics is useful to discriminate taxonomically controversial species, providing more precise estimates of biodiversity. Therefore, our goal was to assess the genetic and morphometric diversity in Nematocharax, a controversial monotypic and sexually dimorphic genus of Neotropical fish, based on sequencing of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and morphometric analyses in seven populations of N. venustus from coastal rivers in Brazil. The average pairwise intrapopulation divergence in COI ranged from 0 to 2.2%, while the average pairwise interpopulation divergence varied from 0 to 7.5%. The neighbour-joining (NJ) tree resulted in five genetic groups (bootstrap ≥ 97%), which correspond to the five clusters delimited by the BIN System, GMYC, and bPTP, indicating that there might be at least five species (or OTUs) within Nematocharax. Morphometric differences among these genetic lineages were also identified. Apparently, sexual selection, restricted dispersal, and geographic isolation might have acted synergistically to cause the evolutionary split of populations. These data challenge the current view that Nematocharax is a monotypic genus inasmuch as evolutionarily significant units or even distinguished species were identified. Therefore, we recommend that the highly impacted coastal basins in northeastern Brazil should be prioritized in conservation plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCharaciformes 3aDNA barcoding 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3afish 3ageometry 3amorphometry 3arivers 3asexual dimorphism 3asexual selection 3atropics 3aBrazil 0aCOI 0aDNA barcoding 0aichthyofauna 0ageometric morphometrics 0aspecies delimitation1 aNunes, Lorena Andrade1 ada Silva, André Teixeira1 aJucá-Chagas, Ricardo1 aDiniz, Debora,1 aSampaio, Iracilda1 aSchneider, Horacio1 aAffonso, Paulo Roberto Antunes de Mello0 tGenome.g2016 Sept. 8, v. 59, no. 10 p.851-865dNRC Research Pressx1480-33217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-2015-01663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245009100166520210100257592002802358650002302386650001202409650001702421650001702438650001202455650002302467650002002490650001802510650001002528650001302538650001202551650001002563650002102573650001102594650001302605650001602618650002602634650001402660650001102674650000902685650001502694650001002709650000902719700002002728700002302748773012102771856007302892961001202965852000902977655001202986IND60715266020221119082621.0201026e20201016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071526602DNAL7 a10.3390/f111010982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChamberlain, James  L.10aRediscovering the Contributions of Forests and Trees to Transition Global Food Systems  aThe importance of forests to safeguard agricultural production through regulating ecosystem services such as clean water, soil protection, and climate regulation is well documented, yet the contributions of forests and trees to provide food for the nutritional needs of the increasing human population has not been fully realized. Plants, fungi, and animals harvested from forests have long provided multiple benefits—for nutrition, health, income, and cultural purposes. Across the globe, the main element of “forest management” has been industrial wood production. Sourcing food from forests has been not even an afterthought but a subordinate activity that just happens and is largely invisible in official statistics. For many people, forests ensure a secure supply of essential foods and vital nutrients. For others, foraging forests for food offers cultural, recreational, and diversified culinary benefits. Increasingly, these products are perceived by consumers as being more “natural” and healthier than food from agricultural production. Forest-and wild-sourced products increasingly are being used as key ingredients in multiple billion dollar industries due to rising demand for “natural” food production. Consumer trends demonstrate growing interests in forest food gathering that involves biological processes and new forms of culturally embedded interactions with the natural world. Further, intensifying calls to “re-orient” agricultural production provides opportunities to expand the roles of forests in food production; to reset food systems by integrating forests and trees. We use examples of various plants, such as baobab, to explore ways forests and trees provide for food security and nutrition and illustrate elements of a framework to encourage integration of forests and trees. Forests and trees provide innovative opportunities and technological and logistical challenges to expand food systems and transition to a bioeconomy. This shift is essential to meet the expanding demand for secure and nutritious food, while conserving forest biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdansonia digitata 3aanimals 3abiodiversity 3abioeconomics 3aclimate 3aecosystem services 3afood production 3afood security 3afoods 3aforaging 3aforests 3afungi 3ahuman population 3aincome 3aindustry 3aingredients 3anutrient requirements 3anutrients 3apeople 3asoil 3astatistics 3atrees 3awood1 aDarr, Dietrich 1 aMeinhold, Kathrin 0 tForests.g2020 Oct. 16, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f111010983Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle04080naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014700170300001400317520202600331592002802357650001502385650002702400650002102427650001202448650001802460650002402478650001802502650002702520650000902547650001002556650000902566650001102575650001102586650002102597650001302618650001602631650001002647650001902657650003902676650002202715650001402737650002202751650001402773651001102787653001402798653001002812653001802822653002602840653002802866653001402894653002102908700002802929700002802957700004102985700002703026700003203053700002703085700007003112773010503182856008503287961001303372852000903385655001203394IND60561523520221121024510.0180905e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056152352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plgene.2017.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Viviane10aIdentification of double-stranded RNA viruses in Brazilian strains of Metarhizium anisopliae and their effects on fungal biology and virulence  ap. 49-58.  aBrazil is the leading country in the use of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae against agricultural pests. Very little information has been documented about the diversity and the impact of mycoviruses on M. anisopliae compared to M. robertsii and M. brunneum. This study reports the discovery of mycoviruses associated with native Brazilian Metarhizium spp. strains from the entomopathogen collection of the University of São Paulo, including strains used for mass-production of aerial conidia in sugar-alcohol factories to meet their own demand for controlling sugarcane spittlebugs and used in commercial mycoinsecticides. We also investigated the potential effects of viral infection on the biological traits of some of these strains. Viral-like double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was found in 61% of the 36 Metarhizium spp. strains analyzed and showed a large variation of different electrophoretic banding patterns consisting of 2 to 8 dsRNA bands in polyacrylamide gels (PAGE). No dsRNA was detected in any of the strains from commercial products used in this study. Efforts to “cure” strains with dsRNA revealed that the inhibitor of protein synthesis cycloheximide was not efficient in eradicating dsRNA viruses from Metarhizium spp. strains. Some dsRNA segments of M. anisopliae ESALQ 26 were lost following hyphal tip subculturing. The dsRNA-variants of M. anisopliae strains ESALQ 866, ESALQ 1256 and ESALQ 1595 were healed after either monoconidial or hyphal tip subculturing. Single spore cultures of M. anisopliae ESALQ 1256 exhibited significant differences in vegetative growth, conidia production, and virulence against Tenebrio molitor larvae, although these differences were not linked with dsRNA. Moreover, fungal variants free of or positive for dsRNA had similar heat and UV tolerance responses. Our results suggest that viral-like dsRNA are very common among Brazilian M. anisopliae strains, but there is sparse evidence that these mycoviruses are harmful to fungal biological traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCercopidae 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3aTenebrio molitor 3aconidia 3acycloheximide 3adouble-stranded RNA 3adsRNA viruses 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3agels 3agenes 3aheat 3ahyphae 3alarvae 3amycoinsecticides 3amycology 3amycoviruses 3apests 3apolyacrylamide 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein synthesis 3asugarcane 3avegetative growth 3avirulence 3aBrazil 0aMycovirus 0adsRNA 0aCycloheximide 0aHyphal tip subculture 0aMonoconidial subculture 0aVirulence 0aStress tolerance1 aMascarin, Gabriel Moura1 ada Silva Lopes, Mariana1 aAlves, Maria Clara Duarte Fregolente1 aRezende, Janayne Maria1 aGatti, Maria Silvia Viccari1 aDunlap, Christopher A.1 aDelalibera Júnior, Italo,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9770-92160 tPlant gene.g2017 Sept., v. 11 p.49-58dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:23305x2352-40737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plgene.2017.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014700173300001600320520127900336536004201615592002801657650001301685650003401698650001501732650001401747650002201761650001301783651001301796653002101809653003401830653001901864653001401883653003701897700002201934773012401956856008502080852000902165655001202174IND60752093620221122005845.0210929e20210903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075209362DNAL7 a10.1080/03949370.2020.18705682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBattisti, Corrado10aAlien-dominated plant communities’ syntopic with seabird’s nests: evidence and possible implication from a Mediterranean insular ecosystem  ap. 543-552.  aIn a small Mediterranean island (South Sardinia), we compared two non-native plant communities (respectively dominated by Malephora crocea and Mesembrianthemum cristallinum), located on an insular rocky cliff syntopic with a nesting gull’s colony, with a native one (with Limonium sardoum dominant) used as a “control” (without nesting colony). Uni-variate metrics of diversity, Whittaker plot and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMMS) with Morisita distance, evidenced a clear pattern with non-native communities less rich, less even and less diverse, when compared to native assemblage. Limonium native community is probably competitive toward the Malephora community in the absence of gulls but tends to be outcompeted by Malephora in the presence of these seabirds. In this regard, our data suggest a hypothesis that should be tested in future: i.e. those non-native Malephora- and Mesembrynathemum-dominated plant assemblages are favored in those sites where the dropping of gulls creates a nitrophytic environment. Differences in exposition could appear also important to explain the occurrence of the two non-native communities (with Mesembryanthemum crystallinum located along the sea-exposed cliff and Malephora in the internal side, toward the inland).  aThis work was not supported by funds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLimonium 3aMesembryanthemum crystallinum 3aecosystems 3aevolution 3aintroduced plants 3aseabirds 3aSardinia 0aMalephora crocea 0aMesembrianthemum crystallinum 0aWhittaker plot 0adiversity 0aLarus michahellis, nitrification1 aFanelli, Giuliano0 tEthology, ecology & evolution.g2021 Sept. 03, v. 33, no. 5 p.543-552dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12280x1828-71317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03949370.2020.18705683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245008000169300001600249520124800265592002801513650001801541650001801559650001701577650001301594650001901607650001401626650001001640650004201650650001401692650001801706650001301724653001301737653001401750653001101764653001801775653001501793700002201808773008701830856007701917852000901994655001202003IND60555511220221122034947.0171213e20160511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055551122DNAL7 a10.1139/gen-2015-01752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnkenbrand, Markus J.10abcgTree: automatized phylogenetic tree building from bacterial core genomes  ap. 783-791.  aThe need for multi-gene analyses in scientific fields such as phylogenetics and DNA barcoding has increased in recent years. In particular, these approaches are increasingly important for differentiating bacterial species, where reliance on the standard 16S rDNA marker can result in poor resolution. Additionally, the assembly of bacterial genomes has become a standard task due to advances in next-generation sequencing technologies. We created a bioinformatic pipeline, bcgTree, which uses assembled bacterial genomes either from databases or own sequencing results from the user to reconstruct their phylogenetic history. The pipeline automatically extracts 107 essential single-copy core genes, found in a majority of bacteria, using hidden Markov models and performs a partitioned maximum-likelihood analysis.

The proposed extended-time Local Identification of Voltage Emergency Situations (eLIVES) method is a significantly modified version of the previously presented LIVES method. The new method is not bound to assessing system response over a predefined LTC tapping period. This allows handling LTCs with variable delays, as well as events taking place during the tapping sequence impacting the distribution voltages. For that purpose, eLIVES applies recursive least square fitting to acquired distribution voltage measurements and a new set of rules to detect a voltage emergency situation. The effectiveness of the eLIVES method is presented on the IEEE Nordic test system for voltage stability and security assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPower system dynamics 0aVoltage stability 0aOn-line stability monitoring1 aPapangelis, Lampros1 aVournas, Costas D.1 aCutsem, Thierry Van,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4877-80360 tSustainable Energy, Grids and Networks.g2017 Mar., v. 9 p.95-103dElsevier Ltdx2352-46777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.segan.2017.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003400143245012400177300001600301520138200317592002801699650001801727650001501745650001501760650001101775650001201786650001601798650002201814650001301836651001801849653001701867653002001884653001001904653001401914700002401928700002101952773008601973856007702059852000902136655001202145IND60555511320221122024821.0171213e20160502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055551132DNAL7 a10.1139/gen-2016-00062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Vaquero, Rocío Ana10aDNA barcoding as a useful tool in the systematic study of wild bees of the tribe Augochlorini (Hymenoptera: Halictidae)  ap. 889-898.  aSpecial care is needed in the delimitation and identification of halictid bee species, which are renowned for being morphologically monotonous. Corynura Spinola and Halictillus Moure (Halictidae: Augochlorini) contain species that are key elements in southern South American ecosystems. These bees are very difficult to identify due to close morphological similarity among species and high sexual dimorphism. We analyzed 170 barcode-compliant COI sequences from 19 species. DNA barcodes were useful to confirm gender associations and to detect two new cryptic species. Interspecific distances were significantly higher than those reported for other bees. Maximum intraspecific divergence was less than 1% in 14 species. Barcode index numbers (BINs) were useful to identify putative species that need further study. More than one BIN was assigned to five species. The name Corynura patagonica (Cockerell) probably refers to two cryptic species. The results suggest that Corynura and Halictillus species can be identified using DNA barcodes. The sequences of the species included in this study can be used as a reference to assess the identification of unknown specimens. This study provides additional support for the use of DNA barcodes in bee taxonomy and the identification of specimens, which is particularly relevant in insects of ecological importance such as pollinators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aHalictidae 3aecosystems 3agender 3ainsects 3apollinators 3asexual dimorphism 3ataxonomy 3aSouth America 0aDNA barcodes 0acryptic species 0aChile 0aArgentina1 aRoig-Alsina, Arturo1 aPacker, Laurence0 tGenome.g2016 May 2, v. 59, no. 10 p.889-898dNRC Research Pressx1480-33217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-2016-00063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02147naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002700142245007800169506002800247520092800275592002801203506003701231650001101268650000801279650001401287650001101301650001401312650001101326650003001337651001401367653003801381653001401419653002401433700002801457700001301485700002201498700001301520773011801533856007701651852000901728655001201737IND60774940920221207140204.0171211e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077494092DNAL7 a10.14692/jfi.11.3.792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRustiani, Ummu Salamah10aDeteksi Bakteri Penyebab CVPD pada Jeruk Menggunakan DNA Asal Tulang Daun  aResource is Open Access  a<span lang="EN-GB">A method for identification of the causal bacteria of citrus vein phloem degeneration (CVPD) based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique using template DNA extracted from leaf midrib of citrus has been implemented routinely. The method has not been validated, therefore it is necessary to validate the method to confirm that the method fit for its intended use. Leaf samples showing chlorotic symptom was obtained from Bogor and Bekasi, West Java and used for test samples. These samples was differentiated into 2 groups, i.e. leaf midrib and leaf mesophyll. Validation test involved homogenicity, and reproducibility test; each test was replicated 2 times. The test showed that using leaf midrib gave better result for detection of bacteria causing CVPD disease than using leaf mesophyll. Therefore, this method is recommended as routine detection method for bacteria causing CVPD disease.</span>  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCitrus 3aDNA 3achlorosis 3aleaves 3amesophyll 3aphloem 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aIndonesia 0aCandidatus liberibacter asiaticus 0akarantina 0ametode deteksi CPVD1 aEndah, Ariningsih Salji1 aNurjanah1 aPrasetiawan, Andi1 aNurmaida0 tJurnal Fitopatologi.g2015 June, v. 11, no. 3dPerhimpunan Fitopatologi IndonesiawJournal:27732x2339-24797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.14692/jfi.11.3.793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001400180245010000194300001800294506007600312520108400388592002801472506003701500650000901537650002001546650001701566650001201583650001401595650001701609700001701626700001901643700002301662773013201685856007501817852000901892655001201901IND60538499420221207092558.0160815e20120404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053849942DNAL7 a10.1021/ja21199642doi7 aPMC43699132pmcid7 a224286672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jin10aNonfluorescent Quenchers To Correlate Single-Molecule Conformational and Compositional Dynamics  ap. 5734-5737.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSingle-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is a powerful method for studying the conformational dynamics of a biomolecule in real-time. However, studying how interacting ligands correlate with and regulate the conformational dynamics of the biomolecule is extremely challenging because of the availability of a limited number of fluorescent dyes with both high quantum yield and minimal spectral overlap. Here we report the use of a nonfluorescent quencher (Black Hole Quencher, BHQ) as an acceptor for smFRET. Using a Cy3/BHQ pair, we can accurately follow conformational changes of the ribosome during elongation in real time. We demonstrate the application of single-color FRET to correlate the conformational dynamics of the ribosome with the compositional dynamics of tRNA. We use the normal Cy5 FRET acceptor to observe arrival of a fluorescently labeled tRNA with a concomitant transition of the ribosome from the locked to the unlocked conformation. Our results illustrate the potential of nonfluorescent quenchers in single-molecule correlation studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adyes 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3aligands 3aribosomes 3atransfer RNA1 aTsai, Albert1 aPetrov, Alexey1 aPuglisi, Joseph D.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Apr. 04, v. 134, no. 13 p.5734-5737dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja21199643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01907naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245007000168506002800238520101500266592002801281506003701309650001401346650002401360650001101384650000901395700002101404773010001425856008301525852000901608655001201617IND60740064720221207131544.0120912e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074006472DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/201101000542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaniel, Gopher10aTransfer of Skill from a Virtual Reality Trainer to Real Juggling  aResource is Open Access  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate transfer of training from a virtual reality environment that captures visual and temporal-spatial aspects of juggling, but not the motor demands of juggling. Transfer of skill to real juggling was examined by comparing juggling performance of novices that either experienced both the virtual training protocol and real juggling practice, or only practiced real juggling. After ten days of training, participants who have alternated between real and virtual training demonstrated comparable performance to those who only practiced real juggling. Moreover, they adapted better to instructed changes in temporal-spatial constraints. These results imply that juggling relevant skill subcomponents can be trained in the virtual environment, and support the notion that cognitive aspects of a skill can be separately trained to enhance the acquisition of a complex perceptual-motor task. This study was performed within the SKILLS integrated project of the EC 6th framework.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acognition 3acomputer simulation 3amotors 3awebs1 aRotem, Lammfromm0 tBIO web of conferences.g2011 Dec., v. 1 p.00054-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/201101000543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245006000131300001600191506002800207520187500235592002802110506003702138650001502175650002502190650001402215650001402229653001402243653001202257653001602269700002302285773020402308852000902512655001202521IND60774422320221207143407.0201111e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077442232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartins, Paulo10aGastronomia hospitalar: treinamento em bases de cozinha  ap. 110-117.  aResource is Open Access  aO bom gerenciamento de uma Unidade de Alimentação e Nutrição (UAN) hospitalar reflete na saúde alimentar de pacientes, a qual implica no auxílio do tratamento e recuperação da saúde.

Pyrolysis is an overall endothermic process but preformed exothermically at its early stage. The overall energy consumption as well as the product quality and yield are affected by the heating rate and the operation temperature. In order to reach its full potential to produce bio-fuels, the energy consumption of the process has to be minimised. An idea to reduce the pyrolysis energy consumption is observed, which suggests trapping the exothermic heat released in the beginning of the pyrolysis process and using it to fulfil the energy requirement of the endothermic reactions at the end of the process. To achieve this, the pyrolysis has to be performed in multiple stages. The operation strategy of the multi-stage pyrolysis, including the number of stages, the operating conditions (e.g. process temperature, heating rate) and residence times of each stages, have to be carefully designed to obtain the most energy saving and the best product yield. The operating strategy of a pyrolysis process therefore greatly depends on the pyrolysis kinetics and the control of heat transfers. Waste tire pyrolysis is chosen as the study example in this paper. The corresponding reaction kinetics at different heating rates are investigated via experiments. Based on the experimental results, a mathematical model integrating kinetics and heat transfers is then developed. The objective of the model is to design a suitable operation strategy for the multi-stage pyrolysis process. A four-stage strategy is finally proposed for the tire pyrolysis, which has the sequence of heating, adiabatic, heating and adiabatic. The strategy is verified by the model, and it is capable to save about 22.5% energy consumption compared to the conventional strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aheat production 3aheat transfer 3amathematical models 3aorganic wastes 3aproduct quality 3apyrolysis 3areaction kinetics 3atemperature 3atires 3atrapping1 aLee, King-Lung1 aLam, Ka-Leung1 aChan, Tsz-Ying1 aLee, Chi-Wui1 aHui, Chi-Wai0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2011 May, v. 91, no. 1 p.165-182dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2011.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012600161520185200287592002802139650000802167650001302175650001102188650001302199650001602212650000902228700002402237700001802261700002202279700002502301773012902326856007502455852000902530655001202539IND60787884820221122003225.0220811e20220805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078788482DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141537642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeneruso, Paolo 10aSensing Requirements and Vision-Aided Navigation Algorithms for Vertical Landing in Good and Low Visibility UAM Scenarios  aTo support the rapid development of the Urban Air Mobility framework, safe navigation must be ensured to Vertical Take-Off and Landing aircraft, especially in the approach and landing phases. Visual sensors have the potential of providing accurate measurements with reduced budgets, although integrity issues, as well as performance degradation in low visibility and highly dynamic environments, may pose challenges. In this context, this paper focuses on autonomous navigation during vertical approach and landing procedures and provides three main contributions. First, visual sensing requirements relevant to Urban Air Mobility scenarios are defined considering realistic landing trajectories, landing pad dimensions, and wind effects. Second, a multi-sensor-based navigation architecture based on an Extended Kalman Filter is presented which integrates visual estimates with inertial and GNSS measurements and includes different operating modes and ad hoc integrity checks. The presented processing pipeline is built to provide the required navigation performance in different conditions including day/night flight, atmospheric disturbances, low visibility, and can support the autonomous initialization of a missed approach procedure. Third, performance assessment of the proposed architecture is conducted within a highly realistic simulation environment which reproduces real world scenarios and includes variable weather and illumination conditions. Results show that the proposed architecture is robust with respect to dynamic and environmental challenges, providing cm-level positioning uncertainty in the final landing phase. Furthermore, autonomous initialization of a Missed Approach Procedure is demonstrated in case of loss of visual contact with the landing pad and consequent increase of the self-estimated navigation uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaircraft 3aflight 3alighting 3auncertainty 3awind1 aOpromolla, Roberto 1 aTiana, Carlo 1 aGentile, Giacomo 1 aFasano, Giancarmine 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 05, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141537643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011300166520092200279592002801201650000801229650001501237650001401252650001101266650002001277650002501297650002201322651002001344651002001364653002001384653002401404653001501428653002101443700002201464700002801486700002401514773009401538856008201632852000901714655001201723IND60725329820221116174526.0210511e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072532982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1066742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDSouza, Stafny10aIllumina short-read sequencing data, de novo assembly and annotations of the Drosophila nasuta nasuta genome  aThe Drosophila nasuta nasuta (D. n. nasuta) is a member of nasuta subgroup of immigrans species group of Drosophila widely distributed across South-East Asia and central to Southern Africa. It displays morphological similarities with other members of the nasuta subgroup with which it has a recent divergence history. The genomic DNA of D. n. nasuta Coorg strain was paired-end sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500 technology to obtain a draft genome assembly of 145.64 Mb. The generated assembly retrieved 93.6% of the conserved dipteran BUSCO orthologs. Approximately 85% of the ab initio predicted proteins exhibit sequence similarity to the proteins of D. albomicans which is the closest annotated species. This draft genome sequence is a valuable resource to Drosophila geneticists and evolutionary biologists to understand molecular organisation of the genome and its evolution during early stages of speciation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDrosophila 3aevolution 3agenome 3agenome assembly 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence homology 3aSouth East Asia 3aSouthern Africa 0aNasuta subgroup 0aIllumina sequencing 0aAnnotation 0aGenome evolution1 aPonnanna, Koushik1 aChokkanna, Amruthavalli1 aRamachandra, Nallur0 tData in Brief.g2021 Feb., v. 34 p.106674-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.1066743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04083naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013900173300001800312520259500330536008102925592002803006596008803034650001203122650001503134650001803149650001503167650001303182650001503195650002403210650001903234650002303253650001803276650002503294650001503319651001903334700002503353700002003378700001903398773013703417856008603554852000903640655001203649IND60677678720221123014352.0210101e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067767872DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2019.16930762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsare, Yaw Mensah10aEvaluation of gap-filling methods for Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off image for LULC classification in a heterogeneous landscape of West Africa  ap. 2544-2564.  aThe Landsat mission which has existed over five decades has remained at the forefront of providing consistent moderate spatial and temporal resolution optical images of the earth. The failure of the scan line corrector (SLC) on board the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) in May 2003 has permanently resulted in data gaps on each Landsat 7 scene. Due to the obvious negative impacts on the image usability, a number of methods have been developed to fill the no-data areas in the image. This study assessed the performance of four Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off gap-filling methods in a highly heterogeneous landscape of West Africa for two different seasons (dry and rainy). The methods considered are: (1) Weighted Linear Regression (WLR) integrated with Laplacian Prior Regularization Method (LPRM), (2) Localised Linear Histogram Matching (LLHM), (3) Neighbourhood Similar Pixel Interpolator (NSPI) and (4) Geostatistical Neighbourhood Similar Pixel Interpolator (GNSPI). All the images used were Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off images, temporally close and from the same season for each set of time step. Visual comparison, mean, and standard deviations of the histograms of all bands of only the filled areas were used to assess the results. Additionally, overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficient (κ), and balanced accuracy (BA) per class were used to evaluate a land use/cover (LULC) classification based on the gap-filled images. Visually, all the four methods were able to completely fill the gaps in the Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off image. They all look similar and spatially continuous with no anomalies or artefacts on them. The histograms from each band for only the filled areas for all the four methods also gave similar means and standard deviations in most cases. All the four gap-filling methods provided satisfactory results (OA >96% and κ> 0.937 in all methods for images in the dry season and OA >93% and κ> 0.877 for the image in the rainy season) in the land cover classification considering the complexity of the study area. But the GNSPI was superiority in all cases with the highest OA of 97.1% and κ of 0.947 in the dry season and OA of 94.6% and κ of 0.899 in the rainy season. This implies that the GNSPI is more robust in gap filling of Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off images than the other three methods in a heterogeneous landscape of West Africa regardless of the season. This study suggests that gap filling of Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off images will help to increase the number of Landsat images needed to build time-series data for a data-scarce region such as West Africa.  aThis work was supported by the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung;  aPublisher supplied data  cBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschungdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002347 3aLandsat 3adry season 3ageostatistics 3aland cover 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3astandard deviation 3athematic maps 3atime series analysis 3awet season 3aWestern Africa1 aForkuo, Eric Kwabena1 aForkuor, Gerald1 aThiel, Michael0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2020 Apr. 2, v. 41, no. 7 p.2544-2564dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2019.16930763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010100172300001600273520135400289592002801643650001101671650001201682650001501694650001601709650001401725653002401739653001401763653001701777653002501794653003301819653002401852700001401876700001701890773009901907856008402006852000902090655001202099IND60606253820221120200921.0180725e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060625382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2016.02.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbrahamsson, P.J.10aOn continuum modelling of dense inelastic granular flows of relevance for high shear granulation  ap. 323-329.  aThis article investigates a number of possible formulations of a continuum description for modelling dense inelastic granular flows. The revised Enskog theory (RET) for expressing the granular temperature and formulation of transport coefficients has been used within the continuum framework. The framework assumes particles as inelastic spheres and can describe a granular system at a wide range of volume fractions. The transport coefficients depend on the volume fraction through a modified expression for the radial distribution function. The proposed radial distribution function is based on previous studies on the behaviour of the shear viscosity in which an earlier divergence of the latter compared to the other transport coefficients has been demonstrated for sheared dense granular systems. Our results show that the newly developed radial distribution function maintains the ability of RET to predict the occurrence of instabilities in a homogeneous cooling granular gas. The introduced function also improves predictions for the velocity and volume fraction profiles in a Couette cell dense shear flow. Thus the proposed expression shows promising features in terms of improving predictions for volume fractions relevant in high shear granulators. We have also observed that a different expression may be needed for the densest regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3apowders 3aprediction 3atemperature 3aviscosity 0aDense granular flow 0aInelastic 0aCouette cell 0aCooling granular gas 0aRadial distribution function 0aContinuum modelling1 aSasic, S.1 aRasmuson, A.0 tPowder technology.g2016 June, v. 294 p.323-329dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2016.02.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008400166300001600250520173800266592002802004650004402032650001602076650001302092650001202105650001902117650001402136650002402150650001702174650004102191650002902232650001802261650001102279650001102290650001402301650001602315650002102331700001702352700001602369700001902385773011502404856008202519852000902601655001202610IND60085252920221116141857.0141101e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008525292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2011.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shurong10aInfluence of the interaction of components on the pyrolysis behavior of biomass  ap. 183-189.  aThere has been much interest in the utilization of biomass-derived fuels as substitutes for fossil fuels in meeting renewable energy requirements to reduce CO₂ emissions. In this study, the pyrolysis characteristics of biomass have been investigated using both a thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (TG-FTIR) and an experimental pyrolyzer. Experiments have been conducted with the three major components of biomass, i.e. hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin, and with four mixed biomass samples comprising different proportions of these. Product distributions in terms of char, bio-oil, and permanent gas are given, and the compositions of the bio-oil and gaseous products have been analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and gas chromatography (GC). The TG results show that the thermal decomposition of levoglucosan is extended over a wider temperature range according to the interaction of hemicellulose or lignin upon the pyrolysis of cellulose; the formation of 2-furfural and acetic acid is enhanced by the presence of cellulose and lignin in the range 350–500°C; and the amount of phenol, 2,6-dimethoxy is enhanced by the integrated influence of cellulose and hemicellulose. The components do not act independently during pyrolysis; the experimental results have shown that the interaction of cellulose and hemicellulose strongly promotes the formation of 2, 5-diethoxytetrahydrofuran and inhibits the formation of altrose and levoglucosan, while the presence of cellulose enhances the formation of hemicellulose-derived acetic acid and 2-furfural. Pyrolysis characteristics of biomass cannot be predicted through its composition in the main components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetic acid 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acellulose 3aenergy requirements 3afossil fuels 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3aphenol 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry1 aGuo, Xiujuan1 aWang, Kaige1 aLuo, Zhongyang0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2011 May, v. 91, no. 1 p.183-189dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2011.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010600158520127100264592002801535650001501563650002601578650001101604700001501615700002201630700002001652700002101672700001901693773012901712856007501841852000901916655001201925IND60787884920221120041823.0220811e20220805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078788492DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141537652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuan, Daying 12aA Novel Double Ensemble Algorithm for the Classification of Multi-Class Imbalanced Hyperspectral Data  aThe class imbalance problem has been reported to exist in remote sensing and hinders the classification performance of many machine learning algorithms. Several technologies, such as data sampling methods, feature selection-based methods, and ensemble-based methods, have been proposed to solve the class imbalance problem. However, these methods suffer from the loss of useful information or from artificial noise, or result in overfitting. A novel double ensemble algorithm is proposed to deal with the multi-class imbalance problem of the hyperspectral image in this paper. This method first computes the feature importance values of the hyperspectral data via an ensemble model, then produces several balanced data sets based on oversampling and builds a number of classifiers. Finally, the classification results of these diversity classifiers are combined according to a specific ensemble rule. In the experiment, different data-handling methods and classification methods including random undersampling (RUS), random oversampling (ROS), Adaboost, Bagging, and random forest are compared with the proposed double random forest method. The experimental results on three imbalanced hyperspectral data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ahyperspectral imagery 3amodels1 aFeng, Wei 1 aDauphin, Gabriel 1 aWang, Xiaofeng 1 aHuang, Wenjiang 1 aXing, Mengdao 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 05, v. 14, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141537653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245011900188300001600307520141600323592002801739650001801767650001201785650001301797650002801810650001601838650001101854650002001865650000901885650002001894650001401914650003201928650001901960650001901979650001801998650001202016650001302028650000902041651001102050653002102061653001502082653001702097700003302114700003202147700003302179700002402212700002902236773013602265856008102401852000902482655001202491IND60650349720221121215312.0190710e20170128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065034972DNAL7 a281621082pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145160046572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadilha, Luana L.10aNutrient intake variability and the number of days needed to estimate usual intake in children aged 13–32 months  ap. 287-294.  aThe number of days of data required to accurately estimate usual nutrient intake of children is not well established. This study aims to calculate the variability and the number of days required to estimate usual nutrient intake in children aged 13–32 months. This cross-sectional study, which is part of the BRISA Project in São Luís, Maranhão, Brazil, involved 231 children from April 2011 to January 2013. Socio-economic and demographic data were collected using a questionnaire, and 3 non-consecutive days of food consumption were collected using a 24-h dietary recall (24HDR) survey. Intrapersonal and interpersonal variability and variance ratio (VR) were obtained for each nutrient using the Multiple Source Method® program (version 1.0.1). The number of days (d) needed was calculated using the formula proposed by Black et al. for different correlation coefficients (r) (i.e. 0·7, 0·8 or 0·9). For the vast majority of nutrients, intrapersonal and interpersonal variability values of <1 were observed, with even smaller intrapersonal variabilities, resulting in low VR (<1). More days were needed to estimate intakes of soluble fibre (12), insoluble fibre (11), total fibre (10), vitamin C (9) and PUFA (7), while fewer days were needed for energy, carbohydrate, SFA, Ca, Fe, P and Zn (all had 2 d for r 0·9). However, most nutrients required one, two or three 24HDR for r 0·7, 0·8 or 0·9.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3acalcium 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3adiet recall 3aenergy 3ainsoluble fiber 3airon 3anutrient intake 3anutrients 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aquestionnaires 3asocioeconomics 3asoluble fiber 3asurveys 3avariance 3azinc 3aBrazil 0aNutrient intakes 0aVariations 0aDiet records1 aFrança, Ana Karina T. d.

In this manuscript, we evaluate the use of the Eurostat Land Use and Coverage Area frame Survey (LUCAS) 2018 data to generate a detailed LULC map with 19 crop type classes and two broad categories for woodland and shrubland, and grassland. The field data were used in combination with Copernicus Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite data covering Europe. First, spatially and temporally consistent S2 image composites of (1) spectral reflectances, (2) a selection of spectral indices, and (3) several bio-geophysical indicators were created for the year 2018. From the large number of features, the most important were selected for classification using two machine-learning algorithms (support vector machine and random forest). Results indicated that the 19 crop type classes and the two broad categories could be classified with an overall accuracy (OA) of 77.6%, using independent data for validation. Our analysis of three methods to select optimum training data showed that by selecting the most spectrally different pixels for training data, the best OA could be achieved, and this already using only 11% of the total training data. Comparing our results to a similar study using Sentinel-1 (S1) data indicated that S2 can achieve slightly better results, although the spatial coverage was slightly reduced due to gaps in S2 data. Further analysis is ongoing to leverage synergies between optical and microwave data.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasslands 3aland use 3aland use and land cover maps 3aremote sensing 3ashrublands 3asupport vector machines 3asurveys 3awoodlands 3aEurope1 aDujakovic, Aleksandar 1 aŻółtak, Mateusz 1 aImmitzer, Markus 1 aAtzberger, Clement 1 aVuolo, Francesco 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 23, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140305413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245014100164300001800305520136200323592002801685650001501713650001801728650001501746650001101761650001301772650001301785650001401798650001301812650001501825650001301840650002501853650002001878653002901898653002901927653002501956653002201981653001902003700001602022700001702038700005802055700001202113773014402125856008602269852000902355655001202364IND60645139120221120223728.0190528e20190419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064513912DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b000672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Lin10aInherent N-Doped Honeycomb-like Carbon/Fe₃O₄ Composites with Versatility for Efficient Microwave Absorption and Wastewater Treatment  ap. 9237-9248.  aTo our knowledge, the utilization of chitosan-derived materials in microwave absorbing is currently scarce. Herein, for the first time, by fully exploiting its potential properties via facile means, chitosan was employed as the exclusive joint source of carbon and nitrogen, and the inherent N-doped honeycomb-like carbon/Fe₃O₄ composites with favorable versatility that can efficiently treat microwave interference and even wastewater pollution were controllably prepared. The optimal microwave absorbency is attractive, of which the minimum reflecting loss reaches to −59.5 dB, and the maximum effective absorbing bandwidth is 5.36 GHz when filler content is only 10%. Beyond the major trying, another function for wastewater treatment was also demonstrated by excellent toxic Cr(VI) adsorption and peroxymonosulfate activation for organic pollutants (azo-dye Orange II) degradation. More significantly, the embedding magnetic component makes it convenient to be magnetically separated from the testing solution. Totally, these N-doped honeycomb-like carbon/Fe₃O₄ composites with versatility prepared by simple methods not only open a new road for the diversified utilization of chitosan but also would possibly make a referrable guidance to the design or even synthesis for superior microwave absorption and environmental remediating materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacid orange 7 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3achitosan 3achromium 3amagnetism 3anitrogen 3apollutants 3atoxicity 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 0aHoneycomb-like structure 0aControllable fabrication 0aMicrowave absorption 0aCr(VI) adsorption 0aPMS activation1 aAn, Qing-Da1 aXiao, Zuo-Yi1 aZhai, Shang-Ru1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1441-69661 aCui, Li0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 Apr. 19, v. 7, no. 10 p.9237-9248dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b000673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245014200162300001800304520099300322592002801315596007201343650002201415650002001437650001701457650001601474650002601490650001501516650002701531650002301558650002901581650001001610700001601620700001701636700001301653700001501666700001401681700001701695700001201712700001801724773011501742856008201857852000901939655001201948IND60638205820221119090520.0190426e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063820582DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-019-01438-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Rui10aDetermination of Ellagic Acid in Wine by Solid-Phase Extraction–Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry  ap. 1103-1110.  aThe method for the determination of ellagic acid in wine by solid-phase extraction–ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-UPLC-MS/MS) using electrospray ion source (ESI) multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode detection was established. The sample was purified by Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction column and separated on an Acquity UPLC® BEH C18 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm 1.7 μm) with a mobile phase of 0.1% formic acid methanol–0.1% formic acid aqueous solution. Under the best detection conditions, ellagic acid within the range of 0.01~1 mg/L had a good linear relationship with a correlation coefficient of 0.9993. The detection limit (LOD) and quantitative limit (LOQ) were 3 and 10 μg/L, respectively. The recovery was 90.8~116% with the relative standard deviation (RSD) of 3.6~9.4%. The results indicate that the method is simple, fast, sensitive, and reproducible and can be used for the determination of ellagic acid in wine.  aPublisher supplied data  a31570374 and 31470542cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aaqueous solutions 3adetection limit 3aellagic acid 3aformic acid 3aliquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3asolid phase extraction 3astandard deviation 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awines1 aLi, Jiaxuan1 aYang, Zhiwei1 aGao, Fei1 aQi, Pengyu1 aLi, Xiang1 aZhu, Fengmei1 aLi, Jun1 aZhang, Jinjie0 tFood analytical methods.g2019 May, v. 12, no. 5 p.1103-1110dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4237774x1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-019-01438-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245011500160300001600275520114000291592002801431650002101459650002601480650001901506650002201525650001501547650001201562650002801574650001201602650001201614650002101626700001901647700001801666700001701684700001701701773012801718856008201846852000901928655001201937IND60089485020221119145056.0141102e20111118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008948502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.10.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xu10aBiochemical and structural analysis of Gox2181, a new member of the SDR superfamily from Gluconobacter oxydans  ap. 410-415.  aGluconobacter oxydans enable to oxidize sugars and polyols incompletely to corresponding materials with potential industrial applications, containing around 75 putative dehydrogenases. One of these putative dehydrogenases, Gox2181, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and its X-ray crystal structure was determined to a resolution of 1.8Å. Gox2181 formed a homo-tetramer in the crystal that was coincident with the apparent molecular mass determined in the solution. Gox2181 displayed α/β-folding patterns, the conserved catalytic tetrad of Asn119-Ser147-Tyr162-Lys166, and the NAD-binding pocket, which aligned well with the ‘classical’ type of short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) enzymes. Gox2181 was denoted SDR51C based on the SDR nomenclature system. The purified recombinant Gox2181 was demonstrated to be NAD(H)-dependent and active towards a wide range of substrates, including sugar alcohols, secondary alcohols, ketones, and ketoses. Among the substrates tested, Gox2181 displayed preference for secondary hydroxyl or carbonyl groups, showing low Kₘ values with d-arabitol and butanedione.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGluconobacter oxydans 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aX-ray diffraction 3aarabinitol 3aenzymes 3aindustrial applications 3aketones 3aketoses 3amolecular weight1 aYuan, Zuanning1 aAdam Yuan, Y.1 aLin, Jinping1 aWei, Dongzhi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 Nov. 18, v. 415, no. 2 p.410-415dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.10.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245015700163520111300320592002801433650002601461650003001487650001201517650001001529650002701539650003301566650001801599650001401617650001701631650001701648650001201665651001301677700002201690700002601712700002201738773012001760856007901880852000901959655001201968IND60768489520221121160416.0220225e20220212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076848952DNAL7 a10.3390/plants110405042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDy, Kim Sreang10aMorphological, Molecular Identification and Pathogenicity of Neoscytalidium dimidiatum Causing Stem Canker of Hylocereus polyrhizus in Southern Thailand  aRed-fleshed dragon fruit (Hylocereus polyrhizus) is commonly cultivated in Thailand, especially in southern Thailand, where the weather favors plant growth and development. In 2021, stem canker of H. polyrhizus was observed in a dragon fruit plantation field in Phatthalung Province, southern Thailand. Small, orange circular spots developed on the stem of H. polyrhizus, which later became gray, and the lesion expanded with a mass of conidia. Scytalidium-like fungus was isolated from infected tissues. Based on morphology and phylogenetic analyses of internal transcribed spacer (ITS), nuclear large subunit (LSU) and β-tubulin (tub) sequences of fungal isolates, the fungus was identified as Neoscytalidium dimidiatum. Pathogenicity tests revealed that this isolate caused stem canker on the stem of H. polyrhizus, similar to that observed in the field. Knowledge of the diagnosis of plant diseases is an important step for managing plant diseases and therefore, this finding provides basic information for the development of appropriate strategies to manage stem canker disease on H. polyrhizus plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHylocereus polyrhizus 3aNeoscytalidium dimidiatum 3aconidia 3afungi 3agrowth and development 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3aplant growth 3astem cankers 3aweather 3aThailand1 aWonglom, Prisana 1 aPornsuriya, Chaninun 1 aSunpapao, Anurag 0 tPlants.g2022 Feb. 12, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants110405043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03751naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245013300175300001600308520236000324592002802684650002102712650001302733650002702746650001502773650001402788650001602802650001602818650002102834650001402855650001502869650002202884650001102906650002202917650000902939650002202948650001502970650002302985650001203008650001503020650001503035650001303050700001903063773009203082856008603174852000903260655001203269IND60084223520221116172958.0141101e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008422352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2010.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoheide, Steven P.10aEffects of changing channel morphology on vegetation, groundwater, and soil moisture regimes in groundwater-dependent ecosystems  ap. 364-376.  aChannel incision, channel widening, and excessive floodplain sedimentation are major causes of riparian ecosystem degradation across the country. Although the causes and consequences of these processes vary significantly, the resulting morphology in all cases results in a lower stream stage relative to the floodplain surface for any given discharge. This change in channel morphology alters surface water–groundwater interactions between the stream and the riparian aquifer and affects the soil moisture and groundwater regimes differentially across the floodplain. The distribution of vegetation is altered as the hydrologic regime shifts between the hydrologic niches of potential species. We simulate the hydroecologic response of a groundwater-dependent ecosystem on the floodplain of an archetypical watershed under three scenarios representing changes in channel morphology: a base case, a widened channel case, and an incised channel case. Stochastically-driven synthetic rainfall records are used to drive a rainfall–runoff model of the archetype watershed. The resulting hydrograph is transformed to stage via Manning's equation for the three channel morphologies considered. This stage record is used as a boundary condition for a finite-element model simulating 2-dimensional, variably-saturated groundwater flow in the riparian aquifer. The model predicts soil moisture and groundwater regimes lateral to the channel. The 7-day moving average high water level is determined for ten growing seasons and used to predict the distribution of three species across the floodplain. Plant frequency is predicted for Carex emoryi (an obligate wetland species), Carex crawei (facultative wetland species), and Carex duriuscula (a facultative upland species) for each of the channel morphologies considered. The frequency is predicted using existing nonlinear parametric species response curves determined empirically for these species using direct gradient analysis. Results show the sensitivity of the distribution of vegetation on floodplains to channel morphologic changes. Our linked hydrologic and ecological model provides a solid framework for considering potential hydroecologic impacts of channel disturbance and/or restoration on vegetation communities which are often affected by channel degradation and targeted in restoration efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarex duriuscula 3aaquifers 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3aequations 3afloodplains 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahighlands 3ahydrograph 3ahydrologic models 3aniches 3aplant communities 3arain 3asimulation models 3asoil water 3asoil water regimes 3astreams 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3awetlands1 aBooth, Eric G.0 tGeomorphology.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 126, no. 3-4 p.364-376dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2010.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010400169300001400273520180500287592002802092650001702120650002402137650003002161650001102191650001502202650002202217650002602239650001602265653001802281653001402299653003502313653002602348653003602374700001702410700002002427700001402447700001502461773010402476856008702580852000902667655001202676IND60637954420221120094733.0190516e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063795442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2019.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Chixiao10aComparison of the performances between the WRF and WRF-LES models in radiation fog – A case study  ap. 76-86.  aIt is desirable to find a numerical forecast model that can better simulate and forecast the evolution of radiation fog. Here, observations made on 21 December 2015 at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST) are used to validate simulations from the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model and WRF nested Large-Eddy Simulation (WRF-LES) model. The WRF-LES model is significantly better than the WRF model at simulating various meteorological factors at the near-surface. Especially for the oscillation characteristics of meteorological factors, the WRF-LES model provides a more detailed and accurate description. The differences in the temporal evolution of visibility in the two models are evaluated during the radiation fog process. Compared with the WRF model, the fog onset time and the start of the strong phase predicted by the WRF-LES model are both more consistent with the actual situation. The temperature inversion (TI) layer from the WRF-LES model is lower than that of the WRF model, but its strength is closer to the observations. In addition, the WRF-LES model can better demonstrate the evolution of the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) over time in the life cycle of this radiation fog than the WRF model. Based on the simulation results of the TI structure and the PBLH, it is shown that improving the ability of the numerical model to predict the turbulent mixing intensity can improve its ability to predict radiation fog. Meteorological station data are combined with experimental data to evaluate the ability of the two models to simulate a horizontal fog area. Combining the four indices with the horizontal distribution of the simulated fog region, the WRF-LES model is shown to be more capable of predicting radiation fog than the WRF model.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ainformation science 3ameteorological parameters 3amixing 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3atemperature inversion 3atroposphere 0aRadiation fog 0aWRF model 0aWRF Nested LES (WRF-LES) model 0aTemperature inversion 0aPlanetary boundary layer height1 aBao, Yunxuan1 aYuan, Chengsong1 aLi, Zihua1 aZong, Chen0 tAtmospheric research.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 226 p.76-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2019.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002300176245010100199300001500300520146000315592002801775650001201803650001901815650002701834650001401861650001501875650002001890650001901910650001101929650001201940650006601952650001602018650001502034650001102049650001902060650002202079650001302101650001202114700001802126700002402144700002202168773015202190856006902342856010302411990002302514852000902537655001202546IND60644633720221118034904.0190517e20190403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064463372DNAL7 a10.3791/594902doi7 aPMC66385492pmcid7 a310090152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZink, Katherine E.10aCapturing small molecule communication between tissues and cells using imaging mass spectrometry  ap. e59490.  aImaging mass spectrometry (IMS) has routinely been applied to three types of samples: tissue sections, spheroids, and microbial colonies. These sample types have been analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to visualize the distribution of proteins, lipids, and metabolites across the biological sample of interest. We have developed a novel sample preparation method that combines the strengths of the three previous applications to address an underexplored approach for identifying chemical communication in cancer, by seeding mammalian cell cultures into agarose in coculture with healthy tissues followed by desiccation of the sample. Mammalian tissue and cells are cocultured in close proximity allowing chemical communication via diffusion between the tissue and cells. At specific time points, the agarose-based sample is dried in the same manner as microbial colonies prepared for IMS analysis. Our method was developed to model the communication between high grade serous ovarian cancer derived from the fallopian tube as it interacts with the ovary during metastasis. Optimization of the sample preparation resulted in the identification of norepinephrine as a key chemical component in the ovarian microenvironment. This newly developed method can be applied to other biological systems that require an understanding of chemical communication between adjacent cells or tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagarose 3aanimal ovaries 3achemical communication 3acoculture 3adesorption 3afallopian tubes 3aimage analysis 3alipids 3amammals 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametastasis 3amodels 3anorepinephrine 3aovarian neoplasms 3aproteins 3atissues1 aDean, Matthew1 aBurdette, Joanna E.1 aSanchez, Laura M.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2019 Apr. 03, , no. 146 p.e59490-e59490dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/594903Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/59490/capturing-small-molecule-communication-between-tissues-cells-using  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245008300174300001400257520104600271592002801317650002001345650001701365650001101382650002601393650001101419650001301430650001101443650002201454650002501476650001501501650001701516650001201533653001901545653002301564653002101587653001801608653002101626700001801647700001601665700002501681700002401706773008701730856008301817990002301900852000901923655001201932IND60697530620221121033409.0200605e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069753062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2017.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManaresi, Elisabetta12aA Parvovirus B19 synthetic genome: sequence features and functional competence  ap. 54-62.  aCentral to genetic studies for Parvovirus B19 (B19V) is the availability of genomic clones that may possess functional competence and ability to generate infectious virus. In our study, we established a new model genetic system for Parvovirus B19. A synthetic approach was followed, by design of a reference genome sequence, by generation of a corresponding artificial construct and its molecular cloning in a complete and functional form, and by setup of an efficient strategy to generate infectious virus, via transfection in UT7/EpoS1 cells and amplification in erythroid progenitor cells. The synthetic genome was able to generate virus with biological properties paralleling those of native virus, its infectious activity being dependent on the preservation of self-complementarity and sequence heterogeneity within the terminal regions. A virus of defined genome sequence, obtained from controlled cell culture conditions, can constitute a reference tool for investigation of the structural and functional characteristics of the virus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtoparvovirus 3acell culture 3aclones 3afunctional properties 3agenome 3agenomics 3amodels 3amolecular cloning 3anucleotide sequences 3astem cells 3atransfection 3aviruses 0aParvovirus B19 0aConsensus sequence 0aSynthetic genome 0aGenomic clone 0aInfectious clone1 aConti, Ilaria1 aBua, Gloria1 aBonvicini, Francesca1 aGallinella, Giorgio0 tVirology.g2017 Aug., v. 508 p.54-62dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.05.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245013300164300001800297520167900315592002801994650001702022650001302039650001202052650003602064650001702100650002002117650002102137650002102158650001202179650001902191650002202210700001802232700002302250700001902273773012102292856008202413852000902495655001202504IND60576408320221119002404.0170804e20170713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057640832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b017762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRani, Anjeeta10aCoherent Experimental and Simulation Approach To Explore the Underlying Mechanism of Denaturation of Stem Bromelain in Osmolytes  ap. 6456-6470.  aCharacterization of a protein in the context of its environment is of crucial importance for a complete understanding of its function. Although biophysical techniques provide powerful tools for studying the stability and activity of the enzyme in the presence of various cosolvents, an approach of combining both experimental techniques and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations may lead to the mechanistic insight into the interactions governing the stability of an enzyme. The knowledge of these interactions can be further utilized for range of modifications in the wild form of an enzyme for various pharmaceutical applications. Herein, we employed florescence, UV–visible, circular dichroism (CD), dynamic light scattering (DLS) study, and MD simulations for comprehensive understanding of stem bromelain (BM) in the presence of betaine, sarcosine, arginine, and proline. The thermal stability of BM in the presence of 1 M of osmolytes is found to be in order: proline > betaine > buffer > arginine > sarcosine. BM gets more preferentially hydrated in the presence of betaine and proline than in sarcosine and arginine. Nonetheless, MD simulations suggest that betaine, sarcosine, and arginine at 1 M interact with the active site of BM through H-bonding except proline which are responsible for more disruption of active site. The distances between the catalytic site residues are 1.6, 1.9, 4.3, 5.0, and 6.2 Å for BM in proline, buffer, betaine, arginine, and sarcosine at 1 M, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on detailed unequivocal evidence of denaturation and deactivation of BM in the presence of methylamines and amino acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aarginine 3abetaine 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adenaturation 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrogen bonding 3alight scattering 3aproline 3astem bromelain 3athermal stability1 aTaha, Mohamed1 aVenkatesu, Pannuru1 aLee, Ming- Jer0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 July 13, v. 121, no. 27 p.6456-6470dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.7b017763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010700170300001800277520146300295592002801758650001501786650001801801650002201819650002801841650001301869650000901882650002001891650002401911650002901935650002301964650001901987653003202006653002602038653001002064653002002074653001502094700001802109700005702127773010002184856008602284852000902370655001202379IND60610854820221121054032.0180830e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061085482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wenqing10aParallel finite element modelling of multi-physical processes in thermochemical energy storage devices  ap. 1954-1964.  aThermal energy storage technologies are of current interest in order to improve the integration of renewable energy sources as well as energy efficiency. Numerical simulations of thermochemical heat storage are especially challenging and time consuming due to the complexity of the mathematical description of the strongly coupled and highly nonlinear processes characteristics for such systems. These difficulties are exacerbated once practically relevant complex or large geometries are considered as they can occur around heat exchangers or due to internal heterogeneities of the reactive bed. To allow a computationally efficient simulation of such applications, an existing finite element implementation of a thermochemical heat storage model was parallelised using PETSc routines. Input/output, global assembly and the linear solver all work in a distributed fashion. The approach is implemented into the open source framework OpenGeoSys. The performance of the present parallelisation approach is tested by simulating the discharge of a heat store based on calcium oxide and water as a benchmark problem. The algorithm is tested on 2D as well as 3D meshes. The computational time required for the simulation could be reduced significantly. For example, a 3D model running almost 7days on a single core could be solved in less than 1h on 120 cores using the developed framework. The results strongly depend on linear solver and preconditioner settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acalcium oxide 3aenergy efficiency 3afinite element analysis 3ageometry 3aheat 3aheat exchangers 3amathematical models 3arenewable energy sources 3astorage technology 3athermal energy 0aThermochemical heat storage 0aFinite element method 0aPETSc 0aParallelisation 0aOpenGeoSys1 aKolditz, Olaf1 aNagel, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8459-46160 tApplied energy.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 185 p.1954-1964dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012500170300001600295520177300311592002802084650002802112650003102140650001002171650001802181650001102199650001302210653004402223653002802267653002502295653003402320700001802354773013402372856008602506852000902592655001202601IND60552887120221119065232.0161021e20151005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055288712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.04.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerman, David10aForces and force-scaling in systems of adsorbing nanoparticles as measured using colloidal probe atomic force microscopy  ap. 165-176.  aExperimental force measurements (using colloidal probe atomic force microscopy, CP-AFM) were performed to measure the interactions between silica surfaces in the presence of highly charged nanoparticles. Experiments were done using 5μm and 30μm silica spheres as the colloidal probes in solutions of either sulfate latex (negatively charged) or zirconia (positively charged) nanoparticles. The forces were measured as a function of separation distance between the probe and a flat silica slide. The resulting force profiles indicated that the charged nanoparticles adsorbed onto the silica surfaces, producing strong, repulsive electrostatic forces. However, an unexpected result of the CP-AFM measurements was that when the repulsion arose primarily from the adsorbed nanoparticles and not the underlying silica, the repulsive forces between the probe particle and plate lacked the expected dependence on the radius of the probe as predicted by the Derjaguin approximation. Specifically, while the magnitude of the force was expected to scale linearly with the radius of the probe particle, the forces observed in nanoparticle suspensions were virtually identical for the 5μm and 30μm probes. By comparison, when the primary contributor to the repulsive force was the underlying silica, the correct scaling with radius was observed. Based on calculations of the shear rate in the gap, it was theorized that this result may arise from the shearing of adsorbed particles from the surfaces. Because the shear rate in the gap near the point of closest approach is independent of the size of the probe particle, this phenomenon could lead to small, similarly-sized patches of nanoparticles on the probe particles that effectively determine the electrostatic repulsion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3aelectrostatic interactions 3alatex 3ananoparticles 3asilica 3asulfates 0aColloidal probe atomic force microscopy 0aDerjaguin approximation 0aInterparticle forces 0aColloid nanoparticle mixtures1 aWalz, John Y.0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2015 Oct. 05, v. 482 p.165-176dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.04.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008100170300001800251520180600269592002802075650002002103650001202123650001902135650001902154650001902173650002102192650002102213650001502234650001502249650002102264650001502285650001302300700002402313700002302337700002002360773009502380856008102475852000902556655001202565IND60120953720221118032312.0150213e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012095372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-013-1672-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEliseev, Alexey V.10aTransient hysteresis of near-surface permafrost response to external forcing  ap. 1203-1215.  aEstimates of changes in near-surface permafrost (NSP) area S ₚ relative to change in globally averaged surface air temperature T g are made by using the global climate model developed at the A.M. Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics RAS (IAP RAS CM). For ensemble of runs forced by scenarios constructed as return-to-preindustrial continuations of the RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways) scenarios family, a possibility of transient hysteresis in dependence of S ₚ versus T g is exhibited: in some temperature range which depends on imposed scenario of external forcing, NSP area is larger, at the same global mean surface air temperature, in a warming climate than in a cooling climate. This hysteresis is visible more clearly for scenarios with higher concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in comparison to those in which this concentration is lower. Hysteresis details are not sensitive to the type of the prescribed continuation path which is used to return the climate to the preindustrial state. The multiple-valued dependence of S ₚ on T g arises due to dependence of soil state in the regions of extra-tropical wetlands and near the contemporary NSP boundaries on sign of external climatic forcing. To study the dependence of permafrost hysteresis on amplitude and temporal scale of external forcing, additional model runs are performed. These runs are forced by idealised scenarios of atmospheric CO₂content varying, depending on run, with periods from 100 to 1,000 year and with different amplitudes. It is shown that the above-mentioned hysteresis is related to the impact of phase transitions of soil water on apparent inertia of the system as well as to the impact of soil state on atmospheric hydrological cycle and radiation transfer in the atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3aglobal cooling 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrologic cycle 3ahysteresis 3apermafrost 3aphase transition 3asoil water 3awetlands1 aDemchenko, Pavel F.1 aArzhanov, Maxim M.1 aMokhov, Igor I.0 tClimate dynamics.g2014 Mar., v. 42, no. 5-6 p.1203-1215dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-013-1672-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03619naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011300168300001600281520200700297592002802304650003402332650002602366650002402392650001202416650001302428650002402441650001502465650001502480650001902495650004102514650001002555650001302565650001302578650002102591650000902612650001202621650002002633650001902653650001402672650001302686650001002699650002202709650001402731650002302745650001802768700002302786700002702809700002302836773011502859856008202974852000903056655001203065IND60085253020221116141849.0141101e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008525302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2011.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtega, John V.10aPhysical and chemical characteristics of aging pyrolysis oils produced from hardwood and softwood feedstocks  ap. 190-198.  aPyrolysis oils were produced from hardwood or softwood feedstocks in a vacuum batch reactor and trapped at 0°C. The vacuum process was used to intentionally avoid the presence of entrained char particles. The hardwood feedstock was a pelletized mixture of various Eastern tree species. The softwood samples were de-barked Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) wood cut into the same dimensions as the pellets. The oils’ physical (viscosity) and chemical (speciation) properties were measured as-produced and after aging. The total liquid and char yields ranged from ∼50 to 55% and 25 to 27% respectively. Measured water contents were 30% or more, which are greater typically reported from fast pyrolysis oils produced in fluidized beds. Aging took place in covered glass containers at room temperature over a period of 5 months. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GCMS) was used to characterize the oils’ volatile components. Since bio-oils are mixtures of hundreds of different compounds with wide-ranging molecular weights and polarities, the oils were extracted using benzene followed by methanol. Out of ca. 80 non-polar and 100+ polar compounds GCMS showed a few chemical species present in the freshly produced oils were absent in the aged oils. The oils’ viscosities at shear rates (measured between 1 and 1000s⁻¹) increased by approximately a factor of 2.5 during aging. To determine if this was due to polymerization reactions during aging or simply water and other volatile material losses, freshly made oils were aged at an accelerated rate by using elevated temperatures (65°C and 85°C) in a water-saturated environment between 1 and 7 days. The oils are fairly stable with respect to aging both over long periods of time (months) at room temperature and at elevated temperatures, 65°C and 85°C for shorter time periods (days). It is concluded that high water content and char-free characteristics act to slow polymerization reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus contorta var. latifolia 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aambient temperature 3abenzene 3abiofuels 3achemical speciation 3acontainers 3afeedstocks 3afluidized beds 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglass 3ahardwood 3amethanol 3amolecular weight 3aoils 3apellets 3apolar compounds 3apolymerization 3apyrolysis 3asoftwood 3atrees 3avacuum processing 3aviscosity 3avolatile compounds 3awater content1 aRenehan, Andrew M.1 aLiberatore, Matthew W.1 aHerring, Andrew M.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2011 May, v. 91, no. 1 p.190-198dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2011.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007300167300001600240520150000256592002801756650001601784650002301800650001501823650003501838650002801873650002201901650000901923650001201932651001801944653002901962653001101991653002502002653002502027653003102052653002002083700001902103700006102122700001902183700001702202700005402219700001802273700001902291700001802310700001502328773010702343856008502450852000902535655001202544IND60536085620221118043345.0190215e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053608562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2014.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMei, Zhigang14aThe Yangtze finless porpoise: On an accelerating path to extinction?  ap. 117-123.  aFor the conservation of endangered animals to be effective, information on population distribution and abundance requires regular updating from census efforts. The Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis) has recently been reclassified as critically endangered (CR) due to a rapid decline in abundance. Baseline measures currently used for identifying extinction risk and implementing conservation actions may lag behind the actual demographic trend of a population and, thus, should be updated frequently. In this study, we report the results of a line transect survey of porpoises conducted in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in 2012. Five hundred and five porpoises (95% CI=348 to −662, CV=15.86%) remain in the main stem of the Yangtze River, mostly concentrated between Ezhou and Zhenjiang. Our results reveal that the decline in the Yangtze finless porpoise population is more rapid than previously estimated. The porpoise distribution has become more restricted and fragmented with two new gaps in their distribution. We show that the extinction risk for the Yangtze finless porpoise population has increased substantially and, hence, the expected time to extinction has moved closer. Current conservation methods are insufficient and ineffective, and need to be revised. More active conservation actions, such as enforcing year-long fishing bans in the in situ reserves and building more ex situ reserves, should be implemented urgently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeophocaena 3aendangered species 3aextinction 3anatural resources conservation 3apopulation distribution 3apopulation growth 3arisk 3asurveys 3aYangtze River 0aYangtze finless porpoise 0aCensus 0aLine transect survey 0aPopulation abundance 0aIntrinsic rate of increase 0aExtinction risk1 aZhang, Xinqiao1 aHuang, Shiang-Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6133-48511 aZhao, Xiujiang1 aHao, Yujiang1 aZhang, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9295-16841 aQian, Zhengyi1 aZheng, Jinsong1 aWang, Kexiong1 aWang, Ding0 tBiological conservation.g2014 Apr., v. 172 p.117-123dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2014.02.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245012000130300001300250500001900263520159300282592002801875650002701903650002601930650002301956650001001979650002701989650001002016650002202026650002002048650001502068650002802083651001002111653001302121653001602134653000802150653001102158653002602169700001602195700001902211700001602230773019402246852000902440655001202449IND60716726920221120224148.0201224e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071672692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Ghazala10aAdoption and Impact of Kisan Mobile Advisory -an ICT tool on Agriculture Progress in Malwa Region of Madhya Pradesh  ap. 7-12.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe advent of the twenty-first century has seen a number of technological developments which affect almost every aspect of our lives. At the core of this is the ever-growing use of ICT in all realms of life, from the work place to the sports field, in schools and on a personal or social level. ICT is defined as a global network in which ideas are exchanged, or information and knowledge is shared, through using communication like cell phones, and technology like computers, to connect people. In the recent past Mobile Technology has emerged as a best telecommunication technology resulting in the overwhelming increase in the number of mobile user day by day. There are 900 million users of mobile phone in India at present. This cost effective means of communication is being utilized by a top level business tycoon to a low level labour. Agricultural Scientist aims to improve and strengthen existing agriculture extension services by integrating Information Technology with mobile services. Sharing of knowledge among experts, farmers, students and research scholars are very important to the growth of the agriculture sector. The study has revealed that though, farm advisories through mobile phones may not be the only agent for improving farm production, productivity and rural economy, yet the quality of information, timeliness of information and trustworthiness of information help the farmers to a considerable extent in their day to day job for which they were found struggling with the non-experts or the inputs dealers and most of the times ended up in disaster and loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural extension 3aagricultural industry 3acost effectiveness 3afarms 3ainformation technology 3alabor 3amobile telephones 3arural economics 3ascientists 3asustainable development 3aIndia 0aAdoption 0aAgriculture 0aICT 0aImpact 0aKisan Mobile Advisory1 aDixit, A.K.1 aSaxena, Arvind1 aTomar, D.S.0 tJournal of Community Mobilization and Sustainable Development.g2018 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.7-12dSociety for Community Mobilization for Sustainable DevelopmentwJournal:2289x2231-67367nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245007800214506007600292520131700368592002801685506003701713650001801750650001301768650003101781650002901812650001501841650002001856650001201876650002301888650002601911650001301937650001401950650001101964650002501975650001302000650006602013650000902079650001402088650003002102650001502132650003602147650001302183650002102196651001002217651001102227700002302238700002602261700002302287700002502310700002802335700002002363773012702383856008502510852000902595655001202604IND60660506520221207102710.0190823e20190812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066050652DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms70802542doi7 aPMC67239342pmcid7 a314089762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPino, Alessandra 10aPiacentinu Ennese PDO Cheese as Reservoir of Promising Probiotic Bacteria  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPiacentinu Ennese is a protected designation of origin (PDO) cheese produced in the surrounding area of Enna (Sicily, Italy), using raw ewe&rsquo;s milk without the addition of any starter cultures. In the present study, the Lactobacillus population of Piacentinu Ennese PDO cheese was in vitro screened in order to select promising probiotic strains to be further used in humans. One hundred and sixty-nine lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from 90 days ripened cheeses and identified by Rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting, using the (GTG)<inf>5</inf>-primer, and by MALDI-TOF MS. One hundred and thirteen (113) isolates belonging to QPS-list species were characterized for both safety and functional properties. All tested isolates were considered safe because none showed either gelatinase, DNase, mucinase, or hemolytic activity. Tolerance to lysozyme, bile salts, and acidic conditions, along with ability to survive under simulated gastrointestinal digestion, were observed. In addition, based on antimicrobial activity against pathogens, cell surface characteristics, Caco-2 adhesion abilities, and anti-inflammatory potential, it was possible to confirm the strain-dependent functional aptitude, suggesting that Piacentinu Ennese PDO cheese may be considered a precious source of probiotic candidates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLactobacillus 3aadhesion 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantimicrobial properties 3abile salts 3acheese ripening 3acheeses 3adeoxyribonucleases 3afunctional properties 3agenomics 3ahemolysis 3ahumans 3alactic acid bacteria 3alysozyme 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amilk 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprobiotics 3aprotected designation of origin 3araw milk 3astarter cultures 3aItaly 3aSicily1 aRusso, Nunziatina 1 aVan Hoorde, Koenraad 1 aDe Angelis, Maria 1 aSferrazzo, Giuseppe 1 aRandazzo, Cinzia Lucia,1 aCaggia, Cinzia 0 tMicroorganisms.g2019 Aug. 12, v. 7, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms70802543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01890naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245011300152300002000265520084500285592002801130650002401158650002301182650001701205650001401222650001401236650001401250650001901264700001801283700001501301700001601316773013601332856007501468852000901543655001201552IND60754440020221121055054.0211023e20211021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075444002DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc04220c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Lei10aEnhancing Li-ion conduction in composite polymer electrolytes using Li₀.₃₃La₀.₅₆TiO₃ nanotubes  ap. 11068-11071.  aHere, a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) with a unique Li₀.₃₃La₀.₅₆TiO₃ (LLTO) nanotube filler, which shows a high Li-ion conductivity, is reported. Compared with LLTO nanoparticles (NPs) and nanowires (NWs), the LLTO nanotube fillers increase the interfacial area between PVDF and the LLTO filler, leading to the simple transportation of Li-ions through these interfacial pathways. In addition, the Li plating and stripping cycling performance of the CPEs is improved to 205 h at 0.1 mA cm⁻², and the performance of the Li|CPEs|LiFePO₄ cells also achieves a discharge capacity of 120 mA h g⁻¹ after 100 cycles at 0.5C at room temperature.

Distinguishing between these two causes of length change is important for identifying the true climatic cause of past glacier fluctuations. A key step in addressing this is to determine the relative importance of year-to-year variability in climate relative to more persistent climate fluctuations. We address this question for European climate using several long-term observational records: a century-long, Europe-wide atmospheric gridded dataset; longer-term instrumental measurements of summertime temperature where available (up to 250 years); and seasonal and annual records of glacier mass balance (between 30 and 50 years). After linear detrending of the datasets, we find that throughout Europe persistence in both melt-season temperature and annual accumulation is generally indistinguishable from zero. The main exception is in Southern Europe where a degree of interannual persistence can be identified in summertime temperatures. On the basis of this analysis, we conclude that year-to-year variability dominates the natural climate forcing of glacier fluctuations on timescales up to a few centuries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aglaciers 3asummer 3atemperature 3aEurope 3aSouthern European region1 aRoe, Gerard H.0 tClimate dynamics.g2014 Mar., v. 42, no. 5-6 p.1335-1346dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-013-1758-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01836naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245004700167300001600214520083700230592002801067650001901095650001001114650003901124650001401163650002401177650002701201700001801228700001901246773012901265856008401394990002301478852000901501655001201510IND60090052720221120225426.0141110e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009005272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbamcr.2012.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Imran10aMechanisms of FGFR-mediated carcinogenesis  ap. 850-860.  aIn this review, the evidence for a role of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) mediated signalling in carcinogenesis are considered and relevant underlying mechanisms highlighted.

Here we review the accumulating reports that revealed the association of FGF/FGFRs to various types of cancer at a genetic level, along with in vitro and in vivo evidences available so far, which indicates the functional involvement of FGF signalling in tumour formation and progression. An increasing number of drugs against the FGF pathways is currently in clinical testing.

The unit is composed of four interdigitated facies, three of them of a coarse-grained siliciclastic character (Sf1, Sf2, Sf3), and the fourth one composed of bioclastic packstones with argillaceous matrix (calcareous facies, Cf). The siliciclastic facies make up the bulk of the La Pardina Formation in the Ordesa-Monte Perdido National Park, while the Cf is subordinate in the Park but widespread throughout the southern Pyrenees. Biostratigraphic and isotopic data suggest that the Cf pertains to the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). No isotopic or biostratigraphic information could be obtained from the siliciclastic facies, but they are also assigned to the PETM because of their interfingering with the Cf. The siliciclastic facies were accumulated in a braid delta system fed by either a major river or by several minor rivers draining the Ebro Massif. The Sf3, Sf2 and Sf1 respectively represent the top-set, foreset and bottomset parts of the braid delta, whereas the Cf correspond to the prodelta. In proximal parts of the braid delta the Sf3 overlies a subaerial surface carved into upper Thanetian marine carbonates, a proof of a pre-PETM sea-level fall. In the remainder of the braid delta, the La Pardina Formation exhibits an overall thickening-coarsening-up trend that attests to rapid progradation. The development of the braid delta implies a dramatic increase in the influx of both coarse- and fine-grained siliciclastics, which temporarily halted a long-lasting period of carbonate-dominated sedimentation. This abrupt change demonstrates that the environmental impact caused by the intensification of the hydrological cycle during the PETM was particularly severe at middle latitudes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonates 3aenvironmental impact 3ahydrologic cycle 3alatitude 3anational parks 3arivers 3asea level 3aSpain 0aEarly Paleogene 0aPETM 0aHydrological cycle 0aSiliciclastic braid delta 0aCarbonate platform 0aSpanish Pyrenees1 aRobador, Alejandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4570-98411 aPayros, Aitor1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9549-41191 aSamsó, Josep María0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 459 p.453-470dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2016.07.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100004200156245012300198300001600321506002800337520148900365592002801854506003701882650001101919650001001930650001001940650001101950650001301961650001101974650001101985650002101996650001502017650001202032653001502044653001902059653001702078653002002095653001002115700003702125700003302162700002102195700001902216773011502235856009102350852000902441655001202450IND60774939220221207080513.0191128e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077493922DNAL7 a10.15294/biosaintifika.v10i3.149272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPutera, Alexander Kurniawan Sariyanto10aDiversity, Composition, and Abundance Distribution of Birds in Kariangau Industrial Zone, Balikpapan City, East Borneo  ap. 605-612.  aResource is Open Access  aThe Kariangau Industrial Zone extends industry from Balikpapan city in the Central Balikpapan to the coast in Western Balikpapan, forming a part of Balikpapan Bay. Our study aimed to estimate the diversity, species composition, and the abundance distribution of birds at the industrial zone of Balikpapan City. Our study contained six replicates each of boat transects on four rivers, the Somber, Getah, Paka Dua, and Wain rivers during the months of May and June 2017. We calculated the Margalef diversity and Bray–Curtis similarity indices to estimate diversity and species composition, whereas bird abundance distributions were analyzed using Paleontological Statistics (PAST) version 3.12. The Getah river had the highest diversity index (4.846), followed by the Somber (3.988), Wain (3.510), and Paka Dua (3.050) rivers. The Bray–Curtis index revealed high similarity in species composition between the Wain and Paka Dua. Our rarefaction analysis showed that the Wain and Paka Dua rivers were well sampled and had lower species richness, with low differences between the observed and expected species richness, than the Somber and Getah rivers. Fisher Log Series Model also showed abundance distribution being highest at Getah (11.170), and lowest at the Paka Dua Rivers (5.221). This observation may be due to heightened industrial activities and boat traffic on each river. Our study provides a useful baseline for future research on the bird assemblages on Balikpapan Bay.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorneo 3abirds 3aboats 3acoasts 3aindustry 3amodels 3arivers 3aspecies richness 3astatistics 3atraffic 0abalikpapan 0abird diversity 0adistribution 0aindustrial zone 0ariver1 aMulyani, Yeni A.q(Yeni Aryati),1 aFarajallah, Dyah Perwitasari1 aLhota, Stanislav1 aToulec, Tadeas0 tBiosaintifika.g2018 Dec., v. 10, no. 3 p.605-612dUniversitas Negeri SemarangwJournal:27802x2338-76107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15294/biosaintifika.v10i3.149273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007600166300001600242520112700258592002801385650002201413650001201435650001101447650003801458650001201496650001201508650001801520650001201538650002001550650002201570653002801592653002501620653002901645653001701674700005401691700001801745700001501763700001501778700001501793700001501808700001401823700001401837700001601851773009901867856008401966852000902050655001202059IND60606254020221120084807.0180725e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060625402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2016.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarma, M.C.10aSynthesis of Cu3.21Bi4.79S9 bismuth chalcogenide by mechanical alloying  ap. 348-352.  aIn this research, Cu3.21Bi4.79S9 was synthesized from Cu, Bi and S powders using ball milling. The effects of ball milling duration and the process control agent, i.e. ethanol, on the formation of Cu3.21Bi4.79S9 were investigated. The thermal stability of Cu3.21Bi4.79S9 was also studied using a Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) in combination with X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. It was observed that the addition of ethanol shows a significant effect on the refinement of the particle size of the milled powder. However, ethanol showed a negative effect on the formation of single phase Cu3.21Bi4.79S9 during ball milling. Cu3.21Bi4.79S9 was found in the milled powder after milling for 5h without using ethanol, whilst the presence of secondary phases such as Bi2S3 and Cu2S were also detected. All these secondary phases were disappeared after milling for 15h. Prolonged milling duration did not produce any change in the phases. Minimum particle size of the milled powder was achieved around 0.251μm after milling for 25h. The XRD and DSC results showed that Cu3.21Bi4.79S9 is thermally stable up to 230°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abismuth 3acopper 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aethanol 3amilling 3aparticle size 3apowders 3aprocess control 3athermal stability 0aTernary bismuth sulfide 0aBismuth chalcogenide 0aThermoelectric materials 0aBall milling1 aLong, B.D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4789-051X1 aSabri, M.F.M.1 aRamesh, S.1 aSaidur, R.1 aSaid, S.M.1 aKimura, K.1 aHai, N.H.1 aHuy, T.D.1 aTrung, T.B.0 tPowder technology.g2016 June, v. 294 p.348-352dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2016.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245015200164520138600316592002801702650001101730650002201741650001101763650001701774650001801791650001301809650001101822650001901833650006501852650001701917650001401934651001401948700002601962700002201988700002402010700002002034700002702054700002302081700002502104700002702129700003302156700002202189700002802211700002702239700003202266700002202298773012802320856007502448852000902523655001202532IND60766931920221118215052.0220211e20220124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076693192DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140305432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakti, Anjar Dimara10aSpatial Prioritization for Wildfire Mitigation by Integrating Heterogeneous Spatial Data: A New Multi-Dimensional Approach for Tropical Rainforests  aWildfires drive deforestation that causes various losses. Although many studies have used spatial approaches, a multi-dimensional analysis is required to determine priority areas for mitigation. This study identified priority areas for wildfire mitigation in Indonesia using a multi-dimensional approach including disaster, environmental, historical, and administrative parameters by integrating 20 types of multi-source spatial data. Spatial data were combined to produce susceptibility, carbon stock, and carbon emission models that form the basis for prioritization modelling. The developed priority model was compared with historical deforestation data. Legal aspects were evaluated for oil-palm plantations and mining with respect to their impact on wildfire mitigation. Results showed that 379,516 km² of forests in Indonesia belong to the high-priority category and most of these are located in Sumatra, Kalimantan, and North Maluku. Historical data suggest that 19.50% of priority areas for wildfire mitigation have experienced deforestation caused by wildfires over the last ten years. Based on legal aspects of land use, 5.2% and 3.9% of high-priority areas for wildfire mitigation are in oil palm and mining areas, respectively. These results can be used to support the determination of high-priority areas for the REDD+ program and the evaluation of land use policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorneo 3aElaeis guineensis 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3adeforestation 3aland use 3amodels 3aprioritization 3areducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation 3aspatial data 3awildfires 3aIndonesia1 aFauzi, Adam Irwansyah1 aTakeuchi, Wataru 1 aPradhan, Biswajeet 1 aYarime, Masaru 1 aVega-Garcia, Cristina 1 aAgustina, Elprida 1 aWibisono, Dionisius 1 aAnggraini, Tania Septi1 aTheodora, Megawati Oktaviani1 aRamadhanti, Desi 1 aMuhammad, Miqdad Fadhil1 aAufaristama, Muhammad 1 aPerdana, Agung Mahadi Putra1 aWikantika, Ketut 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 24, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140305433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05264naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245010900162300001300271520337600284592002803660650002003688650005003708650000903758650001203767650001403779650001303793650001303806650001303819650001403832650001403846650001703860650001203877650001103889650000903900650001003909650001503919650002003934650001503954650001603969650002103985650003304006650001104039650001404050650001804064650003004082650001304112650001404125650002204139650003004161650002004191650002304211650001304234650001004247650001204257650001204269651001304281700001404294700002504308700001804333773011404351856007904465961001304544852000904557655001204566IND60549034920221119075013.0160906e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054903492DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-03-11-01602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazerian, E.10aFirst Report of Soft Rot Caused by Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum on Cucumber in Malaysia  ap. 1474.  aCucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is one of the most important vegetable fruits in Malaysia. Cucumber is principally grown in the states of Johor, Kelantan, and Perak. The broad host range Enterobacteriaceae pathogen, Pectobacterium carotovorum, can cause soft rot on stems or cucumber fruit. In Malaysia, cucumber is produced in a warm, humid climate, thus the plant is susceptible to attack by P. carotovorum at any time during production. In 2010, cucumber samples with wilted and chlorotic leaves, water-soaked lesions, and collapsed fruits were found in multiple fields. Small pieces of infected stems and fruit were immersed in 5 ml of saline solution (0.85% NaCl) for 20 min and then 50 μl of this suspension was spread onto nutrient agar (NA) and incubated at 27°C for 24 h. White-to-pale gray colonies with irregular margins were selected for analysis. For pathogenicity tests, cucumber fruits were surface sterilized by ethyl alcohol 70%, washed with sterilized distilled water, cut into small pieces, and inoculated with 20 μl of 10⁸ CFU/ml suspensions of five representative strains. Cucumber plants were grown for 3 weeks in sterilized soil and their stems were inoculated with 20 μl of 10⁸ CFU/ml of bacterial suspension. Inoculated samples and control (noninoculated) plants were placed in a growth chamber with 80 to 90% relative humidity at 27°C. Symptoms occurred on fruit slices and stems after 1 to 3 days and appeared the same as naturally infected samples, but the control samples remained healthy. Koch's postulates were fulfilled with the reisolation of cultures with the same characteristics as described earlier. Hypersensitivity reaction (HR) assays were done by infiltrating 10⁸ CFU/ml of bacterial suspension into tobacco leaf epidermis and HR developed. All strains were subjected to biochemical and morphological assays, as well as molecular assessment. The strains were gram negative, facultative anaerobes, rod shaped, able to macerate potato slices and growth at 37°C; catalase positive; oxidase and phosphatase negative; able to degrade pectate; sensitive to erythromycin; negative for utilization of α-methyl glycoside, indole production, and reduction of sugars from sucrose; acid production from arabitol, sorbitol, and utilization of citrate were negative, but positive for raffinose and melibiose utilization. PCR amplification of the pel gene by Y₁ and Y₂ primers produced a 434-bp fragment on agarose gel 1% (1). Amplification of intergenic transcribed spacer region by G₁ and L₁ primers gave two main bands at approximately 535 and 580 bp on agarose gel 1.5%. The ITS-PCR products were digested with RsaI restriction enzyme (3). On the basis of biochemical and morphological characteristics, PCR-based pel gene and characterization of the ITS region, and digestion of the ITS-PCR products with RsaI restriction enzyme, all isolates were identified as P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. To our knowledge, this is the first report of soft rot caused by P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum on cucumber from Malaysia.References: (1) A. Darraas et al. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60:1437, 1994.

We examined the effect of 80 different kinase inhibitors on ERGIC morphology and found that rottlerin, a PKCδ inhibitor, induced the dispersion of the perinuclear ERGIC into punctate structures. Rottlerin also delayed anterograde transport of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG) from the ER to the Golgi and retrograde transport of cholera toxin from cell surface to the ER via the Golgi. RNA interference revealed that knockdown of PKCδ or ε resulted in the dispersion of the ERGIC, but unexpectedly did not inhibit VSVG and cholera toxin transport. We also found that rottlerin depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential, as does carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), an uncoupler, and demonstrated that a decrease in the intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels by rottlerin might underlie the block in transports. These results suggest that PKCδ and ε specifically regulate the morphology of the ERGIC and that the maintenance of ERGIC structure is not necessarily required for anterograde and retrograde transports.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGolgi apparatus 3aRNA interference 3aVesiculovirus 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acholera toxin 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3aprotein kinase C 3aproteins1 aNakatsu, Daiki1 aKii, Hiroaki1 aMaiya, Nobuhiko1 aAdachi, Atsuhiro1 aYamamoto, Akitsugu1 aKano, Fumi1 aMurata, Masayuki0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

Eight weeks old Swiss strain male mice (Mus musculus) were divided into five groups: (A) control, (B) nephrolithiasis, (C) CalcusolTM, (D) nephrolithiasis & CalcusolTM, and (E) nephrolithiasis & CalcusolTM simultaneously. Nephrolithiasis was induced by applying porang tuber (Amor-phophallus muelleri) flour 0.06 mg/g of body weight during 3 months. CalcusolTM is traditional medicine, made of tempuyung leaves extract with Saccharum lactis as additional substance. The dosage for CalcusolTM treatment was 3.3 mg/g of body weight. After 3 months treatment, the mice were killed by neck-dislocation, the kidneys were isolated and prepared for paraffin histology. CuZnSOD was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), using rabbit policlonal antibody anti-SOD1 (Bioss, bs-1079R) as primary antibody. Tissues were observed under Olympus BX51, 400x mag-nification. Images were documented with Olympus Digital Camera DP20. The histology images were analized in Immunoratio software online (URL: http://153.1.200.58:8080/immunoratio/) to receive the percentage of number of cells expressing CuZnSOD. The result showed that CalcusolTM admi=nistration could decrease number of cells expressing CuZnSOD in kidney significantly (P<0.05). It was supposed that antioxidant content in CalcusolTM could scavenge ROS directly with no induction of CuZnSOD production in cell.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharum 3aantibodies 3aantioxidants 3abody weight 3acameras 3acomputer software 3aflour 3aimmunohistochemistry 3akidneys 3amales 3amodels 3arabbits 3arenal calculi 3atraditional medicine 0aCalcusolÃ” 0aCuZnSOD 0anephrolithiasis1 aWidyarti0 tBerkala Penelitian Hayati.g2014 Oct., v. 19, no. 1 p.26-31dIndonesian Biological SocietywJournal:27738x2337-389X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.23869/bphjbr.19.1.201363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002300136245011100159300001600270520119500286592002801481653002601509653001801535653002901553653001401582653001701596653001301613653001701626700002201643700001801665773010601683856007201789852000901861655001201870IND60125518820221121101547.0151104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012551882DNAL7 a10.2179/11-0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexander, Sara N.12aA Subspecific Revision of North American Saltmarsh Mallow Kosteletzkya pentacarpos (L.)

Gray) has been treated as a single variable species or as a species including four varieties: K. virginica var. althaeifolia, var. aquilonia, var. smilacifolia, and var. virginica. The aim of this study was to test the validity of formally recognizing these putative infraspecific taxa with a statistical analysis of morphological data. Loans were received from 15 herbaria, for 1,114 specimens; 224 were selected. Measurements were taken from these 224 specimens for 42 characters and analyzed by canonical discriminant analysis, which recognized two dimensions. Var. smilacifolia and var. aquilonia were separated from the other two groupings and correctly predicted at 100%%. Var. smilacifolia is morphologically distinct from the other taxa in having linear hastate leaves with reflexed linear lobes, an unbranched inflorescence, a slender stem, and a mostly entire leaf margin. A new combination is proposed: Kosteletzkya pentacarpos (L.) Ledeb. var. smilacifolia (Chapm.) S.N. Alexander. All other former putative infraspecific taxa are synonymous with Kosteletzkya pentacarpos var. pentacarpos.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDiscriminant analysis 0ainfraspecific 0aKosteletzkya pentacarpos 0alectotype 0amorphometric 0arevision 0asmilacifolia1 aHayek, Lee-Ann C.1 aWeeks, Andrea0 tCastanea.g2012 Mar., v. 77, no. 1 p.106-122dSouthern Appalachian Botanical Societyx0008-74757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2179%2F11-0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01782naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245011500173506002800288520069100316592002801007506003701035650001501072650001701087650001801104650001101122650001601133650002401149650000901173700002001182700002101202700002101223773009601244856008301340852000901423655001201432IND60740065420221207135057.0200302s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074006542DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202017000282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKudryashova, Yu.

Eleven cassava mosaic disease (CMD) tolerant and two susceptible varieties were planted in six trials; leaves were harvested at 4, 8 and 11 months after planting (MAP) and storage roots were harvested at 12 MAP. Edible leaf and storage root dry matter yields were strongly affected by variety and interacted with location. Edible leaf yields ranged from 209 to 435 kg ha⁻¹ DM among varieties. Storage root yields ranged from 2540 to 9250 kg ha⁻¹ DM among locations and from 2470 to 7550 kg ha⁻¹ among varieties. Leaf harvest caused 15.8% storage root yield loss. Susceptible varieties produced lowest edible leaf (209 kg ha⁻¹) and storage root (2530 kg ha⁻¹) yields in all locations. Improved varieties suffered storage root yield reductions of 5–25.8%, equivalent to 400–1550 kg ha⁻¹. Edible leaf yield and storage root yield were not correlated. Variety TME419 produced the highest average storage root yields in 3 of 6 locations. The three best leaf producing varieties were not among the best storage root producers, indicating an incompatibility of the two production objectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3acassava 3aleaves 3aprotein sources 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo 0aleaf harvest 0aroot yield loss 0aDR Congo 0astorage root yield1 aBakelana, Zeyimo1 aBungu, Denis M.1 aMwangu, Mbuta K.1 aNdonda, Adrien0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 67, no. 12 p.1634-1648dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4585x1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2020.18006473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01341naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245015100154300002000305520029100325592002800616650003600644650002500680650001100705650001300716700001800729700001200747700001700759700001600776700001500792773012400807856007500931852000901006655001201015IND60778931120221121170834.0220603e20220512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077893112DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra02074b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wei10aRh(iii)-catalyzed synthesis of dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-ones from aryl ketone O-acetyl oximes and quinones via C–H activation and C–C bond cleavage  ap. 14435-14438.  aA redox-neutral synthesis of dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-ones from aryl ketone O-acetyl oximes and quinones has been realized via Rh(iii)-catalyzed cascade C–H activation annulation.

Here we tested whether historic smelting affects current mercury (Hg) cycling in 35 freshwater lakes over a 2800 km² area around the former gold mine. We sampled lake water and sediment over three consecutive years (2015–2017) using a factorial sampling design that accounted for different environmental variables known to affect the net methylmercury (MeHg) levels in water. Stable Hg(ii) and MeHg isotope tracers were used to quantify Hg methylation and demethylation rate constants in sediments, and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to characterize microbial community structure. This study reveals that the fraction of methylated total Hg (% MeHg) found in surface water is positively correlated to the sulfate gradient, while the rate at which Hg is methylated (Kₘ) in sediments is negatively correlated with total arsenic, and positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon, total phosphorous, and % MeHg in the water. Furthermore, 6 of the 28 lakes that had detectable demethylation rate constants (Kd) also had significantly lower DOC concentrations than lakes with non-detectable Kd. Our results also show that legacy pollution from smelting activities is affecting the structure of microbial communities in lake sediments. This study reveals the complex dynamics of Hg cycling in this northern environment, highlighting the importance of large-scale studies in which the effect of multiple pollution gradients (e.g. arsenic and sulfate) must be taken into consideration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acommunity structure 3ademethylation 3adissolved organic carbon 3afreshwater 3agenes 3agold 3aisotopes 3amercury 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3amicrobial communities 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3asediments 3asulfates 3asurface water1 aYumvihoze, Emmanuel1 aBlais, Jules M.1 aPoulain, Alexandre J.0 tEnvironmental science.g2021 Aug. 18, v. 23, no. 8 p.1220-1230dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1em00129a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245015200201500002000353520152200373592002801895650002201923650001701945650001801962650001501980650001001995650001902005650001902024650002102043650001402064650001502078650001402093650001302107650001602120651001802136700002402154700001802178700002002196700002402216773012902240856007302369852000902442655001202451IND60624045520221120185313.0181130e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062404552DNAL7 a10.1111/jav.018172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlson, Monica L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2924-982210aHaemosporidian prevalence in northern saw‐whet owls Aegolius acadicus is predicted by host age and average annual temperature at breeding grounds  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnderstanding factors that determine haemosporidian prevalence is critical in predicting how parasite and avian host populations will respond to environmental change. Here, we used molecular screening of blood samples from migrating northern saw‐whet owls Aegolius acadicus in eastern North America to characterize haemosporidian infections and examine parasite prevalence with respect to abundance of migrants, timing of migration, climatic conditions at the breeding grounds, and avian host age. We identified three haemosporidian genera (Leucocytozoon, Plasmodium, and Haemoproteus) and discovered a new lineage of Leucocytozoon that is thus far specific to the northern saw‐whet owl. We found no significant relationship between parasite prevalence and northern saw‐whet owl abundance or timing of migration. After‐hatch‐year birds were significantly more likely to be parasitized by Leucocytozoon than hatch‐year birds, whereas prevalence of Plasmodium was higher in hatch‐year birds. Of the three climatic variables analyzed at owl breeding grounds (temperature, precipitation, and snowpack days), lower average annual temperatures significantly increased the chance of a bird being parasitized by Leucocytozoon; no significant temperature‐dependent relationship was found for Plasmodium. This study contributes to our general understanding of the relationship between parasite prevalence and host density, host age, resource abundance, and abiotic factors such as temperature and precipitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAegolius acadicus 3aHaemoproteus 3aLeucocytozoon 3aPlasmodium 3abirds 3ablood sampling 3abreeding sites 3aclimatic factors 3aparasites 3aprediction 3ascreening 3asnowpack 3atemperature 3aNorth America1 aProudfoot, Glenn A.1 aGentile, Kaya1 aDispoto, Janice1 aWeckstein, Jason D.0 tJournal of avian biology.g2018 Nov., v. 49, no. 11 p.e01817-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3949829x0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.018173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003400140245008700174300001800261520126400279592002801543650005201571650001901623650002601642650001101668650001301679650001201692700002201704700001701726700002501743773013101768856007401899852000901973655001201982IND60747862520221119014522.0210820e20210818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074786252DNAL7 a10.1039/d1em00154j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUkhurebor, Kingsley Eghonghon10aInfluence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: a review from the climate change perspective  ap. 1060-1078.  aEver since the global outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) in the early part of 2020, there is no doubt that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has placed great tension globally and has affected almost all aspects of human endeavors. There are presently several research studies on the atmospheric environmental and economic effects of this dreaded virus. Supposedly, the responses ought to have also present innovations that would advance scientific research to mitigate its impacts since most of the ensuing consequences impact the atmospheric climatic conditions. Even when it appears that economic events would possibly return in no time, the circumstances will change. Specifically, from the existing literature, it appears that not much has been done to study the influence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on climate change. Hence, this present review article will explore the possible connection between the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and climate change. The utilization of various scientific domains for climate change studies during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and exploring the positive influences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and measures to avoid the negative impacts on climate change owing to SARS-CoV-2 have also been discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental science 3ahumans 3apandemic 3aviruses1 aSingh, Kshitij RB1 aNayak, Vanya1 aUK-Eghonghon, Gladys0 tEnvironmental science.g2021 Aug. 18, v. 23, no. 8 p.1060-1078dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1em00154j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245018600167520106200353592002801415650002101443650002601464650001301490650002901503650001701532650001301549650002001562650002401582650001701606650002601623650001001649650000901659650002301668650002001691650002401711650003101735653001301766653001701779653002501796653002401821653003201845700001501877700001801892700001301910700001901923700002001942700001401962700001901976700001501995700001602010700001502026700001602041700001302057700001802070773010802088856008602196852000902282655001202291IND60707453420221117060038.0210820e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070745342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1168422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Derong10aInvestigation of the structural, physical properties, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activity of chitosan- nano-silicon aerogel composite edible films incorporated with okara powder  aThe chitosan/okra powder/nano-silicon aerogel composite films were prepared by casting method and their physicochemical properties and structural characterization were studied.

It is chemically stable substance and demonstrates estrogenic effects, toxicity and carcinogenic effects in the environment. The toxin accumulates rapidly in the liver where it exerts most of its damage, but the molecular mechanisms behind its toxicity remain unclear. Due to limited information concerning the effect of OP on liver, this study investigates how OP causes hepatotoxicity in liver. Here, suppression subtractive hybridization was used to identify the alterations in gene transcription of the frog (Rana chensinensis) after exposure to OP. After hybridization and cloning, the subtractive cDNA libraries were obtained. At random, 207 positive clones were selected and sequenced from the subtractive libraries, which gave a total of 75 gene fragment sequences. The screening identified numerous genes involved in apoptosis, signal transduction, cytoskeletal remodeling, innate immunity, material and energy metabolism, translation and transcription which were extensively discussed. Two sequenced genes were analyzed further using real time quantitative PCR. The two genes from the library were found to be transcriptionally up-regulated. These results confirmed the successful construction of the subtractive cDNA library that was enriched for the genes that were differentially transcribed in the amphibian liver challenged with OP, and for the first time present the basic data on toxicity effect of OP on liver.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRana chensinensis 3aapoptosis 3acDNA libraries 3acarcinogenicity 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3acytoskeleton 3aenergy metabolism 3aestrogenic properties 3afrogs 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahybridization 3aimmunity 3aliver 3apaints 3apesticides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arubber 3ascreening 3asignal transduction 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aPhenolsxtoxicity 2aRanidaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aXiao, Ning1 aZhang, Yu-hui0 tEcotoxicology.g2014 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.1-10dSpringer-Verlagx0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-013-1144-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245008200171520139400253592002801647650001301675650002401688650000901712650001601721650001501737650001401752650002301766650001801789650002201807650002601829650002401855650001501879650001701894651001301911700001801924700002201942700002001964700002001984700002802004773010302032856008302135852000902218655001202227IND60695415920221119022210.0200628e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069541592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2020.1028282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDijk, Michiel van,10aReducing the maize yield gap in Ethiopia: Decomposition and policy simulation  aMaize is an important staple crop in Ethiopia. Reducing the yield gap - the difference between actual and (water-limited) potential yield - has wide implications for food security and policy. In this paper we combine stochastic frontier analysis of household survey data with agronomic information on (water-limited) potential yield to decompose the maize yield gap in Ethiopia and highlight policy solutions to reduce the yield gap. Our analysis suggests that lack of access to advanced technologies makes up the largest component of the maize yield gap but market imperfections, economic constraints and management constraints are also important determinants. Potentially, maize production can be increased almost fivefold if all these constraints would be addressed simultaneously and the yield gap could be fully closed. Another finding of the paper is measurement issues in the national household survey (LSMS-ISA), a key source of information for scientists to assess agricultural policies in Ethiopia and other African countries. A comparison with results from a crop model suggests a large number of unrealistic values related to key maize input and output variables. Combining economic and agronomic approaches is therefore not only useful to identify policies to reduce maize yield gaps, but also to assess and improve the quality of data-bases on which recommendations are made.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aagricultural policy 3acorn 3acrop models 3acrop yield 3adatabases 3aeconometric models 3afood security 3ahousehold surveys 3aimperfect competition 3ainformation sources 3ascientists 3astaple crops 3aEthiopia1 aMorley, Tomas1 avan Loon, Marloes1 aReidsma, Pytrik1 aTesfaye, Kindie1 avan Ittersum, Martin K.0 tAgricultural systems.g2020 Aug., v. 183 p.102828-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2020.1028283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012600176300001400302520165000316592002801966650001801994650003102012650001002043650001202053650002102065650002402086650001102110650001102121650002202132650001702154650000902171650003902180650004402219653001802263653002202281653000802303653001302311653002402324653000902348700002302357700003302380700001902413700002602432700002302458773010802481856008602589852000902675655001202684IND60543270120221118102202.0190410e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054327012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2015.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRačkauskienė, Ieva10aEffects of beetroot (Beta vulgaris) preparations on the Maillard reaction products in milk and meat-protein model systems  ap. 31-39.  aThe effects of beetroots (Beta vulgaris) on the formation of Maillard reaction (MR) products possessing health, nutritional and sensory implications were studied. The effect of dried beetroot juice on the formation of Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) and Nε-(2-furoylmethyl)-L-lysine (furosine) was determined in a milk model system. Beetroot juice reduced furosine formation more than CML, inferring that betalain compounds present in the juice are more effective in reducing the formation of MR products in the early stage than in the advanced stage of MR. Beetroot water extract was fractionated on Sephadex LH20 and obtained three beetroot fractions were used to assess their effect on the formation of heterocyclic amines in a meat-protein model system. Beetroot fraction possessing the highest antioxidant capacity and containing the highest betalain content reduced the amounts of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo-[4,5-b]-pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-3,8-dimethyl-imidazo-[4,5-f]-quinoxaline (MeIQx), and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo-[4,5-f]-quinoline (IQ) by approximately 60, 77 and 87%, respectively. Beetroot preparations were characterized by ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC–Q-TOF–MS/MS). The antioxidant activities of beetroot preparations were also evaluated by 2,2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS+) scavenging capacity, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and total phenolic compound assays. Our findings could be useful for creating novel source of functional ingredients exerting anti-carcenogenic and antiglycation activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeta vulgaris 3aMaillard reaction products 3abeets 3acations 3afunctional foods 3aheterocyclic amines 3ajuices 3alysine 3amass spectrometry 3ameat protein 3amilk 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aBeta vulgaris 0aMaillard reaction 0aCML 0aFurosine 0aHeterocyclic amines 0aPhIP1 aPukalskas, Audrius1 aVenskutonis, Petras Rimantas1 aFiore, Alberto1 aTroise, Antonio Dario1 aFogliano, Vincenzo0 tFood research international.g2015 Apr., v. 70 p.31-39dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011800160300001800278520150400296592002801800650002601828650004001854650001201894650001701906650001301923700002201936700002001958700002201978700001802000700002002018700001702038700001702055700002002072700002302092700001702115700001802132773013102150856007402281852000902355655001202364IND60747862720221119014650.0210820e20210818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074786272DNAL7 a10.1039/d1em00180a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCousins, Ian T.10aFinding essentiality feasible: common questions and misinterpretations concerning the “essential-use” concept  ap. 1079-1087.  aThe essential-use concept is a tool that can guide the phase-out of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and potentially other substances of concern. This concept is a novel approach to chemicals management that determines whether using substances of concern, such as PFAS, is truly essential for a given functionality. To assess the essentiality of a particular use case, three considerations need to be addressed: (1) the function (chemical, end use and service) that the chemical provides in the use case, (2) whether the function is necessary for health and safety and critical for the functioning of society and (3) if the function is necessary, whether there are viable alternatives for the chemical for this particular use. A few illustrative examples of the three-step process are provided for use cases of PFAS. The essential-use concept takes chemicals management away from a substance-by-substance approach to a group approach. For PFAS and other substances of concern, it offers a more rapid pathway toward effective management or phase-out. Parts of the concept of essential use have already been widely applied in global treaties and international regulations and it has also been recently used by product manufacturers and retailers to phase out substances of concern from supply chains. Herein some of the common questions and misinterpretations regarding the practical application of the essential-use concept are reviewed, and answers and further clarifications are provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental science 3aper- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 3asociety 3asupply chain 3atreaties1 aDe Witt, Jamie C.1 aGlüge, Juliane1 aGoldenman, Gretta1 aHerzke, Dorte1 aLohmann, Rainer1 aMiller, Mark1 aNg, Carla A.1 aPatton, Sharyle1 aScheringer, Martin1 aTrier, Xenia1 aWang, Zhanyun0 tEnvironmental science.g2021 Aug. 18, v. 23, no. 8 p.1079-1087dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1em00180a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245010100180300001600281520138100297592002801678650003301706650000801739650001301747650001801760650001001778650001801788650001801806650001501824650002101839650001601860650000901876650002101885650004301906650000901949650002001958650001201978653001801990653001802008653002002026653001302046653002002059700001902079700002602098700002202124700002202146773011002168856008602278852000902364655001202373IND60543270320221118102145.0190410e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054327032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2015.01.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarankovich, Natallia V.10aEvaluation of pea protein–polysaccharide matrices for encapsulation of acid-sensitive bacteria  ap. 118-124.  aProtein–polysaccharide capsules containing Bifidobacterium adolescentis were produced and tested in a series of in vitro survival experiments to evaluate capsule protection of the bacterium to simulated stomach conditions, as well as their ability to release the encapsulated bacteria under conditions similar to those found in the lower gut. A protein fraction isolated from peas (pea protein isolate: PPI; 2.0%; w/v) was mixed with each of three different polysaccharides (0.5% (w/v) of either sodium alginate, iota-carrageenan and gellan gum) to produce capsules ranging in size from 2 to 3mm diameter. All capsule formulations provided significant protection for cells exposed to synthetic stomach juice at 37°C relative to non-encapsulated bacteria. In addition, PPI-alginate and PPI-iota-carrageenan capsules were found to dissolve in simulated intestinal fluid at 37°C, releasing 70–79% of their bacteria “payload” within 3h, with higher cell numbers being released from the freeze-dried capsules. PPI-gellan gum capsules did not dissolve to the same extent and the number of released cells was ~26–30% lower. Following a temporal rat feeding study with the test bacterium encapsulated in PPI-alginate, B. adolescentis-specific PCR and qPCR analyses confirmed the presence of DNA from this species in rat feces, but only during the period of capsule intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium adolescentis 3aDNA 3abacteria 3aencapsulation 3afeces 3afreeze drying 3agastric juice 3agellan gum 3aiota-carrageenan 3apea protein 3apeas 3aprotein isolates 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3asodium alginate 3astomach 0aEncapsulation 0aPlant protein 0aPolysaccharides 0aCapsules 0aBifidobacterium1 aKhan, Nurul H.1 aNickerson, Michael T.1 aKalmokoff, Martin1 aKorber, Darren R.0 tFood research international.g2015 Apr., v. 70 p.118-124dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.01.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002600190245013600216300001400352520172400366592002802090653002702118653000902145653002302154653001002177653000902187700001902196700001902215700002202234700002302256700001902279700002002298700002702318700002502345773010402370856008302474852000902557655001202566IND60530744420221119004230.0160721e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053074442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymgmr.2016.02.0012doi7 aPMC47893882pmcid7 a270145812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilosto, Massimiliano12aA novel mitochondrial tRNAAla gene variant causes chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia in a patient with Huntington disease  ap. 70-73.  aChronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia is a mitochondrial disorder usually caused by single or multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions and, more rarely, by maternally inherited mtDNA point mutations, most frequently in tRNA genes (MTT).We report on a patient presenting with a progressive eyelid ptosis with bilateral ophthalmoparesis, dysphagia, dysphonia and mild proximal limb weakness associate with a mild movement disorder characterized by abnormal involuntary movements involving head and limbs, imbalance and gait instability.Muscle biopsy demonstrated the presence of ragged red fibers and several cytochrome-C-oxidase negative fibers. Molecular analysis showed the novel m.5613T>C heteroplasmic mutation in the mitochondrial tRNAAla gene (MTTA) which disrupts a conserved site and fulfills the accepted criteria of pathogenicity. Moreover, a 38 CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion was found on the huntingtin gene, thus configuring a singular CPEO/“reduced penetrance” Huntington disease “double trouble”.With this novel MTTA point mutation, we extend the spectrum of provisional pathogenic changes in this gene, which is a very rare site of pathogenic mutation, and confirm that clinical expression of these mutations is hardly ever heterogeneous, including myopathy and CPEO.Mitochondrial involvement is an emerging key determinant in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease and it is well known that mutant huntingtin influences the mitochondrial respiratory complexes II and III. A synergist effect of the HTT and MTTA mutations on respiratory chain function may be hypothesized in our patient and should be regarded as a spur for further studies on the mtDNA/HTT reciprocal interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMitochondrial diseases 0aCPEO 0aHuntington disease 0amtDNA 0atRNA1 aLanzi, Gaetana1 aNesti, Claudia1 aVielmi, Valentina1 aMarchina, Eleonora1 aGalvagni, Anna1 aGiliani, Silvia1 aSantorelli, Filippo M.1 aPadovani, Alessandro0 tMolecular Genetics and Metabolism Reports.g2016 Mar., v. 6 p.70-73dElsevier Inc.x2214-42697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgmr.2016.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02000naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009900158300002000257520109200277592002801369650002201397650002201419650001701441650003701458700001901495773012401514856007501638852000901713655001201722IND60778931720221121224812.0220603e20220520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077893172DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra02165j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Mou-Ce10aResearch on the stability of luminescence of CsPbBr₃ and Mn:CsPbBr₃ PQDs in polar solution  ap. 15420-15426.  aMn:CsPbBr₃ PQDs are achieved by hot injection method. As the amount of Mn doping is gradually increased, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra shows a slight blue shift. Mn-doped PQDs exhibit higher quantum efficiency of 83.9% and longer lifetimes of 267 ns. The stability test was performed to assess the susceptibility of the PQDs to polar solutions. It was figured out that although the stabilities of CsPbBr₃ PQDs and Mn-doped PQDs decreased as the polarity of solution increased, Mn-doped PQDs still maintained higher PL intensity than undoped PQD. Notably, 73% PL intensity of Mn:PQDs was maintained which is nearly three times as much as undoped PQDs in water. We found polarity would induce drastic degradation of CsPbBr₃ QDs. The steady-state spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) verified that CsPbBr₃ QDs tend to aggregate to form larger particles under continuous light soaking. Our work reveals the main origin of instability in CsPbBr₃ QDs and provides reference to engineering such QDs towards optimal device application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aphotoluminescence 3aspectroscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aPan, Chun-Yang0 tRSC advances.g2022 May 20, v. 12, no. 24 p.15420-15426dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra02165j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05130naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245013600200300001800336500002000354520130100374592002801675596004701703596003401750596003501784596003401819596002401853596002301877596002301900650001501923650001501938650001301953650001701966650001101983651002201994700005802016700005802074700006102132700006002193700001902253700005702272700002202329700006402351700005702415700005802472700002102530700006102551700002202612700001802634700005602652700006002708700006402768700005802832700006102890700006502951700006003016700005703076700006403133700006903197700006103266700001503327700005803342700006103400700006203461700007003523700006203593700005803655700006503713700006003778700005603838700005703894700006303951700005704014773013104071856007704202852000904279655001204288IND60789669720221116173406.0220822e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078966972DNAL7 a10.1002/2016JC0126712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTestor, Pierre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8038-947910aMultiscale Observations of Deep Convection in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea During Winter 2012–2013 Using Multiple Platforms  ap. 1745-1776.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDuring winter 2012–2013, open‐ocean deep convection which is a major driver for the thermohaline circulation and ventilation of the ocean, occurred in the Gulf of Lions (Northwestern Mediterranean Sea) and has been thoroughly documented thanks in particular to the deployment of several gliders, Argo profiling floats, several dedicated ship cruises, and a mooring array during a period of about a year. Thanks to these intense observational efforts, we show that deep convection reached the bottom in winter early in February 2013 in a area of maximum 28 ± 3 109m2. We present new quantitative results with estimates of heat and salt content at the subbasin scale at different time scales (on the seasonal scale to a 10 days basis) through optimal interpolation techniques, and robust estimates of the deep water formation rate of 2.0 ±0.2 Sv. We provide an overview of the spatiotemporal coverage that has been reached throughout the seasons this year and we highlight some results based on data analysis and numerical modeling that are presented in this special issue. They concern key circulation features for the deep convection and the subsequent bloom such as Submesoscale Coherent Vortices (SCVs), the plumes, and symmetric instability at the edge of the deep convection area.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR 12‐BS06‐0003cANR ASICSMED project  cMOOSE long‐term observatory  aANR J11R107FcANR NAOS project  a284321cEU projects FP7 GROOM  a287600cFP7 PERSEUS  a262584cFP7 JERICO  cCOST Action ES0904 3aconvection 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3asalt content 3awinter 3aMediterranean Sea1 aBosse, Anthony1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6968-38051 aHoupert, Loïc1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8750-56311 aMargirier, Félix1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1205-38341 aMortier, Laurent1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2403-04421 aLegoff, Hervé1 aDausse, Denis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7221-42061 aLabaste, Matthieu1 aKarstensen, Johannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5044-70791 aHayes, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0141-99731 aOlita, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1302-89611 aRibotti, Alberto1 aSchroeder, Katrin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7991-91211 aChiggiato, Jacopo1 aOnken, Reiner1 aHeslop, Emma1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3534-97421 aMourre, Baptiste1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5056-04231 aD'ortenzio, Fabrizio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0617-73361 aMayot, Nicolas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4255-59391 aLavigne, Héloise1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6648-996X1 ade Fommervault, Orens1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7418-08741 aCoppola, Laurent1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0473-11291 aPrieur, Louis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5931-98901 aTaillandier, Vincent1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6922-02291 aDurrieu de Madron, Xavier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4543-69031 aBourrin, Francois1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0266-69921 aMany, Gael1 aDamien, Pierre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5900-99961 aEstournel, Claude1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3593-71381 aMarsaleix, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1684-35501 aTaupier‐Letage, Isabelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1094-20801 aRaimbault, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9466-66791 aWaldman, Robin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5872-14981 aBouin, Marie‐Noelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0437-65611 aGiordani, Hervé1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5517-24731 aCaniaux, Guy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2437-16451 aSomot, Samuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5066-29211 aDucrocq, Véronique1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1574-92871 aConan, Pascal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2879-94110 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Mar., v. 123, no. 3 p.1745-1776dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JC0126713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002800113040001800141100001900159245007400178300001600252520135700268592002801625650001001653650001601663650001601679650000901695650000901704650002401713650002201737650001301759700001401772700001601786700001701802700002401819773011601843856004101959852000902000655001202009IND50072176620221118193753.0140123e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007217662DNAL7 a244334482pmid7 a10.1111/jsap.121732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGindiciosi, B.10aSerum bromide concentrations following loading dose in epileptic dogs  ap. 108-111.  aOBJECTIVE: To determine serum bromide concentrations following an oral loading dose in dogs. METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical records of dogs suffering from seizures that were treated with bromide. A loading dose of 600 mg/kg potassium bromide was administered orally in 17 to 48 hours together with a maintenance dose of 30 mg/kg/day. Blood samples were collected within 24 hours after completing the protocol and serum bromide concentrations were determined by ultra‐violet gold chloride colorimetric assay. RESULTS: Thirty‐eight dogs were included in the study. The median age was 3 (range, 0 · 2 to 10) years and bodyweight 21 · 8 (3 · 45 to 46 · 2) kg. The median serum bromide concentration was 1 · 26 (0 · 74 to 3 · 6) mg/mL. Thirty‐two dogs (84 · 2%) had serum bromide concentrations within the therapeutic interval (1 to 3 mg/mL). The serum concentration in five dogs (13 · 2%) was just under the minimal therapeutic value and in one dog (2 · 6%) it exceeded the maximal therapeutic value (3 · 6 mg/mL). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Following this oral loading dose protocol, serum bromide concentrations reach the therapeutic range in the majority of dogs.

This study aimed to determine the fruit maturation stages at which eggs are laid by different insect seed predators feeding on the seeds or fruits of the following five dipterocarp species: Dipterocarpus globosus, Dryobalanops aromatica, Shorea beccariana, S. acuta and S. curtisii, which reproduced during the same period. We investigated the occurrence frequencies of the insect seed predators at various growth stages by collecting both unfallen and fallen fruit on several occasions during the period of seed/fruit maturation in a tropical rainforest in Borneo from September to December 2013. Weevils and bark beetles were the dominant insect seed predators of the five tree species. One or two weevil species of Alcidodes, Damnux and/or Nanophyes preyed on the seeds of each of the five tree species, and one bark beetle species, Coccotrypes gedeanus, preyed on the seeds of all five tree species. Many larvae, pupae and adults of each weevil species were found in pre‐dispersal (unfallen) fruit, whereas bark beetles at various growth stages were found in post‐dispersal (fallen) fruit. These results suggested that, among the dominant insect seed predators of the five dipterocarp species, weevil species oviposit on pre‐dispersal fruit and begin their larval growth before seed dispersal, whereas the oviposition and larval development of bark beetle species occurs in post‐dispersal fruit.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP21255004cJSPS KAKENHI  aJP16J08043cJSPS KAKENHI 3aDipterocarpus 3aDryobalanops aromatica 3aNanophyes 3aShorea 3aadults 3abark beetles 3aeggs 3afruits 3agranivores 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amoths 3aoviposition 3apupae 3aseed dispersal 3aseeds 3atrees 3atropical plants 3atropical rain forests 3aBorneo1 aItioka, Takao1 aShimizu‐Kaya, Usun1 aKishimoto‐Yamada, Keiko1 aMeleng, Paulus0 tEntomological science.g2018 Dec., v. 21, no. 4 p.412-422dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl3774063x1343-87867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ens.123203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01675naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013700163300001800300520037800318592002800696650001100724650002300735650002300758650001700781650002000798650001800818650004400836700013000880700002101010700001901031700002301050700002301073773013401096856007401230852000901304655001201313IND60617490320221119015615.0181025e20180424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061749032DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc01416g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrinkkötter, Marc10aRelevance of ion clusters for Li transport at elevated salt concentrations in [Pyr₁₂O₁][FTFSI] ionic liquid-based electrolytes  ap. 4278-4281.  aIn binary ionic liquid/Li salt mixtures with the novel asymmetric anion FTFSI, electrophoretic mobility μᵢ values of all ion species were determined using electrophoretic NMR.

The resulting impregnated carbons were examined as adsorbents for the removal of Reactive Black 5 (RB5) from aqueous solutions. RESULTS: The magnetic nanocomposites were characterized by various techniques (nitrogen adsorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, vibrating sample magnetometry, and scanning electron microscope measurements). The results of characterization analyses revealed that co‐precipitation was unsuccessful for the preparation of magnetic carbon while sonication led to a super‐paramagnetic activated carbon. Adsorption studies revealed that although magnetic carbon presented a decreased adsorption capacity compared with raw carbon, it was an acceptable dye adsorbent. High pH and high ionic strength values favored dye adsorption, while the data of adsorption isotherms and kinetics were better fitted by the Freundlich isotherm model and the pseudo‐second‐order kinetic model, respectively. Regeneration of dye‐loaded activated carbons by thermal re‐activation and re‐use of regenerated samples were also investigated. CONCLUSION: Mesoporous magnetic activated carbon, with a saturation magnetization of 18 emu g⁻¹, was successfully synthesized by sonication of activated carbon and magnetite nanoparticles. The magnetic carbon was found to be an adequate dye adsorbent with a maximum adsorption capacity of 445.294 mg g⁻¹. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acoprecipitation 3aionic strength 3airon 3akinetics 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3apH 3aporous media 3asalts 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asonication 3asorption isotherms1 aGiannakoudakis, Dimitrios A1 aSarafidis, Charalampos S1 aLazaridis, Nikolaos K1 aDeliyanni, Eleni A0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2017 Aug., v. 92, no. 8 p.1899-1911dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.52103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245013300171520098200304592002801286650002001314650002301334650002301357650001601380650002201396650001101418650001301429650001301442650001101455653003301466653001701499653001801516653002001534700001901554700001501573700001701588700001701605700002001622700001901642700005701661773010001718856008701818852000901905655001201914IND60695416420221120071003.0200607e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069541642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1270562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Yonghua10aSemi-quantitative evaluation of seafood spoilage using filter-paper strips loaded with an aggregation-induced emission luminogen  aThe method for seafood spoilage detection is far from satisfactory for ensuring food safety and security. Here, we develop a simple and cost-effective method using the filter papers loaded with a dihydroquinoxaline derivative (H + DQ2) to monitor salmon spoilage. The correlation between the content of solid biogenic amines and the photoluminescence intensity (PL) of H + DQ2 induced by amine vapours showed that the PL intensities of H + DQ2 increased with the increase of spoilage, which indicates that it is feasible to evaluate the spoilage degree of salmon based on the PL intensity of H + DQ2-loaded filter papers by semi-quantitation. The optimum detection condition is 75, 50 and 50 g of salmon, 75, 25 and 10 µM H + DQ2 at 0, 4 and 25 °C, respectively. This study provides a quick and simple way for testing amine vapour from fish and provides baseline information for developing an easy-to-use on-site method to evaluate seafood quality for customers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogenic amines 3aconsumers (people) 3acost effectiveness 3afood safety 3aphotoluminescence 3asalmon 3aseafoods 3aspoilage 3avapors 0aAggregation-induced emission 0aPaper stripe 0aAmine vapours 0aSalmon spoilage1 aZhong, Zhaowei1 aOu, Weixin1 aShi, Haoming1 aAlam, Parvej1 aTang, Ben Zhong1 aQin, Jianguang1 aTang, Youhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2718-544X0 tFood chemistry.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 327 p.127056-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1270563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01021naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245002200160300001800182520021000200592002800410650002700438650001400465650001200479650001300491700002300504773013300527856007400660852000900734655001200743IND60747863120221119012633.0210820e20210818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074786312DNAL7 a10.1039/d1np90030g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Robert A.10aHot off the press  ap. 1418-1422.  aA personal selection of 32 recent papers is presented covering various aspects of current developments in bioorganic chemistry and novel natural products such as pyrasplorine A from Aspergillus versicolor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus versicolor 3achemistry 3apresses 3apressing1 aSutherland, Andrew0 tNatural product reports.g2021 Aug. 18, v. 38, no. 8 p.1418-1422dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26900x1460-47527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1np90030g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245016100173300001600334520163700350592002801987650001802015650002702033650002802060650002602088650002902114650001202143650001902155650001302174650001202187650001502199650001502214650001902229650002102248650001602269650001402285650001902299650001402318650002002332650001602352650002002368653003202388653002902420653002902449653002802478653001602506700002502522700001902547773013602566856008502702852000902787655001202796IND60743079420221118195228.0210707e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074307942DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2021.19130132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgbaji, Joseph E.10aAttenuation of petroleum hydrocarbon fractions using rhizobacterial isolates possessing alkB, C23O, and nahR genes for degradation of n-alkane and aromatics  ap. 635-645.  aThis work assessed the catabolic versatility of functional genes in hydrocarbon-utilizing bacteria obtained from the rhizosphere of plants harvested in aged polluted soil sites in Ogoni and their attenuation efficacy in a bioremediation study. Rhizosphere soil was enumerated for its hydrocarbon-utilizing bacteria. The bacteria were in-vitro screened and selected through the quantification of their total protein and specific intermediate pathway enzyme (catechol 2,3-dioxygenase) activity in the metabolism of hydrocarbon. Thereafter, agarose gel electrophoresis technique was deployed to profile the genome of the selected strains for catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O), 1,2-alkane monooxygenase (alkB), and naphthalene dioxygenase (nahR). Four rhizobacterial isolates namely Pseudomonas fluorescens (A3), Achromobacter agilis (A4), Bacillus thuringiensis (D2), and Staphylococcus lentus (L1) were selected based on the presence of C23O, alkB, and nahR genes. The gel electrophoresis results showed an approximate molecular weight of 200 bp for alkB, 300 bp for C23O, and 400 bp for nahR. The gas chromatogram for residual total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) revealed mineralization of fractions C₈–C₁₇, phytane, C₁₈–C₃₀. TPH for in-vitro bioremediation of crude oil-polluted soil was observed to have an optimal reduction/loss of 97% within the 56th day of the investigation. This study has further revealed that the microbiome of plants pre-exposed to crude oil pollution could serve as a reservoir for mining group of bacterial with broad catabolic potentials for eco-recovery and waste treatment purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchromobacter 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aStaphylococcus lentus 3aagar gel electrophoresis 3aalkanes 3abioremediation 3acatechol 3aenzymes 3ametabolism 3amicrobiome 3amineralization 3amolecular weight 3anaphthalene 3apetroleum 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3aprotein content 3arhizosphere 3awaste treatment 0aAgarose gel electrophoresis 0acatechol 2,3-dioxygenase 0a1,2-alkane monooxygenase 0anaphthalene dioxygenase 0aattenuation1 aNwaichi, Eucharia O.1 aAbu, Gideon O.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2021 June 30, v. 56, no. 6 p.635-645dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2126x1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2021.19130133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009200167300001400259520130600273592002801579650001801607650002001625650001101645650001601656650001301672650001701685650001401702650001001716650001001726650002801736650001001764650001201774650001401786653001801800653001301818700002201831700001401853700001901867700002401886773013301910856008402043852000902127655001202136IND60535348420221120170358.0200607e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053534842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vprsr.2016.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForslid, Anna10aBovine eimeriosis in Swedish calves: Epidemiology and insights into sampling procedures  ap. 16-20.  aBovine eimeriosis is a common, globally distributed infection in housed calves aged from 3 to 12weeks. To date, no national prevalence study revealing the occurrence and distribution of Eimeria species under Swedish environmental and farming conditions has been performed.This study revealed the excretion of Eimeria bovis or Eimeria zuernii (alone or together) in 23% of all sampled calves (N=541) and 61% of all herds (N=99). The number of tested calves was critical for whether positive calves were detected or not. Nine other Eimeria species were identified, the most frequently reported being Eimeria ellipsoidalis (9% and 35% of positive calves and herds, respectively) and Eimeria auburnensis (4% and 19% of positive calves and herds, respectively). Not all calves shedding oocysts had diarrhoea and not all diarrhoeic calves shedded oocysts. Based on these present findings, Swedish cattle practitioners should include bovine eimeriosis as a relevant differential diagnosis to other common gastrointestinal pathogens in 3 to 12weeks old calves with diarrhoea or unthrifty calves without diarrhoea. When testing a herd for bovine eimeriosis, a sufficient number of faecal samples, i.e. 10 or more samples, should be examined to obtain a reliable picture of the infection status in a given farm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEimeria bovis 3aEimeria zuernii 3acalves 3acoccidiosis 3adiarrhea 3aepidemiology 3aexcretion 3afarms 3afeces 3agastrointestinal system 3aherds 3aoocysts 3apathogens 0aEimeria bovis 0aCoccidia1 aChristensson, Dan1 aDahl, Jan1 aGrandi, Giulio1 aEnemark, Jörg M.D.0 tVeterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports.g2015 Dec., v. 1-2 p.16-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23280x2405-93907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2016.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008700160300001800247500002000265520150500285592002801790650001801818650001301836650001901849650001301868650001701881650001901898650001201917650002601929650001601955650001301971700002201984700002402006700001802030773015002048856007302198852000902271655001202280IND60587394120221119215510.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058739412DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.52212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacholak, Amanda14aThe ability of Achromobacter sp. KW1 strain to biodegrade isomers of chlorotoluene  ap. 2134-2141.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The isomers of chlorotoluene (2‐chlorotoluene, 3‐chlorotoluene and 4‐chlorotoluene) are considered to be toxic and to have a negative impact on humans and the environment. Therefore, issues related to their removal from the natural environment have become of increasing interest. RESULTS: The morphology of cells and colonies after long‐term metabolic stress was significantly modified. Metabolic stress is suggested to be a determinant of bacteria cell surface properties. The chlorine atom position in chlorotoluenes has a strong impact on cell surface modification. When the chlorine atom was at the ortho or para position, a large increase in hydrophobicity (from 40% to 73% and from 29% to 49%, respectively) and a decrease in the inner membrane permeability (from 0.31 to 0.24 µmol L⁻¹ min⁻¹ and from 0.52 to 0.13 µmol L⁻¹ min⁻¹) were observed. Moreover, Achromobacter sp. KW1 strain was found to exhibit good ability to degrade chlorotoluenes. The greatest difference in biodegradation between the stressed and non‐stressed strains was observed for the cultures grown on 4‐chlorotoluene and 3‐chlorotoluene. CONCLUSIONS: Both long‐term contact with hydrocarbons and the addition of surfactants demonstrated a beneficial effect on the biodegradation process. However, as a result of long‐term contact with hydrocarbons, the bacteria studied were able to degrade chlorotoluenes faster and more effectively. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchromobacter 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3achlorine 3ahydrocarbons 3ahydrophobicity 3aisomers 3amembrane permeability 3asurfactants 3atoxicity1 aSmułek, Wojciech1 aJesionowski, Teofil1 aKaczorek, Ewa0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2017 Aug., v. 92, no. 8 p.2134-2141dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.52213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011900173300001400292520137800306592002801684650002201712650002701734650001701761650002501778650001801803650001601821650002101837650001101858650002201869650002101891650001501912650002201927650001701949650002101966650002301987650000902010651001102019653003702030653007802067653004002145653004102185653001502226653002302241653001702264653002302281653001702304700002402321700002802345700003102373700001802404700002102422773010802443856008602551852000902637655001202646IND60543270720221118102206.0190410e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054327072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2015.01.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalloni, Caroline10aJaboticaba (Plinia trunciflora (O.

Jaboticaba, termed the Brazilian berry, has emerged as a new functional food with potential health benefits. Plinia trunciflora (O. Berg) Kausel is one of the main species of jaboticaba that is naturally occurring and cultivated in Brazil. Thus, this study aimed to determine the macronutrient and phenolic compositions of P. trunciflora pulp and peel. Additionally, jaboticaba peel extract (JPE) was evaluated for its in vitro antioxidant activity and its capacity to modulate oxidative stress as well as mitochondrial function in human lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5). The macronutrient found to have the highest level in both the peel and pulp was carbohydrates, followed by the high fiber content of the peel. The total phenolic compounds and anthocyanin levels were higher in the peel than in the pulp. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) showed the presence of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and kaempferol. Moreover, JPE was able to reduce the decreases in complex I activity and the ATP levels induced by H2O2 and thereby decreased the oxidative stress in MRC-5 cells. These findings show a new role for jaboticaba as a mitochondrial protectant in pathological conditions where mitochondrial dysfunction is involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlinia cauliflora 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3afiber content 3afibroblasts 3afunctional foods 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ain vitro studies 3akaempferol 3amass spectrometry 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3aphenolic compounds 3apulp 3aBrazil 0aKaempferol (PubChem CID 5280863) 0aCyanidin-3-O-glucoside (PubChem CID 197081) cyanidin (PubChem CID 128861) 0aHexadecanoic acid (PubChem CID 985) 0aOctadecanoic acid (PubChem CID 5281) 0aJaboticaba 0aPlinia trunciflora 0aAntioxidants 0aPhenolic compounds 0aMitochondria1 aAgnol, Rafaela Dall1 aMartínez, Luana Soares1 ade Siqueira Marcon, Fábio1 aMoura, Sidnei1 aSalvador, Mirian0 tFood research international.g2015 Apr., v. 70 p.15-22dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.01.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003300139245011600172300001800288500002000306520145500326592002801781650002901809650001201838650001201850650001301862650001601875650003001891650000901921650001401930650001401944650001101958650000701969650001101976650001401987650002002001650000902021650001302030650001202043651002402055700002402079700001802103773015002121856007302271852000902344655001202353IND60587394420221119215851.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058739442DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.52182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnagnostopoulos, Vasileios A10aSodium silicate treatment for the attenuation of U(VI) by iron‐bearing sediments in acidic groundwater plumes  ap. 1919-1927.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Anthropogenic activities, such as uranium mining and the nuclear industry, have resulted in groundwater contamination and the creation of uranium‐affected acidic plumes. In situ immobilization through base injection is a favorable way of uranium attenuation. The present study explores the use of sodium silicate for the restoration of neutral pH of the affected zone and consequently, uranium immobilization under circumneutral conditions. RESULTS: 70 mg L⁻¹ sodium silicate restored the pH of uranium bearing, acidic groundwater to neutral in batch experiments consisting of Savannah River Site (SRS) soil and the aqueous phase. SRS soil main components are quartz, kaolinite and goethite and the U(VI) removal was ∼60%. Identical experiments consisting only of quartz and kaolinite showed only 19% U(VI) removal. Binding of uranium may be improved by inner‐sphere complexation and is not affected by the presence of competitive cations, such as Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺. Recovery of uranium under acidic conditions (pH 3.5) was ∼60%, whereas sorption is not reversible under circumneutral conditions. CONCLUSION: Sodium silicate restores the pH of acidic groundwater systems to circumneutral conditions, where uranium retention by iron bearing sediments is favored. Goethite is the soil's most reactive phase and contributes to stronger binding of uranium through inner‐sphere complexation. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acalcium 3acations 3agoethite 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3airon 3akaolinite 3amagnesium 3amining 3apH 3aquartz 3asediments 3asodium silicate 3asoil 3asorption 3auranium 3aSavannah River Site1 aKatsenovich, Yelena1 aDenham, Miles0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2017 Aug., v. 92, no. 8 p.1919-1927dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.52183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001200155245014600167520162800313592002801941650002701969650001901996650001802015650002102033650002002054650002002074650001702094650001802111650001602129650002102145653002202166653002102188653002502209653002302234700005702257700001402314700001402328700001602342700001402358700001602372700001702388700001302405773009102418856009002509852000902599655001202608IND60782064420221121234057.0220830e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078206442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xue10aMixture effects of imidacloprid and difenconazole on enzymatic activity and gene expression in small yellow croakers (Larimichthys polyactis)  aAgrochemicals usually exist as mixtures in aqueous ecosystems and have harmful impacts on the natural environment. Nonetheless, the combined effects and underlying mechanisms of agrochemicals on aqueous organisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, the interactive effects of imidacloprid (IMI) and difenconazole (DIF) on the embryos of small yellow croakers (Larimichthys polyactis) were assessed using various toxicological assays, including acute toxicity, enzymatic activity, and gene expression changes. The results showed that DIF (72-h LC₅₀ value of 0.20 mg L⁻¹) had higher toxicity than IMI (72-h LC₅₀ value of 12.5 mgL⁻¹). Simultaneously, combinations of IMI and DIF exerted synergistic acute effects on the embryos of L. polyactis. In addition, the SOD, CAT, GST, and CarE activities were noticeably altered in most single and mixed exposures, relative to the untreated control. The expression of four genes (cyp19a1b, ngln2, klf2a, and socs3a) related to the immune system, endocrine system, and neurodevelopment was also surprisingly altered when the embryos of L. polyactis were subjected to individual and combined exposures relative to the untreated control. Changes in enzymatic activity and gene expression might provide early warning indices for the identification of agrochemical co-exposure. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the comprehensive toxicity of agrochemical mixtures to L. polyactis. Further studies on the long-term effects of agrochemical mixtures on marine fish should be conducted to formulate definitive conclusions concerning hazards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarimichthys polyactis 3aacute toxicity 3aagrochemicals 3aendocrine system 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3aimidacloprid 3aimmune system 3amarine fish 3aneurodevelopment 0aMarine toxicology 0aToxic mechanisms 0aAgrochemical mixture 0aSynergistic effect1 aHan, Mingming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5045-72741 aZhan, Wei1 aLiu, Feng1 aGuo, Dandan1 aZhang, Yu1 aLiang, Xiao1 aWang, Yanhua1 aLou, Bao0 tChemosphere.g2022 Nov., v. 306 p.135551-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04388naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245013200198300001600330500002000346520254500366592002802911650001502939650004102954650001802995650001703013650002303030650002303053650002403076650002703100650001503127650001903142650001803161650002603179650000903205650001403214650001303228650002203241650001303263700001603276700002603292700002003318700001803338700001703356700002003373700002603393700001803419700002103437700001403458700001803472700001703490700001903507700002003526700001903546773012603565856007403691852000903765655001203774IND60776581020221120111240.0220507e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077658102DNAL7 a10.1111/zph.129162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFanelli, Angela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8204-123010aSensitivity of an international notification system for wildlife diseases: A case study using the OIE‐WAHIS data on tularemia  ap. 286-294.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) has recently developed a Wildlife Health Framework to respond to the need of members to manage the risk from emerging diseases at the animal–human–ecosystem interface. One of its objectives is to improve surveillance systems, early detection and notification of wildlife diseases. Members share information on disease occurrence by reporting through the OIE World Animal Health Information System (OIE‐WAHIS—formerly known as ‘WAHIS’). To evaluate the capacity of a surveillance system to detect disease events, it is important to quantify the gap between all known events and those officially notified to the OIE. This study used capture–recapture analysis to estimate the sensitivity of the OIE‐WAHIS system for a OIE‐listed wildlife disease by comparing information from publicly available sources to identify undetected events. This article presents a case study of the occurrence of tularemia in lagomorphs among selected North American and European countries during the period 2014–2019. First, an analysis using three data sources (OIE‐WAHIS, ProMED, WHO‐EIOS [Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources]) was conducted. Subsequent analysis then explored the model integrating information from a fourth source (scientific literature collected in PubMed). Two models were built to evaluate both the sensitivity of the OIE‐WAHIS using media reports (ProMED and WHO‐EIOS), which is likely to represent current closer to real‐time events, and published scientific data, which is more useful for retrospective analysis. Using the three‐source approach, the predicted number of tularemia events was 93 (95% CI: 75–114), with an OIE‐WAHIS sensitivity of 90%. In the four‐source approach, the number of predicted events increased to 120 (95% CI: 99–143), dropping the sensitivity of the OIE‐WAHIS to 70%. The results indicate a good sensitivity of the OIE‐WAHIS system using the three‐source approach, but lower sensitivity when including information from the scientific literature. Further analysis should be undertaken to identify diseases and regions for which international reporting presents a low sensitivity. This will enable evaluation and prioritization of underreported OIE‐listed wildlife diseases and identify areas of focus as part of the Wildlife Health Framework. This study also highlights the need for stronger collaborations between academia and National Veterinary Services to enhance surveillance systems for notifiable diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLagomorpha 3aWorld Organization for Animal Health 3aanimal health 3acase studies 3adisease occurrence 3ahealth information 3ainformation systems 3amark-recapture studies 3amonitoring 3aprioritization 3apublic health 3aretrospective studies 3arisk 3atularemia 3awildlife 3awildlife diseases 3azoonoses1 aAwada, Lina1 aCaceres‐Soto, Paula1 aDiaz, François1 aGrillo, Tiggy1 aGizo, Itlala1 aHamilton, Keith1 aRolez, Christine Leon1 aMelens, Peter1 aMorales, Roberta1 aMur, Lina1 aMuset, Sophie1 aNake, Lorenz1 aThompson, Lesa1 aWannous, Chadia1 aTizzani, Paolo0 tZoonoses and public health.g2022 June, v. 69, no. 4 p.286-294dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58703x1863-19597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/zph.129163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245006500166300001600231500001900247520129200266592002801558650001901586650000901605650001701614650002001631653002001651653002301671653002701694653001901721653002001740700002201760700003301782700002201815700002801837773010201865856007801967852000902045655001202054IND60719716520221120094004.0210213e20201216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071971652DNAL7 a10.1515/bot-2020-00282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEndoma, Leonilo F.10aPhoto-bleached agar extracts from Gracilariopsis heteroclada  ap. 559-569.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAgar is a strongly gelling polysaccharide extracted from gracilarioids, which is processed through conventional alkaline pre-treatment and chemical bleaching. However, the use of chemical bleaching agents has associated health risks to humans and the environment. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of photo-bleaching in combination with NaOH pre-treatments at 5, 10 and 15% concentrations on the physico-chemical properties of agar extracted from Gracilariopsis heteroclada. The results highlighted that the gel strength of photo-bleached agar extracts PBA-15 (1822.00 g cm⁻²), PBA-10 (1465.60 g cm⁻²), and PBA-5 (1067.70 g cm⁻²) were significantly higher than in either a commercially sourced agar reference sample (756.20 g cm⁻²) or a chemically bleached agar (390.94 g cm⁻²). The physico-chemical properties of PBA extracts fell within the acceptable limits of food-grade agar. Photo-bleached agar extracts (PBA-5, PBA-10, PBA-15) also exhibited a higher lightness (L*) and whiteness index (WI) which makes these agars ideal for microbiological use. This study demonstrated that photo-bleaching by solar irradiation improved the physico-chemical properties of agar from G. heteroclada without the use of a chemical bleaching agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGracilariopsis 3aagar 3agel strength 3asolar radiation 0aagar extraction 0achemical bleaching 0achemical pre-treatment 0adecolorization 0aphoto-bleaching1 aNuñal, Sharon N.1 aTraifalgar, Rex Ferdinand M.1 aNacional, Loda M.1 aLuhan, Maria Rovilla J.0 tBotanica marina.g2020 Dec. 16, v. 63, no. 6 p.559-569dDe GruyterwJournal:1930x1437-43237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/bot-2020-00283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03577naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245019800168300001300366520175900379592002802138650002602166650001702192650001602209650001802225650001902243650001602262650001002278650002602288650001902314650001802333650001702351650001002368650001002378650001602388650001102404650000902415650001302424650001302437650001502450650001302465650001102478650003502489650001602524650001402540651001802554653002902572653000802601653001502609653001802624653001902642653001502661653001402676653001702690700001902707773013402726856008202860852000902942655001202951IND60622112120221117170456.0181123e199902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062211212DNAL7 a10.1177/1082013299005001012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 adel Valle, J.M.10aRevision: Extracción con CO2 a alta presión.

Fundamentals and applications in the food industry  ap. 1-24.  aSupercritical extraction (SFE) is a unit operation that exploits the dissolving power of supercritical fluids (SF) under conditions above their critical temperature and pressure. It is possible to obtain solvent-free extracts using SF and the extraction is faster than using conventional organic solvents. These advantages are due to the high volatility of SF (gases under normal environmental conditions) and improved transport properties (i.e., high diffusivity and low viscosity). When using carbon diox ide (CO,) in particular, moderate-temperature processing and high selectivity towards valuable microconstituents in natural products can be achieved. This article presents a review of transport properties and solubilities in SF, particularly CO₂, as well as other underlying factors that are respon sible for the kinetics and phase equilibrium in SFE processes. It also describes the selective CO ₂ ex traction of essential oils, pungent principles, carotenoid pigments, antioxidants, antimicrobials, and related substances to be used as ingredients for the food, drug and perfume industries, from spices, herbs and other plant materials. These very important applications are discussed from the point of view of the potential applications of SFE in Latin America. The two most important commercial ap plications of SFE in the food industry, namely hop extraction and coffee decaffeination, are reviewed to a limited extent. Some other potential applications briefly described include extraction and frac tionation of edible fats and oils, purification of solid matrices, and concentration of fermentation broths, fruit juices and other extracts. In most cases CO₂ extracts are compared with counterparts obtained using conventional methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-infective agents 3aantioxidants 3acarotenoids 3aculture media 3adecaffeination 3adiffusivity 3adrugs 3aenvironmental factors 3aessential oils 3afood industry 3afruit juices 3agases 3aherbs 3aingredients 3alipids 3aoils 3aperfumes 3apigments 3asolubility 3asolvents 3aspices 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3aLatin America 0asupercritical extraction 0aCO2 0asolubility 0amass transfer 0aessential oils 0aoleoresins 0acolorants 0aantioxidants1 aAguilera, J.M.0 tFood science and technology international.g1999 Feb., v. 5, no. 1 p.1-24dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1082013299005001013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245010600174520136300280592002801643650002801671650001801699650001801717650001801735650003501753650002501788650002001813650001701833650001101850650001301861650002701874650001701901650001501918650001101933650001901944650000701963650001301970650001901983650002002002650000802022650001202030653001802042653002502060653001402085653001502099700002502114700003402139700002402173700002302197700002902220773012202249856008102371852000902452655001202461IND60688768820221118011317.0210114e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068876882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1093872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVicente-Magueyal, F.J.10aNovel process to obtain agave sap (aguamiel) by directed enzymatic hydrolysis of agave juice fructans  aKluyveromyces marxianus and Saccharomyces paradoxus, which are the native microorganisms found in aguamiel, were used successfully for exo- and endo-fructanase synthesis to hydrolyze agave fructans important in agave sap production. We studied culture media for enzyme synthesis, as well as the physicochemical properties and enzyme activity, and we optimized the bioprocess parameters and the enzyme extract mixture to maximize agave fructan hydrolysis. The results showed that the best culture medium for fructanase synthesis contained 14.0, 20.0, and 1.0 (g-L⁻¹) of sucrose, peptone, and K2HPO4, respectively. The best enzyme-to-substrate ratio for agave juice containing 90 g-L⁻¹ of fructans was 10:1. Under constant operating conditions of 45.25 °C, 65.47 rpm, and pH 4.28, a product with 93.62 g-L⁻¹of total reducing sugars (TRS) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) with a polymerization degree (PD) from 3 to 10 hexose units was obtained using a mixture of 98.4% K. marxianus and 1.6% S. paradoxus enzyme extracts. The resulting agave sap preserves the natural flavor and tastes closest to natural agave sap (aguamiel); hence, the results show, for the first time, a resolution of the technical challenge for stable agave sap production and confirm the importance of using native strains to evolve from spontaneous to directed fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKluyveromyces marxianus 3aSaccharomyces 3abioprocessing 3aculture media 3adipotassium hydrogen phosphate 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme activity 3afermentation 3aflavor 3afructans 3afructooligosaccharides 3aglycosidases 3ahydrolysis 3ajuices 3amicroorganisms 3apH 3apeptones 3apolymerization 3areducing sugars 3asap 3asucrose 0aAgave fructan 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aAgave sap 0aProduction1 aBautista-Méndez, A.1 aVillanueva-Tierrablanca, H.D.1 aGarcía-Ruíz, J.L.1 aJiménez-Islas, H.1 aNavarrete-Bolaños, J.L.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 June, v. 127 p.109387-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1093873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02034naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245005900167300001800226520091400244592002801158650002901186650001201215650002301227650001401250650002201264650001701286653001701303653001801320653002001338653001701358653002201375700002401397773015601421856008601577852000901663655001201672IND60539269020221119231412.0190215e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053926902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2014.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Haifeng10aSynthetic therapeutic gene circuits in mammalian cells  ap. 2537-2544.  aIn the emerging field of synthetic biology, scientists are focusing on designing and creating functional devices, systems, and organisms with novel functions by engineering and assembling standardised biological building blocks.

Objectives were to identify winter crops and associated characteristics with bioassay potential. Saint Joseph and Bossier City, LA experiments used randomized complete block designs with factorial N fertilizer and winter crop treatment arrangements. Nitrogen rates were applied to corn (Zea mays L.) in 2004. Unfertilized winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), cereal rye (Secale cereale L.), native winter vegetation, and weed-free winter fallow treatments followed corn. At Saint Joseph, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) followed winter crop treatments. Greater corn N rate consistently increased winter crop biomass and N accumulation, suggesting potential as bioassays, and increased Saint Joseph seedcotton yield. Winter crop-seedcotton yield N-response relationships were non-significant by familywise error rate criteria. However, some winter crop characteristics, such as rye N accumulation, for which a relationship to seedcotton yield closely approached significance, may merit further research as soil N-supplying capacity bioassays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aSecale cereale 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3abioassays 3abiomass 3acorn 3acotton 3acrops 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3arye 3asoil 3avegetation 3awinter wheat 0anitrogen 0asoil/media testing procedures 0asoil fertility1 aMascagni, H.

This lack of a mechanistic understanding of HBV-specific immunity is also caused by a limited number of suitable animal models. Here, we describe the generation of a recombinant adenovirus expressing an HBV 1.3-overlength genome linked to luciferase (Ad-HBV-Luc) allowing for precise analysis of the quantity of infected hepatocytes. This enables sensitive and close-meshed monitoring of HBV-specific CD8 T cells and the onset of anti-viral immunity in mice. A high dose of Ad-HBV-Luc developed into chronic hepatitis B accompanied by dysfunctional CD8 T cells characterized by high expression of PD1 and TOX and low expression of KLRG1 and GzmB. In contrast, a low dose of Ad-HBV-Luc infection resulted in acute hepatitis with CD8 T cell-mediated elimination of HBV-replicating hepatocytes associated with elevated sALT levels and increased numbers of cytotoxic HBV-specific CD8 T cells. Thus, the infectious dose was a critical factor to induce either acute self-limited or chronic HBV infection in mice. Taken together, the new Ad-HBV-Luc vector will allow for highly sensitive and time-resolved analysis of HBV-specific immune responses during acute and chronic infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aHepatitis B virus 3abioluminescence 3achronic hepatitis B 3acytotoxicity 3agenome 3ahepatocytes 3aluciferase1 aSchneider, Annika 1 aKo, Chunkyu 1 aKnolle, Percy A.1 aSteiger, Katja 1 aProtzer, Ulrike 1 aWohlleber, Dirk 0 tViruses.g2021 Nov. 13, v. 13, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131122733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012000169300001800289520068800307592002800995650003301023650003701056650001201093650002101105650001301126650002001139650002401159650002201183650000901205650002001214650001101234653000801245653000801253653001001261653001101271653000901282653001001291653000901301653000801310653000901318653001201327653000901339653000901348653000801357653000601365653005101371653005101422653000801473653003601481653002001517653002101537700002301558700001901581700002301600700002201623773015601645856008601801852000901887655001201896IND60539269120221119231251.0190215e20140627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053926912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2014.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalto, Rafael10aActivation of ERK by sodium tungstate induces protein synthesis and prevents protein degradation in rat L6 myotubes  ap. 2246-2254.  aThe balance between the rates of protein synthesis and degradation in muscle is regulated by PI3K/Akt signaling. Here we addressed the effect of ERK activation by sodium tungstate on protein turnover in rat L6 myotubes. Phosphorylation of ERK by this compound increased protein synthesis by activating MTOR and prevented dexamethasone-induced protein degradation by blocking FoxO3a activity, but it did not alter Akt phosphorylation. Thus, activation of ERK by tungstate improves protein turnover in dexamethasone-treated cells. On the basis of our results, we propose that tungstate be considered an alternative to IGF-I and its analogs in the prevention of skeletal muscle atrophy.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3amyotubes 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein degradation 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3askeletal muscle 3asodium 0aDEX 0aERK 0aeIF4E 0a4E-BP1 0aFoxO 0aIGF-I 0aMTOR 0aMEK 0aPI3K 0aPKB/Akt 0aS6K1 0aTSC2 0aUbC 0aW 0aExtracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 0aForkhead box O Family of Transcription Factors 0aLC3 0aMechanistic target of rapamycin 0aSkeletal muscle 0aSodium tungstate1 aVílchez, José D.1 aCabrera, Elena1 aGuinovart, Joan J.1 aGirón, María D.0 tFEBS letters.g2014 June 27, v. 588, no. 14 p.2246-2254dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2014.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01820naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011800173300001600291520067700307592002800984650001801012650001301030650001001043650001501053650001601068650001101084651002101095653001301116653002801129700001901157700002001176700001801196700001901214773011901233856008501352852000901437655001201446IND60682605820221122070913.0200130e20191002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068260582DNAL7 a10.1080/09397140.2019.16484022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇiçek, Erdoğan10aKnipowitschia ephesi Ahnelt, 1995, a junior synonym of Gobius ricasolii Di Caporiacco, 1935 (Teleostei: Gobiidae)  ap. 330-335.  aGobius ricasolii was described in 1935 by Di Caporiacco from the lower Küçük Menderes River drainage in Turkey.

We examined grazing pressure by conducting transect surveys and acquiring aerial images by drone before and after the arrival of migratory birds along the Asadokoro tide flats, Aomori Prefecture, Japan. The distribution and biomass of the seagrass Zostera japonica decreased sharply between October and November 2018, which was when migrating waterfowl arrived. We hypothesized that grazing pressure by migrating birds such as the Anatidae, including whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) and brent geese (Branta bernicla), had a major effect on the decline in Z. japonica in late October. Shortly after the Anatidae arrived, most of the Z. japonica in the shallows disappeared, including the belowground parts. The abundance of Z. japonica in this area was insufficient to support wintering swans. Swans likely need food other than Z. japonica for overwintering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBranta bernicla 3aCygnus cygnus 3aJapan 3aZostera 3abiomass 3amigratory behavior 3aoverwintering 3aseagrasses 3awaterfowl 0adrone 0agrazing 0aherbivorous birds 0aunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)1 aTanaka, Satoshi1 aKirihara, Shinji1 aTanaka, Yoshiyuki0 tBotanica marina.g2020 Dec. 16, v. 63, no. 6 p.521-525dDe GruyterwJournal:1930x1437-43237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/bot-2020-00453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245010500208300001800313520133300331592002801664650001301692650001101705650001401716650001101730650000901741650002401750650001801774650002301792650002201815650001901837650002301856650001401879650001101893650001101904650001701915700001701932700002301949773013601972856008002108852000902188655001202197IND60606114720221118025126.0180724e20180320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060611472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b006512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDal Forno, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9869-730610aMaterial, Size, and Environment Dependence of Plasmon-Induced Hot Carriers in Metallic Nanoparticles  ap. 8517-8527.  aHarnessing hot electrons and holes resulting from the decay of localized surface plasmons in nanomaterials has recently led to new devices for photovoltaics, photocatalysis, and optoelectronics. Properties of hot carriers are highly tunable, and in this work, we investigate their dependence on the material, size, and environment of spherical metallic nanoparticles. In particular, we carry out theoretical calculations of hot carrier generation rates and energy distributions for six different plasmonic materials (Na, K, Al, Cu, Ag, and Au). The plasmon decay into hot electron–hole pairs is described via Fermi’s golden rule using the quasistatic approximation for optical properties and a spherical well potential for the electronic structure. We present results for nanoparticles with diameters up to 40 nm, which are embedded in different dielectric media. We find that small nanoparticles with diameters of 16 nm or less in media with large dielectric constants produce most hot carriers. Among the different materials, Na, K, and Au generate most hot carriers. We also investigate hot carrier-induced water splitting and find that simple-metal nanoparticles are useful for initiating the hydrogen evolution reaction, whereas transition-metal nanoparticles produce dominantly holes for the oxygen evolution reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acopper 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3agold 3ahydrogen production 3ananoparticles 3aoptical properties 3aoxygen production 3aphotocatalysis 3aphysical chemistry 3apotassium 3asilver 3asodium 3asolar energy1 aRanno, Luigi1 aLischner, Johannes0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Mar. 20, v. 122, no. 15 p.8517-8527dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b006513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005600155245014600211300001600357520093300373592002801306650002401334650001301358650001301371650001301384650002501397653001401422653002201436653002601458653001201484700001901496700005501515700001601570700001501586700001901601773009101620856009001711852000901801655001201810IND60644332320221123005044.0190606e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064433232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2019.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Helezi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4802-706110aHybrid three-dimensional graphene fillers and graphite platelets to improve the thermal conductivity and wear performance of epoxy composites  ap. 270-277.  aBased on our recent work on the three-dimensional graphene fillers (3DGF) reinforced epoxy (EP) composite, here commercially available graphite platelets (GP) were incorporated together with 3DGF to modify EP in order to further improve the thermal conduction and wear resistance of the EP composites. Remarkably, only 0.14 vol% 3DGF was needed to enhance the thermal conduction of EP by 170%, in contrast with the fact that 37 times content of graphite fillers were required to achieve almost the same enhancement. Moreover, in the presence of both 5.38 vol% GP and 0.14 vol% 3DGF, the thermal conductivity of EP was further enhanced by 258%. Meanwhile, the tribological test results revealed the advantage of 3DGF over GP. The ternary EP composite modified with both 0.28 vol% of 3DGF and 5.38 vol% GP had much lower specific wear rate and coefficient of friction than those binary composites with either 3DGF or GP.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3aepoxides 3afriction 3agraphene 3athermal conductivity 0aA.

In this study, we report the identification and characterization of CNVs from the whole-genome resequencing data of two northernmost cattle breeds from Russia: the Yakut and Kholmogory cattle and their phylogenetically most related breeds, Hanwoo and Holstein, respectively. Comparisons of the CNV regions (CNVRs) among the breeds led to the identification of breed-specific CNVRs shared by cold-adapted Kholmogory and Yakut cattle. An investigation of their overlap with genes, regulatory domains, conserved non-coding elements (CNEs), enhancers, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) was performed to further explore breed-specific biology and adaptations. We found CNVRs enriched for gene ontology terms related to adaptation to environments in both the Kholmogory and Yakut breeds and related to thermoregulation specifically in Yakut cattle. Interestingly, the latter has also been supported when exploring the enrichment of breed-specific CNVRs in the regulatory domains and enhancers, CNEs, and QTLs implying the potential contribution of CNVR to the Yakut and Kholmogory cattle breeds’ adaptation to a harsh environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aRussia 3acattle 3agene ontology 3agenomics 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative traits 3athermoregulation1 aYudin, Nikolay S.1 aLarkin, Denis M.0 tGenes.g2022 Sept. 06, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes130915953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245008800166300001400254520128700268592002801555650001701583650002201600650001901622650001601641650002001657650002101677650001901698650000801717650002001725650001701745650001201762650001001774650002001784650001101804700002101815700002101836773012701857856007701984852000902061655001202070IND60765406720221123024303.0220419e20170130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076540672DNAL7 a10.17221/69/2016-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvana, Tomášková10aNeedle water potential of selected pine species during the off-season: A case study  ap. 16-21.  aIn this study we investigated the needle water potential of different pine species using a pressure chamber during winter months.

The reason why the needle water potential reflects air T and is negatively correlated with the global radiation in winter will be an objective of our future investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus cembra 3aPinus heldreichii 3aPinus jeffreyi 3aPinus nigra 3aPinus ponderosa 3aPinus sylvestris 3aPinus uncinata 3aair 3aair temperature 3acase studies 3aforests 3atrees 3awater potential 3awinter1 aJan, Vítámvás1 aVáclav, Bažant0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 63, no. 1 p.16-21dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/69/2016-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245030100167300001400468520110800482592002801590650002201618650002201640650001201662650001401674650001001688650001001698650001601708650002101724650000701745650002201752650002401774650001701798650001301815650001901828653001801847653001001865653001701875653001201892653001301904653002201917700001501939700002001954773013501974856008202109852000902191655001202200IND60622112520221117170631.0181123e199902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062211252DNAL7 a10.1177/1082013299005001052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastañón, X.10aEffect of storage temperature on the microbial and color stability of banana purée with addition of vanillin or potassium sorbate / Efecto de la temperatura de almacenamiento en la estabilidad microbiológica y en el color del puré de plátano con la adición de vainillina o sorbato de potasio  ap. 51-58.  aThe microbial and color changes during storage at different temperatures (15, 25 and 35 °C) of ba nana purée preserved by the combination of a blanching, reduced pH (3.4) and water activity (a w, 0.97) and the addition of 1000 or 3000 ppm of vanillin (VA) or 1000 ppm potassium sorbate (PS) were evaluated and compared. The use of 3000 ppm VA or 1000 ppm PS inhibited for at least 60 days of storage the native flora of the banana purée at any of the temperatures studied. The addition of 1000 ppm VA was not enough to stop the microbial growth. However, at 15 °C the growth was delayed 16 days. In the presence of 3000 ppm VA or 1000 ppm PS the banana purée stored at 15, 25 and 35 °C presented several color changes that contributed to browning. The rate of browning was greater in samples with VA than in those formulated with PS, but the activation energy was 10% lower in the former systems. An analysis of the transition state parameters revealed that Gibbs free energy was similar, indicating that the mechanism of browning did not change in the presence of one antimicro bial or the other.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aactivation energy 3abananas 3ablanching 3acolor 3aflora 3afruit puree 3amicrobial growth 3apH 3apotassium sorbate 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3avanillin 3awater activity 0abanana purée 0acolor 0apreservation 0astorage 0avanillin 0apotassium sorbate1 aArgaiz, A.1 aLópez-Malo, A.0 tFood science and technology international.g1999 Feb., v. 5, no. 1 p.51-58dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1082013299005001053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245009600163300001800259520157900277592002801856650001401884650002701898650002001925650001001945650001101955650001301966650001301979650001901992650001302011650001202024650001702036650002902053653002102082653000902103653000902112653002102121700001702142700001202159773015602171856008602327852000902413655001202422IND60539269520221119231028.0190215e20140819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053926952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2014.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Min10aRestoring the tumour suppressive function of p53 as a parallel strategy in melanoma therapy  ap. 2616-2621.  aThe tumour suppressor p53 is a master sensor of stress and it controls the expression of hundreds to thousands of genes with diverse biological functions including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence. Consequently p53 is the most mutated gene found in human cancer and p53 mutation rate varies from 5% to 95%. Importantly p53 activity is often inactivated in tumours expressing structurally wild type p53. Thus one of the major challenges in cancer research is to restore the tumour suppressive function of p53. Intensive studies in the past decade have demonstrated that in addition to mutation, p53 activities are largely regulated by cellular factors that control the expression level and/or transcriptional activities of p53. MDM2, MDM4, p14ARF and the ASPP family of proteins are among the most studied regulators of p53. With increased understanding of the complexity of p53 regulation, various p53 reactivating approaches are being developed. This review will focus on the recent understanding of p53 inactivation in melanoma and the approaches to reactivate p53 in preclinical studies. Recent success in the therapeutic targeting of the BRAFV600E oncogenic protein was accompanied with subsequent relapse caused by acquired drug resistance. Restoration of the tumour suppressive function of p53 presents a parallel cancer therapeutic opportunity alongside BRAFV600E inhibition. Thus targeted therapy and concurrent reactivation of p53 may be a fertile ground to achieve synergistic killing of the 50% of cancer cells that express structurally wild type p53.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle checkpoints 3adrug resistance 3agenes 3ahumans 3amelanoma 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3aproteins 3arelapse 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 0ap53 reactivation 0aASPP 0aMDM2 0aMelanoma therapy1 aMiller, Paul1 aLu, Xin0 tFEBS letters.g2014 Aug. 19, v. 588, no. 16 p.2616-2621dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2014.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245012000156520158500276592002801861650001301889650002901902650001301931650001301944650001201957650001101969650001401980650002301994650002402017650001402041650001802055650001502073650001402088700001902102700001602121700001902137700001902156773012002175856007802295852000902373655001202382IND60794209620221121015011.0220922e20220907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079420962DNAL7 a10.3390/genes130916002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Qi 10aGermplasm Enhancement and Identification of Loci Conferring Resistance against Plasmodiophora brassicae in Broccoli  aIn order to breed broccoli and other Brassica materials to be highly resistant to clubroot disease, 41 Brassicaceae varieties were developed and identified between 2020 and 2021. Seven known clubroot genes were used for screening these materials. In addition, the resistant and susceptible broccoli cultivars were designed for observing their differences in the infection process with Plasmodiophora brassicae. The results showed that 90% of total materials had carried more than two clubroot resistance genes: one material carried two disease resistance genes, four materials carried seven genes for clubroot resistance, two materials carried six genes for clubroot resistance, and in total 32% of these materials carried five genes for clubroot resistance. As a result, several new genotypes of Brassicaceae germplasm were firstly created and obtained based on distant hybridization and identification of loci conferring resistance against Plasmodiophora brassicae in this study. We found and revealed that similar infection models of Plasmodiophora brassicae occurred in susceptible and resistant cultivars of broccoli, but differences in infection efficiency of Plasmodiophora brassicae also existed in both materials. For resistant broccoli plants, a small number of conidia formed in the root hair, and only a few spores could enter the cortex without forming sporangia while sporangia could form in susceptible plants. Our study could provide critical Brassica materials for breeding resistant varieties and new insight into understanding the mechanism of plant resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica 3aPlasmodiophora brassicae 3abroccoli 3aclubroot 3aconidia 3acortex 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3agenetic improvement 3agermplasm 3ahybridization 3aroot hairs 3asporangia1 aWei, Xiaochun 1 aLiu, Yumei 1 aHan, Fengqing 1 aLi, Zhansheng 0 tGenes.g2022 Sept. 07, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes130916003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010100171300001600272500001500288520153900303592002801842650001301870650003001883650002401913650001001937650001701947650001401964650002901978650002602007650001302033650001802046650002402064650001702088650001102105650001302116650001102129650001402140650002402154650002902178650003802207650000702245650001202252653001302264700001802277773011302295856008402408852000902492655001202501IND60112770920221117061216.0141111e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011277092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshida, Satoshi10aIdentification and characterization of genes related to the production of organic acids in yeast  ap. 556-561.  a2019-12-04  aOrganic acids contribute to the flavor of many foods and drinks including alcoholic beverages. To study the cellular processes affecting organic acid production, here we screened collections of Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion mutants and identified 36 yeast mutants forming a yellow halo on YPD plates containing bromocresol purple, indicating that the pH of the medium had been lowered. The disrupted genes encoded TCA cycle enzymes, transcription factors, signal transducers, and ubiquitin-related proteins. Acetate, pyruvate, and succinate are produced by yeast fermentation in rich medium, and their production was affected by mutations of the genes GTR1, GTR2, LIP5, LSM1, PHO85, PLM2, RTG1, RTG2 and UBP3, and also succinate dehydrogenase-related genes including EMI5, SDH1, SDH2, SDH4, TCM62 and YDR379C-A. Among the genes identified, overexpression of only LIP5 affected the production of acetate in S. cerevisiae. However, overexpression of EMI5, LIP5, RTG2 and UBP3 had a significant effect on the production of acetate, citrate, lactate, and succinate in the bottom-fermenting yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus. Furthermore, phenotypic analysis of the S. cerevisiae disruptants involved in organic acid production showed that azaserine, citrate, ethionine, and sulfite are useful compounds by which mutants with altered organic acid production might be selected. Taken together, these results suggest that the regulation of many organic acids might be simultaneously achieved by activation or inactivation of a single gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aSaccharomyces pastorianus 3asignal transduction 3agenes 3afermentation 3aethionine 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3atranscription factors 3acitrates 3asuccinic acid 3agene overexpression 3apyruvic acid 3ayeasts 3amutation 3aflavor 3aazaserine 3aalcoholic beverages 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3apH 3amutants 0aproteins1 aYokoyama, Aki0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2012 May, v. 113, no. 5 p.556-561dElsevier B.V.x1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012800167300001800295520156100313592002801874650002501902650001601927650003001943650001901973650002001992650001802012650001702030650001202047650001502059650002602074650002202100650002102122650001802143650002502161700001302186700001602199700001802215700001602233700001802249700002402267773011002291856008602401852000902487655001202496IND60530440120221123030940.0160721e20160202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053044012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b044052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiaojun10aCapillary Electrophoresis–Mass Spectrometry for the Analysis of Heparin Oligosaccharides and Low Molecular Weight Heparin  ap. 1937-1943.  aHeparins, highly sulfated, linear polysaccharides also known as glycosaminoglycans, are among the most challenging biopolymers to analyze. Hyphenated techniques in conjunction with mass spectrometry (MS) offer rapid analysis of complex glycosaminoglycan mixtures, providing detailed structural and quantitative data. Previous analytical approaches have often relied on liquid chromatography (LC)–MS, and some have limitations including long separation times, low resolution of oligosaccharide mixtures, incompatibility of eluents, and often require oligosaccharide derivatization. This study examines the analysis of glycosaminoglycan oligosaccharides using a novel electrokinetic pump-based capillary electrophoresis (CE)–MS interface. CE separation and electrospray were optimized using a volatile ammonium bicarbonate electrolyte and a methanol–formic acid sheath fluid. The online analyses of highly sulfated heparin oligosaccharides, ranging from disaccharides to low molecular weight heparins, were performed within a 10 min time frame, offering an opportunity for higher-throughput analysis. Disaccharide compositional analysis as well as top-down analysis of low molecular weight heparin was demonstrated. Using normal polarity CE separation and positive-ion electrospray ionization MS, excellent run-to-run reproducibility (relative standard deviation of 3.6–5.1% for peak area and 0.2–0.4% for peak migration time) and sensitivity (limit of quantification of 2.0–5.9 ng/mL and limit of detection of 0.6–1.8 ng/mL) could be achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium bicarbonate 3abiopolymers 3acapillary electrophoresis 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3adisaccharides 3aelectrolytes 3aheparin 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3arapid methods 3astatistical analysis1 aLin, Lei1 aLiu, Xinyue1 aZhang, Fuming1 aChi, Lianli1 aXia, Qiangwei1 aLinhardt, Robert J.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Feb. 02, v. 88, no. 3 p.1937-1943dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b044053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245006300202300001800265506007600283520146200359592002801821506003701849650001701886650001201903650001501915650002101930650002201951650000901973650001301982650002501995650002002020650001902040650002102059650001302080650001502093650002602108650001202134650002702146653001202173653002002185653001502205653002002220653001602240653001102256653001202267700001402279700001602293700001802309773011802327856007502445852000902520655001202529IND60567939020221207074913.0170501e20120203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056793902DNAL7 a10.1021/pr20089722doi7 aPMC32741732pmcid7 a221032982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKantardzhieva, A.10aProtein Composition of Immunoprecipitated Synaptic Ribbons  ap. 1163-1174.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe synaptic ribbon is an electron-dense structure found in hair cells and photoreceptors. The ribbon is surrounded by neurotransmitter-filled vesicles and considered to play a role in vesicle release. We generated an objective, quantitative analysis of the protein composition of the ribbon complex using a mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis. Our use of affinity-purified ribbons and control IgG immunoprecipitations ensure that the identified proteins are indeed associated with the ribbon complex. The use of mouse tissue, where the proteome is complete, generated a comprehensive analysis of the candidates. We identified 30 proteins (comprising 56 isoforms and subunits) associated with the ribbon complex. The ribbon complex primarily comprises proteins found in conventional synapses, which we categorized into 6 functional groups: vesicle handling (38.5%), scaffold (7.3%), cytoskeletal molecules (20.6%), phosphorylation enzymes (10.6%), molecular chaperones (8.2%), and transmembrane proteins from the presynaptic membrane firmly attached to the ribbon (11.3%). The 3 CtBP isoforms represent the major protein in the ribbon whether calculated by molar amount (30%) or by mass (20%). The relatively high quantity of phosphorylation enzymes suggests a very active and regulated structure.

The WRKY gene family has been found in many higher plants, while little is known about WRKY-encoding genes in ginseng. As a traditional and important economic medicinal herb and health food, ginseng has been a model species for other related medicinal plants. Here, we analyze the WRKY transcript factor gene family in ginseng from a genetics and genomics perspective in the hope that this study can create a new avenue for understanding the role of PgWRKYs. By identifying and analyzing all candidate WRKY transcription factor family members based on the transcriptome of ginseng, a total of 118 PgWRKY genes was obtained following gene classification, the phylogenetic relationship, conserved domain structure, functional differentiation, and an expression activity analysis. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the PgWRKYs were clustered into three groups: I, II, and III transcription factors. Members in group Ⅱ were further divided into five sub-groups: Ⅱa to Ⅱe. An expression analysis showed a trend of co-expression among most PgWRKY genes, forming an interaction network. The coding sequences were WRKYGQK; only two genes were WRKYGKK, and only one gene was WSKYGQK. Moreover, a salt stress treatment analysis of the response of PgWRKY39-01, PgWRKY062, and PgWRKY064 genes was investigated using RT-qPCR. After salt stress treatment, the expression of three PgWRKY genes was increased, indicating that PgWRKYs can participate in regulating the response to salt stresses in ginseng. These comprehensive data provide a reference for elucidating the functions of this transcription factor family in the growth, development, and salt stress response of ginseng.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax ginseng 3agenes 3agenomics 3agrowth and development 3ahealth foods 3amedicinal plants 3aphylogeny 3asalt stress 3astress response 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome1 aYu, En 1 aHou, Lihe 1 aHua, Panpan 1 aZhao, Mingzhu 1 aWang, Yanfang 1 aHu, Jian 1 aZhang, Meiping 1 aWang, Kangyu 1 aWang, Yi 0 tHorticulturae.g2022 Aug. 23, v. 8, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae80907563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012700166300001800293520124300311592002801554650002201582650001001604650001701614650002101631650003501652650001101687650001901698650001901717650001201736650000901748700001401757700001401771700001601785700001401801700001801815773011001833856008601943852000902029655001202038IND60530440220221123015519.0160721e20160202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053044022DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b044412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Hualong10aAmyloid-β Deposits Target Efficient Near-Infrared Fluorescent Probes: Synthesis, in Vitro Evaluation, and in Vivo Imaging  ap. 1944-1950.  aThe formation of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques is a common molecular change that underlies several debilitating human conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, the existing near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes for the in vivo detection of Aβ plaques are limited by undesirable fluorescent properties and poor brain kinetics. In this work, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated a new family of efficient NIR probes that target Aβ plaques by incorporating hydroxyethyl groups into the ligand structure. Among these probes, DANIR 8c showed excellent fluorescent properties with an emission maximum above 670 nm upon binding to Aβ aggregates and also displayed a high sensitivity (a 629-fold increase in fluorescence intensity) and affinity (Kd = 14.5 nM). Because of the improved hydrophilicity that was induced by hydroxyls, 8c displayed increased initial brain uptake and a fast washout from the brain, as well as an acceptable biostability in the brain. In vivo NIR fluorescent imaging revealed that 8c could efficiently distinguish between AD transgenic model mice and normal controls. Overall, 8c is an efficient and veritable NIR fluorescent probe for the in vivo detection of Aβ plaques in the brain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3abrain 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3aimage analysis 3aligands 3amice1 aTu, Peiyu1 aZhao, Liu1 aDai, Jiapei1 aLiu, Boli1 aCui, Mengchao0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Feb. 02, v. 88, no. 3 p.1944-1950dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b044413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01310naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009300171300001600264520034400280592002800624650001300652650001300665650001300678650001000691650002500701650001900726700002300745700002200768773011300790856008400903852000900987655001200996IND60112771120221117060811.0141111e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011277112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShindo, Hironori10aAdhesion of tissue sections from eleven organs on glass slides with amino group coatings  ap. 661-664.  aThe adhesion of immunohistochemically stained tissue sections from eleven different organs on microscope slides was compared.

The proposed investigation aims to promote awareness about countries’ global engagement and identify gaps in climate-related financial policy. Using a standardised metric, researchers and policymakers can use the generated climate-related financial policy index (CRFPI) to compare international commitment to climate-related financial policymaking. Emerging economies are the most engaged in green financial policymaking, although they report the highest within-group variability, indicating no standard or general approach to “greening” the financial system. The index demonstrates a location effect, as most jurisdictions with high CRFPIs are in Asia-Pacific and North Europe. Brazil, China, France, Indonesia, and South Korea had the highest scores among G20 countries. After examining several aggregation approaches, the findings appear to be robust overall.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aeconomic policy 3aBrazil 3aChina 3aFrance 3aIndonesia 3aSouth Korea 0aClimate-related financial policies 0aClimate risks 0aLow-carbon transition 0aFinancial stability 0aComposite index1 aThole, Steffen0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Aug., v. 141 p.109065-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1090653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245009200155300001600247500002000263520114400283592002801427650004501455650002601500650002801526650001601554650002901570650001601599650000901615650002001624650001701644650001201661650001801673650002401691650002701715650003001742650000901772650002801781700001701809700001501826700001501841700001501856700001601871773012801887856007302015852000902088655001202097IND60571384720221120041542.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057138472DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.77622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Zhipeng10aShort‐ and long‐term antihypertensive effect of egg protein‐derived peptide QIGLF  ap. 551-555.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The present study aimed to investigate the in vivo antihypertensive effect on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) induced by egg protein‐derived peptide QIGLF, which has been previously characterized in vitro as a potent angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor. RESULTS: In vivo antihypertensive effect of QIGLF orally administered was evaluated by the tail‐cuff method. The systolic blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure of rats were measured 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 h after administration every day. Subsequently, the effect of QIGLF on angiotensin‐converting enzyme mRNA expression in the kidney of SHRs was evaluated by a polymerase chain reaction. Systolic blood pressure was found to be reduced markedly in the SHRs after a single oral administration. CONCLUSION: The results show that the effect of QIGLF (50 mg kg⁻¹ body weight) was similar to that of captopril (10 mg kg⁻¹ body weight) with respect to lowering systolic blood pressure in SHRs. Therefore, egg white protein‐derived peptide QIGLF may be useful in the prevention or treatment of hypertension. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 3aanimal disease models 3aantihypertensive effect 3abody weight 3adiastolic blood pressure 3aegg albumen 3aeggs 3agene expression 3ahypertension 3akidneys 3amessenger RNA 3aoral administration 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arats 3asystolic blood pressure1 aZhao, Wenzhu1 aDing, Long1 aWang, Yaqi1 aChen, Feng1 aLiu, Jingbo0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2017 Jan., v. 97, no. 2 p.551-555dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.77623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245008900170300001600259500001900275520168500294592002801979650002602007650001702033650001502050650001202065650001302077650002202090650001102112650002102123650001002144650001802154650000902172650001102181651001102192653003002203653003202233653002402265653001802289653002502307700002402332700003102356700002402387700002902411700002202440700002102462700002502483700002102508773011802529856007902647852000902726655001202735IND60719717620221122030857.0201211e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071971762DNAL7 a10.2478/forj-2020-00222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBičárová, Svetlana14aThe response of Pinus species to ozone uptake in different climate regions of Europe  ap. 255-268.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study is focused on the research of selected Pinus species exposed to high ozone concentrations in the mountain environment. We noticed different values of modelled ozone doses (MOD) up-taken by Mountain pine (Pinus mugo Turra) in the High Tatra Mts (SK–HTMts) and Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra L.) in the Alpes-Mercantour (FR–AlpMar) during the growing season 2019. The MOD values were obtained by multiplicative DO3SE model, while we also tested a new approach based on modification of input ozone data. The MOD values were obtained by multiplicative DO3SE model, while we also tested a new approach based on modification of input ozone data. Testing has shown that ozone input based on passive sampling may be used in MOD modelling for sites situated in the subalpine zone where the operation of active monitors is limited.. Presented results confirmed the assumption regarding stomatal ozone flux reduction due to the occurrence of soil drought in hot and dry summer weather typical for the Mediterranean climate region. Despite the limitation of stomatal flux, foliar ozone specific injury on two years needles of P. cembra was substantially higher in comparison to the incidence of ozone injury symptoms observed on two years needles of P. mugo in SK–HTMts. It may suggest low phytotoxicity of given MOD or efficient resistance of P. mugo against oxidative stress. In addition, the visible injury index (VINX) covering the broad effect of biotic and abiotic harmful agents was appraised on P. mugo. Percentage of affected surface indicated moderate deterioration of needle injury at the end of the growing season, particularly due to traces of mechanical damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aPinus cembra 3aPinus mugo 3adrought 3aforestry 3amechanical damage 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3aozone 3aphytotoxicity 3asoil 3asummer 3aEurope 0aModelled Ozone Dose (MOD) 0aVisible Injury Index (VINX) 0apassive O3 sampling 0asoil humidity 0amountain environment1 aShashikumar, Anumol1 aDalstein-Richier, Laurence1 aLukasová, Veronika1 aAdamčíková, Katarína1 aPavlendová, Hana1 aSitková, Zuzana1 aBuchholcerová, Anna1 aBilčík, Dušan0 tCentral European Forestry Journal.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 66, no. 4 p.255-268dSciendowJournal:23614x2454-03587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/forj-2020-00223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245008200203300001800285506007600303520135800379592002801737506003701765650000801802650001701810650001901827650001801846650001701864650001501881650001501896650002501911650002001936650001001956650001601966650001101982650001201993650001302005650001402018650002202032650001302054650001502067650002402082653002302106653002802129653003902157653001502196653002202211653000802233700001602241700002202257700002302279700002602302773011802328856007502446852000902521655001202530IND60567939220221207074909.0170501e20120203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056793922DNAL7 a10.1021/pr20091092doi7 aPMC32717372pmcid7 a221032622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalvey, Patrick J.10aProteomic Consequences of a Single Gene Mutation in a Colorectal Cancer Model  ap. 1184-1195.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe proteomic effects of specific cancer-related mutations have not been well characterized. In colorectal cancer (CRC), a relatively small number of mutations in key signaling pathways appear to drive tumorigenesis. Mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, occur in up to 60% of CRC tumors. Here we examine the proteomic consequences of a single gene mutation by using an isogenic CRC cell culture model in which wildtype APC expression has been ectopically restored. Using LC–MS/MS label free shotgun proteomics, over 5000 proteins were identified in SW480Null (mutant APC) and SW480APC (APC restored). We observed 155 significantly differentially expressed proteins between the two cell lines, with 26 proteins showing opposite expression trends relative to gene expression measurements. Protein changes corresponded to previously characterized features of the APCNull phenotype: loss of cell adhesion proteins, increase in cell cycle regulators, alteration in Wnt signaling related proteins, and redistribution of β-catenin. Increased expression of RNA processing and isoprenoid biosynthetic proteins occurred in SW480Null cells. Therefore, shotgun proteomics reveals proteomic differences associated with a single gene change, including many novel differences that fall outside known target pathways.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3abeta catenin 3acarcinogenesis 3acell adhesion 3acell culture 3acell cycle 3acell lines 3acolorectal neoplasms 3agene expression 3agenes 3aisoprenoids 3amodels 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asignal transduction 0ashotgun proteomics 0alabel-free quantitation 0amultiple reaction monitoring (MRM) 0aLC−MS/MS 0acolorectal cancer 0aAPC1 aZhang, Bing1 aCoffey, Robert J.1 aLiebler, Daniel C.1 aSlebos, Robbert J.

Living mulches can compete with the main crop for resources, particularly water. The objectives of this research were to quantify soil water dynamics and maize water use in continuous maize with stover removal. Continuous soil water content (SWC) and reproductive whole-plant water use were measured in no-till maize growing in LMs of creeping red fescue (CF) (Festuca rubra L.), Kentucky bluegrass (KB) (Poa pratensis L.), and a no-LM control between 2008 and 2010 near Ames, IA. In 2 yr with excessive rainfall (2008 and 2010), LMs increased SWC compared to the control at 15 cm. No-till LM treatments lowered grain yield in 2008 and 2010 compared to the control, although a KB fall strip-till treatment, which was part of the larger research study, produced yields that were not different than the control all 3 yr. Reproductive water use efficiency for no-till KB in 2008 and 2009 (51 and 42 g grain per cm water) was 21 and 14% greater than the control (42 and 37) but 24% lower in 2010 (41 vs. 51). Maize water use in the control exhibited a bimodal response averaged across the 3 yr with peak water use occurring at the R1 through R2 period (0.58 cm d⁻¹) and declining to 0.26 cm d⁻¹ during R5 through R6. In contrast, no-till KB exhibited a simple negative linear relationship with water use rates declining from a high of 0.47 cm d⁻¹ during the R1 through R2 period to 0.22 cm d⁻¹ during R5 through R6. These results indicate LMs may increase SWC and utilize water more effectively, particularly when combining strip-till and herbicide management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca rubra subsp. rubra 3aPoa pratensis 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acorn stover 3acrops 3aerosion control 3agrain yield 3aherbicides 3alive mulches 3ano-tillage 3arain 3asoil water content 3asoil water regimes 3asoil-plant interactions 3astrip tillage 3awater use efficiency1 aSinger, Jeremy W.1 aMoore, Kenneth J.1 aLamkey, Kendall R.0 tCrop science.g2012 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.327-338dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/539263Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2011.06.03163Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/111905_Wiggans_Living_Mulch_Crop_Sci_2011.pdf  aUSDAUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02322naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245007900183300001400262520106900276592002801345650001501373650001201388650001301400650001601413651001201429653002401441653002301465653001601488653002201504653003201526700001901558700003301577700002201610700002201632700002101654700003001675773011301705856008501818852000901903655001201912IND60644333220221121144802.0190516e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064433322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2017.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadhakrishnan, Mohanasundar10aContext specific adaptation grammars for climate adaptation in urban areas  ap. 73-83.  aIn the context of climate adaptation planning there are relationships between adaptation drivers and adaptation measures, which makes the selection and implementation of the adaptation measures a challenging task. This challenge may be addressed by: structuring the adaptation problem using a multiple perspective adaptation framework; and applying a context specific precedence grammar logic for selecting and evaluating adaptation measures. Precedence grammar logic is a set of rule based algorithms (grammar) that are based on the relationships in a local adaptation context. This paper demonstrates the application of a context specific precedence grammar logic in an adaptation context in Can Tho, Vietnam. Adaptation pathways comprising flood adaptation measures (i.e. dike heightening) for this case were generated using rule based algorithms based on the relationships between the drivers and the adaptation measures. The results show that complex adaptation issues that are structured, can be resolved using a context specific adaptation grammar approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aclimate 3aplanning 3aurban areas 3aVietnam 0aAdaptation pathways 0aClimate adaptation 0aFlexibility 0aPrecedent grammar 0aContext specific adaptation1 aIslam, Tushith1 aAshley, R.

Application of such nutrients to the soil is ineffective because they quickly get tied up in unavailable forms. Elemental sulfur (S) application in a narrow band to lower root zone pH and increase nutrient availability to the crop is a possible economically feasible solution. A four year field study was conducted in which S was applied to sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) at rates up to 1120 kg S ha⁻¹ each of the 1st three years in a band using different application methods. Sulfur application effects on soil pH were gradual, causing only a slight reduction in the application zone after one year; but was long lasting, resulting in continuing substantial declines in soil pH in an adjacent zone four years after the first S application. Soil available P, sulfate (SO₄)-S, and salinity levels increased with increasing S applied. Sugarcane plant growth, as indicated by leaf area index during the grand growth period responded to moderate S application levels. Sugarcane yields increased linearly in the plant crop, but showed quadratic responses to S applications in the 1st through 3rd ratoon crops. Initial soil available P levels prior to the first treatment application were at the critical level considered adequate for crop requirements, yet growth and yield increases in response to S application suggest that the critical available soil P levels for sugarcane may be higher than previously established. Sulfur application at rates beyond those necessary to produce maximum yields resulted in salinity problems which probably reduced yields. The ‘stool splitter’ application method, which slices the plant stool using a coulter and places the fertilizer directly in the middle of the furrow caused crop damage and stand loss which persisted for the remainder of the sugarcane crops. Based on the results of this study, a single application of elemental S at up to 1120 kg S ha⁻¹ directly below the seed cane at planting is recommend for sugarcane on a calcareous soil, with no additional applications in later crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum 3aapplication methods 3aapplication rate 3acalcareous soils 3acrop damage 3acrop yield 3acrops 3afertilizers 3afurrows 3aleaf area index 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3aplanting 3aratooning 3arhizosphere 3asalinity 3aslicing 3asoil nutrients 3asoil pH 3asugarcane 3asugarcane soils 3asulfur 0asoil pH 0aavailable soil P 0asoil salinity0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2011 May 4, v. 34, no. 7 p.1003-1013dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2011.555582  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001600150245012900166300001600295520128600311592002801597650001101625650001601636650002201652650002101674650002101695650002001716650001001736650000901746700001601755700001701771700002601788773009301814856008601907852000901993655001202002IND4472230820221122051419.0141111e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447223082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2011.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalacio, S.10aRoot colonisation by AM fungi differs between gypsum specialist and non-specialist plants: Links to the gypsophile behaviour  ap. 128-132.  aGypsum soils are among the most restrictive substrates for plant life, yet the mechanisms of plant adaptation to gypsum are still poorly understood. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can improve host plant nutrition and survival in stressful environments but little is known about the ubiquity and function of AMF in plants that grow in gypsum soils, both specialists and generalists. Previous studies indicate that most gypsophiles (specialists) show much higher concentration of nutrients than gypsovags (generalists), hence our hypothesis was that this would be related to increased mycorrhizal colonisation in gypsum specialists. We therefore quantified colonisation of the roots by mycorrhizal arbuscules (AC), vesicles (VC) and hyphae (HC) in six species of gypsophiles and six species of gypsovags growing in gypsum outcrops. Both groups of plants showed significant differences in AC, VC and HC but in contrast to our hypothesis, colonisation was greater in gypsovags than in gypsophiles. The extent of AMF colonisation does not seem to explain the distinctively high nutrient concentrations reported for gypsophiles. Our results indicate that increased AM colonisation could be a mechanism allowing non-specialist plants to cope with the restrictive conditions of gypsum.  aPublisher supplied data 3agypsum 3ahost plants 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anutrient content 3aplant adaptation 3aplant nutrition 3aroots 3asoil1 aJohnson, D.1 aEscudero, A.1 aMontserrat-Martí, G.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2012 Jan., v. 76 p.128-132dElsevier Ltdx0140-19637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2011.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008300167520181100250592002802061650002402089650001902113650001702132650001302149650001202162650001402174650002202188650002502210700002002235700001802255700001802273700002102291773012602312856008502438852000902523655001202532IND60794210120221120193155.0220922e20220826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079421012DNAL7 a10.3390/horticulturae80907672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJu, Jin-Hee 10aRecent Trends in Urban Agriculture to Improve Bioactive Content of Plant Foods  aUrban agriculture is an important part of the food and nutrition security of many cities and is growing in importance, especially with social disruptions such as climate change and pandemics. Plant foods, in particular, provide bioactive compounds and other essential nutrients. Therefore, it is important to provide timely and useful research resources to horticultural sector and food-related industries that want to produce high-quality plant foods at low cost to meet the market demands of urban agriculture. This study focuses on up-to-date information on urban agriculture, the mechanisms of production of bioactive compounds in plant foods, and the main factors influencing the levels of bioactive compounds in plant foods. As a strategy to improve the bioactive compounds of plant foods in urban agriculture, the recent trends in urban agriculture were investigated according to four categories: ground-based uncontrolled or controlled agriculture and building-integrated uncontrolled or controlled agriculture. In ground-based urban agriculture, the application of short-term abiotic or biotic stresses, such as agronomic management practices, can significantly affect the bioactive compound levels in fruits and vegetables. On the other hand, in building-integrated urban agriculture, horticultural scientists have been interested in artificial lighting, cultivation medium, and water use efficiency to improve the level and composition of functional components of plants. The future trend of urban agriculture is expected to change from ground-based to building integration considering the sustainability of agriculture. Therefore, ongoing research on the growth and bioactive content improvement of plant foods using building-integrated agriculture is an important aspect for urban agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3aclimate change 3ahorticulture 3alighting 3amarkets 3anutrition 3aurban agriculture 3awater use efficiency1 aYoon, Yong-Han 1 aShin, So-Hui 1 aJu, Se-Young 1 aYeum, Kyung-Jin 0 tHorticulturae.g2022 Aug. 26, v. 8, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae80907673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006500151245013600216300001600352520107700368592002801445650001101473650001201484650001601496650002001512650001101532650001501543650001601558650002001574650001501594650002201609650001801631650001501649650001701664653002501681653001901706653002501725653001701750653003401767653002301801700002401824700001901848773011501867856008501982852000902067655001202076IND60644333520221121144839.0190516e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064433352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpeich, Matthias J.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0173-535110aSensitivity of forest water balance and physiological drought predictions to soil and vegetation parameters – A model-based study  ap. 213-232.  aA global sensitivity analysis was conducted on a dynamic water balance model with 19 parameters describing canopy structure, stomatal regulation and soil characteristics, to quantify the importance of vegetation and soil properties in coupled models of hydrology and forest dynamics. Main outputs were total evaporation, as well as a physiological drought index calculated from actual and potential transpiration. Parameter sensitivity was assessed at ten temperate to sub-alpine locations, covering both water-limited and energy-limited sites.Varying parameter values within plausible ranges led to differences of several hundreds of mm/year in predicted long-term evaporation. Root zone storage is the most important parameter at drier stations, whereas canopy and stomatal parameters become more important where soil moisture is less limiting. Physiological drought also depends strongly on root zone properties, while canopy structure only matters at the drier sites. Stomatal sensitivity to dry air substantially contributed to drought stress at the more humid sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3adrought 3aevaporation 3aforest dynamics 3amodels 3aprediction 3arhizosphere 3asoil properties 3asoil water 3astomatal movement 3atranspiration 3avegetation 3awater stress 0aSensitivity analysis 0aDrought stress 0aForest water balance 0aEcohydrology 0aRooting zone storage capacity 0aWater partitioning1 aZappa, Massimiliano1 aLischke, Heike0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2018 Apr., v. 102 p.213-232dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245019500167520180800362592002802170650002202198650001502220650002502235650002002260650001202280650002002292650001002312650002702322650001502349650001302364650001402377650001302391700001402404700001802418700001802436700001902454700001602473700002102489773012602510856008502636852000902721655001202730IND60794210320221122034253.0220922e20220826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079421032DNAL7 a10.3390/horticulturae80907692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Zhijun 10aAnalysis of Relative Expression of Key Enzyme Genes and Enzyme Activity in Nitrogen Metabolic Pathway of Two Genotypes of Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) under Different Nitrogen Supply Levels  aNitrogen (N) plays an important role in the growth cycle of the potato, and is an important guarantee of yield and quality. Rational N application is one of the key ways to improve a crop’s high and stable yield and economic and environmental benefits. The N nutrition level of potato regulates the gene expression of enzymes related to the N metabolism pathway, which shows the change of the activity of key enzymes in N metabolism, and finally realizes the regulation of N absorption and utilization. In this study, the key enzyme genes and enzyme activity of different genotypes of potato under different N supply treatments were identified, which laid a foundation for further exploration of the functions of each gene in the potato N metabolism pathway and provided theoretical basis for rational N application. The results showed that the relative expression levels of StNRT1.5, StNR, StNiR in leaves, StNRT2.5, StNRT2.4, StGS1-2 in roots and StNRT2.7, StGS1-3, StGS2, StGS1-4, StFd-GOGAT in leaves and roots showed that the levels of N-inefficient potato Atlantic (A) were higher than the N-efficient potato Yanshu 4 (Y), while the relative expression levels of StNRT2.5, StGS1-2 in leaves, StNRT1.5StNR, StNiR in roots and StGDH, StNADH-GOGAT in leaves and roots showed that levels in Yanshu 4 (Y) were higher than in Atlantic (A). At the same time, we especially found that the GDH activity in the leaves of the two genotypes of potato were higher at low N levels. Additionally, the activity of NR and NiR, and the activity of GS and GOGAT were correlated. In addition, the changes of key enzymes in different N metabolism showed a certain continuity with the advancement of growth and development, and some gene expression rules and enzyme activity changes also showed a certain consistency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aabsorption 3abiochemical pathways 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3ametabolism 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3apotatoes1 aLü, Yue,1 aZhao, Yanfei 1 aWang, Yaping 1 aHan, Zhongcai 1 aHan, Yuzhu 1 aZhang, Jingying 0 tHorticulturae.g2022 Aug. 26, v. 8, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae80907693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245019100171300001600362520082000378592002801198650001501226650001201241650001801253650001701271650001101288650001301299650000901312650001501321650001401336650001301350650001001363650001401373650001201387650001801399650001601417650001501433651001001448653001501458653001101473653001701484653000901501653001101510700002201521700001901543700002401562700002601586773013701612856008201749852000901831655001201840IND60622113320221117170548.0181123e199904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062211332DNAL7 a10.1177/1082013299005002042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Romero, E.10aFruity flavor increase of Spanish Airén white wines made by brief fermentation skin contact / Aumento del aroma afrutado de los vinos blancos Airén fermentados en presencia de hollejos  ap. 149-157.  aLaboratory scale vinification assays were carried out with musts of the Spanish Airén white variety from the 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993 vintages from Valdepeñas, Spain, which were fermented both with and without skins.

In this report, we demonstrate a simple microfluidic device that integrates sonication and immunoprecipitation (IP) for epigenetic assays, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP). By incorporating an ultrasonic transducer with a microfluidic chamber, we implemented microscale sonication for both shearing chromatin/DNA and mixing/washing of IP beads. Such integration allowed highly sensitive tests starting with 100 cross-linked cells for ChIP or 500 pg of genomic DNA for MeDIP (compared to 10⁶–10⁷ cells for ChIP and 1–10 μg of DNA for MeDIP in conventional assays). The entire on-chip process of sonication and IP took only 1 h. Our tool will be useful for highly sensitive epigenetic studies based on a small quantity of sample.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aanimals 3achromatin 3acrosslinking 3aepigenetics 3amixing 3apatients 3aprecipitin tests 3aultrasonics 3awashing1 aLü, Chang,0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Feb. 02, v. 88, no. 3 p.1965-1972dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b047073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007600157300001800233520154800251592002801799650002101827650002001848650001401868650001901882650001501901650001101916650002101927650001201948650001401960650001501974650001601989650001702005650001502022650001902037650001102056650001502067650001302082650001502095650001302110650001302123650001502136650002402151650001302175653001802188653001702206653001602223653001002239653001202249653003302261653002102294700002202315700003102337700003202368773011802400856007502518852000902593655001202602IND60567939720221122040926.0170501e20120203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056793972DNAL7 a10.1021/pr200935y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeong, Sharon10aBiomarkers of Breast Cancer Apoptosis Induced by Chemotherapy and TRAIL  ap. 1240-1250.  aTreatment of breast cancer is complex and challenging due to the heterogeneity of the disease. To avoid significant toxicity and adverse side-effects of chemotherapy in patients who respond poorly, biomarkers predicting therapeutic response are essential. This study has utilized a proteomic approach integrating 2D-DIGE, LC–MS/MS, and bioinformatics to analyze the proteome of breast cancer (ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-231) and breast epithelial (MCF-10A) cell lines induced to undergo apoptosis using a combination of doxorubicin and TRAIL administered in sequence (Dox-TRAIL). Apoptosis induction was confirmed using a caspase-3 activity assay. Comparative proteomic analysis between whole cell lysates of Dox-TRAIL and control samples revealed 56 differentially expressed spots (≥2-fold change and p < 0.05) common to at least two cell lines. Of these, 19 proteins were identified yielding 11 unique protein identities: CFL1, EIF5A, HNRNPK, KRT8, KRT18, LMNA, MYH9, NACA, RPLP0, RPLP2, and RAD23B. A subset of the identified proteins was validated by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and Western blotting. Pathway analysis revealed that the differentially abundant proteins were associated with cell death, cellular organization, integrin-linked kinase signaling, and actin cytoskeleton signaling pathways. The 2D-DIGE analysis has yielded candidate biomarkers of response to treatment in breast cancer cell models. Their clinical utility will depend on validation using patient breast biopsies pre- and post-treatment with anticancer drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadverse effects 3aapoptosis 3abioinformatics 3abiomarkers 3abiopsy 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3acaspase-3 3acell lines 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3aepithelium 3amicrofilaments 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apatients 3aprediction 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asignal transduction 3atoxicity 0aBreast cancer 0achemotherapy 0adoxorubicin 0aTRAIL 0a2D-DIGE 0aselected reaction monitoring 0apathway analysis1 aMcKay, Matthew

Our analysis is based on a nationally representative data set from India for the year 2009–10 and we use propensity score matching methods. We find that as compared to households with no commuters, households with rural–urban commuters have higher dietary diversity; whereas households with no fixed place workers have lower dietary diversity.

Both proline and trehalose are known to function as cryoprotectants in yeast cells. In order to enhance the freeze tolerance of yeast cells, we constructed a self-cloning diploid baker's yeast strain with simultaneous accumulation of proline, by expressing the PRO1-I150T allele, encoding the proline-feedback inhibition-less sensitive γ-glutamyl kinase, and trehalose, by disrupting the NTH1 gene, encoding neutral trehalase. The resultant strain retained higher tolerance to oxidative and freezing stresses than did the single proline- or trehalose-accumulating strain. Interestingly, our results suggest that proline and trehalose protect yeast cells from short-term and long-term freezing, respectively. Simultaneous accumulation of proline and trehalose in industrial baker's yeast also enhanced the fermentation ability in the frozen dough compared with the single accumulation of proline or trehalose. These results indicate that baker's yeast that accumulates both proline and trehalose is applicable for frozen-dough baking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abaked goods 3abakers yeast 3abaking 3acold stress 3acryoprotectants 3adiploidy 3afermentation 3afreezing 3afrozen dough 3aproline 3atrehalase 3atrehalose1 aHaitani, Yutaka1 aHashida, Keisuke1 aOhtsu, Iwao1 aShima, Jun1 aTakagi, Hiroshi0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2012 May, v. 113, no. 5 p.592-595dElsevier B.V.x1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012200160300001800282500002000300520174300320592002802063650002902091650002002120650002102140650002602161650003102187650001402218650002802232650001802260650001102278650001102289650001402300650002602314650001502340700002302355773015002378856007302528852000902601655001202610IND60587391320221120151430.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058739132DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.52202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdullah, Bawadi10aEvaluation of gas–liquid mass transfer in gas‐induced stirred tank reactor using electrical resistance tomography  ap. 2123-2133.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: A gas‐entrainment impeller is attractive for multiphase reactive systems such as Fischer–Tropsch reaction and deep liquid‐phase oxidation of organics with the possibility of low gas conversion per pass, enhancement of mixing performance and better inter‐phase mass transfer compared with conventional impellers. RESULTS: Tomograms obtained from ERT measurement reveal that the conductivity of a gas–water system changes as a function of impeller Reynolds number, ReI. The global gas holdup profile behaviour with ReI exhibited a sigmoid character which was adequately captured by ϵG = ϵG,₀ + ϵG,ₘₐₓ(1 − exp(−τgₗReI)). The parity plot showed strong linearity between model predicted and experimental data. The radial gas holdup profiles showed an upward parabolic trend with higher gas holdup values for gas‐entrainment impeller systems than the conventional 4‐blade impeller. To assess the efficiency of power consumption, the mass transfer coefficient, kLa, for a gas–liquid system in a stirred tank reactor was correlated as a function of dimensionless combination of power number and gas holdup; kLa=kLa0+αPP0ϵGβ where α is the bubble collision frequency (s⁻¹) and β is the gas‐inducing enhancement factor. CONCLUSION: Three different regimes of volumetric mass transfer coefficient were identified in the stirred tank reactor for each case. Overall, the combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses of ERT along with dissolved oxygen concentration permitted an insightful analysis of the self‐gas inducing impeller as a superior mixing technology for potential industrial applications involving gas–liquid operations. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aFischer-Tropsch reaction 3aReynolds number 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectrical resistance 3aenergy use and consumption 3aimpellers 3aindustrial applications 3amass transfer 3amixing 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aquantitative analysis 3atomography1 aAdesina, Adesoji A0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2017 Aug., v. 92, no. 8 p.2123-2133dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.52203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01953naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008900166520109800255592002801353653002801381653003901409653001401448700001901462700005301481773009201534856005201626852000901678655001201687IND60795339920221120145008.0221004e20230201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079533992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1239772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Xiuen10aBiosensors based on functional nucleic acids and isothermal amplification techniques  aIn the past few years, with the in-depth research of functional nucleic acids and isothermal amplification techniques, their applications in the field of biosensing have attracted great interest. Since functional nucleic acids have excellent flexibility and convenience in their structural design, they have significant advantages as recognition elements in biosensing. At the same time, isothermal amplification techniques have higher amplification efficiency, so the combination of functional nucleic acids and isothermal amplification techniques can greatly promote the widespread application of biosensors. For the purpose of further improving the performance of biosensors, this review introduces several widely used functional nucleic acids and isothermal amplification techniques, as well as their classification, basic principles, application characteristics, and summarizes their important applications in the field of biosensing.

Graphene-based materials are potential components used in water treatment on different modes and processes. Ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin are two commonly found pharmaceutical contaminants discharged into water bodies from industrial, domestic and hospital sources. Their concentration levels in water bodies are reported in the range of 1 μg/L to 6.5 mg/L and 0.050–100 μg/L respectively. Their toxic effects pose very high risk to the inhabiting organisms. Their ability to resist biodegradation and capacity to bioaccumulate makes the conventional methods less effective in removal. In the present article, treatment of these compounds via three methods, adsorption, photocatalytic degradation and electro–fenton reactions using graphene-based materials along with the methods adopted for synthesis and treatment are reviewed. The uptakes obtained by graphene-derived adsorbents are presented along with the optimal operating conditions. Studies reported complete removal of ibuprofen from wastewater was achieved at 7 pH for 60 min using graphene membrane as adsorbent and uptake of 99% of ciprofloxacin was exhibited for graphene nanoplates/boron nitrate aerogel at a pH of 7 and 60 min. The reduced graphene oxide surface exhibits higher affinity to light adsorption which leads to the formation of photo generated electrons. The future perspectives for improved applications of graphene-based materials and the research gap currently existing are highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaerogels 3abioaccumulation 3abiodegradation 3aboron 3aciprofloxacin 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahospitals 3aibuprofen 3anitrates 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aremediation 3arisk 3asurface area 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3awastewater 3awater treatment 0aGraphene 0aIbuprofen 0aCiprofloxacin 0aDegradation 0aNanocomposite1 aSivaprakash, Baskaran1 aRajamohan, Natarajan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5015-06941 aGovarthanan, Muthusamy1 aElakiya, B.Tamil0 tChemosphere.g2022 Nov., v. 306 p.135520-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001400156245010800170500001900278520188600297592002802183650001102211650002802222650001902250650001302269650001002282650002602292650001602318650001202334650001402346650001702360650002202377650002102399653002802420653002002448653002202468653002502490700001802515700001702533700001502550700001802565700001402583773009302597856009102690852000902781655001202790IND60707451420221117060723.0210108e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070745142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1202982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTu, Yalan10aIntercellular delivery of bioorthogonal chemical receptors for enhanced tumor targeting and penetration  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTargeted drug delivery using biological ligands can improve the precision of cancer therapy. However, this active targeting strategy is limited in tumor targeting and penetration abilities due to the paucity and heterogeneous distribution of targeted receptors in tumor cells, thus compromising the treatment outcomes. In this study, we developed an alternative active targeting strategy for enhanced tumor targeting and penetration through synthetic nanoparticle-mediated metabolic tumor ligand labeling for intercellular delivery of bioorthogonal chemical receptors combined with in vivo bioorthogonal click chemistry. Briefly, artificial azide-containing ligands were first labeled on perivascular tumor cells by nanoscale metabolic precursors (Az-NPs) via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and metabolic engineering of the tumor cells. Through transport by extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by perivascular tumor cells, the azide-containing ligands can be autonomously transported intercellularly to adjacent cells and further spread throughout tumor tissues and label bioorthogonal ligands on cells that are not in proximity to blood vessels. Then, water-soluble dibenzocyclooctyne-modified chlorin e6 (DBCO-Ce6) was intravenously injected to react selectively, efficiently and irreversibly with the azide groups on the cell surface through an in vivo bioorthogonal click reaction. Enhanced tumor accumulation and penetration of DBCO-Ce6 was achieved through this strategy, resulting in improved therapeutic efficiency with laser irradiation for photodynamic therapy. Therefore, the artificial azide-containing ligand targeting strategy by nanoparticle-mediated metabolic labeling through the EPR effect combined with bioorthogonal click chemistry may provide an alternative strategy for enhanced tumor targeting and penetration with broad applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazides 3abiocompatible materials 3acancer therapy 3achlorins 3adrugs 3aintravenous injection 3airradiation 3aligands 3aneoplasms 3apermeability 3aphotochemotherapy 3awater solubility 0aBioorthogonal chemistry 0aTumor targeting 0aTumor penetration 0aPhotodynamic therapy1 aDong, Yansong1 aWang, KeWei,1 aShen, Song1 aYuan, Youyong1 aWang, Jun0 tBiomaterials.g2020 Nov., v. 259 p.120298-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1202983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03694naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009100173520237000264592002802634650001402662650001702676650001502693650002002708650002402728650002202752650001802774650002502792651001102817653002202828653002002850653002202870653003302892653002302925653002602948700003002974700002003004700002103024700002103045773009803066856008703164852000903251655001203260IND60695413720221119022125.0201023e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069541372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1150832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShadram, Farshid10aExploring the trade-off in life cycle energy of building retrofit through optimization  aBuilding retrofit is considered as a vital step to achieve energy and climate goals in both Europe and Sweden. Nevertheless, retrofitting solutions based merely on reducing operational energy use can increase embodied energy use, mainly due to altering the existing trade-off between the two. Considering this trade-off is vitally important, especially for retrofitting buildings located in cold climate regions, as reduction of operational energy use to meet standards of energy-efficient buildings may require a deep retrofitting that can considerably increase the embodied energy and thus be unfavorable from a Life Cycle Energy (LCE) perspective. This article presents a case study in which multi-objective optimization was used to explore the impact of a wide range of retrofitting measures on the aforementioned trade-off for a building in Sweden located in a subarctic climatic zone. The studied building was a typical 1980s multi-family residence. The goal was to explore and compare the optimal retrofitting solution(s) for the building, aiming to achieve Swedish energy-efficient building standards (i.e. new-build and near-zero energy standards). The results of the optimization indicated that (1) use of additional insulation in walls and roof, (2) replacement of existing windows with more energy-efficient ones, and (3) change of traditional mechanical extract ventilation to heat recovery ventilation are the primary and optimal retrofitting measures to fulfill the new-build Swedish energy standard and achieve highest LCE savings. However, to fulfill more far-reaching operational energy savings, application of additional retrofitting measures was required, increasing the embodied energy use considerably and resulting in lower LCE savings compared to the optimal retrofitting solution that only reached the Swedish new-build energy standard. The LCE difference between the optimal retrofitting solutions that fulfilled the new-build standard and the strictest near-zero (passive house) standard was 1862 GJ, which is equivalent to almost four years of operational energy use for the original building. This indicates that there is a limit to the reduction of operational energy use when retrofitting existing buildings, beyond which additional reductions can considerably increase the embodied energy and thus be unfavorable in terms of LCE use.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acase studies 3acold zones 3aembodied energy 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat recovery 3ainsulating materials 3aSweden 0aBuilding retrofit 0aEmbodied energy 0aLife cycle energy 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aOperational energy 0aRetrofitting measures1 aBhattacharjee, Shimantika1 aLidelöw, Sofia1 aMukkavaara, Jani1 aOlofsson, Thomas0 tApplied energy.g2020 July 01, v. 269 p.115083-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1150833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005300142245011600195300001800311500002000329520162600349592002801975596003702003596002002040596005902060596005902119596005902178596005902237596005902296650001502355650001302370650003002383650002502413650001602438651001702454700001602471700001402487700005602501700001402557700005502571773013102626856007702757852000902834655001202843IND60789667120221116173823.0220822e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078966712DNAL7 a10.1002/2017JC0134102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLian, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7438-411010aInvestigating the Uncertainty in Global SST Trends Due to Internal Variations Using an Improved Trend Estimator  ap. 1877-1895.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA new criterion was proposed recently to measure the influence of internal variations on secular trends in a time series. When the magnitude of the trend is greater than a theoretical threshold that scales the influence from internal variations, the sign of the estimated trend can be interpreted as the underlying long‐term change. Otherwise, the sign may depend on the period chosen. An improved least squares method is developed here to further reduce the theoretical threshold and is applied to eight sea surface temperature (SST) data sets covering the period 1881–2013 to investigate whether there are robust trends in global SSTs. It is found that the warming trends in the western boundary regions, the South Atlantic, and the tropical and southern‐most Indian Ocean are robust. However, robust trends are not found in the North Pacific, the North Atlantic, or the South Indian Ocean. The globally averaged SST and Indian Ocean Dipole indices are found to have robustly increased, whereas trends in the zonal SST gradient across the equatorial Pacific, Niño 3.4 SST, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation indices are within the uncertainty range associated with internal variations. These results indicate that great care is required when interpreting SST trends using the available records in certain regions and indices. It is worth noting that the theoretical threshold can be strongly influenced by low‐frequency oscillations, and the above conclusions are based on the assumption that trends are linear. Caution should be exercised when applying the theoretical threshold criterion to real data.  aPublisher supplied data  cSecond Institute of Oceanography  aQNYC201501cSOA  a41506025cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41606012cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41530961cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41690121cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41690120cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3asurface water temperature 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3aIndian Ocean1 aShen, Zheqi1 aYing, Jun1 aTang, Youmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1158-64251 aLi, Junde1 aLing, Zheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9718-57040 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Mar., v. 123, no. 3 p.1877-1895dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JC0134103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01820naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009800156300002000254520081900274592002801093650001601121650003101137650002101168650001501189650001901204650001501223700001801238700001601256700001401272773012401286856007501410852000901485655001201494IND60778929320221123004917.0220603e20220517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077892932DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra01778d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yuchen10aApproaching high performance Ni(Co) molybdate electrode materials for flexible hybrid devices  ap. 14858-14864.  aTransition metal molybdates are widely used as electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their high theoretical specific capacitance and excellent electrochemical activity.

Vehicle hot-start PN emissions at various ambient temperatures were studied previously. Still, these studies used the same rolling resistance setting at different ambient temperatures and the tests at various ambient temperatures have similar PN emissions. Vehicles get larger resistance at cold ambient temperatures, so this experimental setting (same resistance at various ambient temperatures) is beyond the natural conditions. To evaluate how ambient temperatures affect the PN emissions from fully warmed vehicles, two vehicles were tested at four ambient temperatures: −10 °C, 0 °C, 23 °C, and 40 °C. Vehicle resistance variations under different ambient temperatures were taken into consideration. The observed results proved that PN emission would significantly deteriorate under cold conditions even when the vehicles are thoroughly warmed. The PN emission factor at −10 °C could be six times higher than at 23 °C. The deteriorated PN emission is caused by enhanced fuel enrichment and GPF regeneration, and larger vehicle resistance under cold ambient temperatures is the underlying reason for the increased PN emission. For the first time, this study proved that PN emission from fully warmed vehicles would significantly deteriorate when the ambient temperature decreases. The results could be used for emission models, inventory, and regulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acold 3aemissions factor 3agasoline 3ainventories 0aPN emission 0aCold ambient temperatures 0aFully-warmed vehicles 0aVehicle resistances1 aZhao, Haiguang1 aHou, Pan1 aLyu, Tao1 aLai, Yitu1 aXu, Chunlin1 aZhang, Wulong1 aYin, Hang1 aYang, Zhengjun1 aSu, Sheng1 aGe, Yunshan0 tChemosphere.g2022 Nov., v. 306 p.135522-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003400145245014400179300001600323520194000339592002802279650002102307650000802328650002602336650002002362650001902382650002502401650002302426650000902449650001102458650001102469650001602480650001202496650002002508650001002528650001102538653002402549653001302573653002002586653002202606653002102628653002902649653002502678700001902703700001902722700002502741700003302766773011902799856008002918852000902998655001203007IND60619193820221120082608.0191025e20180317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061919382DNAL7 a10.1093/treephys/tpy0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonnellan Barraclough, Alicia10aDaytime stem swelling and seasonal reversal in the peristaltic depletion of stored water along the stem of Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh  ap. 965-978.  aDiurnal courses of stem radial water dynamics represent the sum of all internal and external conditions affecting tree water relations. Changes in stem radius due to early morning water depletion and night time refilling of storage tissues is generally well documented. This study seeks to understand the unusual daytime refilling of stem elastic storage tissues present in the mangrove species Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh, which deviates from our traditional understanding of hydraulics in terrestrial trees. We explored the relationship of this pattern to other water-related physiological processes and environmental variables, and investigated the seasonal changes in the timing and time lags of peak swelling at different stem heights, in order to understand the ‘peristaltic’ depletion of internally stored water. Our findings show that daytime stem swelling occurs year-round, even on days when leaf water potentials dropped to values lower than −4 MPa. The amplitude of stem swelling was strongly positively correlated to daily light sums more often than to measures of water availability in air and soil, especially in winter. There was also a clear seasonal reversal in the timing and direction of the ‘peristaltic’ depletion of water along the stem, with an earlier onset of shrinking in the upper (median = 10:00 h) than in the lower stem (median = 12:00 h) in winter, but an earlier onset of shrinking in the lower (median = 08:00 h) than in the upper stem (median = 11:00 h) in summer. This time lag was closely correlated to daily temperature, with a clear switch in the direction of peristaltic stem shrinking at the start of the growing season. We propose that sugar loading/unloading and changes in source–sink activity play a role in the endogenous osmotic adjustment responsible for daytime stem swelling and the seasonal switch in the direction of peristaltic water storage depletion in A. marina.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvicennia marina 3aair 3aenvironmental factors 3afluid mechanics 3agrowing season 3aleaf water potential 3aseasonal variation 3asoil 3asugars 3asummer 3atemperature 3atissues 3atree physiology 3atrees 3awinter 0abark osmotic turgor 0amangrove 0aphloem swelling 0apoint dendrometer 0astem daily cycle 0astem diameter variations 0atree water relations1 aZweifel, Roman1 aCusens, Jarrod1 aLeuzinger, Sebastian1 aMencuccini, M.,q(Maurizio),0 tTree physiology.g2018 Mar. 17, v. 38, no. 7 p.965-978dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl41003x1758-44697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpy0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245011400201300001600315500002000331520139000351592002801741650002901769650002501798650002601823650001201849650001001861650001501871650001801886650001001904650002101914650002501935651000901960651001901969651001701988700005802005700006502063700006002128700006002188700002402248700002002272700005802292700001802350773013102368856007502499961001302574852000902587655001202596IND60785875820221120053612.0220729e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078587582DNAL7 a10.1002/jeq2.203402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeinen, Robert J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3309-352810aOpportunities to implement manureshed management in the Iowa, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania swine industry  ap. 510-520.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe U.S. swine industry is diverse, but opportunities exist to strategically improve manure management, especially given much of the industry's vertical integration. We investigate opportunities for improving manureshed management, using swine production examples in Iowa, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania as a lens into historical trends and the current range of management conditions. Manure management reflects regional differences and the specialized nature of hog farms, resulting in a large range of land bases required to assimilate manure generated by these operations. Selected representative farm scenarios were evaluated on an annual basis; farm‐level manuresheds were largest for Pennsylvania sow farms and smallest for North Carolina nursery farms. Compared with nitrogen‐based manuresheds, phosphorus‐based manuresheds were up to 12.5 times larger. Technology advancements are needed to promote export of concentrated nutrients, especially phosphorus, from existing “source” manuresheds to suitable croplands. The industry is dynamic, as revealed by historical analysis of the siting of hog barns in Pennsylvania, which are currently trending toward the north and west where there is greater isolation to prevent the spread of disease and a larger land base to assimilate manure. Industry expansion should focus on locating animals in nutrient “sink” areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manure management 3adisease transmission 3aenvironmental quality 3aexports 3afarms 3aphosphorus 3apork industry 3aswine 3aswine production 3avertical integration 3aIowa 3aNorth Carolina 3aPennsylvania1 aSpiegal, Sheri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5489-95121 aKleinman, Peter J.

However, buses electrification may lead to additional vehicle weight, which may emit more non-exhaust particulate matter (PM) emissions. It remains debatable whether buses' electrification will successfully improve air quality as excepted. To assess the effect of the buses' electrification on the levels of PM emissions, PM emission factors (EFs) were evaluated from EBs and equivalent DBs. In addition, the total mass of PM emissions from EBs and equivalent DBs in 2021 was calculated in Xi'an using the real-world number and mileage of EBs. The non-exhaust PM EFs from EBs were larger than total exhaust and non-exhaust PM EFs from DBs, indicating that the electrification of buses would cause an increase in the level of PM emissions. The total annual mass of PM emissions from EBs was apparently higher than that from DBs. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis showed that tire wear, brake wear, and road wear PM emissions were more reliant on vehicle mileage, whereas resuspension of road dust was more dependent on vehicle weight. This finding can serve as a guideline for policymakers to design mitigation strategies for reducing extra PM emissions due to the electrification of buses by reasonably reducing vehicle weight and annual mileage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3adust 3aguidelines 3aparticulate emissions 3aparticulates 0aElectric bus 0aDiesel bus 0aParticulate matter 0aNon-exhaust emission 0aPublic transit network1 aLiu, Ye1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9367-35321 aHu, Dawei1 aZhu, Lan0 tChemosphere.g2022 Nov., v. 306 p.135523-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01856naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011000154300002000264520083400284592002801118650001601146650001201162650002101174650001401195650001501209650002201224700001301246700001901259700001601278700001601294773012401310856007501434852000901509655001201518IND60778929520221123004822.0220603e20220513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077892952DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra01822e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Xuan10aHalogen-free instinct flame-retardant waterborne polyurethanes: composition, performance, and application  ap. 14509-14520.  aIdeal halogen-free instinct flame-retardant waterborne polyurethanes have high flame-retardant efficiency, environmental friendliness, fine compatibility, and good thermostability. Phosphorus flame-retardants are currently widely used in halogen-free instinct flame-retardant waterborne polyurethanes (HIFWPU), especially those with phosphorous–nitrogen co-structures. Phosphorous–nitrogen HIFWPU have become a hotspot because their co-structures provide higher flame-retardance as compared to waterborne polyurethanes. This review introduces three main types of HIFWPU based on composition, performance and application. HIFWPU not only have improved flame-retardance but also satisfy the various requirements for functionality.

This article introduces the most common analytical approaches for camera‐trap data. Camera traps are generally used as point‐based sampling devices, and many analytical methods require spatial independence of camera‐trap stations and temporal independence of subsequent records. Photographic rates of species should be interpreted with care, because they confound abundance/use with detectability. Occupancy models estimate species occurrence while accounting for imperfect detection and can reveal species–habitat associations. Capture–recapture models estimate abundance and detection probability from individual detection/nondetection data and are applicable to camera‐trap data for individually recognizable species. Spatial capture–recapture extends this framework by accounting for animal movement and location relative to the trap array. This is particularly useful for the often wide‐ranging species typically studied with camera traps and presents possibilities of modelling spatial population processes. Several methods have been developed to estimate abundance for species that cannot be individually identified; they all heavily rely on model assumptions. Finally, time stamps on camera‐trap records can be used to describe activity pattern and temporal interactions between species. Considering the usefulness of camera trapping, we expect ongoing development of analytical approaches for camera‐trap data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aanimals 3acameras 3aecology 3amodels 3aprobability 3awildlife0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2018 Dec., v. 56, no. 4 p.740-749dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl31087x0141-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.125573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245009800178300001600276520132300292592002801615650001601643650002601659650001501685650002401700650001001724650002101734650001101755650001501766700002101781700002001802700002401822773008201846856008901928852000902017655001202026IND60095874220221119155706.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009587422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2011.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuzaki, Ryosuke10aCross-sectional monitoring of resin impregnation using an area-sensor array in an RTM process  ap. 695-702.  aIt is difficult to visualize the flow in the cross-section direction, and most conventional methods for monitoring resin flow are limited to the in-plane direction. This study investigates the monitoring of the cross-section of resin impregnation using an area-sensor array during a resin transfer molding (RTM) process. The area-sensor array is mounted on a thin polyimide film that is integrated with the inter-digital electrode array and associated wiring, and forms the bottom layer of the stacked composite laminates. Each area-sensor is square-shaped and measures the capacitance and electrical resistance of the sensor region. First, we constructed the equivalent electrical circuit model of in-plane and out-of-plane impregnation. Using this model, we proposed a method to identify the flow direction and the ratio of the impregnation thickness by measuring the electrical capacitance and resistance. The validity of the model was confirmed by comparison with the experimental results. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, the area-sensor array was applied to monitoring the resin injection through-thickness to the glass fabric laminates. As a result, the cross-section of the impregnated area could be estimated and the estimated area provided a good match to the actual impregnated area.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3aelectrical resistance 3aelectrodes 3aelectronic circuits 3aglass 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amonitoring1 aKobayashi, Seiji1 aTodoroki, Akira1 aMizutani, Yoshihiro0 tComposites.g2012 Apr., v. 43, no. 4 p.695-702dElsevier Ltdx1359-835X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2011.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011900169520137500288592002801663650001301691650002101704650002401725650001701749650001601766650001101782650002301793650003401816650002101850650002401871650002801895650001201923650002301935650001801958650002201976650001101998653002102009653003002030653001502060653002802075653003702103700001702140700001502157700001502172700001802187773009802205856008702303852000902390655001202399IND60695414120221119022400.0201023e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069541412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1151012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Huihui10aBiogas upgrading and energy storage via electromethanogenesis using intact anaerobic granular sludge as biocathode  aMicrobial electrochemical system is a promising CO₂-to-CH₄ conversion technology that can upgrade raw biogas to high calorific content for downstream applications. The development of efficient, robust, and cost-effective biocathode is the pivotal issue for its industrial application. In this study, intact anaerobic granular sludge (AGS), which was the conventional biocatalyst in anaerobic digestion processes for high-efficiency CH₄ production, was for the first time employed as biocathode in electromethanogenesis system (EM) for biogas upgrading. The applied voltage (0, 3, 4, and 5 V) and biogas flow rate (5.22–23.43 mL/h) were modulated to optimize biogas upgrading performance in the AGS-EM system. The CH₄ content in treated biogas could reach as high as 97.9 ± 2.3% at an applied voltage of 4 V and a gas flow rate of 17.79 mL/h. The system showed superior stability and anti-interference ability in the continuous operation mode for 2 months. 16S rRNA sequencing results showed that Methanobacterium and Azoarcus were the dominant populations in biocathode. The AGS-EM system obtained an energy benefit of 477.3 kJ/molbᵢₒgₐₛ, and economic benefit of 446.4 EUR/m³bᵢₒgₐₛ.

Growth of these forests is known to be dependent on the salinity of soil water, but the influence of foliar uptake of rainwater as a freshwater source, additional to soil water, has hardly been investigated. Under field conditions in Australia, stem diameter variation, sap flow and stem water potential of the grey mangrove (Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh.) were simultaneously measured during alternating dry and rainy periods. We found that sap flow in A. marina was reversed, from canopy to roots, during and shortly after rainfall events. Simultaneously, stem diameters rapidly increased with growth rates up to 70 μm h⁻¹, which is about 25–75 times the normal growth rate reported in temperate trees. A mechanistic tree model was applied to provide evidence that A. marina trees take up water through their leaves, and that this water contributes to turgor-driven stem growth. Our results indicate that direct uptake of freshwater by the canopy during rainfall supports mangrove tree growth and serve as a call to consider this water uptake pathway if we aspire to correctly assess influences of changing rainfall patterns on mangrove tree growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvicennia marina 3aanimals 3acanopy 3acarbon dioxide 3afoliar uptake 3afreshwater 3aleaves 3amangrove forests 3amangroves (trees) 3amodels 3arain 3aroots 3asap flow 3asoil water 3astem elongation 3astorms 3atree growth 3awater potential 3awater uptake 3awet season 3awood 3aAustralia 0adendrometer 0afoliar absorption of intercepted rainfall 0afoliar water uptake 0ahydraulic redistribution 0amangrove 0amechanistic tree modelling 0asap flow 0asoil–plant–atmosphere continuum 0astem diameter variations 0aturgor-driven radial stem growth1 aVandegehuchte, Maurits W1 aVan de Wal, Bart A E1 aHoste, Pieter1 aGuyot, Adrien1 aLovelock, Catherine E1 aLockington, David A1 aTognetti, R.,0 tTree physiology.g2018 Mar. 17, v. 38, no. 7 p.979-991dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl41003x1758-44697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpy0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02088naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002600155245006400181300001600245500001500261520109700276592002801373650002501401650001601426650001901442650002401461650001201485650001001497650001901507653002101526700002301547773008201570856008901652852000901741655001201750IND60095874420221119155912.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009587442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrbulov, Imre Norbert10aCompressive characteristics of metal matrix syntactic foams  ap. 553-561.  a2019-12-06  aThe compressive behaviour of eight different metal matrix syntactic foams (MMSFs) are investigated and presented. The results showed that the engineering factors as chemical compositions of the matrix material, the size of the microballoons, the previously applied heat treatment and the temperature of the compression tests have significant effects on the compressive properties. The smaller microballoons with thinner wall ensured higher compressive strength due to their more flawless microstructure and better mechanical stability. According to the heat treatments, the T6 treatments were less effective than expected; the parameters of the treatment should be further optimised. The elevated temperature tests revealed ∼30% drop in the compressive strength. However, the strength remained high enough for structural applications; therefore MMSFs are good choices for light structural parts working at elevated or room temperature. The chemical composition – microballoon type – heat treatment combinations give good potential for tailoring the compressive characteristics of MMSFs.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3aengineering 3amicrostructure 3aambient temperature 3atesting 3afoams 3aheat treatment 0aroom temperature1 aGinsztler, János,0 tComposites.g2012 Apr., v. 43, no. 4 p.553-561dElsevier Ltdx1359-835X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007100139245011700210300001800327500001700345520131100362592002801673650001201701650001701713650001401730650002401744650000901768650001201777650001401789650001001803650001001813650001401823650002001837650001201857650001101869650001501880650001401895700002301909700002201932773012101954856007402075852000902149655001202158IND60785876220221120064947.0220729e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078587622DNAL7 a10.1111/vsu.138212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, K.

ANIMALS: Twelve‐year‐old male neutered Chihuahua mix dog. STUDY DESIGN: Case report METHODS: The dog presented for the evaluation of a hepatic mass. Computed tomography of thorax and abdomen was performed, and a right lateral liver lobe mass and a right adrenal mass were noted. The adrenal mass had a caval thrombus extending almost to the level of the right atrium. Traditional methods of tumor thrombectomy were unsuccessful. Extraction of the thrombus was facilitated by passing a balloon catheter through the caudal vena cavotomy until it was cranial to the thrombus, inflating the balloon and slowly withdrawing the catheter. RESULTS: A malignant pheochromocytoma was diagnosed on histology. The dog had a subjectively assessed good quality of life until it was euthanized 118 days postoperatively for acute dyspnea. CONCLUSION: Balloon catheter‐assisted thrombectomy was successful in removing an extensive caval thrombus that was otherwise difficult to extract via conventional methods. This technique can be considered in cases with extensive tumor thrombus either as a method of choice or when other methods of thrombus extraction have failed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdomen 3acase studies 3acatheters 3acomputed tomography 3adogs 3adyspnea 3ahistology 3aliver 3amales 3aneoplasms 3aquality of life 3asurgery 3athorax 3athrombosis 3avena cava1 aStanley, Bryden J.1 aDegner, Daniel A.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2022 Aug., v. 51, no. 6 p.1016-1022dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10192x0161-34997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vsu.138213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002900155245014500184520120500329592002801534650002301562650001701585650001801602650001601620650001301636650003101649650001601680650002001696650002101716650001101737650000901748650002701757650001601784653002801800653002301828653001401851653001401865653001301879653002101892700002401913700002201937700001701959700002501976700006702001773009102068856009002159852000902249655001202258IND60782062220221121234021.0220830e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078206222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarayanan, Mathiyazhagan10aPhytoremediation potential of Gossypium hirsutum on abandoned polluted chromium sludge soil with the amalgamation of Streptomyces tritici D5  aThe phytoremediation potency of Gossypium hirsutum was explored in this research under the influence of pre-identified metal tolerant Streptomyces tritici D5 in Cr enriched sludge soil using various treatment sets (I to V) in a greenhouse setting. Interestingly, the G. hirsutum remarkable remediate the Cr metal from the Cr enriched sludge soil under diluted (50:50) condition in 90 days of greenhouse experiment. The S. tritici D5 also effectively support the growth and phytoremediation competence of G. hirsutum. This was evidenced by the under the diluted (set III) condition the growth and major biomolecules such as protein, carbohydrate, and chlorophyll content of G. hirsutum were considerably increased in quantity. Hence, the phytoremediation potential of G. hirsutum was effective at soil diluted with fertile and xenobiotics free soil with dilution ratio of 50:50 (set III) and followed by 75:25 (set II) ratio. Thus, under diluted conditions (50:50) G. hirsutum seed coated with S. tritici D5 showed an outstanding phytoremediation process. Therefore, this method can be implemented to the field level study to assess the metal removal prospects of this environmentally friendly method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aStreptomyces 3acarbohydrates 3achlorophyll 3achromium 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3ametal tolerance 3aphytoremediation 3asludge 3asoil 3asustainable technology 3axenobiotics 0aStreptomyces tritici D5 0aGossypium hirsutum 0aCr sludge 0aPollution 0aIn-vitro 0aPhytoremediation1 aKaruppusamy, Indira1 aAlshiekheid, Maha1 aSabour, Amal1 aChi, Nguyen Thuy Lan1 aPugazhendhi, Arivalagan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9529-33060 tChemosphere.g2022 Nov., v. 306 p.135526-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001400156245013400170500001900304520134100323592002801664650002801692650001401720650001401734650002501748650002501773650002001798650001001818650001801828650000901846650001001855650002401865653001801889653001201907653002401919653002301943653001401966700001701980700001701997700001702014700001602031700001802047773009302065856009102158852000902249655001202258IND60707452020221117060241.0200907e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070745202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1203102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Chao10aAutologous cell membrane coatings on tissue engineering xenografts for suppression and alleviation of acute host immune responses  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aXenogeneic extracellular matrix (ECM) based tissue engineering graft is one of the most promising products for transplantation therapies, which could alleviate the pain of patients and reduce surgery cost. However, in order to put ECM based xenografts into clinical use, the induced inflammatory and immune responses have yet to be resolved. Cell membrane is embedded with membrane proteins for regulation of cell interactions including self-recognition and potent in reducing foreign body rejections. In this study, a novel and facile method for evasion from immune system was developed by coating autologous red blood cell membrane as a disguise on xenogeneic ECM based tissue engineering graft surface. Porcine source Living Hyaline Cartilage Graft (LhCG) and decellularized LhCG (dLhCG) established by our group for cartilage tissue engineering were chosen as model grafts. The cell membrane coating was quite stable on xenografts with no obvious decrease in amount for 4 weeks. The autologous cell membrane coated xenograft has been proved to be recognized as “self” by immune system on cell, protein and gene levels according to the 14-day lasting in vivo study on rats with less inflammatory cells infiltrated and low inflammation-related cytokines gene expression, showing alleviated acute immune and inflammatory responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3acartilage 3acytokines 3aerythrocyte membrane 3aextracellular matrix 3agene expression 3agenes 3aimmune system 3apain 3aswine 3axenotransplantation 0aCell membrane 0aCoating 0aImmunocompatibility 0aTissue engineering 0aXenograft1 aNie, Xiaolei1 aZhu, Wenzhen1 aIqbal, Jabed1 aXu, Chenjie1 aWang, Dong-An0 tBiomaterials.g2020 Nov., v. 258 p.120310-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1203103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01367naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015500166300001600321500001400337520034700351592002800698650001600726650001100742650001600753650001600769651001000785653001500795653003100810653001300841773009700854856008100951852000901032655001201041IND60724319320221118083456.0210121e20210113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072431932DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.110.595302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Hai-Tian12aA new species of Coomaniella (Coleoptera, Buprestidae, Coomaniellini) from Guangxi, China, with new distributional records and biological observations  ap. 185-190.  aNAL-light  aA new species Coomaniella (Coomaniella) dentatasp. nov. from Guangxi Province, China, is described and placed in the C.

In the current study we determined the heat resistance of a particularly stress tolerant C. sakazakii strain, C. sakazakii DPC 6529, and monitored the behavior of a lux-tagged derivative under different reconstitution and handling scenarios in a commercial brand of PIF. Some of the molecular mechanisms involved in the heat stress response were investigated using a transposon mutagenesis approach. Survival curves of C. sakazakii DPC 6529 in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth and PIF at various temperatures (58, 60, 62 and 64°C) displayed an upward concavity and were fitted to the non-linear Weibull model. While at the highest treatment temperatures heat resistance was lower in PIF than in LB broth, at lower temperatures no significant differences in heat resistance were observed. Experiments in real time with artificially inoculated PIF reconstituted at different water temperatures (50, 55, 60, 65, 70°C) and cooled at different rates confirmed that C. sakazakii can survive for long time periods in powdered formula, and is capable of proliferating after reconstitution. The use of water at temperatures between 50 and 65°C for reconstitution did not provide a significant inactivation of C. sakazakii cells. Reconstitution at 70°C reduced the bacterium to levels below the detection limit, although survivors were able to proliferate and reached dangerous levels when the reconstituted product was stored for a long time at room temperature. The cooling rate had an important impact on survival and subsequent growth of C. sakazakii, which makes it advisable to avoid rapid cooling of baby formula. Transposon mutagenesis allowed the identification of some of the molecular mechanisms involved in the response of C. sakazakii DPC6529 to heat stress. Genes identified included the Ribosome Maturation Protein RimP and Outer Membrane Porin L (OmpL). Results suggest that de novo protein synthesis, and the uptake of cysteine for the formation of disulfide bonds for protein stabilization, are key processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCronobacter sakazakii 3aWeibull statistics 3aambient temperature 3abacteria 3acooling 3acysteine 3adetection limit 3adisulfide bonds 3aenterocolitis 3agenes 3aheat shock response 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ainfant formulas 3ameningitis 3amutagenesis 3aneonates 3apathogens 3aporins 3aprotein synthesis 3aribosomes 3asepticemia 3atransposons 3awater temperature 0aCronobacter sakazakii 0aHeat resistance 0aPowered Infant Formula 0aHeat stress 0aTransposon mutagenesis 0aGrowth 0aBioluminescence1 aAlvarez-Ordõnez, Avelino,1 aMorrissey, Ruth1 aRos-Chumillas, Maria1 aEsteban, Maria-Dolores1 aMaté, Javier1 aPalop, Alfredo1 aHill, Colin0 tFood research international.g2015 Mar., v. 69 p.401-409dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03490naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245010200201300001600303500002000319520138700339592002801726596003801754596002501792596003101817596004301848596003201891596001901923596001401942596003601956596002301992596002302015596003402038596005502072596005302127650002302180650001502203650002902218650001202247650001002259650002002269650001802289650001602307650001602323650002202339650002902361650001502390650001502405650001902420650000902439650001002448650001202458650001302470651001502483700002102498700001802519700002902537700002202566700002002588773012602608856007302734852000902807655001202816IND60624044220221120211931.0181130e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062404422DNAL7 a10.1111/aje.125522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaynor, Kaitlyn M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5747-054310aEffects of human settlement and roads on diel activity patterns of elephants (Loxodonta africana)  ap. 872-881.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAs the human footprint expands worldwide, people and wildlife are coming into greater contact, and areas of human activity may be simultaneously associated with risk and reward for animals. To avoid human threats while exploiting opportunities, animals may adjust their spatiotemporal activity, using areas of anthropogenic disturbance at night when people are less active. We combined four camera trap datasets from Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park to evaluate the effects of roads and settlement on diel activity patterns of elephants (Loxodonta africana). We found high rates of elephant activity along the boundary of the park, where elephants can access cultivated crops, and along roads, which serve as movement corridors. However, elephants restricted their activity to the night and crepuscular periods in these areas of human disturbance, seeking refuge in the interior of the park away from roads and settlements during the day. Our findings suggest that a history of killing and antagonism has instilled a fear of humans in this elephant population, with implications for research, tourism and human–elephant coexistence. Our study highlights the utility of camera traps in monitoring human–wildlife conflict and habituation and demonstrates the value of integrating disparate camera trap datasets for comparative analyses on landscape or even continental scales.  aPublisher supplied data  aGRFPcNational Science Foundation  cElephant Crisis Fund  cCrystal Springs Foundation  cUC Berkeley Center for African Studies  cNational Geographic Society  cExplorers Club  cIdea Wild  cHoward Hughes Medical Institute  cRufford Foundation  cSave the Elephants  cGorongosa Restoration Project  cUnited States Agency for International Development  cUniversity of Idaho College of Natural Resources 3aLoxodonta africana 3aantagonism 3aanthropogenic activities 3acameras 3acrops 3adata collection 3adiel activity 3afearfulness 3ahabituation 3ahuman settlements 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3anational parks 3arisk 3aroads 3atourism 3awildlife 3aMozambique1 aBranco, Paola S.1 aLong, Ryan A.1 aGonçalves, Dominique D.1 aGranli, Petter K.1 aPoole, Joyce H.0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2018 Dec., v. 56, no. 4 p.872-881dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl31087x0141-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.125523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006500155245007100220520167800291592002801969650001301997650002302010650001302033650001502046650002102061650001802082650002002100650001502120650002502135653002502160653002402185653002402209653002002233653001702253653001402270700002202284700002002306700002102326700002502347700001602372700002402388700002102412700001902433773009102452856009002543852000902633655001202642IND60782062320221121234154.0220830e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078206232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Shams Forruque1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3360-363610aStrategies to improve membrane performance in wastewater treatment  aMembrane technology has rapidly gained popularity in wastewater treatment due to its cost-effectiveness, environmentally friendly tools, and elevated productivity. Although membrane performance in wastewater treatment has been reviewed in several past studies, the key techniques for improving membrane performance, as well as their challenges, and solutions associated with the membrane process, were not sufficiently highlighted in those studies. Also, very few studies have addressed hybrid techniques to improve membrane performance. The present review aims to fill those gaps and achieve public health benefits through safe water processing. Despite its higher cost, membrane performance can result in a 36% reduction in flux degradation. The issue with fouling has been identified as one of the key challenges of membrane technology. Chemical cleaning is quite effective in removing accumulated foulant. Fouling mitigation techniques have also been shown to have a positive effect on membrane photobioreactors that handle wastewater effluent, resulting in a 50% and 60% reduction in fouling rates for backwash and nitrogen bubble scouring techniques. Membrane hybrid approaches such as hybrid forward-reverse osmosis show promise in removing high concentrations of phosphorus, ammonium, and salt from wastewater. The incorporation of the forward osmosis process can reject 99% of phosphorus and 97% of ammonium, and the reverse osmosis approach can achieve a 99% salt rejection rate. The control strategies for membrane fouling have not been successfully optimized yet and more research is needed to achieve a realistic, long-term direct membrane filtering operation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3acost effectiveness 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphotobioreactors 3apublic health 3areverse osmosis 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aWastewater treatment 0aMembrane filtration 0aMembrane bioreactor 0aFouling control 0aPretreatment 0aAdsorbent1 aMehejabin, Fatema1 aMomtahin, Adiba1 aTasannum, Nuzaba1 aFaria, Nishat Tasnim1 aMofijur, M.1 aHoàng, Anh Tuấn,1 aN.

Because dung beetles are favoured as bioindicators, we studied the trophic preference of a southern African beetle community and its potential effects on surveys of beetle diversity using manual sampling of droppings and pitfall traps baited with carnivore, ruminant or nonruminant dung. Manual sampling showed no significant differences between dung types in either dung beetles abundance or species richness. Generalised linear mixed models of total and endocoprid abundances, species richness and Real Shannon index of trap samples showed higher dung beetle diversity associated with ruminant than with nonruminant dung, which in turn was significantly preferred over carnivore dung. Hide beetles (248 Troginae specimens) were attracted almost exclusively to carnivore dung. Paracoprid abundance was comparable between ruminant and nonruminant dung. IndVal analysis showed that, of a total of 47 species, six preferred ruminant dung and only one preferred nonruminant dung. These results imply that different dung beetle species may be used as ecological indicators, depending on their natural history, and that the survey method and the dung type used to survey will influence such assessment results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3abait traps 3acarnivores 3adung beetles 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental indicators 3afeces 3ainsect communities 3anatural history 3apitfall traps 3aruminants 3aspecies richness 3asurveys1 aBalmer, Jonathan P.1 aVillet, Martin H.0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2018 Dec., v. 56, no. 4 p.938-948dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl31087x0141-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.125233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01890naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245008700171300001600258520096300274592002801237650002301265650002601288650002001314650001901334700001801353700002001371700001701391773008201408856008901490852000901579655001201588IND60095874920221119155846.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009587492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2011.12.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrask, R.S.10aInfluence of process induced defects on the failure of composite T-joint specimens  ap. 748-757.  aAn experimental investigation of the failure load of T-joint structures has been undertaken, with a focus on the influence of process induced defects within the deltoid area. Static pull-off tension tests have been conducted for a comparative assessment. An extensive literature review on the subject to place is also presented. The role of the deltoid area in stabilizing the primary load bearing plies and minimising the volume fraction reduction in the off-axis plies is critical to maximise the failure load and minimise the performance variability of the T-joint structures. A deltoid area reduction of 25%, with no change in the external geometry, yielded a similar mechanical performance to the nominal baseline specimen but with increased variability. However, a reduction of 50% in the deltoid area yielded a strength reduction of 33%. The findings of this study suggest that the reduction in the deltoid area can be tolerated within certain limits.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3amechanical properties 3aproduct defects 3astatic testing1 aHallett, S.R.1 aHelenon, F.M.M.1 aWisnom, M.R.0 tComposites.g2012 Apr., v. 43, no. 4 p.748-757dElsevier Ltdx1359-835X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2011.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01726naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011000159300002000269520073900289592002801028650001601056650002201072650002401094650002201118700001701140700001401157700001501171700001801186773012401204856007501328852000901403655001201412IND60778930120221121234228.0220603e20220516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077893012DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra01900k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Mingming10aHigh-quality all-inorganic CsPbBr₃ single crystals prepared by a facile one-step solution growth method  ap. 14838-14843.  aIn this report, a facile one-step solution growth method has been proposed to synthesize high-quality all-inorganic CsPbBr₃ single crystals.

We used a mixed method approach, whereby qualitative and quantitative approaches are combined, to develop, implement and validate a TST system for GINs in small ruminants, most commonly goats, among smallholder farmers in the Makgadikgadi Pans region of Botswana, and to seek better understanding of system performance within a cultural context. After the first six months of the study, 42 out of 47 enrolled farmers were followed up; 52% had monitored their animals using the taught inspection criteria and 26% applied TST during this phase. Uptake level showed little correlation with farmer characteristics, such as literacy and size of farm. Herd health significantly improved in those herds where anthelmintic treatment was applied: anaemia, as assessed using the five-point FAMACHA© scale, was 0.44–0.69 points better (95% confidence interval) and body condition score was 0.18–0.36 points better (95% C.I., five-point scale) in treated compared with untreated herds. Only targeting individuals in greatest need led to similar health improvements compared to treating the entire herd, leading to dose savings ranging from 36% to 97%. This study demonstrates that TST against nematodes can be implemented effectively by resource-poor farmers using a community-led approach. The use of mixed methods provides a promising system to integrate technical and social aspects of TST programmes for maximum uptake and effect.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanemia 3aanthelmintics 3acost effectiveness 3afarm size 3afarmers 3afood security 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3agoats 3aherd health 3aherds 3aliteracy 3arefining 3aBotswana 0aFAMACHA© 0aParticipatory epidemiology 0aLivestock management 0aGoats 0aTargeted selective treatment 0aNematodes1 aOfithile, Mphoeng1 aTavolaro, F.

Although most of the double bonds found in polyketides are trans or E-configured, several cases are known in which cis or Z-configurations are observed. Double bond formation by polyketide synthases (PKSs) is widely recognised to be catalysed by ketoreduction and subsequent dehydration of the acyl carrier protein (ACP)-tethered 3-ketoacyl intermediate in the PKS biosynthetic assembly line with a specific stereochemical course in which the ketoreduction step determines the usual trans or more rare cis double bond configuration. Occasionally, other mechanisms for the installation of cis double bonds such as double bond formation during chain release or post-PKS modifications including, amongst others, isomerisations or double bond installations by oxidation are observed. This review discusses the peculiar mechanisms of cis double bond formation in polyketide biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacyl carrier protein 3abiosynthesis 3aoxidation 3apolyketide synthases 3apolyketides 3asecondary metabolites 3astereochemistry1 aDickschat, Jeroen S.0 tNatural product reports.g2021 Aug. 18, v. 38, no. 8 p.1445-1468dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26900x1460-47527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0np00091d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03858naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245014200199300001600341500001400357500002000371520213300391592002802524596008102552650001702633650001902650650002102669650001502690650001202705650001302717650002002730650002102750650001802771650003002789650001102819650001402830650001502844650001502859650001502874650002202889650001602911650001702927650001602944650001002960651001802970700006402988700006103052773013303113856007303246852000903319655001203328IND60724319620221118083422.0210121e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072431962DNAL7 a10.1111/geb.132092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Squin, Amaël1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3516-415510aClimate‐induced variation in the demography of 14 tree species is not sufficient to explain their distribution in eastern North America  ap. 352-369.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Dynamic range models are proposed to investigate species distributions and to project range shifts under climate change. They are based upon the Hutchinsonian niche theory, specifying that the occurrence of a species in an environmental space should be limited to positions where the intrinsic growth rate is positive. Evaluating population growth rate is, however, difficult for physiologically structured populations, such as forest stands, owing to size‐induced individual variation in performance. Therefore, we still have a limited understanding of which aspect of tree demography contributes the most to their geographical range limit. We develop an index of demographic performance for size‐structured populations and study its variation across a climatic gradient. We then investigate the relationship between the demographic performance index and species distribution. LOCATION: North America (57–124° W, 26–52° N). TIME PERIOD: 1963–2010. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Fourteen tree species. METHODS: We represent forest dynamics with a size‐structured population model and neighbourhood competition with the perfect plasticity approximation. We then derive the lifetime reproduction per individual, R0, in the absence of density dependence. Using forest inventory data, we assess how tree demography for each species varies with climate. We test the model by comparing R0 and the probability of occurrence within species ranges. RESULTS: We find that both growth and mortality rates vary across species distributions, but climate explains little of the observed variation. Individual size and neighbourhood competition are the primary explanatory variables of tree demography. Finally, we find that R0 relates weakly to the probability of occurrence, with no systematic decline in population growth rates towards the range limits. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Spatial and size‐induced variation in tree growth and mortality do not explain range limits and are insufficient to enable an understanding of tree dynamics. We propose that phenomena perceived mostly at the metapopulation scale should also be considered.  aPublisher supplied data  aStrategic grantcNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3ademography 3adensity 3adynamics 3aforest dynamics 3aforest inventory 3aforest stands 3ageographical distribution 3amodels 3amortality 3aoccurrence 3aplasticity 3apopulation 3apopulation growth 3aprobability 3areproduction 3atree growth 3atrees 3aNorth America1 aBoulangeat, Isabelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8463-70461 aGravel, Dominique1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4498-70760 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2021 Feb., v. 30, no. 2 p.352-369dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3920180x1466-822X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.132093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011700173520153200290592002801822650001401850650001601864650001101880650001701891650002401908650002301932650002301955650001101978650001601989653004702005653002902052653003702081653003402118653002502152700001702177700002002194700002102214700002002235700001802255773011202273856008702385852000902472655001202481IND60695414820221119022545.0201023e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069541482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1151182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElkazaz, Mahmoud12aA hierarchical two-stage energy management for a home microgrid using model predictive and real-time controllers  aThis paper presents a hierarchical two-layer home energy management system to reduce daily household energy costs and maximize photovoltaic self-consumption. The upper layer comprises a model predictive controller which optimizes household energy usage using a mixed-integer linear programming optimization; the lower layer comprises a rule-based real-time controller, to determine the optimal power settings of the home battery storage system. The optimization process also includes load shifting and battery degradation costs. The upper layer determines the operating schedule for shiftable domestic appliances and the profile for energy storage for the next 24 h. This profile is then passed to the lower energy management layer, which compensates for the effects of forecast uncertainties and sample time resolution. The effectiveness of the proposed home energy management system is demonstrated by comparing its performance with a single-layer management system. For the same battery size, using the hierarchical two-layer home energy management system can achieve annual household energy payment reduction of 27.8% and photovoltaic self-consumption of 91.1% compared to using a single layer home energy management system. The results show the capability of the hierarchical home energy management system to reduce household utility bills and maximize photovoltaic self-consumption. Experimental studies on a laboratory-based house emulation rig demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed home energy management system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acontrollers 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3ahousehold equipment 3alinear programming 3amanagement systems 3amodels 3auncertainty 0aHierarchical home energy management system 0aModel predictive control 0aMixed-integer linear programming 0aBattery energy storage system 0aReal-time controller1 aSumner, Mark1 aNaghiyev, Eldar1 aPholboon, Seksak1 aDavies, Richard1 aThomas, David0 tApplied energy.g2020 July 01, v. 269 p.115118-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1151183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005200142245008200194300001800276500002000294520146400314592002801778596001801806650001401824650001401838650001501852650002401867650001301891650001301904650001901917700006401936700005702000773013102057856007702188852000902265655001202274IND60789668320221116173851.0220822e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078966832DNAL7 a10.1002/2016JC0126232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPein, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5554-389210aSecondary Circulation Asymmetry in a Meandering, Partially Stratified Estuary  ap. 1670-1683.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNumerical model experiments are used to study the effects of multiple channel bends on estuarine dynamics and, in particular, on secondary flows. These effects are demonstrated by comparing experiments with two different idealized trumpet‐shaped estuaries, one straight and another one with a ∼8 km meandering section in the middle of the estuary. Meanders complicate the flow field by introducing secondary processes. For instance, meanders increase turbulence and associated mixing locally within the water column, as well as outside the meandering portion. Furthermore, meanders transform up to 30% of the along‐channel momentum into secondary circulation. Production of turbulence and secondary currents is different at flood and ebb tidal phases. At flood, meanders lead to unstable stratification and increased turbulence. At ebb, the flow develops a helical pattern and adjusts to the channel curvature with minimal decrease in density stability. The secondary circulation asymmetry is caused by an interplay between the across‐channel baroclinic pressure gradient force and the centrifugal force. During ebb both forces enhance each other, whereas they oppose during flood. As a consequence of this interaction between baroclinic forcing and curving morphology, ebb flows and horizontal buoyancy fluxes increase relative to flood. The enhanced ebb dominance shifts a density front toward the mouth of the estuary, thus reducing salt intrusion.  aPublisher supplied data  cBMBF, Germany 3aasymmetry 3aestuaries 3ageophysics 3amathematical models 3amomentum 3aresearch 3aturbulent flow1 aValle‐Levinson, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3852-09711 aStanev, E.

However, the essential role of selenium in plant metabolism remains unclear. When used in moderate concentrations, selenium promotes plant physiological processes such as enhancing plant growth, increasing antioxidant capacity, reducing reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation and offering stress resistance by preventing ferroptosis cell death. Ferroptosis, a recently discovered mechanism of regulated cell death (RCD) with unique features such as iron-dependant accumulation of lipid peroxides, is distinctly different from other known forms of cell death. Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity plays a significant role in scavenging the toxic by-products of lipid peroxidation in plants. A low level of GPX activity in plants causes high oxidative stress, which leads to ferroptosis. An integrated view of ferroptosis and selenium in plants and the selenium-mediated nanofertilizers (SeNPs) have been discussed in more recent studies. For instance, selenium supplementation enhanced GPX4 expression and increased TFH cell (Follicular helper T) numbers and the gene transcriptional program, which prevent lipid peroxidase and protect cells from ferroptosis. However, though ferroptosis in plants is similar to that in animals, only few studies have focused on plant-specific ferroptosis; the research on ferroptosis in plants is still in its infancy. Understanding the implication of selenium with relevance to ferroptosis is indispensable for plant bioresource technology. In this review, we hypothesize that blocking ferroptosis cell death improves plant immunity and protects plants from abiotic and biotic stresses. We also examine how SeNPs can be the basis for emerging unconventional and advanced technologies for algae/bamboo biomass production. For instance, algae treated with SeNPs accumulate high lipid profile in algal cells that could thence be used for biodiesel production. We also suggest that further studies in the field of SeNPs are essential for the successful application of this technology for the large-scale production of plant biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aantioxidant activity 3abamboos 3abiodiesel 3abiomass production 3acrop production 3aferroptosis 3agenes 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aimmunity 3alipid composition 3alipid peroxidation 3ametabolism 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3aphytomass 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aselenium 3astress tolerance 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 0aSelenium-induced 0aFerroptosis 0aLipid peroxidase 0aSelenium accumulation 0aSelenium fertilization 0aNanoparticles 0aAlgae 0aRCD - 0aPCD - 0aGSH - 0aGPX4 - 0aROS - 0aER - 0aSeCys - 0aSeMet -1 aArivalagan, Jaison1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8426-52731 aSatish, Lakkakula1 aMohan, Manikandan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0132-75101 aSamuel Selvan Christyraj, Johnson Retnaraj1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7662-81501 aChandran, Sam Aldrin1 aJu, Ho-Jong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8634-20251 aJohn L, Anoopa1 aRamesh, Thiyagarajan1 aIgnacimuthu, Savarimuthu1 aKalishwaralal, Kalimuthu0 tChemosphere.g2022 Nov., v. 306 p.135531-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03668naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006900139245009100208300001600299500001400315500002000329520200000349592002802349596012102377650001902498650002902517650000902546650001702555650001702572650001502589650001602604650001202620650001102632650001402643650001802657650002102675650001802696650001102714650001402725650001602739650001502755651001302770700002102783700001802804700002602822700002002848700002002868700002302888773013302911856007303044852000903117655001203126IND60724319920221118083047.0210121e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072431992DNAL7 a10.1111/geb.132322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdeleye, Matthew Adesanya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6034-580710aLong‐term drivers of vegetation turnover in Southern Hemisphere temperate ecosystems  ap. 557-571.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Knowledge of the drivers of ecosystem changes in the past is key to understanding present ecosystem responses to changes in climate, fire regimes and anthropogenic impacts. Northern Hemisphere‐focussed studies suggest that climate and human activities drove turnover during the Holocene in temperate ecosystems. Various drivers have been invoked to explain changes in Southern Hemisphere temperate vegetation, but the region lacks a quantitative assessment of these drivers. To better understand the regional drivers of past diversity, we present a quantitative meta‐analysis study of turnover and richness during the lateglacial and Holocene in Australian temperate ecosystems. LOCATION: South‐east Australia (Tasmania, Bass Strait, SE mainland). METHODS: We conducted a meta‐analysis study of 24 fossil pollen records across south‐east Australian temperate ecosystems, applying an empirical turnover threshold to fossil records to identify periods of major turnover for the first time in Australia. We tested pollen richness as a proxy for vegetation richness to estimate past richness and applied this to fossil pollen data. The resulting reconstructions were compared to independent records of climate, sea‐level change and fire through generalized linear modelling. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Our results show changes in available moisture and sea level drove turnover and richness in most parts of SE Australia in the past, explaining up to c. 97% deviance. However, fire mainly drove turnover in Bass Strait. Our richness reconstructions also support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, suggesting that high biodiversity was partially maintained by anthropogenic‐managed fire regimes. While temperature change is considered key to Northern Hemisphere palaeodiversity, past turnover and richness in Southern Hemisphere temperate ecosystems responded mainly to moisture availability and sea‐level change (considering its role in modulating regional oceanic climate).  aPublisher supplied data  aCE170100015cAustralian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage support grant 3aHolocene epoch 3aanthropogenic activities 3abass 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3aecosystems 3afire regime 3afossils 3ahumans 3aknowledge 3alinear models 3amaritime climate 3ameta-analysis 3apollen 3asea level 3atemperature 3avegetation 3aTasmania1 aMariani, Michela1 aConnor, Simon1 aHaberle, Simon Graeme1 aHerbert, Annika1 aHopf, Felicitas1 aStevenson, Janelle0 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2021 Feb., v. 30, no. 2 p.557-571dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3920180x1466-822X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.132323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245014100176300001600317520114100333592002801474650001301502650002501515650001101540650001501551650002501566650002301591651001001614700002001624700002901644773009501673856008101768990002301849852000901872655001201881IND60093315120221122214839.0141103e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009331512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.07.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín de la Vega, P.T.10aUpgrading the biological nutrient removal process in decentralized WWTPs based on the intelligent control of alternating aeration cycles  ap. 213-220.  aThis work presents an intelligent alternated aeration process, based on a patented automatic remote control system, applied to decentralized wastewater treatment plants. Two actual small plants (named WWTP1 and WWTP2), with different working conditions defined by their population equivalent (PE) and influent concentrations, were used to test the process. Data were recorded throughout two years. They showed an average decrease of NO₃ ⁻–N in the effluent of about 65% in WWTP1 and 92% in WWTP2, along with low energy consumption, usually <100 WhPE⁻¹day⁻¹. An average decrease in phosphorus of about 65% was also observed in the steady stage, as the system was forced to carry out the enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process. The high efficiency obtained in nutrient removal in these two plants, which are representatives of standard small wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in the South of Spain, proves that the upgrading process proposed in this work may be applied to similar plants in order to adapt them to the new Spanish nutrient removal requirements, providing, in addition, lower energy consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3achemical engineering 3aenergy 3aphosphorus 3awastewater treatment 3aworking conditions 3aSpain1 aJaramillo, M.A.1 aMartínez de Salazar, E.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Oct., v. 232 p.213-220dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.07.0513Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03853naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002100167245010200188300001600290500002000306520248000326592002802806650002302834650001102857650001102868650002202879650001702901650000902918650001802927650002802945650002302973650001302996650001403009650001403023650002303037650001903060650001103079650002003090650001103110650001903121650001303140700001803153773009603171852000903267856010703276655001203383IND2203627920221121014340.0170626e200003  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220362792DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0852:WCSINA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPonsard, Sergine10aWhat can stable isotopes (δ15n and δ13c) tell about the food web of soil macro‐invertebrates?  ap. 852-864.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAnimals reflect the stable isotope ratios (δ¹⁵N and δ¹³C) of their diet, with a slight enrichment in ¹⁵N that allows the use of δ¹⁵N as a trophic‐level indicator. Stable isotope contents were measured for the litter, soil, and macro‐invertebrates of three temperate deciduous forest sites, in spring, summer, and autumn, to study the trophic structure of this community. No distinct trophic structure could be derived from measurements of δ¹³C. In contrast, when the δ¹⁵N values of all animal species were grouped together, the hypothesis of an isotopically similar diet was rejected. Therefore, the community spreads over more than one trophic level and was subdivided into detritivores and predators. The potential detritivore food sources in the forest litter and soil showed a variety of isotopic ratios. Despite this fact, the variance of the isotopic ratios of the detritivorous species was not larger than what could be expected from interspecific variability of trophic isotopic enrichment alone. This was also the case for the predators in most of the sample sets. However, in some cases this variance was significantly larger, due to a small number of species with high δ¹⁵N values. The δ¹⁵N values of the detritivores indicated that the mean δ¹⁵N value of their food was close to that measured for the superficial litter layers. The difference in δ¹⁵N between detritivores and predators was highly significant and never significantly different from the value expected for one trophic transfer (3.4‰), although often slightly higher. Most of the litter macro‐invertebrate community we studied can therefore be described as belonging to two trophic levels, one feeding on the superficial litter layers (or on soil fractions that have a similar δ¹⁵N value), and a second trophic level feeding on the first, with some indication of intraguild predation among the predators. Between‐site differences of up to 7‰ were found for δ¹⁵N in the litter, and the δ¹⁵N values of the whole animal community were shifted in accordance with the local value of the litter δ¹⁵N. Therefore, the trophic structure must be studied in relation to the local isotopic content of the litter. Seasonal differences in isotopic ratios of the litter or animal samples were neither large nor consistent. These findings indicate similar trophic structure of the communities at the three sites and during the three sampling periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal communities 3aautumn 3acarbon 3adeciduous forests 3adetritivores 3adiet 3aforest litter 3ainterspecific variation 3amacroinvertebrates 3anitrogen 3apredation 3apredators 3aseasonal variation 3asoil separates 3aspring 3astable isotopes 3asummer 3atrophic levels 3avariance1 aArditi, Roger0 tEcology.g2000 Mar., v. 81, no. 3 p.852-864dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081%5B0852:WCSINA%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02414naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245010300160300001600263520131200279592002801591650003701619650001501656650002501671650001501696650001701711650000901728650001401737650000701751700001401758700002901772700001601801700001501817773009501832856008101927990002302008852000902031655001202040IND60093315320221122214844.0141103e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009331532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.07.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wen10aMutual promotion mechanism for adsorption of coexisting Cr(III) and Cr(VI) onto titanate nanotubes  ap. 228-236.  aMultilayered titanate nanotubes (TNTs) were shown to provide excellent adsorption of Cr(III), with a maximum adsorption capacity of 88.99mgg⁻¹. Adsorption of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) was mutually promoted when the two ions coexisted at wider pH ranges of 3–6. Compared to single systems, the adsorption capacity of Cr(III) increased from 56.3 to 82.1mgg⁻¹, whereas the Cr(VI) capacity increased from 0 to 9.8mgg⁻¹ in the binary system at pH 5 with 0.6gL⁻¹ TNTs. Cr(III) adsorbed onto the TNTs mainly through ion-exchange with Na⁺ in the interlayers of TNTs, as indicated by the linear relationship between adsorption capacity of Cr(III) and the Na content of TNTs. However, double-layer adsorption occurred when Cr(III) and Cr(VI) coexisted. An ionic cluster of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) was formed initially and subsequently bridged with Cr(III) adsorbed on TNTs through Cr(III)OCr(VI) linkages. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman analyses confirmed the ion-exchange mechanism and formation of Cr(III)OCr(VI), and that the process did not change the basic [TiO₆] structure of TNTs. Moreover, rearrangement of Cr(III) from the second layer to TNTs’ surface was observed when adsorption of Cr(III) was unsaturated, resulting in damage to Cr(III)OCr(VI) linkages and desorption of Cr(VI).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3achemical engineering 3adesorption 3aion exchange 3aions 3ananotubes 3apH1 aChen, Hao1 aBorthwick, Alistair G.L.1 aHan, Yunfei1 aNi, Jinren0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Oct., v. 232 p.228-236dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.07.1003Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245010300213300002000316520135300336592002801689650001201717650001801729650001601747650001601763650001001779650001801789650001501807650001101822650002801833650001201861651002301873700006301896700006001959773014802019856008302167852000902250655001202259IND60756718420221121224332.0211117e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075671842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-021-01407-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdallah, Abdul-Hanan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2469-027510aSustainable agricultural practices, farm income and food security among rural households in Africa  ap. 17668-17701.  aSustainable agriculture has been recognized in the literature as one of the important pathways to ensuring food and livelihood security among rural households in Africa. This study used data from the “Intensification of Food Crops Agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa (Afrint)” project to examine the impact of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs)—zero tillage, intercropping, residue incorporation and animal manure—on farm income and food security (captured as self-sufficiency in food production—SSF) of rural households in Africa. The multinomial endogenous treatment effect method is applied to control for potential selection bias from observable and unobservable factors. In addition, the multivalued treatment effect model and dose–response functions are used to examine the treatment effects heterogeneity associated with the adoption of SAPs. The study revealed that joint adoption of SAPs increases farm income and food security relative to the adoption of a single practice or non-adoption. Households obtain significantly higher farm income and food security via the adoption of at least three practices relative to households adopting less than three practices. These findings reaffirm the notion that adopting SAPs as a package rather than single practice enables farm households to derive significant welfare benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3adose response 3aenvironment 3afarm income 3afarms 3afood security 3alivelihood 3amodels 3asustainable agriculture 3atillage 3aSub-Saharan Africa1 aAbdul-Rahaman, Awal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-63261 aIssahaku, Gazali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3471-73470 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2021 Dec., v. 23, no. 12 p.17668-17701dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01407-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013900164300001600303520142700319592002801746650001201774650001501786650002501801650001901826650001401845650001101859650001401870650002201884650001101906650002701917650002301944700001301967700001601980700001301996773009502009856008102104990002302185852000902208655001202217IND60093316520221122234752.0141103e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009331652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.07.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeng, Yuxiao10aAmino-bearing calixcrown receptor grafted to micro-sized silica particles for highly selective enrichment of palladium in HNO₃ media  ap. 319-326.  aPalladium recovery in HNO₃-containing radioactive waste is of great value due to its considerable amount and benign radioactivity level. In this study, a new calixcrown receptor decorated with amino ligands (soft N donors) was synthesized for the selective extraction of Pd(II) in HNO₃ media. A high distribution ratio (D) of 278.6 was obtained within 10min in solvent extraction. Moreover, the calixcrown receptor was covalently grafted to micro-sized silica particles to obtain a novel solid phase extraction (SPE) material (labeled as ACGSi). Detailed batch and column experiments revealed that the ACGSi material had fast kinetics and favorable adsorption capacity towards Pd(II) in HNO₃ solutions. Parameters influencing the adsorption ability such as contact time, acidity and initial metal concentration were fully evaluated. Kinetic equations (pseudo-first/second-order) and adsorption isotherm models (Langmuir and Freundlich models) were employed to fit the experimental data for inspecting the adsorption mechanism. On this basis, a facile chromatographic process was proposed for the selective enrichment and recovery of palladium in simulated high level liquid waste (HLLW). A recovery rate of 99.3% was obtained. The amino-decorated calixcrown extractant as well as the functionalized SPE material is believed to be promising to find applications in palladium separation from radioactive liquid wastes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aadsorption 3achemical engineering 3achromatography 3aequations 3amodels 3apalladium 3aradioactive waste 3asilica 3asolid phase extraction 3asorption isotherms1 aXu, Jian1 aWei, Jichao1 aYe, Gang0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Oct., v. 232 p.319-326dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.07.1163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01749naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009500174300001600269520068300285592002800968650001400996650002501010650001901035650001301054650001601067650001401083650002401097700002401121700002701145700001901172773009501191856008101286990002301367852000901390655001201399IND60093316720221122234723.0141103e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009331672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.07.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeixeira, Ana Paula C.10aUse of chrysotile to produce highly dispersed K-doped MgO catalyst for biodiesel synthesis  ap. 104-110.  aIn this work, a new heterogeneous catalyst for the biodiesel synthesis was produced by the combination of chrysotile with KOH and thermal treatment.

Many schools of thought, focused on economic, social and environmental sustainability, have adopted Nature as a mentor, claiming that by mimicking its forms, processes and ways of being, we can learn to live in such a way as to restore functionality to the planet while maintaining a vibrant economy. But how appropriate is it to consider Nature as a mentor? We examine three significant flaws in this approach: erroneous ecological knowledge, industry-ecology incompatibilities and the justification of Nature as a mentor. Given that most of these problems apply to almost all of the current schools of sustainability, we conclude by considering what threats to progress these flaws present, and how we can circumnavigate such difficulties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth system science 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental knowledge 3aenvironmental sustainability 3ahumans 3aissues and policy0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2021 Dec., v. 23, no. 12 p.18167-18185dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01432-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04275naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002300167245010500190300001400295500002000309520279200329592002803121650002403149650000903173650001603182650001203198650001103210650001703221650001603238650001603254650001603270650001103286650001303297650002403310650001603334650001503350650001603365650001203381650001303393650002303406650002003429650001403449650001003463650001103473650000903484650002403493650001803517773009403535852000903629856010703638655001203745IND2204718420221120232459.0170626e200001  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220471842DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0015:FTSCOD]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrera, Carlos M.10aFlower‐to‐seedling consequences of different pollination regimes in an insect‐pollinated shrub  ap. 15-29.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInsect pollinators of the Mediterranean shrub Lavandula latifolia (Labiatae) differ in components of pollinating effectiveness that may influence seed production and progeny quality. This study tests the prediction that L. latifolia flowers exposed to pollination regimes differing in pollinator composition should differ in their expected contribution to population recruitment in the field, as measured in terms of established seedlings, because of differences in seed production, progeny quality, or both. Using a randomized complete block design, two pollination regimes were induced during a 3‐wk period on each of 15 L. latifolia plants by alternately exposing flowers in the two halves of each shrub to natural pollinators during two nonoverlapping diurnal periods (0930–1630, MD regime; dawn to 0930 and 1630 to dusk, R regime). The two pollination regimes differed in pollinator composition. The importance as flower visitors of butterflies and small bees was greater during the MD regime, which was also characterized by higher flower visitation rate and higher probability of visitation per time unit of individual flowers. MD flowers set proportionally more fruits, and each fruit contained more seeds, than R flowers. Seed production per inflorescence was also greater in MD than in R half‐plants. Seeds from the MD and R regimes did not differ significantly in either mean mass, probability of germination under laboratory conditions, or probability of producing a seedling when planted in a greenhouse. When planted in the field, seeds originating from MD flowers had a greater probability of producing a seedling than those originating from R flowers, the difference being greatest where soil characteristics were most adverse for early seedling growth. In the field, MD and R seedlings did not differ in post‐emergence survival rate and size of eventual survivors. The estimated average probability (±1 se) of one ovule eventually producing one third‐year, established seedling in the home environment was significantly greater for MD (0.0192 ± 0.0041) than for R (0.0085 ± 0.0020) flowers. This demographic advantage of MD ovules was mainly accounted for by the greater seedling emergence rate of MD seeds, and only secondarily by the greater fruit‐ and seed‐set of MD flowers. Observed patterns may be explained by a combination of increased outcrossing derived from the greater relative importance of small bees and butterflies as pollinators, and increased gametophytic competition resulting from increased overall visitation rates to individual flowers during the MD pollination regime. This study suggests that even relatively minor differences in pollinator composition and abundance may have a measurable demographic impact on plant populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLavandula latifolia 3abees 3abutterflies 3aflowers 3afruits 3agametophytes 3agermination 3agreenhouses 3aoutcrossing 3aovules 3aplanting 3apollinating insects 3apollination 3aprediction 3aprobability 3aprogeny 3aseed set 3aseedling emergence 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashrubs 3asoil 3aspecies recruitment 3asurvival rate0 tEcology.g2000 Jan., v. 81, no. 1 p.15-29dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081%5B0015:FTSCOD%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02675naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012200166300001600288520123800304592002801542650004401570650002301614650003701637650002501674650002801699650001301727650002401740650002401764650001101788650001301799700001901812700002001831700001901851700002001870700001701890700001401907700001701921700002001938700002001958700001901978773009501997856008102092990002302173852000902196655001202205IND60093317020221122234757.0141103e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009331702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.07.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhai, Tran Van10aDirect production of highly conductive graphene with a low oxygen content by a microwave-assisted solvothermal method  ap. 346-355.  aFew-layer graphene (FLG) with a low oxygen content has been synthesized by a two-step process using expanded graphite (EG) as a starting material. EG was subjected to solvothermal treatment, followed by microwave radiation. The FLG had an average thickness in the range of 1.8–2nm with a lateral size of 3–10μm. Both Raman spectroscopy and high resolution TEM measurements showed that the sizes of sp² carbon domains in graphene oxide (GO) and FLG were estimated to be about 2–5nm and 10–16nm, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra revealed that the FLG consisted of several peaks similar to those of EG, which were not observed in GO, indicating the effectiveness of the solvothermal reduction method in lowering the oxygen level. The electrical conductivity of the as-synthesized FLG ismeasured to be 165S/m, which is much higher than that of the GO (1.2×10⁻⁴S/m), possibly due to the larger sp² carbon domain size, lower oxygen content, and fewer structural defects. In contrast to the Hummer method, the method is simple, inexpensive, and does not generate toxic gas. This simple method could provide the synthesis of high quality FLG on a large scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3achemical engineering 3aelectrical conductivity 3agraphene 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3aoxygen 3atoxicity1 aKwak, Dong Sub1 aKwon, Yong Jung1 aCho, Hong Yeon1 aHuan, Tran Ngoc1 aChung, Hoeil1 aHam, Heon1 aLee, Chongmu1 aDan, Nguyen Van1 aTung, Ngo Trinh1 aKim, Hyoun Woo0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Oct., v. 232 p.346-355dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.07.1233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02012naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001900167245009200186300001600278500002000294520097200314592002801286650001201314650002601326650000901352650001201361650001501373650002001388650001601408650001701424700002101441773009601462852000901558856010701567655001201674IND2204719520221120232525.0170626e200001  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220471952DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0281:DAIEOP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStiling, Peter10aDirect and indirect effects of plant clone and local environment on herbivore abundance  ap. 281-285.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe used reciprocal transplant experiments to test the relative strengths of the effects of plant clone and environment on the density of insect herbivores both directly, via plant effects, and indirectly, via natural enemy effects.

Herbivore density was significantly affected by both site of origin (plant clone) and recipient site (local environment). This may be because both plant clone and local environment affect plant quality or because they affect attack rates of herbivores by natural enemies.

Groundwater quality, co-dispersions, sources, and probabilistic health risk were assessed simultaneously using multiple approaches and indexes including the entropy water quality index, groundwater quality index (GWQI), Moran’s spatial autocorrelation index, fuzzy logic GIS, principal component analysis (PCA), the correlation matrix (CM), hazard index (HI), carcinogenic risk (CR), and stochastic uncertainty analysis. The average concentrations of EC (781.66 μS/cm), Mg²⁺ (40.75 mg/L), K ⁺ (11.96 mg/L), NO₂⁻ (3.57 mg/L), Fe (1950.76 μg/L), Mn (130.04 μg/L), Cd (1.75 μg/L) and Pb (42.22 μg/L) were identified in groundwater and surpassed the water quality limits from 25 to 100% based on the sampling sites. SO4₂⁻, NO₂⁻ and NO₃⁻ were the priority contributors affecting water quality degradation. Approximately 30 and 33% of samples were unfit for drinking use employing the EWQI and GWQI, respectively. Spatially, groundwater quality is degraded from southwest to northeast area inundating by saline water. PCA and CM disclosed that Fe, Mn, and Cu had geogenic origins from the dissolution of weathering and leaching; Pb and Zn were primarily from nonpoint sources; Cd, and As were dominated by the mixed sources. Based on the non-carcinogenic risk (NCR), the HI values were above the permissible limit (> 1) for both adults and children, except for a few sites, indicating harmful health risks on humans. The attribution of the analyzed metals did not outweigh the CR range (10–⁶–10–⁴) with an elevated risk of children. Uncertainty analysis identified As concentration, exposure duration, and exposure frequency as the most significant parameters affecting the probabilistic health risk results. The outcome of this study can provide the baseline data for sustainable groundwater management and human health protection in the coastal region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3acarcinogenicity 3acoasts 3aentropy 3aenvironment 3aexposure duration 3afuzzy logic 3agroundwater 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahealth promotion 3ahuman health 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3asaline water 3asustainable development 3auncertainty analysis 3awater management 3awater quality 3aBangladesh1 aKabir, Mohammad Mahbub1 aFaruk, Sharmina1 aAl Jahin, Jawad1 aBodrud-Doza, Md.1 aDidar-ul-Alam, Md.1 aBahadur, Newaz Mohammed1 aMohinuzzaman, Mohammad1 aFatema, Konica J.1 a Safiur Rahman, M.1 aChoudhury, Tasrina Rabia0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2021 Dec., v. 23, no. 12 p.18394-18423dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01447-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002100167245008700188300001800275500002000293520130100313592002801614650001701642650002201659650001801681650001201699650001101711650002401722650001301746650002201759650001801781650001001799650001101809651001201820651001901832700002501851700002301876700001601899773009801915852000902013856010702022655001202129IND2204749220221120232645.0170626e200004  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220474922DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[1133:DMOTSB]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoriuchi, Ken S.10aDirect measurement of the seed bank age structure of a sonoran desert annual plant  ap. 1133-1138.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe describe a new approach to determining the age structure of seed banks of natural plant populations and apply it to a natural population of the Sonoran Desert winter annual, Pectocarya recurvata (Boraginaceae). Unlike other ¹⁴C techniques, tandem accelerator mass spectrometry (TAMS) counts the number of carbon isotope atoms, permitting high precision with small samples. Aboveground nuclear bomb tests caused atmospheric ¹⁴C levels to peak in 1963. Their subsequent gradual decline provides a signal for aging seed banks with TAMS. We constructed a calibration curve using seeds with known dates of production during 1980–1995, then used it to age 53 seeds sampled from a natural seed bank in 1993, at the Desert Laboratory in Tucson, Arizona. Seed number declined with age at an approximately exponential rate, with the oldest recovered seed having an estimated age of 5 yr (95% ci = ±2.3 yr). The seed bank age structure was judged more than adequate to buffer this population from typical fluctuations, based on an examination of 15 yr of population dynamic data.

DCP and TiO₂ concentration were varied to check possible different behaviors. DCP removal and TOC mineralization were monitored and fitted to a semiempiric model. DCP degradation rates show similar values in both installations, if comparison is based on entering UV photon flux. However, lab installation mineralizes lower amounts of TOC for the same accumulated UV photons, probably due to the different radiation intensity supplied in each set-up. Finally, some actinometric experiments to characterize the solar pilot plant are also presented, analyzing the collector and clouds effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3achemical engineering 3acollectors 3amineralization 3amodels1 aGiménez, J.1 aMaldonado, M.I.1 aMalato, S.1 aEsplugas, S.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Oct., v. 232 p.405-417dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.07.1023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245015700210300002000367520166200387592002802049650002002077650001602097650001202113650001502125650003302140650001202173700002402185773014802209856008302357852000902440655001202449IND60756720320221120054218.0211117e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075672032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-021-01360-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPribićević, Ivan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2354-270510aCritical sustainability indicators identification and cause–effect relationships analysis for sustainable organization strategy based on fuzzy DEMATEL  ap. 17263-17304.  aTraditionally, there was a common belief that the main role of successful organizations, especially in business, was to make profit. However, over the past decades, this belief proved to be wrong, since many organizations that had been making a lot of profit went bankrupt, while others persisted, and the main reasons were their adaptability and sustainability. In this research, we wanted to find out the indicators on the strategy level that leaders should take into account in order to make their organization sustainable in the most adaptive way. Our research was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, we handpicked 150 indicators and conducted a survey where decision makers were asked to rank them. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Varimax rotation were used on the chosen data to find if there was any correlation between the indicators and if they formed any groups. It was found that there were eight perspectives which described 69.38% of the entire sample. Therefore, we chose the indicators that best represented the perspectives. In the second phase, Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (Fuzzy DEMATEL) was used to calculate if there were any cause–effect relationships between the indicators. The results show that in order to have a sustainable strategy, organizations need to consider eight perspectives, where the biggest weight belongs to the perspective of Learning. The perspective of Leadership is the second, and Finance perspective has the lowest weight. In conclusion, it is pointed out that the survival of organizations depends on their ability to learn, adapt to changes, and be more sustainable.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aenvironment 3afinance 3aleadership 3aprincipal component analysis 3asurveys1 aDelibašić, Boris,0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2021 Dec., v. 23, no. 12 p.17263-17304dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01360-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03668naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001800167245010900185300001800294500002000312520236100332592002802693650001502721650002202736650002202758650000902780650001202789650002602801650001402827650001002841650001402851650002202865650001102887650001602898650001202914650001302926650002002939650001002959650002102969700001802990773009803008852000903106856010703115655001203222IND2204748520221120232542.0170626e200004  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220474852DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[1100:PMSAIY]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuth, Chad J.10aPollen‐mediated selective abortion in yuccas and its consequences for the plant–pollinator mutualism  ap. 1100-1107.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMutualistic interactions contain an underlying evolutionary conflict, in that natural selection favors individuals better at exploiting their mutualistic partner, thus potentially destabilizing the mutualism. In the obligate mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths, selective abortion of flowers that receive many moth eggs or receive poor pollen load has been suggested as a mechanism that can prevent evolution of excessive exploitation by moths. Using controlled pollinations, varying pollen amount and source, we asked whether variation in pollination quality of the magnitude seen among moths affects patterns of selective abortion. Pollination experiments in two Yucca filamentosa populations revealed that both pollen quantity (large/small) and quality (self/one‐outcross/two‐outcross donors) affected fruit retention, seed set, and seedling growth rate. A pollen load larger than that typically provided by moths increased fruit retention. Outcrossed flowers were selectively retained to fruit, and flowers receiving a mixed outcross load were selectively retained over single‐outcross flowers in one population. Seed set per fruit was significantly lower with a small pollen load, and lower when a single outcross source was used than in self or mixed outcross treatments. Outcross seeds germinated at a greater frequency and produced plants that grew faster than those that resulted from self‐pollination, yielding a cumulative inbreeding depression of 0.73–0.81. Early fruit abortion is a major mortality factor to the yucca moth's progeny, and the female can increase retention by providing high‐quality pollinations. Nonetheless, individual pollen loads are usually below levels that provide higher probability of retention, and commonly observed geitonogamous pollinations also appear to conflict with expected strong selection on moths to provide pollinations that give high retention probability. Other factors, such as combined visits by multiple females, floral position effects on retention, and possible costs of moth movement among plants, may interact with the pollination‐mediated effects in molding female behavior. These factors do not diminish the potential of selective abortion to promote evolutionary stability of the interaction as they do not provide the moth with a mechanism to circumvent selective abortion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProdoxidae 3aYucca filamentosa 3aabortion (plants) 3aeggs 3afemales 3ainbreeding depression 3amortality 3amoths 3amutualism 3anatural selection 3apollen 3aprobability 3aprogeny 3aseed set 3aseedling growth 3aseeds 3aself-pollination1 aPellmyr, Olle0 tEcology.g2000 Apr., v. 81, no. 4 p.1100-1107dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081%5B1100:PMSAIY%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02803naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016600169300001600335520157900351592002801930650001101958650002101969650002501990650001302015650001302028650001202041650001802053650002002071650001102091650001602102650001102118700002602129700002002155700002202175773009502197856008102292990002302373852000902396655001202405IND60093318820221122231141.0141103e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009331882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.07.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPirard, Sophie L.10aModeling of a continuous rotary reactor for carbon nanotube synthesis by catalytic chemical vapor deposition: Influence of heat exchanges and temperature profile  ap. 488-494.  aThe influence of the reaction exothermicity has been taken into account for the modeling of a continuous inclined mobile-bed rotating reactor for carbon nanotube synthesis by the CCVD method using ethylene as carbon source. The optimal temperature to maximize the productivity and to avoid the formation of soot and tars is equal to 700°C with ethylene. In small scale reactors, the heat exchange between the carbon nanotube growing bed and the atmosphere of the furnace surrounding the reactor is efficient enough to evacuate the heat released by the reaction and to keep the temperature constant along the reactor. However, for higher production capacity reactors, the global heat released by reaction increases, and the heat exchange has to be efficient enough to evacuate the heat released by the reaction. Otherwise, one may observe a runaway phenomenon. So the heat released by reaction influences the temperature profile through the reactor and heat exchanges have to be taken into account to model the axial temperature profile. The model has been validated with data obtained on two industrial reactors equipped with heating systems belonging four distinct heating zones with the same length providing an adequate control of the temperature in the reactor. To avoid a too high reaction speed, possibly leading to excessive heat release and to hot point responsible of cracking of ethylene and of reactor fouling by tars and soot deposition in the first reactor sections, the feed temperature of the reacting gas has to be fixed at a value lower or equal to 650°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemical engineering 3acracking 3aethylene 3afouling 3aheat transfer 3aheating systems 3amodels 3atemperature 3avapors1 aDelafosse, Angélique1 aToye, Dominique1 aPirard, Jean-Paul0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Oct., v. 232 p.488-494dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.07.0773Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245016900206300002000375520173800395592002802133650001502161650001202176650001902188650003202207650001602239650001602255650001402271650002902285650002502314650001702339700002002356700001902376700001902395773014802414856008302562852000902645655001202654IND60756721120221120025743.0211117e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075672112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-021-01385-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaisal, Faisal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1818-341810aExploring the relationship between carbon dioxide emissions, urbanisation and financial deepening for Turkey using the symmetric and asymmetric causality approaches  ap. 17374-17402.  aThis paper investigates the association among carbon dioxide emissions, electricity consumption, capital, financial deepening and urbanisation using data from 1968 to 2013 collected from the World Bank for Turkey. Further, this study applies single- and bi-endogenous structural break unit root approach in addition to the Ng and Perron (2001) to explore the integration order of the series. The bounds test is adopted to analyse the long-run connection among the variables. The robustness of the bounds test was further investigated using the Bayer–Hanck (Bayer and Hanck, Journal of Time Series Analysis 34:83–95, 2013) combined cointegration method. The long-run effects identified the evidence of an inverted U-shaped association among carbon dioxide and urbanisation. This suggests that rapid urbanisation increases the levels of pollution in the initial stages of development. However, after reaching a threshold point, urbanisation reduces environmental pollution. Financial development, electricity use and capital affect COE significantly and positively in both the short and long run, while GDP has a positive and insignificant effect. Additionally, the causal relationships among the variables are identified using the symmetric and asymmetric causal techniques. The outcomes of the causal results showed that financial deepening, urbanisation and electricity use are causing environmental pollution in the short run in the symmetric causality, while CO₂ is causing financial development based on the asymmetric causality. The findings suggest that green technologies should be adopted. Further, the use of renewable energy must be ensured for generating the electricity as it will facilitate a reduction in the COE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Bank 3acapital 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3aenvironment 3apollution 3arenewable energy sources 3atime series analysis 3aurbanization1 aPervaiz, Ruqiya1 aOzatac, Nesrin1 aTursoy, Turgut0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2021 Dec., v. 23, no. 12 p.17374-17402dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01385-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013200165300001400297520150100311592002801812650001401840650001201854650001201866650002501878650001101903650002201914650001301936650000701949650001301956650001501969700001701984700001902001700001802020700002002038700001902058773009302077856008102170990002302251852000902274655001202283IND60093319220221122231231.0141103e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009331922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.07.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Byungryul10aCalcium and hydrogen effects during sorption of copper onto an alginate-based ion exchanger: Batch and fixed-bed column studies  ap. 51-58.  aThe characteristics of alginate beads in calcium (Ca²⁺) and hydrogen (H⁺) form were studied with respect to the uptake of copper ions (Cu²⁺) via batch and fixed-bed column experiments. The maximum Cu²⁺ sorption capacities (Qₘₐₓ) of calcium and hydrogen alginates (abbreviated as CA and HA, respectively) were found to be 107mg/g and 189mg/g, respectively. At pH 5, more than 95% of Cu²⁺ was removed, but the amount of Cu²⁺ sorbed onto CA beads was significantly lowered at pH 2 owing to the pKa value of carboxylic acid. When Ca²⁺, as a competing ion, was present in solution at a molar ratio of Ca²⁺ to Cu²⁺ equal to 8, Qₘₐₓ was drastically decreased to 20mg/g. A faster equilibrium time (24h) was also observed for HA beads compared to CA beads (48h). In a fixed-bed column packed with CA beads, the breakthrough of Cu²⁺ occurred immediately with the presence of Ca²⁺ in the model wastewater. Using HA beads, however, the first breakthrough of Cu²⁺ appeared after 900 bed volumes. These results suggested that HA beads were more effective than CA beads in reducing the adverse influence of competing cations such as Ca²⁺ during the initial period of Cu²⁺ sorption. Moreover, the breakthrough of Cu²⁺ occurred later than that of Ca²⁺ due to a higher selectivity of Cu²⁺ over Ca²⁺, which was confirmed by a separation factor (αCᵤ/Cₐ, 10.3) of HA beads. In addition, their reusability was confirmed via ten regeneration cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3acalcium 3acations 3achemical engineering 3acopper 3acopper metabolism 3ahydrogen 3apH 3asorption 3awastewater1 aSon, Hyunjin1 aChung, Jaeshik1 aChoi, Jae Woo1 aYi, Sang-hyŏp,1 aHong, Seok Won0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Oct., v. 232 p.51-58dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.07.0793Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02061naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011300163300001600276520100500292592002801297650001501325650002201340650002501362650001501387650000901402700001601411700001501427700001701442700002601459700001801485773009501503856008101598990002301679852000901702655001201711IND60093319320221122231233.0141103e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009331932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeng, Cuiyu10aEffect of synthesis method on selective adsorption of thiosulfate by calcined MgAl-layered double hydroxides  ap. 510-518.  aCalcined MgAl-layered double hydroxides (CLDH-U) derived from layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors synthesized by urea decomposition, had the higher adsorption selectivity for thiosulfate (S₂O₃ ²⁻) in aqueous solutions mixed with thiocyanate (SCN⁻) than the counterpart (CLDH-C) obtained by co-precipitation method. The adsorption rates for S₂O₃ ²⁻ over CLDH-U with diameter in 2μm and CLDH-C with diameter in 50nm were respectively about 98.00% and 94.80%, and those for SCN⁻ were only about 0% and 6.84%. The results revealed that the selective adsorption was realized over these CLDH materials and the synthesis method influenced the adsorption behavior. The reason for the better selectivity over CLDH-U could be probably related to these mini sheets growing perpendicularly to the lamellate surface, which completely differed to the adsorption process over the small-sized counterpart. The different adsorption mechanisms of two CLDH materials were respectively proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical engineering 3ahydroxides 3aurea1 aXu, Tianhao1 aLi, Yaping1 aChang, Zheng1 aSun, Xiaoming,d1955-1 aLei, Xiaodong0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Oct., v. 232 p.510-518dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.08.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04528naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245010000169300001300269520299600282592002803278650003403306650001303340650002503353650000903378650001303387650002703400650001403427650001603441650001203457650001703469650001003486650001603496650002803512650001603540650001403556650001103570650001803581650001203599650001803611650001103629650002203640650001203662650002603674651001103700700001703711700001803728700001703746773010603763856008303869961001303952852000903965655001203974IND60614005120221123020359.0180919e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061400512DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-11-17-1771-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugiyama, L. S.10aFirst Report of Pseudomonas cichorii Causing Bacterial Leaf Blight of Plumeria pudica in Hawaii  ap. 1025.  aBridal bouquet plumeria (Plumeria pudica) is a commonly grown ornamental in Hawaii. In November 2014, a nursery grower located in Panaewa on the eastern side of Hawaii Island noticed water-soaked, irregular, grayish-black leaf spots and leaf blight followed by defoliation on potted plants of P. pudica. Two leaf samples were submitted to the University of Hawaii Agricultural Diagnostic Service Center located at the Komohana Research and Extension Center in Hilo, HI, for diagnosis. Isolations were made on King’s Medium B agar (KMB) and bacteria were consistently isolated from diseased tissue. Culture plates were forwarded to the USDA-ARS facility in Hilo, HI, for further purification and molecular identification. Isolations on KMB resulted in essentially pure cultures that were nonmucoid, cream, and fluorescent under 365 nm UV light. Four representative bacterial isolates were examined and characterized as gram-negative, oxidase positive, and produced a hypersensitive reaction in tobacco. Colonies were identified as Pseudomonas cichorii based on the LOPAT scheme (Schaad et al. 2001). A partial 16S rRNA gene product (1,355 bp) using primers Y1 and Bacterial 16S reverse was sequenced and compared in GenBank (accession no. MF536096) and was 100% identical to multiple accessions of P. cichorii in the NCBI database. Bacterial identity was further confirmed by using the specific primers Hrp1a/Hrp2a of P. cichorii to amplify an 859-bp fragment (MG518230) that had 99% sequence identity to P. cichorii strain 83-1 (Cottyn et al. 2011). To prove pathogenicity, four healthy P. pudica plants were spray inoculated to runoff with a bacterial suspension (10⁸ CFU/ml), placed in a clear plastic bag, and held at 24°C (Strayer et al. 2012). Four control plants were inoculated with sterile distilled water. After 24 h, plants were removed from the bag, placed on a greenhouse bench, and observed for disease development. After 1 day, numerous water soaked lesions were visible on the adaxial leaf surface and a few 1 to 2 mm, grayish-black leaf spots were visible on the abaxial leaf surface. Irregular leaf spots identical to the original diseased samples continued to develop and by day 4, several had coalesced into large blighted areas covering 20 to 30% of the leaf surface. By day 7, 50 to 90% of the leaves of each plant were defoliated. Bacterial colonies were consistently reisolated from the inoculated plants and morphologically and molecularly identified as P. cichorii, while no bacterial colonies were isolated from the control plants, fulfilling Koch’s postulates. The test was repeated. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bacterial leaf blight caused by P. cichorii on P. pudica in Hawaii. The nursery was notified of these findings. As recommended by Chase (2013), pruning, rouging and removal of diseased plant material, increased plant spacing, and reduction of standing water were implemented. To date, no additional samples have been submitted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgricultural Research Service 3aPlumeria 3aPseudomonas cichorii 3aagar 3abacteria 3acontainer-grown plants 3adatabases 3adefoliation 3aenzymes 3afluorescence 3agenes 3agreenhouses 3ahypersensitive response 3aleaf blight 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3apathogenicity 3apruning 3aribosomal RNA 3arunoff 3asequence analysis 3atobacco 3aultraviolet radiation 3aHawaii1 aBushe, B.

We hypothesized that pregnant women exposed to marginal food insecurity, and who reported dietary restraint before pregnancy, will paradoxically show the greatest weight gain. Weight outcomes were defined as total kilograms, observed-to-recommended weight gain ratio, and categorized as adequate, inadequate or excessive weight gain based on 2009 Institute of Medicine guidelines. A likelihood ratio test assessed the interaction between marginal food insecurity and dietary restraint and found significant. Adjusted multivariate regression and multinomial logistic models were used to estimate weight gain outcomes. In adjusted models stratified by dietary restraint, marginal insecurity and low restraint was significantly associated with lower weight gain and weight gain ratio compared to food secure and low restraint. Conversely, marginal insecurity and high restraint was significantly associated with higher weight gain and weight gain ratio compared to food secure and high restraint. Marginal insecurity with high restraint was significantly associated with excessive weight gain. Models were consistent when restricted to low-income women and full-term deliveries. In the presence of marginal food insecurity, women who struggle with weight and dieting issues may be at risk for excessive weight gain.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adieting 3afood security 3afoods 3aguidelines 3aingestion 3alogit analysis 3amedicine 3amodels 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3arecipes 3arisk 3aweight gain 2aAdult 2aDiet, Reducing 2aEnergy Intake 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aFood Supply 2aHumans 2aHunger 2aIncome 2aLogistic Models 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aObesityxcomplicationsxetiology. 2aPoverty 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complications 2aWeight Gain 2aYoung Adult 0aFood insecurity 0aDietary restraint 0aWeight gain 0aDieting 0aDisordered eating 0aPregnancy1 aEpel, Elissa1 aSiega-Riz, Anna Maria0 tAppetite.g2013 June 01, v. 65 p.178-184dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2013.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245013200209300001600341506007600357520142600433592002801859506003701887650001501924650002701939650001201966650002901978650000902007650002502016650001802041650001102059650001702070650001602087650001102103650002402114650001702138650001202155650001502167650001602182650001602198653002302214653003102237653001002268653001002278653002502288653002802313700002102341700001502362700001602377700006402393773011902457856008502576852000902661655001202670IND60558536220221207062654.0180829e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055853622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.10.0082doi7 aPMC51958952pmcid7 a277519532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuguang10aPhotobiomodulation of human adipose-derived stem cells using 810nm and 980nm lasers operates via different mechanisms of action  ap. 441-449.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhotobiomodulation (PBM) using red or near-infrared (NIR) light has been used to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells. The use of NIR wavelengths such as 810nm is reasonably well accepted to stimulate mitochondrial activity and ATP production via absorption of photons by cytochrome c oxidase. However, the mechanism of action of 980nm is less well understood. Here we study the effects of both wavelengths (810nm and 980nm) on adipose-derived stem cells in vitro. Both wavelengths showed a biphasic dose response, but 810nm had a peak dose response at 3J/cm² for stimulation of proliferation at 24h, while the peak dose for 980nm was 10–100 times lower at 0.03 or 0.3J/cm². Moreover, 980nm (but not 810nm) increased cytosolic calcium while decreasing mitochondrial calcium. The effects of 980nm could be blocked by calcium channel blockers (capsazepine for TRPV1 and SKF96365 for TRPC channels), which had no effect on 810nm. To test the hypothesis that the chromophore for 980nm was intracellular water, which could possibly form a microscopic temperature gradient upon laser irradiation, we added cold medium (4°C) during the light exposure, or pre-incubated the cells at 42°C, both of which abrogated the effect of 980nm but not 810nm. We conclude that 980nm affects temperature-gated calcium ion channels, while 810nm largely affects mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acalcium 3acalcium channel blockers 3acold 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adose response 3ahumans 3aion channels 3airradiation 3alasers 3amechanism of action 3amitochondria 3aphotons 3astem cells 3atemperature 3awavelengths 0aPhotobiomodulation 0aAdipose-derived stem cells 0a810nm 0a980nm 0aCytochrome c oxidase 0aHeat-gated ion channels1 aHuang, Ying-Ying1 aWang, Yong1 aLyu, Peijun1 aHamblin, Michael R.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6431-46050 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 Feb., v. 1861, no. 2 p.441-449dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245011000160300001000270520140000280592002801680596008001708596005001788650001401838650001501852650001501867650001401882650001201896650001201908650001701920650001701937650001201954650002701966650002101993650001102014650000902025650002802034650001402062650001402076700001502090700001402105700001902119700001702138700001902155700005302174773011002227856008302337852000902420655001202429IND60726407420221121055052.0210731e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072640742DNAL7 a10.1007/s12038-020-00132-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yue10aHypoxia preconditioning improves structure and function of astrocytes mitochondria via PGC-1α/HIF signal  ap. 7.  aThe protective effect of astrocytes on nerves was demonstrated by mitochondrial transfer. The neuroprotective effect of hypoxic pretreatment is widely accepted. The aim of this research is to investigate the role of hypoxic preconditioning on astrocytes mitochondria. Rat neuronal cells and astrocytes were isolated and cultured. A hypoxic preconditioned astrocyte and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) neuronal cell co-culture experiment was used to detect the effect of hypoxic preconditioning (HP) on nerve damage. The silencing of proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) with siRNA was used to explore the role of HP in the repair of nerve damage and biogenesis of mitochondria. HP increased astrocyte viability and promoted neuroprotective factor secretion. The expression levels of antioxidant enzymes, PGC-1α and uncoupling protein2 (UCP2) were up-regulated by HP. In addition, HP improved mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress induced by OGD. It was found that HP astrocytes had a greater neuroprotective effect than normal astrocytes cells. Neuronal apoptosis and reactive oxygen species levels were down-regulated by cell co-culture. The PGC-1α siRNA experiment showed that hypoxia treatment promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and plays a neuroprotective role. HP significantly enhanced the efficacy of astrocytes in the treatment of neuronal injury.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018-ZJ-720cQinghai Fundamental Scientific and Technological Research Plan  a81860762cNatural Science Foundation of China 3aapoptosis 3aastrocytes 3abiogenesis 3acoculture 3aglucose 3ahypoxia 3amitochondria 3anerve tissue 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3arats 3areactive oxygen species 3asecretion 3aviability1 aGu, Cunlin1 aHuang, Lu1 aZhao, Yuanqing1 aTang, Yanjun1 aZhao, Hongqian1 aWu, Qiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0443-06680 tJournal of biosciences.g2021 Dec., v. 46, no. 1 p.7-7dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl31976x0250-59917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12038-020-00132-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03411naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013500170300001800305520172900323592002802052650000802080650002102088650001902109650001002128650002002138650001102158650002802169650001102197650001202208650004402220650003902264650003502303653000702338653000802345653000802353653000902361653000802370653000702378653001702385653001202402653000802414653002902422653000802451653003502459700001802494700002302512700001802535700002102553700005702574773012002631856008502751852000902836655001202845IND60558536920221121114808.0180829e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055853692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarušič, Maja14aThe effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms in G-rich regions of high-risk human papillomaviruses on structural diversity of DNA  ap. 1229-1236.  aInfection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) can lead to development of cancer of the head and neck and anogenital regions. G-rich sequences found in genomes of high-risk HPVs can fold into non-canonical secondary structures that could serve as 3D motifs distinct from double-stranded DNA and present recognition sites for ligands and opportunity for gene expression modulation.Combination of UV, CD and NMR spectroscopy and PAGE electrophoresis were used as they offer complementary insights into structural changes of G-rich oligonucleotides.G-rich region of HPV16 is shown to preferentially form hairpin structures, while regions of HPV18, HPV52 and HPV58 fold into four-stranded DNA structures called G-quadruplexes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms found in G-rich sequences have been found to promote formation of hairpin structures of HPV16 and have affected number of species formed in G-rich region of HPV52, whereas they have exhibited minimal effect on the formation of HPV18 and HPV58 G-quadruplex structures. These structural changes were reflected in differences in apparent thermal stabilities.Potential of G-rich sequences as drug targets was evaluated based on the results of the current study. HPV16 and HPV18 are considered less appropriate targets due to several single nucleotide polymorphisms and low stability, respectively. On the other hand, HPV52 and HPV58 could be used for small-molecule mediated stabilization.G-rich sequences occurring in high-risk HPVs can fold into hairpin and G-quadruplex structures that could be potentially utilized as drug targets.

Efficient control of these parasites is difficult due to their development and attachment to the host plant (via a specialized organ, the haustorium) under the soil surface and to their unique biological traits of massive seed production, facile seed dispersal, germination only under specific conditions, and seed longevity. The major damage inflicted by the parasites takes place underground, making control extremely challenging. Egyptian broomrape (Phelipanche aegyptiaca) is a devastating pest in the Mediterranean basin, parasitizing a wide host crop range, including tomato, sunflower, legumes, and carrot, resulting in severe crop losses. Twenty years of research have led to the development of integrated smart management strategies for combating this parasite in processing tomato fields. In particular, an explicit decision support system (DSS) designated PICKIT has been developed; this DSS is based on predicting parasitism dynamics and employing a range of selective targeted chemical applications (preplanting incorporation, foliar application, and herbigation). In this feature article, we describe the evolution of this research from the laboratory, through greenhouse and experimental field trials, to large scale commercial fields and the successful assimilation of PICKIT into agricultural practice. The use of PICKIT in fields of processing tomatoes in northern Israel has led to effective control of Egyptian broomrape, even in fields with high infestation levels, resulting in a tomato yield increase of an average of 40 tons ha⁻¹ compared with nontreated plots. In 2016, PICKIT was commercially implemented in 33 fields, totaling 400 ha, giving 95% Egyptian broomrape control and tomato yields of 115 to 145 tons ha⁻¹. The outcome of this research is now enabling farmers to grow tomatoes in Egyptian broomrape-infested fields with assured increased yields and hence high profits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aOrobanche 3acarrots 3acrop losses 3acrop yield 3adecision support systems 3afarmers 3afield crops 3afield experimentation 3afoliar application 3agermination 3agreenhouses 3ahaustoria 3ahost plants 3airrigation 3alegumes 3aparasitic plants 3aparasitism 3aprediction 3aprofits and margins 3aseed dispersal 3aseed longevity 3asoil 3atomatoes 3aIsrael 3aMediterranean region1 aGoldwasser, Yaakov0 tPlant disease.g2018 Aug., v. 102, no. 8 p.1477-1488dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-01-18-0020-FE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03722naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245013100178300001600309520174600325592002802071650003402099650002402133650001202157650001702169650002502186650001802211650001902229650001602248650002202264650001302286650001402299650001402313650001102327650002602338650001702364650000702381650001302388650001902401650001202420650001402432650002202446650001602468650002002484650002402504650001102528650002502539650001002564650001602574651001102590651001902601651001502620653002502635653001502660653001702675700002702692700003702719700002402756700002602780700002602806773010902832856008602941852000903027655001203036IND60558538120221121152623.0190319e20161214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055853812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2016.10.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBastos, Victorio Jacob10aHarvest point determination of indian jujube fruit (Ziziphus mauritiana L.) based on physicochemical and functional parameters  ap. 392-402.  aThe indian jujube (Ziziphus mauritiana) is a native fruit of South Asia and East Africa. In Brazil, it is an exotic and endemic fruit specie, brought by the colonizers in the 18th century to the state of Roraima, Brazil. In its native region presents damaging aspect, it demands severe control to prevent its invasion in the pastures and other agricultural fields. Nevertheless, it is considered a very nutritious fruit, but so far has been studied very little. Thus, the aim of this study was to find out its exact harvest time based on its physicochemical and functional properties. The study was conducted between the years of 2012 and 2016, and the fruits were collected from the individual trees in the urban area of Boa Vista city, Roraima sate, Brazil, and analyzed at 7-day interval after the anthesis (DAA). The analysis included physical analysis (diameter and fresh weight), chemical analysis (pH, total acidity, soluble solids, total sugars, reducing sugars, starch, total pectin, soluble pectin, pectin methylesterase and polygalacturonase enzymes), antioxidant activity (phenolic compounds, anthocyanins, flavones, flavonols, carotenoids, ascorbic acid, ORAC and DPPH), and pattern of respiration (CO2 and ethylene). A completely randomized design was used for the experiment with 10 phenological fruit stages and three replications, with a total of 30 sample units per each replication. For the best fit of regression model, F test was performed with a 5% probability level. At the end of the experiment, a clear fruit climacteric behavior was observed, and the antioxidant activity was connected with the presence of phenolic compounds, and based on other analyses, it was determined that the best point of harvest is 56 DAA.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aZiziphus mauritiana 3aacidity 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acarbon dioxide 3acarotenoids 3achemical analysis 3aethylene 3aflavonols 3aflowering 3afruits 3afunctional properties 3aharvest date 3apH 3apastures 3apectinesterase 3apectins 3aphenology 3apolygalacturonase 3aprobability 3areducing sugars 3aregression analysis 3astarch 3atotal soluble solids 3atrees 3aurban areas 3aBrazil 3aEastern Africa 3aSouth Asia 0aClimacteric behavior 0aMaturation 0aDegeneration1 aNeves, Leandro Camargo1 ada Silva, Paula Monique Carvalho1 aShahab, Muḥammad,1 aColombo, Ronan Carlos1 aRoberto, Sergio Ruffo0 tScientia horticulturae.g2016 Dec. 14, v. 213 p.392-402dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2016.10.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05655naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013400166300001300300520389700313592002804210596004804238650002704286650003304313650000804346650001104354650001004365650001704375650001004392650001404402650002404416650001304440650001604453650001304469650001104482650003004493650002204523650003304545650001804578650005204596650001404648650001004662650002204672650001204694651001804706700001704724700001504741700001404756700001704770700001104787700001604798700005104814773010804865856008304973852000905056655001205065IND60614007820221122222232.0180919e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061400782DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-01-18-0055-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, R. L.10aFirst Report of Coleus blumei viroid 5 and Molecular Confirmation of Coleus blumei viroid 1 in Commercial Coleus blumei in Canada  ap. 1862.  aPlectranthus scutellarioides (syn. Coleus blumei, common name coleus) is a popular ornamental plant grown worldwide. Six viroids, Coleus blumei viroid 1 through 6 (CbVd-1 to 6), belonging to the genus Coleviroid, family Pospiviroidae, have been found to date in coleus (Nie and Singh 2017). Previously, a viroid was detected in commercial seeds of coleus in Canada (Singh et al. 1991); although the exact species of the viroid was unknown, the presence of CbVd-1 has been inferred. From May to July 2017, leaf tissue was collected from 56 coleus plants of six cultivars (Black Dragon, Wizard Select Mix, Pineapple Surprise, Wizard Coral Sunrise, Premium Sun Chocolate Covered Cherry, and Wizard Rose) at a local nursery in Fredericton, NB, Canada. No clear-cut symptoms were observed in the plants. Total RNA was extracted from pooled tissue from all individual plants. Return-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Singh et al. 1991) analysis detected a viroid-like fragment in the sample. When this fragment was subjected to RT-PCR using the universal coleviroid primers CbVds-P1 (5′-GCAGCGCTGCAACGGAAT-3′) and CbVds-P2 (5′-GCAGCGCTGCCAGGGAACCCAGGT-3′) (Jiang et al. 2011), a CbVd-specific fragment (∼250 bp) was produced, confirming the presence of a coleviroid(s) in the sample. The resulting amplicon was cloned into pCR-Blunt vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 10 clones were sequenced by the Sanger method. BLAST analysis of the sequences revealed the presence of CbVd-1 and -5, with frequencies of 9/10 and 1/10, respectively. The 249-nt-long CbVd-1 (accession no. MG767212) exhibited a 100% sequence identity with most CbVd-1 sequences deposited in GenBank whereas the 274-nt-long CbVd-5 (MG767213) showed a single substitution of G for C at position 54 with other CbVd-5 isolates. RNA was then extracted from pooled tissue from all plants within each cultivar, and subjected to RT-PCR using the universal coleviroid primers as well as newly designed CbVd-1-specific primer pair CbVd1-F1 (5′-GAGCTTGGCTCGAACTGACT-3′)/CbVd1-R1 (5′-CGAAGAAGAAGCCGAAGCTA-3′) (amplicon size 144 bp) and CbVd-5-specific primer pair CbVd5-F1 (5′-GAAAAGGCAGGTTGCTTACC-3′)/CbVd5-R1 (5′-AGCAGGAACCCGGAAGAC-3′) (amplicon size 171 bp). These tests indicated that ‘Wizard Coral Sunrise’ was not infected with any CbVds, ‘Black Dragon’ was infected with both CbVd-1 and -5, and that the four other cultivars were infected solely with CbVd-1. To further study the prevalence and disease symptoms of CbVd infections in coleus plants, 60 commercial seeds each of cvs. Black Dragon, Pinto Mix, and Wizard Mix were germinated, and the resulting seedlings were transplanted and grown in the greenhouse at 20 to 25°C with a light/dark cycle of 16/8 h and humidity of 75%. RT-PCR tests of the plants using the universal coleviroid primer pair indicated that the cultivars had different CbVd-infection rates: 0% in Pinto Mix, 20% in Black Dragon, and 35% in Wizard Mix. Further testing of the CbVd-positive samples using the CbVd-1- and -5-specific primer pairs showed that all the CbVd-positive samples were infected solely with CbVd-1. Interestingly, most CbVd-1-infected Wizard plants were significantly lighter in color than those that were not infected with the viroid. However, in Black Dragon, no visible differences were observed between the infected and the uninfected plants, suggesting that host genotype plays a role in CbVd-induced symptom development. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CbVd-5 and the first confirmed detection of CbVd-1 in coleus in Canada. Considering the apparent propensity for coleviroids to recombine and evolve (Nie and Singh 2017), and the ability of viroids in general to cause disease symptoms in not only ornamental plants, but economically important crop species, precautions may be necessary to minimize the spread of these viroids.  aPublisher supplied data  aCHA-P-1601cCanadian Food Inspection Agency 3aColeus blumei viroid 1 3aPlectranthus scutellarioides 3aRNA 3aclones 3acolor 3acommon names 3acrops 3acultivars 3agel electrophoresis 3agenotype 3agreenhouses 3ahumidity 3aleaves 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aornamental plants 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asequence analysis 3aviroids 3aNew Brunswick1 aLawrence, J.1 aShukla, M.1 aSingh, M.1 aLi, Xunjing,1 aXu, H.1 aGardner, K.1 aNie, X.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6831-26390 tPlant disease.g2018 Sept., v. 102, no. 9 p.1862-1862dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-01-18-0055-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245016800154300001600322500001400338520199800352592002802350650001202378650001902390650002602409650003302435650001302468650002002481650001702501650004302518650002002561650002902581650003002610653002202640653001302662653003002675653002102705700001502726700001402741700001802755773014302773856007302916852000902989655001202998IND60726409720221122174212.0210204e20210203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072640972DNAL7 a10.3920/CEP2000222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNess, H.O.10aAcute high-intensity aerobic exercise increases gene expression of calcium-related proteins and activates endoplasmic reticulum stress responses in diabetic hearts  ap. 123-135.  aNAL-light  aRegular aerobic exercise training has a wide range of beneficial cardiac effects, but recent data also show that acute very strenuous aerobic exercise may impose a transient cardiac exhaustion. The aim of this study was to assess the response to acute high-intensity aerobic exercise on properties of mitochondrial respiration, cardiomyocyte contractile function, Ca²⁺ handling and transcriptional changes for key proteins facilitating Ca²⁺ handling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses in type 2 diabetic mice. Diabetic mice were assigned to either sedentary control or an acute bout of exercise, consisting of a 10×4 minutes high-intensity interval treadmill run. Mitochondrial respiration, contractile and Ca²⁺ handling properties of cardiomyocytes were analysed 1 hour after completion of exercise. Gene expression levels of key Ca²⁺ handling and ER stress response proteins were measured in cardiac tissue samples harvested 1 hour and 24 hours after exercise. We found no significant changes in mitochondrial respiration, cardiomyocyte contractile function or Ca²⁺ handling 1 hour after the acute exercise. However, gene expression of Atp2a2, Slc8a1 and Ryr2, encoding proteins involved in cardiomyocyte Ca²⁺ handling, were all significantly upregulated 24 hours after the acute exercise bout. Acute exercise also altered gene expression of several key proteins in ER stress response and unfolded protein response, including Grp94, total Xbp1, Gadd34, and Atf6. The present results show that despite no significant alterations in functional properties of cardiomyocyte function, Ca²⁺ handling or mitochondrial respiration following one bout of high intensity aerobic exercise training, the expression of genes involved in Ca²⁺ handling and key components in ER stress and the unfolded protein response were changed. These transcriptional changes may constitute important steps in initiating adaptive remodelling to exercise training in type 2 diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acardiomyocytes 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3aexercise 3agene expression 3amitochondria 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3aunfolded protein response 0aexercise training 0adiabetes 0amitochondrial respiration 0acalcium handling1 aLjones, K.1 aPinho, M.1 aHøydal, M.A.0 tComparative exercise physiology.g2021 Feb. 3, v. 17, no. 2 p.123-135dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:J000000061x1755-25597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3920/CEP2000223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04184naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245007000173520249000243592002802733596007902761650002402840650002102864650001602885650001402901650001002915650001902925650002202944650001402966650001202980650001002992650002203002650004203024650001103066650002203077650005203099650002603151650001403177650001203191650001603203651001003219651001103229651001203240651001103252651001003263651001003273651001803283700002903301700001303330700001403343700005403357773010303411856008303514852000903597655001203606IND60614009020221122222056.0180919e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061400902DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-01-18-0105-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz-García, A. B.10aFirst Report of Grapevine Red Globe Virus in Grapevine in Germany  aGrapevine red globe virus (GRGV) is a member of the genus Maculavirus, family Tymoviridae, found to infect grapevine for the first time in Italy (Sabanadzovic et al. 2000). GRGV has also been reported in Greece, the United States, France, China, and Spain (Cretazzo et al. 2017; Fan et al. 2016). No specific symptoms have been associated with GRGV infection (Martelli et al. 2002). In 2016, grapevine leaves from a Pinot Gris cultivar from the Rhineland-Palatinate area showing leaf mottling and flecking were collected and analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of siRNAs using TrueSeq Illumina technology on a HiSeq 1000 system. De novo assembly of the 5,658,588 reads was performed by Geneious software. The BlastN and BlastX analysis of the 316 contigs obtained revealed the presence of 65 contigs related to GRGV, with a percentage of nucleotide similarity ranging from 85.2 to 100%. Illumina reads were mapped to reference using the Graciano-T101 isolate (GenBank accession no. NC_030693.1), allowing the recovery of 90.1% of the viral sequence scattered along the genome. A partial sequence corresponding to a fragment of the GRGV replicase gene of one of the German isolates has been deposited in GenBank database (accession no. MG779496). Bioinformatic analysis of the remaining contigs showed the presence of Arabis mosaic virus, grapevine rupestris stem pitting associated virus, grapevine yellow speckle viroid-1, and hop stunt viroid. The presence of GRGV in the German vineyards was confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using two different sets of primers, the generic primers for tymoviruses, 5′-CATGCANGTSAGRGGRCCRAA-3′ and 5′-CYCARCAYAARGTVAACGA-3′ (Kominek et al. 2009), and newly designed primers specific for GRGV, GRGV-CF-F1 5′-GAATTCGCTGTCGGCCACTC-3′ and GRGV-CF-R1 5′-AGTGAGAGGAGAGATTCCATC-3′. The expected RT-PCR products, of 453 and 386 bp respectively, were successfully amplified, cloned, and sequenced. BlastN analysis of all amplicons confirmed the presence of the virus. GRGV was also detected by RT-PCR in 14 out of 57 randomly collected samples from symptomatic and asymptomatic grapevines, in different grapevine growing areas from the Rhineland-Palatinate area. To our knowledge, this is the first report of GRGV in Germany. Further studies will be necessary to assess the relevance and potential threat of this virus to the grape production in Germany and to determine whether it should be regulated.  aPublisher supplied data  aCOST Action FA1407 (DIVAS)cEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology 3aArabis mosaic virus 3aHop stunt viroid 3aMaculavirus 3aTymovirus 3aVitis 3abioinformatics 3acomputer software 3acultivars 3aenzymes 3agenes 3agenetic databases 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aleaves 3amolecular cloning 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asmall interfering RNA 3avineyards 3aviruses 3aviticulture 3aChina 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aGreece 3aItaly 3aSpain 3aUnited States1 aNourinejhad Zarghani, S.1 aOkic, A.1 aOlmos, A.1 aWetzel, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1559-975X0 tPlant disease.g2018 Aug., v. 102, no. 8 p.1675-dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-01-18-0105-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05303naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013200168300001300300520332300313592002803636596006303664650002203727650002003749650001203769650000903781650001203790650002303802650001403825650002103839650001203860650001203872650001003884650001203894650001703906650001003923650001103933650001303944650002103957650001803978650003103996650001404027650001704041650001104058650002404069650001604093650001404109650002504123650001704148650001004165650001204175650000904187650001804196651001704214700001904231700005604250700001804306700001804324700001804342700005704360773010804417856008304525852000904608655001204617IND60614009420221122160432.0180919e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061400942DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-01-18-0135-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWickert, K. L.10aFirst Report of Fusarium Stem Canker on Pyrularia pubera, a Rare Native Parasitic Shrub in Forests of Southwestern Pennsylvania  ap. 1852.  aPyrularia pubera Michx. (buffalo nut; Cervantesiaceae/Santales) is a parasitic shrub native to the eastern United States (Nickrent et al. 2010). More than 60 plant species in 31 families have been recorded as hosts (Leopold and Muller 1983). At its northern range limit in Pennsylvania, P. pubera is classified as rare (Randle and Wenzel 2014). In June 2015, extensive dieback of dozens of Pyrularia was reported from the Powdermill Nature Reserve (PNR) in Westmoreland Co., PA. Symptoms included green leaf wilt and branch dieback, sunken stem lesions, and epicormic sprouting. Lenticular sporodochia were present on dead stems. Dendrochronology of growth rings from declining shrubs revealed prolonged radial growth decline from 1999 to 2015. Surveys during 2016 to 2017 revealed additional dieback on the Forbes State Forest (FSF). From the necrotic margin of 16 stem cankers from PNR, 128 wood plugs were extracted, surface disinfested in 5% sodium hypochlorite, and plated onto glucose yeast extract agar. After 7 to 10 days, a fungus with dense floccose aerial mycelium and hyaline, oval to fusiform, 0 to 1 septate, microconidia characteristic of Fusarium (Leslie and Summerell 2008) emerged from 55% of plugs and 100% of cankers. Sporodochia that subsequently formed had 3 to 5 septate, cylindrical to slightly curved macroconidia. Translation elongation factor 1-α (EF1) sequences were generated for 20 isolates (deposited as MG975094 to MG975096) and analyzed using BLASTN against GenBank and FUSARIUM-ID databases. Results revealed that EF1 sequences from the tested isolates were 99 to 100% identical to Fusarium sp. NRRL 22586 (FSSC 13-b; AF178353, from Robinia sp.) and Fusarium solani isolate FS0723 (HQ647286; from Carya cordiformis, Park 2011). Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis of these sequences along with representatives of all known species in the F. solani species complex (FSSC) nested them within FSSC undescribed species 13 (FSSC 13). To confirm pathogenicity, inoculations using isolates P1-C1, P1-C3, and P2-C4 were conducted. Healthy Pyrularia stems (approximately 2 cm in diameter) were harvested from FSF in June 2017. In the lab, ends of 20-cm stem sections were waxed and were submerged in 10% sodium hypochlorite for 15 min prior to inoculation. Stem sections were wounded with a sterile 9-mm-diameter cork borer. Blank agar plugs (control) or plugs colonized by one of three fungal treatments were aseptically placed inside wounds and sealed with tape. Ten stems were inoculated per treatment and incubated at 23°C in the dark for 6 weeks. At 6 weeks postinoculation, all inoculated stems had sunken cankers, whereas controls remained canker free. Lenticular sporodochia were abundant on fungus-treated stems. Mean canker linear growth, (length + width)/2, for all isolates was significantly larger (P < 0.001; 8.0, 8.0, and 9.5 cm) than the control (1.3 cm, wound only), but not from each other. Consistent isolation of FSSC 13 from all fungus-treated stems, coupled with molecular confirmation of 10 isolates across these same treatments, fulfilled Koch’s postulates, thus confirming pathogenicity of FSSC 13 on Pyrularia. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Fusarium stem canker caused by members of the FSSC on P. pubera or any member of the Cervantesiaceae.  aPublisher supplied data  cWest Virginia Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station 3aCarya cordiformis 3aFusarium solani 3aRobinia 3aagar 3aconidia 3aconservation areas 3adatabases 3adendrochronology 3adieback 3aforests 3afungi 3aglucose 3agrowth rings 3ahosts 3aleaves 3amycelium 3aparasitic plants 3apathogenicity 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphylogeny 3arare species 3ashrubs 3asodium hypochlorite 3asporodochia 3asprouting 3astatistical analysis 3astem cankers 3astems 3asurveys 3awood 3ayeast extract 3aPennsylvania1 aMetheny, A.

S.10aFirst Report of Pestalotiopsis clavispora Causing Root Rot on Blueberry in China  ap. 1655.  aHighbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) is widely cultivated in Shandong Province, the most important blueberry production area in China. In September 2016, declining highbush blueberry plants were observed with ∼20% incidence on cvs. Duke and Misty in a commercial planting in Rizhao, Shandong Province. Diseased plants showed yellow leaves, defoliation, and root rot. The root system was reduced, with few feeder roots and a dark discoloration of the root cortex. Plant mortality was also observed. Root pieces (5 mm long and 2 to 3 mm in diameter) were surface disinfected in 75% ethanol for 30 s and rinsed three times in sterile water before plating them onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) with 0.05% lactic acid. Eleven isolates showing white and cottony colonies were obtained and three isolates were selected for further tests. The cultures were covered with black and globular acervuli 100 to 200 µm in diameter. The base of each conidiophore was swollen and globose with phialides growing from the apical end. Mature conidia consisted of five cells that were straight to fusiform, with a tapering base and two to four hyaline appendages (apical appendages measured 27.5 to 33.0 µm long and a single basal appendage was 3.6 to 6.5 µm long, n = 40). Conidia were 21.1 to 32.3 × 6.5 to 8.5 µm (n = 40) with the three middle cells brown and darker than the end cells. According to colony and conidia morphology, the isolates were initially identified as Pestalotiopsis clavispora (Guba 1961). Total DNA was extracted from the mycelium of three monoconidial isolates and subjected to PCR using the universal primers ITS1 and ITS4. Purified PCR products were sequenced in both directions. Consensus sequences of the three isolates (B1, B2, and B3) were deposited in GenBank (accession nos. MG729400, MG932648, and MG932649). BLAST analysis revealed over 99% homology with P. clavispora isolates KM264343 and EF119336 (Luan et al. 2008; Zhao et al. 2016). Pathogenicity was confirmed in 1-year-old blueberry plants (cv. Duke). A 5-ml suspension (10⁶ conidia/ml) was applied as soil drench to three potted plants grown in a greenhouse. Roots were superficially wounded with needles. Control plants were inoculated with sterile distilled water. Plants were incubated at 25°C and a 16-h photoperiod. After 30 days, plants showed root rot and leaf defoliation followed by plant death. Control plants showed no symptoms. The pathogenicity test was conducted three times. The same pathogen was reisolated from diseased roots of inoculated plants in all three experiments. Although this fungus has been previously reported to cause leaf spot and twig blight on blueberry in China (Chen et al. 2016; Luan et al. 2008), to our knowledge, this is the first report of P. clavispora as a root pathogen of blueberry in China, and even worldwide. Blueberry root rot is an emerging problem in Shandong Province, which is in need of effective disease-management practices to sustain blueberry production in this region.  aPublisher supplied data  cTai-Shan Scholar Construction Foundation of Shandong province  aCARS-28cChinese Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3aNeopestalotiopsis clavispora 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3aappendages 3ablight 3ablueberries 3abranches 3aconidia 3acontainer-grown plants 3acortex 3aculture media 3adeath 3adefoliation 3adiscoloration 3aethanol 3afungi 3agreenhouses 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alactic acid 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3amortality 3amycelium 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aphotoperiod 3aplanting 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aroot rot 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asequence analysis 3asoil drenching 3aChina1 aLian, S.1 aLi, B.

In this study, cervical epithelial cells from mice during the follicular phase were cultured invitro and treated with different concentrations of P4 (5, 10, and 20nM). The results of the present study suggest that treatment of murine cervical epithelial cells with 10nM P4 for 24h contributed to: (1) significantly increased expression of protein kinase A (PKA), cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and PGE synthase (PGES)-1; (2) higher phosphorylated (p-) to total extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) ratios; (3) a significant decrease in the number of lipid droplets (LDs) and fatty acid content within LDs in epithelial cells; and (4) enhanced arachidonic acid and PGE2 levels in cells compared with the control (0nM P4) group (P<0.01 for all findings). In contrast, the PKA inhibitor H89 contributed to significantly decreased cPLA2, PGES-1 and HSL expression, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and arachidonic acid and PGE2 levels, even in the presence of P4. These data show that P4 can act via the PKA/ERK1/2 pathway to stimulate lipolysis of triacylglycerol in the LD core and degradation of phospholipid in the LD membrane to promote PGE2 synthesis in murine cervical epithelial cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarachidonic acid 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3aepithelium 3afatty acid composition 3alipolysis 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphospholipase A2 3aphospholipids 3aphosphorylation 3aprogesterone 3aprostaglandins 3areproduction 3atriacylglycerols 0acervical epithelial cells 0alipid droplets 0aneutral lipase 0aprostaglandin 0aprotein kinase A/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway1 aSu, Feng1 aHuang, Libo1 aLi, Boyu1 aYuan, Xuejun1 aLuo, Mingjiu1 aGe, Lijiang0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2021, v. 33, no. 3 p.209-219dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl47095x1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD201953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245007200158300001600230500001900246520131600265592002801581650001701609650001901626650002501645650001901670650001101689650001001700650001101710650001401721650001701735650001701752650001701769650002001786650002101806650001001827653001801837700002201855700002001877700002501897700002201922700002301944773012901967856007102096852000902167655001202176IND60726412020221118235448.0210204s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072641202DNAL7 a10.1071/RD203122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDodi, Alessandra10aMelatonin modulates swine luteal and adipose stromal cell functions  ap. 198-208.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBased on our previous study in follicles, the first aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of melatonin in the swine corpus luteum (CL). Luteal cells were exposed to 10 and 20pg mL−1 melatonin. We evaluated the effect on proliferation (bromo-deoxy-uridine uptake), steroidogenesis (progesterone) and redox status by means of Griess test (nitric oxide production), WST-1 test (superoxide anion generation) and FRAP test (non-enzymatic antioxidant power). The results showed a significant increase in antioxidant power, as well as a reduction in the other parameters analysed. These data and the expression of MT2 observed in luteal cells allow us to hypothesise a physiological role of melatonin in the regulation of CL functionality. The reproductive function is dependent on energy reserves stored in adipose tissue. Therefore, we sought to verify the effect of melatonin on adipose stromal cells (ASCs). MT2 receptor expression was detected in ASCs and the presence of gene markers (PPARγ and leptin) before and after adipogenic differentiation was verified. The differentiation was significantly inhibited by melatonin, as well as cell viability. In conclusion, present results suggest that melatonin exerts a potential inhibitory action on luteal function and adipogenesis, possibly mediated by MT2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipogenesis 3aadipose tissue 3aantioxidant activity 3acell viability 3aenergy 3agenes 3aleptin 3amelatonin 3anitric oxide 3aprogesterone 3areproduction 3asteroidogenesis 3asuperoxide anion 3aswine 0acorpus luteum1 aBussolati, Simona1 aGrolli, Stefano1 aGrasselli, Francesca1 aDi Lecce, Rosanna1 aBasini, Giuseppina0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2021, v. 33, no. 3 p.198-208dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl47095x1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD203123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245012300162300001400285500001900299520144600318592002801764650002401792650001001816650002601826650001501852650000801867650001401875650001001889650001601899650001301915650002301928650002001951650002001971653001101991653001702002653001702019653001102036700002302047700001802070700001702088773010002105856007502205852000902280655001202289IND60726412120221118235429.0210204e20201221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072641212DNAL7 a10.3106/ms2020-00042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirakawa, Yukino10aEstimation of Sexual Maturity Based on Morphometrics of Genital Organs in Male Northern Fur Seals, Callorhinus ursinus  ap. 41-51.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt's not always possible to obtain samples from dead male pinnipeds that are fresh enough to determine the histological characteristics of spermatogenesis and their stage of sexual maturity. We propose that the morphometrics of genital organs of northern fur seals, Callorhinus ursinus, can be used as a new indicator of sexual maturity. We analyzed data from collected records of male fur seals around Hokkaido during 2011–2017 to examine morphometrics of genital organs and their stage in histological characteristics of spermatogenesis. First, we investigated ontogenetic and seasonal variation in three genital organs: testes, epididymides, and bacula. Second, we classified the stages of histological characteristics of spermatogenesis into three groups (Stage A–C) using non-linear discriminant analysis, based on the stage in histological characteristics of spermatogenesis determined by histological observation of seminiferous tubules. Testicular size, testicular mass, and epididymal mass showed seasonal variation associated with spermatogenesis. From our analysis, the stage in histological characteristics of spermatogenesis could be estimated using testicular mass with high accuracy of predicting spermatogenesis. And measurement of baculum was suggested to be an indicator of predicting sexual maturity. We conclude that this simple estimation may be used to determine sexual maturity based on individual growth patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallorhinus ursinus 3aJapan 3adiscriminant analysis 3aepididymis 3afur 3ahistology 3amales 3amorphometry 3aontogeny 3aseasonal variation 3asexual maturity 3aspermatogenesis 0abacula 0aepididymises 0areproduction 0atestes1 aHorimoto, Takanori1 aSuzuki, Ippei1 aMitani, Yoko0 tMammal study.g2020 Dec. 21, v. 46, no. 1 p.41-51dUniBio PresswJournal:19720x1348-61607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3106/ms2020-00043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03894naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245018100207500001900388520222000407592002802627650002702655650002302682650001002705650002202715650001402737650001602751650003102767650001402798650003702812650001102849650003502860653003402895653004102929653003802970653001303008653001103021653000703032653001103039653000703050653001103057653000803068653001003076700001803086700001703104700001703121700001703138773011503155856008503270852000903355655001203364IND60673938020221118174951.0200103e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067393802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1040472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapić, Bojan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2484-945810aRetrospective investigation of listeriosis outbreaks in small ruminants using different analytical approaches for whole genome sequencing-based typing of Listeria monocytogenes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aListeria monocytogenes is the causative agent of listeriosis, a serious disease affecting both humans and animals. While listeriosis outbreaks in humans are commonly investigated in detail, routine typing of L. monocytogenes is generally not performed in animal outbreaks. Here, seven presumable listeriosis outbreaks in small ruminants were retrospectively identified based on the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles. Outbreaks were further characterised using three different analytical approaches based on the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data: core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST), whole-genome MLST (wgMLST) and whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (wgSNP) typing. A monoclonal pattern of all seven outbreaks was identified using all three approaches, indicating common-source outbreaks. The outbreak strains belonged to sequence types (STs) 1 (n = 3), ST18 (n = 1), ST21 (n = 2) and ST184 (n = 1). Two epidemiologically linked ST1 outbreaks with indistinguishable PFGE profiles showed a polyphyletic nature and differed in >78 SNPs; thus, they were classified as separate outbreaks according to WGS. In ST184, the outbreak strain was also found in faeces of apparently healthy ruminants, silage and water collected from the trough, which were the most likely source(s) of infection. The outbreak-associated isolates differed in 0–7 cgMLST alleles, 0–12 wgMLST alleles and 1–13 SNPs. The minimum genetic diversity between outbreak-associated isolates and epidemiologically unrelated isolates of the same ST was low in all analysed cases, approaching the maximum diversity within the outbreak cluster. The results suggest that a fixed threshold to define the outbreak cluster should only be considered as a guide and highlight the role of epidemiological data for outbreak confirmation. The identified cgMLST clusters may be further investigated by wgMLST and/or wgSNP typing to increase confidence during investigations of outbreaks caused by highly clonal L. monocytogenes groups. This study gives an overview of the inter- and intra-outbreak genetic diversity of L. monocytogenes strains involved in animal outbreaks, hence improving their investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aetiological agents 3afeces 3agenetic variation 3ainfection 3alisteriosis 3amultilocus sequence typing 3apolyphyly 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3asilage 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aWhole-genome sequencing (WGS) 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 0aMultilocus sequence typing (MLST) 0aOutbreak 0aAnimal 0aCC 0acgMLST 0aST 0awgMLST 0aWGS 0awgSNP1 aKušar, Darja1 aZdovc, Irena1 aGolob, Majda1 aPate, Mateja0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2020 Jan., v. 77 p.104047-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1040473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03646naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245014200175500001900317520198900336592002802325650002202353650001602375650001302391650001002404650001302414650001402427650001002441650002702451650001402478650002002492650001802512650001602530650001602546651001702562653001302579653001102592700006702603700002902670700002302699700001602722700002102738700001902759700002102778700002202799700002302821700002502844700002602869773011502895856008503010852000903095655001203104IND60673938120221118175001.0200103e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067393812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1040512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Qahtani, Ahmed A.10aMolecular epidemiology, phylogenetic analysis and genotype distribution of hepatitis B virus in Saudi Arabia: Predominance of genotype D1  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDespite the implementation of various vaccination programs, hepatitis B virus (HBV) poses a considerable health problem in Saudi Arabia. Insight on HBV evolutionary history in the region is limited. We performed a comprehensive epidemiological and phylogenetic reconstruction based on a large cohort of HBV infected patients.Three hundred and nineteen HBV-infected patients with different clinical manifestations, including inactive and active chronic carriers and patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), were enrolled in this study. The full-length large S gene was amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to determine the genotype and subgenotypes of the isolates. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that genotype D is the most dominant genotype among patients. Moreover, this analysis identified two strains with genotype E isolated from active carriers. Detailed phylogenetic analyses confirmed the presence of four HBV D subgenotypes, D1 (93%, n = 296), D2 (0.02%, n = 5), D3 (0.003%, n = 1), and D4 (0.003%, n = 1). In addition, six genotype D strains were not assigned to any existing HBV D subgenotype. The large S gene of eight strains showed signatures of genotype recombination between the genotypes D and A and between D and E. Several strains harbored medically important point mutations at the protein level. Along with the dominance of the HBV genotype D, isolation of the E genotype and several recombinant strains from patients with Saudi Arabian origin is an essential result for decisions involving therapeutic measures for patients. Development of vaccines and detection of diagnostic escape mutations at antigenic epitopes on the HBsAg will be valuable to public health authorities. Furthermore, the diversity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels and different proportions of dN/dS at the PreS1, PreS2, and HBsAg reveal the selective pressure trend from inactive status towards advanced liver diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3aamino acids 3aepitopes 3agenes 3ahepatoma 3ainfection 3aliver 3amolecular epidemiology 3aphylogeny 3aprotein content 3apublic health 3asubgenotype 3avaccination 3aSaudi Arabia 0aGenotype 0aS gene1 aPourkarim, Mahmoud Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4620-64531 aTrovão, Nídia Sequeira1 aVergote, Valentijn1 aLi, Guangdi1 aThijssen, Marijn1 aAbdo, Ayman A.1 aSanai, Faisal M.1 aDela Cruz, Damian1 aBohol, Marie Fe F.1 aAl-Anazi, Mashael R.1 aAl-Ahdal, Mohammed N.0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2020 Jan., v. 77 p.104051-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1040513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04126naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010800170520234700278592002802625650002102653650002602674650002402700650002502724650001102749650001302760650001702773650001202790650002202802650001202824650001702836650000902853650001502862650002102877650001902898650001902917650001302936650002602949650001802975650001102993650002503004650001003029650001703039650001503056651002503071653003803096653001303134653002703147653001703174700003303191700001703224700002203241700002303263700001803286773011603304856008303420852000903503655001203512IND60673938620221118175017.0191118e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067393862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2019.1264802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrunetti, Cecilia13aAn integrated overview of physiological and biochemical responses of Celtis australis to drought stress  aTrees in Mediterranean areas frequently face severe drought stress events, due to sudden decreases in soil water availability associated to intense heat waves. The knowledge of strategies adopted by plants to cope with the environmental pressures associated to Mediterranean climate is crucial for reforestation strategies and planning future urban greening. Here we investigated the physiological and biochemical adjustments activated by Celtis australis in response to drought stress during summer. Despite widely used for reforestation in Southern Mediterranean, how C. australis responds to the severe challenges imposed by Mediterranean climate has not investigated yet. In our study, we performed analyses of water relations, gas exchange and PSII performance, the concentration of photosynthetic pigments, the activity and the concentration of primary antioxidants in plants exposed to drought stress of increasing severity. Data of our study reveal that C. australis displays both conservative water use and isohydric behavior in response to drought, and diffusive resistance mostly limits photosynthesis even at severe drought. Our study also reveals an effective down-regulation rather than permanent impairment of PSII photochemistry in response to drought stress of increasing severity, since excess electron transport due to declines in photosynthesis (-61% at severe stress, compared to control) was matched by an increase in nonphotochemical quenching (+71% at severe stress, compared to control). However, our study highlights that under severe drought, zeaxanthin (and neoxanthin) increased by 75% (and 25%), likely served an important function as chloroplast antioxidant, other than sustaining nonphotochemical quenching. Antioxidant enzymes and ascorbate also increased (+132% on average for superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, and catalase) and contributed in countering oxidative stress in severely droughted plants. Large adjustments in the suite of physiological and biochemical traits may effectively enable C. australis to gain carbon at appreciable rates while avoiding irreversible damage to the photosynthetic apparatus even when challenged by severe drought stress, thereby making this species an excellent candidate for forest and urban plantings in sites experiencing extended periods of drought stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeltis australis 3aMediterranean climate 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acarbon 3acatalase 3achloroplasts 3adrought 3aelectron transfer 3aforests 3agas exchange 3aheat 3aneoxanthin 3aoxidative stress 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3aplanning 3aplant available water 3areforestation 3asummer 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atrees 3awater stress 3azeaxanthin 3aMediterranean region 0aGas exchange and PSII performance 0aIsohydry 0aPhoto-oxidative stress 0aXanthophylls1 aTattini, M.q(Massimiliano),1 aGuidi, Lucia1 aVelikova, Violeta1 aFerrini, Francesco1 aFini, Alessio0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2019 Dec., v. 46 p.126480-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2019.1264803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245020600168520104200374592002801416650002201444650001401466650002401480650001501504650003801519650001301557650002101570650002001591650001201611650001801623650002301641650001801664650001801682650001701700650002201717650001201739650001301751650005301764650004301817650000901860650001401869650002401883650002001907653000901927653001101936653001701947653002101964653000901985653000901994653000902003653001202012653000802024653000902032653003602041653003002077653001002107653000902117653001102126653001202137653000802149653000902157653000902166653001002175653000902185700001902194700001902213700001502232700002402247700001702271773011202288856008202400852000902482655001202491IND60673939120221118172201.0200210e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067393912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2019.1036322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorikura, Toshio10acis-Banglene, a bangle (Zingiber purpureum)-derived bioactive compound, promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and glucose uptake by activating the IL-6/AMPK signaling pathway in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells  aRecently, we reported that bangle intake promotes exercise-induced effects such as reducing insulin resistance and non-esterified fatty acid levels and ameliorating the loss of autophagy function in rats fed high-fat diets. In the present study, we examined the physiological effects of cis-banglene on C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. cis-Banglene activated AMPK, an exercise mimic target. It also promoted glucose uptake (2-NBDG uptake) and mitochondrial biogenesis (Rho 123 uptake and mtDNA copy number) as well as increased the mRNA expression (real-time PCR) and secretion of IL-6 (ELISA), a myokine produced by exercising skeletal muscles. Furthermore, cis-banglene significantly increased the mRNA expression levels of PPARγ, PGC-1α, LPL, CD36, and UCP3. These findings are consistent with previously reported changes in mRNA expression levels in the muscles during exercise. Thus, cis-banglene is a candidate exercise mimetic for increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and glucose uptake by activating the IL-6/AMPK signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZingiber montanum 3aautophagy 3abioactive compounds 3abiogenesis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aexercise 3afree fatty acids 3agene expression 3aglucose 3ahigh fat diet 3ainsulin resistance 3ainterleukin-6 3amessenger RNA 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amuscles 3amyocytes 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3asecretion 3asignal transduction 3askeletal muscle 0aAMPK 0aBangle 0acis-banglene 0aExercise mimetic 0aIL-6 0aSTAT 0aAMPK 0arho 123 0aJAK 0aSTAT 0amitochondrial fission 1 protein 0adynamin related protein 1 0aGLUT4 0aIL-6 0aPPARγ 0aPGC-1α 0aLPL 0aCD36 0aUCP3 0amtDNA 0anDNA1 aKajiya, Shiori1 aSugawara, Mami1 aKubo, Miwa1 aFukuyama, Yoshiyasu1 aSatō, Shin,0 tJournal of functional foods.g2020 Jan., v. 64 p.103632-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2019.1036323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245012900205520099400334592002801328650002001356650002501376650001201401650002001413650001401433650001001447650001701457650001301474650002101487650001701508650001801525650001801543650002401561650000901585650001601594650001801610650003201628653001701660653001301677653002201690653002201712653001401734653001601748700002601764700002601790700001701816700001601833700001901849700003301868700002101901700002501922700005901947773011202006856008202118852000902200655001202209IND60673939320221118172154.0200210e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067393932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2019.1036382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMudgal, Jayesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8190-703110aEffect of coffee constituents, caffeine and caffeic acid on anxiety and lipopolysaccharide-induced sickness behavior in mice  aCaffeine (CAF) and polyphenolic compounds like caffeic acid (CA), chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid are commonly consumed through beverages and food. These constituents modulate immune system and impact the systemic inflammatory pathways. This study explored the modulatory effect of CA and CA + CAF on behavior and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) – induced neuroinflammation in mice. An array of behavioral tests suggest that CA (15 mg/kg) and CA + CAF (10 mg/kg + 5 mg/kg) express anxiolytic-like properties. Systemic administration of LPS (1.5 mg/kg) induced profound immobility, increased the systemic/brain cytokine (TNF-α and IL-6) levels and altered the host antioxidant defence in all the animals. Seven days pretreatment with CA alone and CA + CAF significantly reversed the LPS-induced behavioral changes and inflammatory markers. Our results suggest that the low doses of CA may offer a comparable anxiolytic and antidepressant effect when combined with CAF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantidepressants 3aantioxidant activity 3aanxiety 3abehavior change 3abeverages 3abrain 3acaffeic acid 3acaffeine 3achlorogenic acid 3aferulic acid 3aimmune system 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3amice 3apolyphenols 3atranquilizers 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aCaffeic acid 0aCaffeine 0aSickness behavior 0aNeuroinflammation 0aCytokines 0aAntioxidant1 aBasu Mallik, Sanchari1 aNampoothiri, Madhavan1 aKinra, Manas1 aHall, Susan1 aGrant, Gary D.1 aAnoopkumar-Dukie, Shailendra1 aDavey, Andrew K.1 aRao, C.

But recent land reforms threaten to undermine customary tenure and land-use practices in Myanmar. This paper combines income accounting methods with access theory to assess how new legislation may affect four Chin communities in the country’s north-west. Our assessment of 94 households’ land-access mechanisms and economic benefits from different types of land reveals existing land-access inequalities among Chin households and demonstrates communities’ continued dependence on environmental resources, especially those from swidden fields, home gardens and forests. A majority of households would lose all of their land-derived income, if they were denied access to communities’ customarily governed land, e.g., under the Vacant, Fallow and Virgin Land Management Law. Policy stakeholders should therefore intervene, to alleviate land-access inequalities among Chin households and to direct Myanmar’s land-system dynamics onto more just development trajectories.  aPublisher supplied data 3afallow 3ahighlands 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3aland reform 3aland use 3astakeholders 3aMyanmar 0aLivelihoods 0aland-use practices 0aswidden farming 0acustomary tenure 0aenvironmental income1 aPalm, Matilda1 aPersson, U.

During the crop year 2015 to 2016, leaf spots (3 to 4 mm in diameter) were observed on rose leaves in the cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Excised segments (3 mm²) from 20 infected leaves were surface sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min and then rinsed three times with sterile distilled water. The segments were transferred to potato dextrose agar and incubated at 25 ± 2°C. After 7 days, colonies were white, later becoming black or golden brown with regular to irregular margins. Conidia were brown, 20.9 to 28.4 (average 24.7) μm × 9.2 to 13.1 (average 10.6) μm (n = 25). Conidia were obovoidal to broadly clavate, smooth walled, three-septate, with the third cell from the base conspicuously larger, broader, and darker than other cells, normally curved or occasionally straight, with rounded apical and obconical basal cells. Unbranched conidiophores were septate, erect, flexuous in the apical part, with flat and dark brown scars. These morphological features were similar to those described for Curvularia lunata (Wakker) Boedijn (Bussaban et al. 2017). Three asymptomatic detached rose leaves were surface sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite and sprayed with single-spore suspensions (10⁶ conidia/ml). Sterile distilled water was used as a negative control, and the experiment was conducted twice. The leaves were incubated at 25 ± 2°C in sterile glass chambers at 70% relative humidity, and symptoms were recorded 5 days after inoculation, whereas no symptoms occurred on the negative control leaves. The pathogen was reisolated from the inoculated leaves and was morphologically identical to the original isolate. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2) region of ribosomal DNA was amplified and sequenced to confirm the species of Curvularia (Bussaban et al. 2017). The rose isolate (CUR 1, GenBank accession no. MG837719) exhibited 100% homology with previously reported sequences of C. lunata (Wakker) Boedijn (KF897859) (Dutta and Hussain 1959; Ghosh and Shamsi 2014), but to our knowledge, this is the first report of Curvularia leaf spot of rose in Pakistan. Roses provide a significant economic return to small farmers in Pakistan, and this finding will help them to plan effective disease management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurvularia lunata 3aRosa 3acities 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3acosts and returns 3acrop year 3aculture media 3adisease control 3aessential oils 3afarmers 3aglass 3aherbal tea 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3apathogens 3aperfumes 3arelative humidity 3aribosomal DNA 3asodium hypochlorite 3asyrups 3aPakistan1 aAziz-ud-Din, 1 aRashid, A.1 aGhanzafar, M.

A multi-site experiment was conducted to evaluate how variety (V), seeding rate (S), and nitrogen (N) fertilizer affect malt quality in the northeast. Two barley varieties (Cerveza and Newdale), two seeding rates (200 and 400 seeds m⁻²), and five rates of actual applied N fertility (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 kg ha⁻¹) were tested at Charlottetown, PE, Canada, Ithaca, NY, US, Princeville, QC, Canada, and New Liskeard and Ottawa, ON, Canada. Basic agronomic data were collected from all environments including yield, thousand kernel weight, and hectoliter weight. Barley of suitable quality was micromalted and subjected to malt quality analysis. Both V and S resulted in small effects on malt quality, however, N had the greatest effect on most measured variables. Increased rates of N application resulted in increased yield, hectoliter weight, and thousand kernel weight but had a negative effect on most quality traits, especially with increased protein content, reduced fine extract, Kolbach index, and friability, though it increased wort β-glucans. This study shows that for most years at most sites, it is possible to achieve malt quality in the northeast; however, excessive protein and the prevalence of preharvest sprout damage are the main barriers. The results of this study have implications for increased malt barley production for the craft sector as well as potential access to commodity markets for northeastern producers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3abeers 3amalt 3anitrogen 3aprotein content 3aseeds 0aseeding rate 0amalt barley 0acraft malt1 aIzydorczyk, M.1 aChoo, T.M.

Nevertheless, the effect of natural symbiotic bacteria on microalgae cultivation and lipid production is still unclear. Here, the effects of nitrogen-fixing, symbiotic Rhizobium on nitrogen content and algal growth, lipid accumulation, and gene expression were investigated in the green microalga Chlorella variabilis. The results demonstrated that compared to axenic C. variabilis cultures, the bacterial-derived nitrogen supply and algal growth were enhanced by 32.8% and 27% in cocultures, respectively. Transcriptome analyses revealed that C. variabilis growing with R. radiobacter TH729 upregulated genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and downregulated genes related to nitrogen metabolism. Our findings indicated that bacterial fixed nitrogen reduces lipid accumulation in microalgae, which is not beneficial for biodiesel production. Further studies on the effects of other bacteria on microalgae are needed to assess most optimal practices for biodiesel production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aChlorella variabilis 3aRhizobium 3abacteria 3abeta oxidation 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3acoculture 3afuel production 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3amicrosymbionts 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen metabolism 3atranscriptome 0aRhizobium 0aChlorella 0aFatty-acid oxidation 0aNitrogen repletion 0aBiodiesel1 aWang, Tong1 aWoldemicael, Abeselom1 aHe, Meilin1 aZou, Shanmei1 aWang, Changhai0 tAlgal research.g2019 Dec., v. 44 p.101692-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2019.1016923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04125naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245013000172520270600302592002803008650002003036650003003056650001103086650001903097650002303116650002203139650001203161650001403173650002303187650001803210650002203228650001103250650001403261650002203275650001103297650002503308650001103333650002303344650002503367650001103392651001103403700002903414773012203443856008103565852000903646655001203655IND60760708020221119041308.0211223e20211018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076070802DNAL7 a10.3390/hydrology80401602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStefanidis, Stefanos 10aPrecipitation and Potential Evapotranspiration Temporal Variability and Their Relationship in Two Forest Ecosystems in Greece  aThe assessment of drought conditions is important in forestry because it affects forest growth and species diversity. In this study, temporal variability and trends of precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (PET), and their relationship (P/PET) were examined in two selected forest ecosystems that present different climatic conditions and vegetation types due to their location and hypsometric zone. The study area includes the forests of Pertouli and Taxiarchis, which are managed by the Aristotle University Forest Administration and Management Fund. The Pertouli is a coniferous forest in Central Greece with a maximum elevation of 2073 m a.s.l, and Taxiarchis is a broadleaved forest in Northern Greece with a maximum elevation of 1200 m a.s.l. To accomplish the goals of the current research, long–term (1974–2016) monthly precipitation and air temperature data from two mountainous meteorological were collected and processed. The PET was estimated using a parametric model based on simplified formulation of the Penman–Monteith equation rather than the commonly used Thornthwaite approach. Seasonal and annual precipitation, potential evapotranspiration (PET), and their ratio (P/PET) values were subjected to Mann–Kendall tests to assess the possible upward or downward trends, and Sen’s slope method was used to estimate the trends magnitude. The results indicated that the examined climatic variables vary greatly between seasons. In general, negative trends were detected for the precipitation time series of Pertouli, whereas positive trends were found in Taxiarchis; both were statistically insignificant. In contrast, statistically significant positive trends were reported for PET in both forest ecosystems. These circumstances led to different drought conditions between the two forests due to the differences of their elevation. Regarding Pertouli, drought trend analysis indicated downward trends for annual, winter, spring, and summer values, whereas autumn showed a slight upward trend. In addition, the average magnitude trend per decade was approximately −2.5%, −3.5%, +4.8%, −0.8%, and +3.3% for annual, winter, autumn, spring, and summer seasons, respectively. On the contrary, the drought trend and the associated magnitude per decade for the Taxiarchis forest were found to be as follows: annual (+2.2%), winter (+6.2%), autumn (+9.2%), spring (+1.0%), and summer (−5.0%). The performed statistical test showed that the reported trend was statistically insignificant at a 5% significance level. These results may be a useful tool as a forest management practice and can enhance the adaptation and resilience of forest ecosystems to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aautumn 3aclimate change 3aconiferous forests 3adeciduous forests 3adrought 3aequations 3aevapotranspiration 3aforest growth 3aforest management 3amodels 3amountains 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3astatistical analysis 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3atime series analysis 3awinter 3aGreece1 aAlexandridis, Vasileios 0 tHydrology.g2021 Oct. 18, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27143x2306-53387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology80401603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012300167500002200290520141700312592002801729650002001757650001101777650001901788650002201807650001401829650002201843650002801865650002001893650003101913650001301944650001101957650001101968650001301979650004301992650002302035650001702058653001902075653000802094653001202102700003302114700001902147700002102166773008002187856008502267852000902352655001202361IND60673942620221118174613.0191021e20190919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067394262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plgene.2019.1002052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZare, Sajjad10aIdentification of miRNAs and evaluation of candidate genes expression profile associated with drought stress in barley  aPre-press version  aTo identify miRNAs and assess the expression of genes involved in drought stress tolerance, leaf and root ESTs were analyzed in barley. To this end, the EGassembler bioinformatics service and IDEG6 were used for the pre-processing and identify differentially expressed genes among EST libraries, respectively. Furthermore, root contigs were analyzed by C-mii software for miRNAs identification. The expression profile of two drought tolerance candidate genes was studied, using Real time-PCR in a 2 (Nimruz and Spontaneum) × 2 (control and 50% FC) factorial experiment in a completely randomized design with 3 replications. Results of this study showed that N-butyl-N-methylpiperidinium (Pip1;4) and a non-specific lipid transport protein (nsLTP) were found to express differently under drought stress. The expression level of barley HvPip1;4 (HvPiP1;4) and non-specific lipid transport (HvnsLTP) genes increased by 95.98 and 54.53 fold after 72 h of drought stress, respectively. There was a significant difference (P < .05) between two genotypes with respect to the expression level of candidate genes. Nimruz cultivar had a higher expression level for both candidate genes. Comparison analysis of miRNAs showed that miR2102 had a differential expression between non-stressed and drought stress libraries in barley root tissue. Furthermore, HvPiP1;4 and HvnsLTP were miR6201and miR5052 target genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3abioinformatics 3acomputer software 3acultivars 3adrought tolerance 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenotype 3aleaves 3alipids 3amicroRNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atransport proteins 3awater stress 0aDrought stress 0aEST 0aHordeum1 aNazarian-Firouzabadi, Farhad1 aIsmaili, Ahmad1 aPakniyat, Hassan0 tPlant gene.g2019 Sept. 19, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23305x2352-40737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plgene.2019.1002053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002900146245013500175520145700310592002801767650001101795650001401806650001401820650002401834700001901858700002201877700002701899773012201926856008102048852000902129655001202138IND60760708320221119041328.0211223e20211026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076070832DNAL7 a10.3390/hydrology80401622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTellez-Alvarez, Jackson 10aNumerical and Experimental Approaches to Estimate Discharge Coefficients and Energy Loss Coefficients in Pressurized Grated Inlets  aNumerical models concerning inlet systems are run to assess the hydraulic performance of existing or new systems and estimate the flow interchanges between the surface overland and sewer flows. In most programs, these interactions are modelled using the orifice equation, with estimated discharge coefficients around 0.6. In this paper, discharge values and energy loss coefficients for several pressurized grated inlets were obtained by experimental and numerical approaches and compared. To achieve these goals, a numerical model replicating several experimental tests carried out at the hydraulic laboratory of Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) was produced using a CFD model (Flow 3D). This numerical model was found to be highly sensitive to the mesh size used; however, it was able to accurately simulate the experimental processes. The comparison considered different combinations of pressurized flow though the grate, between 10 to 50 l/s, and different longitudinal gradients. The experimental discharge coefficient was found to increase with surcharging flowrate (ranging from 0.14 and 0.41), whereas the longitudinal gradient was found to have no effect. The discharge coefficients obtained in this study show that the standard 0.6 value commonly used by practitioners should be revised to a range between 0.14 to 0.41, depending on circulating flow and inlet type. In addition, the loss coefficient values range from 0.25 to 3.41.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aequations 3ahydrology 3amathematical models1 aGomez, Manuel,1 aRusso, Beniamino 1 aAmezaga-Kutija, Marko 0 tHydrology.g2021 Oct. 26, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27143x2306-53387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology80401623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245012000174520149000294592002801784650002601812650002001838650002901858650001901887650001601906650002301922650002501945650001101970650002101981650001402002650002202016650001602038650001402054651002002068700003602088773012202124856008102246852000902327655001202336IND60760708420221119041000.0211223e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076070842DNAL7 a10.3390/hydrology80401632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimitriadou, Stavroula 10aEvapotranspiration Trends and Interactions in Light of the Anthropogenic Footprint and the Climate Crisis: A Review  aEvapotranspiration (ET) is a parameter of major importance participating in both hydrological cycle and surface energy balance. Trends of ET are discussed along with the dependence of evaporation to key environmental variables. The evaporation paradox can be approached via natural phenomena aggravated by anthropogenic impact. ET appears as one of the most affected parameters by human activities. Complex hydrological processes are governed by local environmental conditions thus generalizations are difficult. However, in some settings, common hydrological interactions could be detected. Mediterranean climate regions (MCRs) appear vulnerability to the foreseen increase in ET, aggravated by precipitation shifting and air temperature warming, whereas in tropical forests its role is rather beneficial. ET determines groundwater level and quality. Groundwater level appeared to be a robust predictor of annual ET for peatlands in Southeast Asia. In semi-arid to arid areas, increases in ET have implications on water availability and soil salinization. ET-changes after a wildfire can be substantial for groundwater recharge if a canopy-loss threshold is surpassed. Those consequences are site-specific. Post-fire ET rebound seems climate and fire-severity-dependent. Overall, this qualitative structured review sets the foundations for interdisciplinary researchers and water managers to deploy ET as a means to address challenging environmental issues such as water availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aair temperature 3aanthropogenic activities 3aenergy balance 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3agroundwater recharge 3ahumans 3ahydrologic cycle 3apeatlands 3asoil salinization 3awater table 3awildfires 3aSouth East Asia1 aNikolakopoulos, Konstantinos G.0 tHydrology.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27143x2306-53387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology80401633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245012900163520147100292592002801763650002001791650002001811650002901831650001501860650001101875650001101886650001401897650001801911650002401929650001301953650001101966650002001977650002101997650001302018650001602031651001702047651001402064700002202078700002202100700002302122700002102145700001902166700001902185700002002204700002002224773012202244856008102366852000902447655001202456IND60760708620221119040951.0211223e20211103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076070862DNAL7 a10.3390/hydrology80401642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrau, Diego 10aHydroclimatological Patterns and Limnological Characteristics of Unique Wetland Systems on the Argentine High Andean Plateau  aHigh-elevation wetlands in South America are not well described despite their high sensitivity to human impact and unique biodiversity. We describe the hydroclimatological and limnological characteristics of 21 wetlands on the High Andean Plateau of Argentina, synthesizing information gathered over ten years (2010–2020). We collected physical-chemical, phytoplankton, and zooplankton data and counted flamingos in each wetland. We also conducted an extensive analysis of climatic patterns and hydrological responses since 1985. These wetlands are shallow, with a wide range of salinity (from fresh to brine), mostly alkaline, and are dominated by carbonate and gypsum deposits and sodium-chloride waters. They tend to have high nutrient concentrations. Plankton shows a low species richness and moderate to high dominance of taxa. Flamingos are highly dependent on the presence of Bacillariophyta, which appears to be positively linked to silica and soluble reactive phosphorus availability. Climatic conditions show a strong region-wide increase in average air temperature since the mid-1980s and a decrease in precipitation between 1985–1999 and 2000–2020. These high-elevation wetlands are fundamentally sensitive systems; therefore, having baseline information becomes imperative to understanding the impact of climatic changes and other human perturbations. This work attempts to advance the body of scientific knowledge of these unique wetland systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyta 3aair temperature 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarbonates 3agypsum 3ahumans 3ahydrology 3aphytoplankton 3areactive phosphorus 3asalinity 3asilica 3asodium chloride 3aspecies richness 3awetlands 3azooplankton 3aAndes region 3aArgentina1 aMoran, Brendan J.1 aArengo, Felicity 1 aMarconi, Patricia 1 aBattauz, Yamila 1 aMora, Celeste 1 aManzo, Ramiro 1 aMayora, Gisela 1 aBoutt, David F.0 tHydrology.g2021 Nov. 03, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27143x2306-53387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology80401643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03988naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003400140245017100174500001400345520263400359592002802993650002103021650001603042650001603058650001903074650001203093650001603105650001703121650001803138650002003156650001103176650001403187650004303201650001603244650000903260650001503269650001603284651001003300700003303310773012803343856007403471852000903545655001203554IND60726422320221118235557.0210205e20210127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072642232DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130304362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaro-Martínez, Mª  Ángeles10aStand Delineation of Pinus sylvestris L. Plantations Suffering Decline Processes Based on Biophysical Tree Crown Variables: A Necessary Tool for Adaptive Silviculture  aNAL-light  aMany planted Pinus forests are severely affected by defoliation and mortality processes caused by pests and droughts. The mapping of forest tree crown variables (e.g., leaf area index and pigments) is particularly useful in stand delineation for the management of declining forests. This work explores the potential of integrating multispectral WorldView-2 (WV-2) and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data for stand delineation based on selected tree crown variables in Pinus sylvestris plantations in southern Spain. Needle pigments (chlorophyll and carotenes) and leaf area index (LAI) were quantified. Eight vegetation indices and ALS-derived metrics were produced, and seven predictors were selected to estimate and map tree crown variables using a Random Forest method and Gini index. Chlorophylls a and b (Chla and Chlb) were significantly higher in the non-defoliated and moderately defoliated trees than in severely defoliated trees (F = 14.02, p < 0.001 for Chla; F = 13.09, p < 0.001 for Chlb). A similar response was observed for carotenoids (Car) (F = 14.13, p < 0.001). The LAI also showed significant differences among the defoliation levels (F = 26.5, p < 0.001). The model for the chlorophyll a pigment used two vegetation indices, Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI) and Carotenoid Reflectance Index (CRI); three WV-2 band metrics, and three ALS metrics. The model built to describe the tree Chlb content used similar variables. The defoliation classification model was established with a single vegetation index, Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI); two metrics of the blue band, and two ALS metrics. The pigment contents models provided R² values of 0.87 (Chla, RMSE = 12.98%), 0.74 (Chlb, RMSE = 10.39%), and 0.88 (Car, RMSE = 10.05%). The cross-validated confusion matrix achieved a high overall classification accuracy (84.05%) and Kappa index (0.76). Defoliation and Chla showed the validation values for segmentations and, therefore, in the generation of the stand delineation. A total of 104 stands were delineated, ranging from 6.96 to 54.62 ha (average stand area = 16.26 ha). The distribution map of the predicted severity values in the P. sylvestris plantations showed a mosaic of severity patterns at the stand and individual tree scales. Overall, the findings of this work underscore the potential of WV-2 and ALS data integration for the assessment of stand delineation based on tree health status. The derived cartography is a relevant tool for developing adaptive silvicultural practices to reduce Pinus sylvestris mortality in planted forests at risk due to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3acartography 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3adecline 3adefoliation 3aforest trees 3ahealth status 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3amortality 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3areflectance 3arisk 3atree crown 3atree health 3aSpain1 aNavarro-Cerrillo, Rafael  M.0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Jan. 27, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130304363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04296naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003700135040001800172100003000190245012000220506007600340520206800416592002802484506003702512650002102549650002802570650000802598650001502606650001102621650001502632650001602647650001702663650001702680650000902697650002502706650000902731650001002740650000902750650001402759650001002773650001202783650001002795650002102805650001902826650001002845650001402855650001902869650002302888650001102911650001002922650001402932650001002946650001302956650001402969650001402983650001602997650001703013650001503030651001603045653002803061653002103089653001603110653002303126653001903149653002503168700002403193700001803217700001803235700002203253773013403275856008403409852000903493655001203502IND60673943520221207144916.0201025e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067394352DNAL7 aPMC71040722pmcid7 a317961742pmid7 a10.1016/j.vprsr.2019.1003422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGueldner, Emily Katharina10aFirst case of a natural infection in a domestic cat (Felis catus) with the canid heart worm Angiostrongylus vasorum  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCardiopulmonary nematodes in cats include different parasite species affecting feline lungs and the heart, with the metastrongyloid Aelurostrongylus abstrusus being the most frequent feline lungworm worldwide. The present case report describes an 11-month-old male neutered European short hair cat which presented with generalised subcutaneous oedema and pleural and peritoneal effusions. According to clinical examination, abdominal imaging and laboratory analyses, a tentative diagnosis of severe glomerulopathy with massive proteinuria was made. Due to worsening of the clinical signs despite therapeutic interventions and a poor prognosis, the cat was euthanised. Necropsy and histological examinations revealed severe bilateral collagenofibrotic glomerulopathy, generalised oedema and a focal verminous pneumonia with thrombosis in arterial lung vessels containing nematode cross sections. A serum sample was tested for the presence of antibodies against the cat lungworm A. abstrusus, resulting negative. Genetic analyses confirmed the presence of nematode DNA; after exclusion of common lung and heart parasites occurring in cats, DNA of the canid heart worm nematode Angiostrongylus vasorum was identified. This is the first description of a naturally occurring infection with A. vasorum in a cat. Previous experimental studies demonstrated the development of adult male and female A. vasorum worms containing eggs in cats, but no larval excretion in the faeces. Although cats did not become patent, A. vasorum infections were clinically relevant. As A. abstrusus and A. vasorum are both gastropod transmitted nematodes, they may share the same intermediate hosts within overlapping areas. In addition, especially chronic A. abstrusus infected cats become non-patent and do not excrete L1. Considering that patent A. vasorum infections are widespread in the dog and fox population in Switzerland (and several other countries) but are apparently not patent in cats, we cannot exclude that infections with A. vasorum may occur more frequently than expected.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAelurostrongylus 3aAngiostrongylus vasorum 3aDNA 3aGastropoda 3aadults 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3acase studies 3acat diseases 3acats 3aclinical examination 3adogs 3aedema 3aeggs 3aexcretion 3afeces 3afemales 3afoxes 3agenetic analysis 3aglomerulopathy 3aheart 3ahistology 3aimage analysis 3aintermediate hosts 3alarvae 3alungs 3alungworms 3amales 3anecropsy 3apneumonia 3aprognosis 3aproteinuria 3atherapeutics 3athrombosis 3aSwitzerland 0aAngiostrongylus vasorum 0aCanid heart worm 0aFelis catus 0aAberrant infection 0aGlomerulopathy 0aGenetic confirmation1 aSchuppisser, Carole1 aBorel, Nicole1 aHilbe, Monika1 aSchnyder, Manuela0 tVeterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports.g2019 Dec., v. 18 p.100342-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23280x2405-93907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2019.1003423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245009100160300001600251520178200267592002802049653002502077653002102102653002102123653001802144653001802162653002002180653002002200653001602220653001302236700002202249700001702271700002402288773010902312856007402421961001202495852000902507655001202516IND60131398020221120141722.0151127e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013139802DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaab, Victoria A.10aModeling Nest Survival of Cavity-Nesting Birds in Relation to Postfire Salvage Logging  ap. 794-804.  aSalvage logging practices in recently burned forests often have direct effects on species associated with dead trees, particularly cavity-nesting birds. As such, evaluation of postfire management practices on nest survival rates of cavity nesters is necessary for determining conservation strategies. We monitored 1,797 nests of 6 cavity-nesting bird species: Lewis's woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis), hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), black-backed woodpecker (P. arcticus), northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), western bluebird (Sialia mexicana), and mountain bluebird (S. currucoides) from 1994 to 2004 in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), mixed-severity burned forests (partially logged and unlogged) of Idaho, USA. Based on a priori hypotheses, we modeled daily survival rate (DSR) of nests as a function of abiotic (temperature, precipitation), temporal (time since fire, calendar year) and biotic factors (distance to unburned forest, nest height, and tree harvest [partial-salvage logging vs. unlogged]). Multiple abiotic and biotic factors, other than direct effects of salvage logging, affected daily survival rates of breeding cavity-nesting birds. Hairy woodpecker was the only species in which partial-salvage logging had a measurable, negative impact on DSR. Managers implementing carefully planned salvage logging prescriptions that include both unlogged reserves and partially logged areas can expect to maintain habitat for successfully breeding cavity-nesting birds of the interior northwestern United States. Our results also suggest that nest survival for some species of cavitynesting birds could be improved if unlogged reserves are located centrally in postfire forests, distant from unburned habitats that potentially serve as sources of nest predators.  aPublisher supplied data 0acavity-nesting birds 0aColaptes auratus 0aMelanerpes lewis 0anest survival 0aPicoides spp. 0aPinus ponderosa 0asalvage logging 0aSialia spp. 0awildfire1 aRussell, Robin E.1 aRotella, Jay1 aDudley, Jonathan G.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2011 May, v. 75, no. 4 p.794-804dThe Wildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fjwmg.1113Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle05292naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002200167245010400189300001400293500002000307520377700327592002804104650001504132650002504147650002304172650002404195650001104219650002404230650001404254650001404268650001004282650001204292650002104304650001704325650002104342650002604363650001504389650002604404650002504430650002204455650002104477650001804498650001004516650001504526700002104541773010804562852000904670856010704679655001204786IND2202796320221118185315.0161030e200002  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220279632DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9615(2000)070[0073:HAPSCC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarson, Walter P.10aHerbivory and plant species coexistence: community regulation by an outbreaking phytophagous insect  ap. 73-99.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMost general theories proposed to explain the trophic structure of communities ignore the possibility that insect outbreaks can severely damage vegetation and reduce the abundance of dominant plant species over vast areas. Specialist chrysomelid beetles can irrupt and defoliate goldenrods (Solidago spp.), a group of widespread, long‐lived, herbaceous perennials. We examined the long‐term effects (10 yr) of suppressing insects, using insecticide in replicated plots on the structure and diversity of an old field dominated by the goldenrod, Solidago altissima. An outbreak of the chrysomelid beetle, Microrhopala vittata, that specializes on S. altissima, occurred during the experiment and persisted several years. Damage caused by this outbreak dramatically reduced the biomass, density, height, survivorship, and reproduction of S. altissima. Herbivore exclusion caused the formation of dense stands of goldenrods with a twofold increase in both standing crop biomass and litter. The understory in these dense stands had significantly lower plant abundance, species richness, flowering shoot production, and light levels; these conditions persisted for years following the outbreak. Thus, M. vittata functioned as a keystone species. Furthermore, insect herbivory indirectly increased the abundance of invading trees, thereby increasing the rate of succession, by speeding the transition of this old field to a tree‐dominated stage. We conducted two follow‐up experiments to test the hypothesis that insects altered community dynamics by their indirect effect on litter accumulation and light availability in the understory. In the first experiment, we tied back the canopy to increase light into the understory and removed litter in both the insecticide‐treated and control plots. We found little effect of removing litter. By contrast, increasing understory light levels significantly increased understory forb abundance and species richness. In the second experiment, we placed rosettes of Hieracium pratense, the dominant understory forb, under nine levels of shade cloth, ranging from 95% shade to full sun. Flowering‐shoot production was a linear function of light availability (r² = 0.92; P < 0.0001). We concluded that insect herbivores indirectly promoted plant species richness and coexistence, primarily by augmenting light availability to suppressed understory species. Insect herbivory may often play a strong role in goldenrod stands, because outbreaks will likely occur at least once, if not more, during the period when goldenrods are dominant. Furthermore, our findings provide compelling evidence for two general mechanisms whereby insect herbivory promotes plant species diversity and coexistence. The first mechanism operates during outbreaks when insects act as keystone species. The second mechanism can operate at less than outbreak levels and occurs whenever insect damage augments light to a sufficient degree to enhance the fecundity of suppressed nonhost species. If this increase in fecundity increases recruitment of subordinate species, then insect herbivory will promote plant species coexistence and diversity. Our data suggest that there is a continuum in the influence of insect herbivory on plant communities from the more subtle, but important, effects of herbivory on the fecundity of nonhost species to the devastating influence of outbreaks. Also, our results demonstrate that long‐term experiments are required to elucidate the role of insect herbivores. Finally, we propose that insect outbreaks are common enough in many community types, particularly forests, to warrant explicit consideration in theories of trophic regulation, particularly in terrestrial communities inhabited by long‐lived plant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3aPilosella caespitosa 3aSolidago altissima 3aaboveground biomass 3acanopy 3acommunity structure 3afecundity 3aflowering 3aforbs 3aforests 3ainsect outbreaks 3ainsecticides 3akeystone species 3along term experiments 3aperennials 3apesticide application 3aphytophagous insects 3aplant communities 3aspecies richness 3asurvival rate 3atrees 3aunderstory1 aRoot, Richard B.0 tEcological monographs.g2000 Feb., v. 70, no. 1 p.73-99dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9615(2000)070%5B0073:HAPSCC%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03384naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245008800160300001600248520223600264592002802500653001802528653001802546653002402564653001502588653000802603653002702611653001502638653001002653653003102663700002302694700002302717700002402740700002102764700002102785773010902806856007402915852000902989655001202998IND60131398420221120141714.0151127e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013139842DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcRoberts, Jon T.10aDetectability of Lesser Prairie-Chicken Leks: A Comparison of Surveys from Aircraft  ap. 771-778.  aLesser prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) are traditionally monitored by spring roadbased lek surveys and counts of males attending leks. Several weaknesses exist with ground-based monitoring methods such as the bias of restricting surveys to roads, unknown probability of lek detection, and man-hours required to survey large tracts of habitat. We evaluated aerial surveys to locate lesser prairie-chicken leks in Texas and New Mexico using a Cessna 172 airplane (C172), R-22 Beta II helicopter (R-22), and R-44 Raven II helicopter (R-44) during spring 2007––2008. We determined lek activity during surveys with remote cameras placed on leks and cross-referenced time on the photo frame to time on our Global Positioning System flight log. From remote cameras we found that 305 leks were available for detection during survey flights. We determined lek detectability was 32.7% (95% CI = 20.3––47.1%) in the C172, 72.3% (64.50–– 79.14%) in the R-22, and 89.8% (82.0––95.0%) in the R-44. We created 16 a priori logistic regression models incorporating aircraft platform, distance to lek, survey date, lek size, and lek type to explain lek detection from aerial surveys. Our top ranked model included platform, distance, and lek type (model weight; w₁ = 0.288). We had four competitive models and model averaged to draw inferences. Model averaging showed that detectability was generally greatest with the R-44, followed by the R-22, and lowest with the C172, with a slight deviation from this ranking at increased distances. Within our transect width, model averaging also suggested that detectability decreased as distance from the transect to the lek increased during helicopter surveys, and detectability increased as distance from the transect to the lek increased during C172 surveys. Furthermore, man-made leks were more likely to be detected than natural leks and large leks were more likely to be detected than medium or small leks. Aerial surveys effectively locate new leks and monitor lek density, and alleviate weaknesses associated with ground-based monitoring. We recommend using the R-44 to conduct lek surveys while flying at an altitude of 15 m at a speed of 60 km/hr on sunny mornings.  aPublisher supplied data 0aaerial survey 0adetectability 0afixed-wing aircraft 0ahelicopter 0alek 0alesser prairie-chicken 0aNew Mexico 0aTexas 0aTympanuchus pallidicinctus1 aButler, Matthew J.1 aBallard, Warren B.1 aWhitlaw, Heather A.1 aHaukos, David A.1 aWallace, Mark C.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2011 May, v. 75, no. 4 p.771-778dThe Wildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fjwmg.1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05418naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002100167245007800188300001600266500002000282520385800302592002804160650002804188650001904216650001404235650001704249650001704266650001404283650001604297650001404313650001504327650002404342650001004366650002504376650001604401650000904417650001504426650001104441650001404452650003104466650001704497650002304514650001404537650001104551650000904562650001704571650001804588650001204606700002004618773011004638852000904748856010704757655001204864IND2202796820221118185429.0161030e200002  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220279682DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9615(2000)070[0149:FSHATF]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOdion, Dennis C.10aFire, soil heating, and the formation of vegetation patterns in chaparral  ap. 149-169.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe documented patterns of surface heating associated with chaparral fire to characterize fundamental scale variation in the intensity of this stand‐replacing disturbance. To test how this variation may influence community structure, we studied its effect on the soil seed bank and the distribution of seedlings and resprouts that emerged after fire. To evaluate the long‐term significance of initial patterns, we monitored vegetation development for 4–5 yr, thereby encompassing the dynamic portion of the chaparral fire cycle. We studied two stands on level uniform terrain before, during, and after fall fires. Stands were dominated by chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum), a postfire seeder/sprouter. Nonsprouting Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus spp. were also present. Preburn vegetation, seed populations, soil heating, and postburn plant growth were analyzed along transects of contiguous 1‐m² plots, so that we could block them together incrementally to identify scale dependence of patterns. In addition, we directly compared heating effects under the fuel array with those just outside by establishing plots in canopy gaps, under the adjacent canopy, and in gaps created and eliminated by reciprocally translocating fuel. Pre‐ and postburn seed populations were estimated in soil samples collected from all plots. The proportion of seed that survived above and below 2.5 cm in the soil was determined in a subset of plots. The amount and distribution of canopy fuel that collapsed during fire and smoldered on the ground caused pronounced spatial variation in total surface heating. The strength of relationships among patterns of soil heating, preburn canopy, surviving seeds, and seedlings and herbaceous resprouts was consistently most pronounced in blocks 3–5 m long. At this scale, postburn patterns were strongly negatively associated with the amount of preburn canopy and the pattern of soil heating this fuel created. Seedlings or herbaceous resprouts of numerous species were abundant where soil heating was relatively low, most notably in natural and created canopy gaps. Conversely, areas where dense canopy occurred before fire, especially gaps displaced by fuel addition, were barren except for occasional Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus seedlings. These obligate postfire seeders, along with the subshrub Helianthemum scoparium, had more deeply buried seeds, and some of them were able to survive where soil heating was prolonged. However, Helianthemum did not emerge from depth. Seedlings of Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus nearest Adenostoma burls survived significantly better when Adenostoma failed to resprout. This was common in one burn where heating was relatively high and burl size was small. Seed mortality prevented Adenostoma seedling emergence from occurring where its seeds were most abundant prior to fire, which was in proximity to its burls. Adenostoma seedlings did emerge in areas of lower soil heating, but their survival was inversely related to the density of Helianthemum seedlings. No shrub seedlings emerged after the first year following fire because their seed banks were exhausted by fire‐induced mortality and/or germination. After 4–5 yr, few young Adenostoma remained. The combination of seedling and resprout regeneration allowed this shrub to maintain dominance, but to a lesser extent in the older stand. Our results support a vegetation pattern–process model in which local species distributions after fire in Adenostoma chaparral are antecedently linked to the physical and chemical properties of the canopy. These control the nature of combustion, the soil heating that results, and the distribution of seeds and resprout tissues that survive. The vegetation develops entirely from these sources, so fire‐induced patterns are manifest in the long‐term structure of this vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenostoma fasciculatum 3aArctostaphylos 3aCeanothus 3aHelianthemum 3aburied seeds 3aburl wood 3acanopy gaps 3achaparral 3acombustion 3acommunity structure 3afires 3afuels (fire ecology) 3agermination 3aheat 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amortality 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplant growth 3aseedling emergence 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3asoil 3asoil heating 3asoil sampling 3atissues1 aDavis, Frank W.0 tEcological monographs.g2000 Feb., v. 70, no. 1 p.149-169dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9615(2000)070%5B0149:FSHATF%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03286naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001900167245008500186300001600271500002000287520180800307592002802115650002102143650002102164650001102185650001602196650002802212650001202240650001402252650001102266650001702277650001402294650002002308650002402328650001302352650002102365650002002386650001402406650002002420650001502440651001102455700001502466700001702481700001902498700002002517700001902537773009602556852000902652856010702661655001202768IND2321355920221118035544.0170626e200104  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232135592DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[0933:TULHOA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalling, J.

We tested the validity of this assumption for Alseis blackiana, a common canopy tree in central Panama, by examining its seed germination, seedling growth, and sapling distribution, growth, and mortality. We found that the early life history of Alseis is characteristic of pioneer species: the seed germination rate was much higher in forest gaps than in the forest understory, small seedlings were absent from the understory, and seedlings showed strong plastic responses to variation in light. Seedling relative growth rate, leaf area production rate, and maximum carbon assimilation rates of Alseis are much more similar to those of the pioneer tree Miconia argentea than to those of the non‐pioneer tree Tetragastris panamensis. However, in contrast to Miconia, established seedlings of Alseis are capable of remarkable persistence in the understory; in a 1‐ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, the mortality rate for 722 saplings <1 cm dbh was <4% per year between 1986 and 1998. We suspect that shade tolerance in Alseis is achieved by both physiological and morphological adaptations, e.g., efficient light interception by thin, nonoverlapping leaves, tolerance to litterfall damage, and a high resprouting capacity. These results show that existing functional group classifications do not account for the full range of seedling trait combinations found in tropical trees and indicate that a gap requirement for seedling establishment need not limit the abundance of adult individuals in a stand.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlseis blackiana 3aMiconia argentea 3aadults 3acanopy gaps 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3aislands 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3alife history 3amortality 3apioneer species 3aplant establishment 3asaplings 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3ashade tolerance 3aunderstory 3aPanama1 aWinter, K.1 aNason, J.

With the increasing dosage of Li⁺ ions in the NaYF₄:Yb/Er crystals, their morphologies are changed from rod to disk and finally to polyhedron. However, the morphologies of NaYF₄:Yb/Er crystals doped with K⁺ ions almost keep the rod-like shape. In addition, the phase transition of LiₓNa₁₋ ₓYF₄ crystals initiates when x is equal to or larger than 0.5, but the phase of KyNa₁₋ yYF₄ remains unchanged even if y reaches 0.85. Furthermore, the UC emission intensity of NaYF₄:Yb/Er crystals reduces with the doping of Li⁺ ions. On the contrary, the UC emission intensity of NaYF₄:Yb/Er crystals increases as K⁺ ions are introduced. It is interesting that the green and red UC emissions of the K₀.₇Na₀.₃YF₄:Yb,Er crystal are high 8 and 7 times, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3aemissions 3afluorescence 3aions 3aphase transition1 aYang, Xiaohong1 aZhao, Lijun0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 229 p.429-435dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01617naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245007600161300001800237520062200255592002800877653002000905653001600925653001400941653002200955653001500977653001600992700003501008700002301043700003001066773011201096856007401208852000901282655001201291IND60131400020221118034531.0151127e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013140002DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBengsen, Andrew J.10aUsing a General Index Approach to Analyze Camera-Trap Abundance Indices  ap. 1222-1227.  aThe lack of variance estimates constrain the utility of abundance indices calculated from camera-trap data.

If a species is a good competitor when measured by one component of fitness (e.g., seedling growth), but a poor competitor when measured by a different component of fitness (e.g., seedling survival), understanding the relative importance of each component of fitness for persistence in the community is critical to understanding how communities are structured. Using a field and a garden experiment in southeastern Michigan, we generated competitive response hierarchies among 4–8 old‐field perennials for five components of fitness (germination, seedling growth, seedling survival, adult growth, and adult survival). We examined how the overall response to neighbors changes among components of fitness, the concordance of hierarchies within and among components of fitness, and the correlations between competitive hierarchies and natural abundance. We found little to no overall effect of neighbors on germination and seedling survival, indicating a high tolerance (= strong response competitive ability) of species for neighbors as measured by these components of fitness. We found a strong effect of neighbors on seedling growth, and on adult survival and growth, indicating poorer response competitive ability overall for these components. Although rankings of competitive ability were concordant among species across all components of fitness, certain demographic parameters were more consistent in their rankings than others. Specifically, competitive response hierarchies based on size were strongly concordant, while those based on survival were not. This suggests that future studies may effectively estimate response competitive ability for growth with a single estimate, but that estimates of response competitive ability for survival at both the seedling and adult stages may be required. Finally, competitive response rankings based on germination and seedling growth were most strongly correlated with abundance, suggesting that these components of fitness more strongly influence success in the community than do seedling survival and adult growth and survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3agardens 3agermination 3aperennials 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aMichigan1 aGoldberg, Deborah E.0 tEcology.g2001 Apr., v. 82, no. 4 p.979-990dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082%5B0979:CRHFGG%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01983naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245021300162300001600375520080100391592002801192650002501220650001601245650000701261650003001268650002001298700001501318700001601333700001401349700001301363700001701376700001801393773009701411856008101508990002301589852000901612655001201621IND60093298220221120215931.0141103e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009329822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xin10aEffect of dosing sequence and raw water pH on coagulation performance and flocs properties using dual-coagulation of polyaluminum chloride and compound bioflocculant in low temperature surface water treatment  ap. 477-483.  aA series jar test was conducted to study the impact of dosing sequence and solution pH on coagulation and flocs properties by dual-coagulants of polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and compound bioflocculant (CBF) in low temperature surface water treatment.

Daily nest-survival rate was positively related to maximum daily temperature during the nest interval and to density of large-diameter trees surrounding the nest tree. We developed a niche-based habitat suitability model (partitioned Mahalanobis distance) for nesting white-headed woodpeckers using remotely sensed data. Along with low elevation, high density of large trees, and low slope, our habitat suitability model suggested that interspersion-juxtaposition of low- and high-canopy cover ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) patches was important for nest-site suitability. Cross-validation suggested the model performed adequately for management planning at a scale >1 ha. Evaluation of mapped habitat suitability index (HSI) suggested that the maximum predictive gain (HSI = 0.36), where the number of nest locations are maximized in the smallest proportion of the modeled landscape, provided an objective initial threshold for identification of suitable habitat. However, managers can choose the threshold HSI most appropriate for their purposes (e.g., locating regions of low-moderate suitability that have potential for habitat restoration). Consequently, our habitat suitability model may be useful for managing dry coniferous forests for white-headed woodpeckers in central Oregon; however, model validation is necessary before our model could be applied to other locations.  aPublisher supplied data 0anest survival 0aniche model 0apartitioned Mahalanobis distance 0aPicoides albolarvatus 0aponderosa pine forests 0aremote sensing 0awhite-headed woodpecker1 aSaab, Victoria A.1 aFrenzel, Richard W.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2011 June, v. 75, no. 5 p.1061-1071dThe Wildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fjwmg.1463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002600167245010500193300001800298500002000316520232300336592002802659650001602687650001602703650001402719650001002733650002402743650002602767650001302793650001102806650001102817650002302828650001502851650001702866650002202883700002102905773009702926852000903023856010703032655001203139IND2322515620221118185041.0170626e200105  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232251562DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[1360:EOEHFO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSummerville, Keith S.10aEffects of experimental habitat fragmentation on patch use by butterflies and skippers (lepidoptera)  ap. 1360-1370.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe conducted an experimental study to assess the effects of habitat fragmentation on patch use by butterflies and skippers. Five fragmentation treatments (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% habitat remaining) were replicated five times by selectively mowing 15 × 15 m patches of an old field. Community and species responses to fragmentation were tested against several alternative predictions: (1) the proportional area hypothesis, in which species richness or abundance declines linearly with habitat area, (2) the patch heterogeneity hypothesis, in which richness or abundance peaks at intermediate levels of fragmentation, (3) the critical threshold hypothesis, in which a nonlinear decrease in richness or abundance occurs below some critical level of habitat loss, and (4) the patch quality hypothesis, in which declines in richness or abundance with increasing habitat loss are partially offset by the resource value of the remnant habitat. We found that fragmentation treatment significantly affected species richness and total number of patch visits for the overall community, as well as the numbers of patch visits by individual species. Community and species responses were linearly related to the amount of habitat remaining, as predicted by the proportional area model of fragmentation. We also found that plots with a higher cover of flowering forbs received greater patch use. Thus, the effects of habitat quantity (patch area) and habitat quality (flower cover) were independent and additive, suggesting that moderately sized patches of high resource quality may be equivalent to large patches of lower quality. Therefore, to maintain local population densities of Lepidoptera, it may be possible to compensate for losses in habitat area with improvements in habitat quality. Species did not uniformly respond to fragmentation. Rare species were disproportionately affected by fragmentation and did not occur in patches with <40% habitat remaining. Several common species appeared unaffected by fragmentation; however, other common species were also significantly influenced by fragmentation treatment. These findings support the notion that rare species may be especially vulnerable to fragmentation, but it could be quite difficult to predict a priori how more common species will respond to habitat loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepidoptera 3abutterflies 3aflowering 3aforbs 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3amodels 3amowing 3apopulation density 3aprediction 3arare species 3aspecies diversity1 aCrist, Thomas O.0 tEcology.g2001 May, v. 82, no. 5 p.1360-1370dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082%5B1360:EOEHFO%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle04009naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002400167245010600191300001800297500002000315520266500335592002803000650002403028650002103052650002803073650001503101650002003116650001703136650001103153650001603164650001003180650001503190650001503205650001103220650001403231650001103245650001703256650001403273650001903287650001003306700002203316773009703338852000903435856010703444655001203551IND2322517020221118185021.0170626e200105  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232251702DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[1387:EOFOSP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallin, Kimberly F.10aEffects of folivory on subcortical plant defenses: can defense theories predict interguild processes?  ap. 1387-1400.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe manner and extent to which physiological alterations resulting from folivory can affect the growth, survival, and resistance of trees against subsequent insects and fungi is poorly understood. Information obtained under natural conditions and with subcortically feeding insects is particularly lacking. We evaluated the effects of varying levels of natural feeding by a folivore on subsequent host growth, survival, and suitability to subcortical insects and fungi and also considered implications as to how source limitations caused by defoliation relate to current plant defense theories. The study system consisted of Choristoneura pinus pinus, the jack pine budworm, on Pinus banksiana Lamb., jack pine. We quantified a range of defoliation by C. pinus pinus in test trees and measured parameters of host defenses and colonization by bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) and woodborers (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). We also measured colonization and accompanying tree mortality attributable to these insects. Tree physiological parameters and insect colonization patterns were measured over a 24‐mo period. Primary resin flow rates and the ability of active responses to confine the bark beetle's fungal symbiont Ophiostoma ips within the phloem, were reduced by high levels of defoliation. These patterns were further influenced by host seasonal phenology and time since defoliation. The predominant subcortical insects responding to defoliation by C. pinus pinus were Ips grandicollis and Monochamus carolinensis. Colonization by these insects together increased exponentially in relation to defoliation level, but the two species differentially exploited trees from particular defoliation levels. The loss of growth among surviving trees increased with defoliation intensity. However, growth and defensive capacity were not related, either negatively or positively, during any interval of this study. Depending on the length of time since defoliation stress, the relationship between plant defense and defoliation intensity was either parabolic, as predicted by growth differentiation theory, or inverse linear, as predicted by plant stress theory. Thus, differing models depicting how carbon allocation and overall carbon availability can influence secondary‐chemical metabolism in plants may represent various stages along a temporal continuum. Our results suggest that the time since a stress is exerted is an important variant that should be incorporated into synthetic theories of plant defense. These results also suggest that integrative models of plant defense theory can be extended to describe impacts on community‐level interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChoristoneura pinus 3aIps grandicollis 3aMonochamus carolinensis 3aOphiostoma 3aPinus banksiana 3abark beetles 3acarbon 3adefoliation 3afungi 3aherbivores 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aphenology 3aphloem 3aplant stress 3asymbionts 3atree mortality 3atrees1 aRaffa, Kenneth F.0 tEcology.g2001 May, v. 82, no. 5 p.1387-1400dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082%5B1387:EOFOSP%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03177naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002500167245009300192300001800285500002000303520196800323592002802291650002402319650002902343650001002372650002402382650001002406650001502416650001202431650001602443650002202459650001002481650001302491650001502504650002502519700002202544773009702566852000902663856010702672655001202779IND2322513620221118185038.0170626e200105  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232251362DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[1319:FLIEHF]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteinauer, Ernest M.10aFeedback loops in ecological hierarchies following urine deposition in tallgrass prairie  ap. 1319-1329.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlthough theory predicts that large‐scale factors will constrain small‐scale interactions, the potential for small‐scale events to impact large‐scale patch structure is less clear. We examined experimentally the effects of urine deposition, a highly localized event, on small‐ and large‐scale vegetation structure and spatial variation in tallgrass prairie. The response by vegetation to urine deposition may be mediated by grazing. Thus, we also determined the probability of urine patches serving as foci for grazing events by bison. Likelihood of bison grazing was much higher on vs. off urine patches, and grazed areas initiated on urine patches expanded well beyond the area of urine deposition. Abundance of four common graminoid species, and of all graminoids combined, increased on urine patches in ungrazed prairie, while the abundance of Andropogon gerardii and total graminoids decreased on urine patches in grazed prairie. The abundance of Aster ericoides, and all forbs combined, increased on urine patches in ungrazed, but not in grazed, prairie. Species richness and Shannon‐Weiner diversity increased on urine patches in ungrazed prairie but were not affected by urine treatment in grazed prairie. Total spatial variance of graminoids increased relative to controls in response to urine treatment, grazing, and the combination of these treatments. For forbs, total variance increased marginally compared to controls only in response to urine treatment in ungrazed prairie. In combination, urine patches plus grazing produced unique large‐scale patch structure compared to urine patches in ungrazed prairie. The most important impact of urine patches on community structure resulted from preferential grazing of urine patches by bison, which increases both the size and severity of the grazed area. Urine patches are thus an example of a small‐scale perturbation that generates larger‐scale patch structure in tallgrass prairie.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndropogon gerardii 3aSymphyotrichum ericoides 3abison 3acommunity structure 3aforbs 3agraminoids 3agrazing 3aprobability 3aspecies diversity 3aurine 3avariance 3avegetation 3avegetation structure1 aCollins, Scott L.0 tEcology.g2001 May, v. 82, no. 5 p.1319-1329dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082%5B1319:FLIEHF%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02373naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010100163300001600264520126700280592002801547650001401575650002501589650001501614650001301629650001401642650001201656650001101668650001101679650001001690650001601700700001901716700002201735700002001757773009701777856008101874990002301955852000901978655001201987IND60093298920221120230629.0141103e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009329892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiura, Shin10aIn situ synthesis of Ni/MgO catalysts on inorganic paper-like matrix for methane steam reforming  ap. 515-521.  aIn situ synthesis of nickel/magnesium oxides (Ni/MgO) on a microstructured inorganic paper support was investigated to develop high-performance, easily handled, paper-like catalysts, using two different methods: sequential impregnation and co-impregnation approaches. Porous paper supports were prepared beforehand using a conventional papermaking technique, and then simply impregnated with Mg(NO₃)₂ and Ni(NO₃)₂ solutions, either stepwise or at the same time. After reduction in a hydrogen flow, Ni/MgO catalysts were formed in the paper composites. The as-prepared Ni/MgO paper is much like an ordinary paper product, being flexible, lightweight, and easy to handle. The Ni/MgO paper composites, especially the co-impregnated paper, exhibited excellent catalytic performances in the steam reforming of methane, and produced hydrogen much more efficiently than did commercial Ni-based catalysts in powdered and pellet forms. The Ni/MgO paper composites also showed good durability for 24-h continuous reaction, and maintained their initial efficiency for methane steam reforming. These results were attributed to the favorable supply of gaseous reactants to the active Ni/MgO catalysts, which were well distributed inside a microporous paper structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3achemical engineering 3adurability 3ahydrogen 3amagnesium 3amethane 3anickel 3aoxides 3apaper 3apapermaking1 aUmemura, Yuuka1 aShiratori, Yusuke1 aKitaoka, Takuya0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 229 p.515-521dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0523Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010100167300001600268500001500284520165200299592002801951650001101979650001401990650001102004650002502015650001102040650002302051650001802074650001202092650001102104650001502115653001002130700002002140773009702160856008102257990002302338852000902361655001202370IND60093299420221121001920.0141103e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009329942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNauha, Elina K.10aModeling method for combining fluid dynamics and algal growth in a bubble column photobioreactor  ap. 559-568.  a2019-12-06  aA comprehensive modeling method for algal growth in a photobioreactor is introduced. The model integrates fluid dynamics, mass transfer and the growth kinetics of algae. Availability of light, nutrients and carbon source as well as oxygen inhibition on growth is considered. The modeling approach has three-stages: (1) Detailed prediction of the flow field by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), (2) Division of the computational domain into larger compartments (blocks or zones), and (3) Compartmental modeling. Compartmentalization is performed because calculations with CFD would be very time consuming. Use of the compartmental model allows fast calculation of several concurrent phenomena while accuracy of the important flow parameters is retained. The approach uses a dynamic model called photosynthetic factory to model algal biomass growth. The combination of fluid dynamics and light distribution in the reactor model is important because the fluid dynamics defines the time–irradiance profile the algal cell experiences. Adequate mixing is therefore not only important for mass transfer but for light distribution as well. The movement of biomass in the column between light and dark areas allows for the continuation of growth even at high biomass concentrations, where light is only available on the sides of the reactor. The model is inherently capable of predicting this behavior from the fluid dynamics without the need to define time–irradiance profiles i.e. light–dark cycles. A comprehensive model such as this is needed for photobioreactor design and scale up, because the phenomena in the reactor are all interdependent.  aPublisher supplied data 3amixing 3anutrients 3amodels 3achemical engineering 3acarbon 3agrowth retardation 3amass transfer 3abiomass 3aoxygen 3aprediction 0aAlgae1 aAlopaeus, Ville0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 229 p.559-568dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0653Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010800166300001400274520103000288592002801318650001501346650001501361650001201376650001101388650001801399650002501417650001101442650001501453650001501468650001901483650001601502650001101518650001601529700001901545700001701564700002101581700001901602773009501621856008101716990002301797852000901820655001201829IND60093300120221119235649.0141103e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009330012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.04.1132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhare, Prateek10aCarbon nanofibers containing metal-doped porous carbon beads for environmental remediation applications  ap. 72-81.  aCarbon nanofibers (CNFs) were grown in porous carbon beads (∼0.5mm) by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).

The carbon beads decorated with Ni- or Fe-CNFs were tested as adsorbents for the removal of different pollutants in the aqueous phase. The prepared material showed superior performance relative to the parent metal-doped porous carbon beads without CNFs. The loadings of vitamin B12 (vit B12) on Ni-CNF beads and that of arsenic (As) on Fe-CNF beads were determined to be 180mg/g and 18mg/g, corresponding to an aqueous phase vitamin B12 concentration of 250ppm and an As concentration of 50ppm, respectively.

Its production reaches a maximum within 20âh, and thereafter is maintained at an almost constant level. The differentiated cells show phorbol 12âmyristate 13âacetate (PMA)âstimulated NADPH oxidase activity consistent with the amount of gp91phox (phagocytic oxidase) expressed in the plasma membrane. Three isoforms of p21âactivated serine/threonine kinases, PAK68, PAK65 and PAK62, were found in both cytosolic and membrane fractions, and their contents were significantly increased during induced differentiation. The amount of Rac identified in the two fractions was also markedly enhanced by ATRAâ induced differentiation. In contrast, neither PAK nor Rac was seen in the plasma membrane of undifferentiated HLâ60 or human neutrophil, but they were abundant in the cytoplasmic fraction. Binding of Rac with PAK isoforms was shown in the membrane upon induced differentiation of HLâ60 cells. Direct binding of purified Rac1 to PAK68 was quantified using a fluorescent analog of GTP (methylanthraniloyl guanosineâ5â²â[Î²,Î³âimido]triphosphate) bound to Rac as a reporter group. Rac1 bound to PAK68 with a 1â:â1 stoichiometry and with a Kd value of 6.7ânm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3afluorescence 3aguanosine triphosphate 3ahumans 3aleukemia 3aneutrophils 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein-serine-threonine kinases 3aserine 3astoichiometry 3asuperoxide anion 3athreonine1 aOgawa, Hisamitsu0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2002 May 15, v. 269, no. 10 p.2622-2629dBlackwell Science, Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.02939.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002200167245006800189300001800257500002000275520118600295592002801481650001801509650001601527650002001543650001001563650002301573650001401596650001101610650001101621650001501632650001801647650001401665650002301679650002401702650002101726650001401747700002101761773009801782852000901880856010701889655001201996IND2323875720221118041141.0170626e200108  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232387572DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[2294:PRIAAI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohler, Steven L.10aPopulation regulation in an aquatic insect: the role of disease  ap. 2294-2305.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe studied the dynamics of a univoltine stream‐dwelling caddisfly, Brachycentrus americanus, and its microsporidian disease for 15 yr. The pathogen is highly virulent, with infections generally resulting in death during the larval stage. In most years, we sampled Brachycentrus immatures every 1–2 mo to estimate population density and disease prevalence. Brachycentrus population dynamics exhibited strong evidence for direct and delayed (1 generation lag) density dependence and appeared to cycle with a period of ∼4 yr. Pathogen prevalence in Brachycentrus was >10% in all generations and frequently exceeded 50%. Disease prevalence also exhibited cyclic behavior, with peaks in prevalence following Brachycentrus generations with relatively high population density. There was no evidence for direct density‐dependent parasitism, but there was strong evidence for density‐dependent infection delayed by one generation. A path analysis model suggested that the disease mediated much of the strong density dependence observed in Brachycentrus. Collectively, these observations suggest that the pathogen is largely responsible for driving observed Brachycentrus dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrosporidia 3aTrichoptera 3aaquatic insects 3adeath 3adisease prevalence 3aimmatures 3alarvae 3amodels 3aparasitism 3apath analysis 3apathogens 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3aunivoltine habit 3avirulence1 aHoiland, Wade K.0 tEcology.g2001 Aug., v. 82, no. 8 p.2294-2305dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082%5B2294:PRIAAI%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02601naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245009500159300001800254520152500272592002801797653003901825653001301864653001201877653001201889653001201901653001501913653001401928653002401942700002201966700002001988700002002008700001602028773011202044856007402156852000902230655001202239IND60131403020221118034534.0151127e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013140302DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.1682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergman, Eric J.10aBiological and Socio-Economic Effects of Statewide Limitation of Deer Licenses in Colorado  ap. 1443-1452.  aWe evaluated the biological and socio-economic effects of statewide limitation of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) hunting licenses, which began in Colorado in 1999. We implemented a before-after-control-impact (BACI) analysis of annual helicopter sex and age class surveys, collected as part of the Colorado Division of Wildlife's routine monitoring, to assess changes in adult male/adult female ratios and fawn/adult female ratios in response to this change in harvest management. Following statewide limitation and reduction of license sales (1999––2006), we observed increases in adult male/adult female ratios of 7.39 (SE = 2.36) to 15.23 (SE = 1.22) adult males per 100 adult females in moderately limited areas and of 17.55 (SE = 3.27) to 21.86 (SE = 2.31) adult males per 100 adult females in highly limited areas. We simultaneously observed reductions in fawn/adult female ratios in newly limited areas by as much as 6.96 (SE = 2.19) fawns per 100 females, whereas in areas that had previously been limited we observed stabilization of fawn/adult female ratios at levels lower than levels observed under the unlimited harvest management structure. An immediate decline of $7.86 million in annual revenue stemmed from the change in harvest management, but revenue subsequently rebounded. This study provides preliminary evidence of potential effects that other state and provincial wildlife management agencies may face as they consider shifting mule deer harvest management towards limited license scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 0abefore-after-control-impact (BACI) 0aColorado 0aharvest 0ahunting 0alicense 0amanagement 0amule deer 0aOdocoileus hemionus1 aWatkins, Bruce E.1 aBishop, Chad J.1 aLukacs, Paul M.1 aLloyd, Mary0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2011 Aug., v. 75, no. 6 p.1443-1452dThe Wildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fjwmg.1683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03630naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002000167245009200187300001600279500002000295520244700315592002802762650001602790650001102806650002002817650001402837650002002851650001102871650001402882650001702896650001102913650001402924650001502938650000902953650001202962651001202974651002202986773009603008852000903104856010703113655001203220IND2325616620221118040959.0170626e200202  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232561662DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[0370:FFAAIL]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLytle, David A.10aFlash floods and aquatic insect life‐history evolution: evaluation of multiple models  ap. 370-385.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn disturbance ecology there is a tension between ecological and evolutionary viewpoints, because while disturbances often cause mortality in populations (an ecological effect), populations may also evolve mechanisms that ameliorate mortality risk (an evolutionary effect). Flash floods cause high mortality in the juvenile aquatic stage of desert stream insects, but these ecological effects may be mitigated by the evolution of life‐history strategies that allow the terrestrial adult stage to avoid floods. Life‐history theory predicts that, to balance trade‐offs between juvenile growth and mortality risk from floods, (1) most individuals should emerge before the peak of the flood season, (2) optimal body size at emergence should decline as flood probability increases, and (3) a second decline in body size at emergence should occur as the reproductive season ends. These predictions were tested with data on body mass at and timing of emergence of the caddisfly Phylloicus aeneus measured in three montane Chihuahuan Desert (Arizona, USA) streams over two years. P. aeneus that had not reached the adult stage were eliminated from site‐years that experienced flash floods, suggesting that timing of emergence is an important fitness component. On average 86% of emergence occurred before the long‐term (∼100 yr) mean arrival date of the first seasonal flood, supporting prediction 1. The presence of two consecutive declines in body mass at emergence in most site‐years was congruent with predictions 2 and 3. To test whether the two declines were associated with increasing flood probability and end of the reproductive season, respectively, maximum‐likelihood methods were used to compare five body‐size models: a null model that contains no parameters related to flood regime or reproductive season, a seasonal model that incorporates a reproductive time constraint, and three disturbance models that incorporate both reproductive time constraints and flood dynamics. The disturbance models outperformed the other models, suggesting that at least some of the body‐mass pattern was influenced by flood dynamics. The timing of the first flood of the season was the most important determinant of observed emergence patterns. Overall, this study demonstrates that aquatic insects can compensate for flash floods by using state‐dependent emergence strategies that are synchronized with long‐term flood dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichoptera 3aadults 3aaquatic insects 3abody size 3abreeding season 3afloods 3ajuveniles 3alife history 3amodels 3amortality 3aprediction 3arisk 3astreams 3aArizona 3aChihuahuan Desert0 tEcology.g2002 Feb., v. 83, no. 2 p.370-385dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083%5B0370:FFAAIL%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02032naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245007800159300001800237520116300255592002801418653001801446653002301464653002701487653002201514700002301536773011201559856007401671852000901745655001201754IND60131403620221118034424.0151127e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013140362DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.1742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStewart, Chad M.14aThe Extent of Lead Fragmentation Observed in Deer Culled by Sharpshooting  ap. 1462-1466.  aSharpshooting is a proven management technique to lower white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) densities in areas where hunting is precluded. A donation program that allows for the consumptive use of these culled deer is often necessary to gain public approval for such a program. We culled 40 deer in Indiana using sharpshooting methods (head and neck shot placement) and radiographed the carcasses to determine if lead fragmentation spread throughout the skeletal muscle system. In 30 deer where shot placement was between the cranium and fourth cervical vertebrae, we observed no lead fragments in any thoracic or crural muscle tissue. Of 10 deer where shot placement was between the fifth and seventh cervical vertebrae, 8 deer experienced lead fragments in the extensor spinae muscle. Deer culled with highly frangible bullets via sharpshooting in the cranium or upper cervical spine have minimal risk of experiencing lead fragmentation in the thoracic or crural muscle systems. Deer shot in the lower neck may experience lead fragmentation in the anterior extensor spinae muscle, and up to 40 cm of that muscle should be removed before consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 0asharpshooting 0alead fragmentation 0aOdocoileus virginianus 0awhite-tailed deer1 aVeverka, Norman B.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2011 Aug., v. 75, no. 6 p.1462-1466dThe Wildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fjwmg.1743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008600164300001600250520141200266592002801678650001501706650001901721650002501740650001901765650001401784650001601798650001101814650001801825650002301843700001301866700001801879700001401897700001601911773009801927856008102025990002302106852000902129655001202138IND60093301320221119235836.0141103e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009330132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xiang10aNano-TiO₂ membrane adsorption reactor (MAR) for virus removal in drinking water  ap. 180-187.  aIn order to improve the removal efficiency of virus in drinking water, phage F2, which is similar to human enteric pathogenic virus, was used as the model virus to study the removal efficiency of virus in the water using nano-TiO₂-membrane coupling system. The results showed that the adsorption of phage F2 by nanosized TiO₂ could reach the adsorption equilibrium in 60min, and the process could follow the Freundlich isotherm (qₑ=27.4·cₑ ¹.²⁴), which is assigned to multilayer adsorption. The kinetic studies showed that the pseudo second-order rate equation could fit the experimental data well. The chemical adsorption was the main mechanism, and the intra particle diffusion was the control step. As for the membrane systems, two different flat membranes PVDF (0.20μm) and PAN (0.05μm) were used, and the removal efficiency of phage F2 was 1.88–2.56 log and 4.78–5.95 log, respectively. As for the coupling systems of nanosized TiO₂ and membrane (nano-TiO₂-membrane adsorption reactor), the removal efficiency of phage F2 was 3.88 log and 6.40 log, respectively, which was mainly due to the adsorption of nanosized TiO₂ and the effective filter cake layer formed on the surface of membrane during operation. The nano-TiO₂-membrane adsorption reactor (MAR) achieved not only the high removal efficiency of virus, but also the effective separation and recycle of nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abacteriophages 3achemical engineering 3adrinking water 3aequations 3afilter cake 3ahumans 3ananoparticles 3asorption isotherms1 aChen, Di1 aWang, Zhiwei,1 aLei, Yang1 aCheng, Rong0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 230 p.180-187dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0693Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011300169300001600282520117800298592002801476650002501504650002701529650002101556650002601577650001301603650001801616650001101634650001501645650001101660650001001671650002501681700002401706700001801730700001801748773009801766856008101864990002301945852000901968655001201977IND60093301620221119235847.0141103e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009330162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertanza, Giorgio10aBio-P release in the final clarifiers of a large WWTP with co-precipitation: Key factors and troubleshooting  ap. 195-201.  aPhosphorus removal by chemical precipitation is a well-established and widely used technique in municipal waste water treatment plants (WWTPs). Very low effluent concentrations can be achieved in order to comply with standards for discharge in sensitive areas, in force in the EU; nevertheless, failures of this system are occasionally recorded. In this work, a 330,000 people equivalent (p.e.) WWTP was studied, where co-precipitation was not effective to guarantee an effluent concentration stably below 1mgP/L, despite the great expenditure for chemicals (around 260,000€/y) and additional sludge disposal (around 160,000€/y). Based on results of laboratory tests and mathematical simulations, it was shown that bio-P release occurs in final clarifiers under special conditions, related to Sludge Retention Time (SRT) in the settling tanks, Dissolved Oxygen (DO) in nitrification basins and nitrates concentration in the effluent. Therefore, complying with effluent standards should require keeping process conditions as follows: DO>1mg/L, N–NO₃ ⁻>5mg/L and SRT<3h. As additional measure, a post-precipitation (required dosage: 4–5mgAl/mgP) could be applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3achemical precipitation 3adissolved oxygen 3alaboratory techniques 3anitrates 3anitrification 3apeople 3aphosphorus 3asludge 3atanks 3awastewater treatment1 aPedrazzani, Roberta1 aManili, Livia1 aMenoni, Laura0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 230 p.195-201dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0673Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016200164300001600326520131400342592002801656650002101684650002101705650002101726650001401747650002301761650002501784650001301809650001501822650001101837650001601848700001201864700001901876700001501895700001701910700001401927700001201941773009801953856008102051990002302132852000902155655001202164IND60093301920221119235919.0141103e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009330192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Honghong10aSimultaneous catalytic hydrolysis of low concentration of carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide by impregnated microwave activated carbon at low temperatures  ap. 220-226.  aThe blank microwave coal-based activated carbons (MCAC) and blank microwave coconut shell activated carbons (MCSAC) were tested for simultaneous catalytic hydrolysis of carbonyl sulfide (COS) and carbon disulfide (CS₂) at relatively low temperature (at 50°C). MCAC and MCSAC loaded by Fe–Cu–Ni metal mixed oxides were prepared by sol–gel method, and also tested for the simultaneous catalytic hydrolysis process. The results showed that Fe–Cu–Ni/MCSAC catalyst had the superior activity for the simultaneous catalytic hydrolysis of COS and CS₂. These modified catalysts were characterized by XRD, BET, EDS and XPS, the results of which can help us to understand the reasons of the superior catalytic activity and the reasons of catalyst deactivation. Lower generation of sulfate (K₃Na(SO₄)₂), high specific surface areas and more pore sizes of 0.3–1.2nm and 3.5–4.0nm may be the important role in COS and CS₂ catalytic hydrolysis reaction. The XPS results showed that most of products on the exhausted catalysts were S/SO₄ ²⁻ species which accumulated on the active carbon’s surface and had a negative effect on the hydrolysis activity, and the contents of S/SO₄ ²⁻ species of exhausted Fe–Cu–Ni/MCAC were higher than which of exhausted Fe–Cu–Ni/MCSAC catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3acarbon disulfide 3acarbonyl sulfide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical engineering 3acoconuts 3ahydrolysis 3aoxides 3atemperature1 aLi, Kai1 aTang, Xiaolong1 aNing, Ping1 aPeng, Jinhui1 aWang, Chi1 aHe, Dan0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 230 p.220-226dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0823Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245009900162300001800261520195600279592002802235653001002263653001902273653001302292653002002305653001302325653001802338700002002356700001702376700002402393700002102417700002002438773011202458856007402570852000902644655001202653IND60131404920221118034650.0151127e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013140492DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.1892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStephenson, John A.10aFactors Influencing Survival of Native and Translocated Mountain Quail in Idaho and Washington  ap. 1315-1323.  aUnderstanding survival and cause-specific mortality of native and translocated animals can help biologists design more effective recovery programs. We estimated survival rates for 181 native mountain quail (Oreortyx pictus) in west-central Idaho from 1992 to 1996 and for 199 translocated mountain quail in western Idaho and eastern Washington in 2005 and 2006. Spring——summer survival of native birds over 4 yr ranged from 0.210 (SE = 0.116) to 0.799 (SE = 0.103) and fall-winter survival in 2 yr was 0.523 (SE = 0.089) and 0.244 (SE = 0.084). Annual survival rates were 0.418 (SE = 0.088) and 0.174 (SE = 0.065). Springsummer survival rate of translocated birds was 0.215 (SE = 0.044) in 2005 and 0.059 (SE = 0.021) in 2006. We modeled biweekly survival as a function of sex, age, movement rate, native versus translocated status, and linear time trend, and then we added year and 3 weather covariates (mean biweekly precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures). Year and climate variables improved the a priori top model which included movement rate and native versus translocated status. Higher mortality rates due to predation coincided with movements to breeding habitat in late winter, periods of higher temperatures in the spring and summer, and periods of higher precipitation and colder temperatures during the fall-winter seasons. High movement rates of native birds in winter to avoid snow and by translocated birds when dispersing may have led to greater exposure to predators and consequently lower survival rates. Mountain quail can experience low and variable survival, stressing the potential need for multiple years of releases in restoration efforts in the eastern portion of their range. More attention is needed to identify optimal habitat (including nest sites) for restoring mountain quail populations to reduce movements, lower mortality risks, and provide conditions for withstanding periods of unfavorable weather.  aPublisher supplied data 0aIdaho 0amountain quail 0amovement 0aOreortyx pictus 0asurvival 0atranslocation1 aReese, Kerry P.1 aZager, Peter1 aHeekin, Patricia E.1 aNelle, Pamela J.1 aMartens, Ashley0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2011 Aug., v. 75, no. 6 p.1315-1323dThe Wildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fjwmg.1893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245012000157300001800277520210600295592002802401653001402429653002302443653001202466653002302478653001502501653001302516653002402529700001802553700002502571700001902596700001702615700001902632700002102651773011202672856007402784852000902858655001202867IND60131405120221118034511.0151127e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013140512DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.1912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuda, Yusuke10aRecovery of Saltwater Crocodiles Following Unregulated Hunting in Tidal Rivers of the Northern Territory, Australia  ap. 1253-1266.  aSaltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) in the Northern Territory of Australia were protected in 1971, after a severe population decline resulting from 26 yr of intense commercial hunting. By that time wild saltwater crocodiles were rarely sighted anywhere and they were commercially extinct in areas where they had once been abundant. Standardized monitoring by spotlight surveys started in 1975 and provided relative density indices over time (1975––2009) as a unique record of the post-protection recovery of a wild crocodilian population. We examined the survey data for populations at 12 major tidal rivers, individually and as a single subpopulation. The pattern of recovery in the subpopulation in both abundance and biomass was approximated by logistic curves, predicting 5.26 non-hatchling crocodiles weighing 387.64 kg sighted per kilometer of river in 2010. We predicted potential carrying capacity as 5.58 non-hatchling crocodiles (5.73% higher than 2010) weighing 519.0 kg (25.31% higher than 2010). Individual rivers showed largely different abundance and biomass among rivers. The statistical model that best described the recovery in individual rivers was not always logistic. However, where it was logistic, expected carrying capacity of different rivers showed considerable variation in abundance and biomass. The variation indicates different habitat quality among the rivers. Recovery occurred despite various consumptive uses, particularly a widespread egg-harvest program, which has been an integral part of the incentive-driven conservation program for saltwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory since 1983. We suggest that the saltwater crocodile population of the Northern Territory is achieving full recovery from uncontrolled hunting in 1945––1971. Although saltwater crocodiles are considered an important natural resource, their increase in number, size, and distribution is posing management issues for public safety. Continuation of human-crocodile conflict management through public education and strategic removal of problem crocodiles will be essential.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAustralia 0aCrocodylus porosus 0ahunting 0aNorthern Territory 0apopulation 0arecovery 0asaltwater crocodile1 aWebb, Grahame1 aManolis, S.

They are indirect mutualists through nutrient cycling, but also competitors for inorganic nutrients due to stoichiometric constraints in decomposers. We examine the conditions under which they are able to coexist, and hence ecosystems are able to persist, using a stoichiometrically explicit minimum model for an ecosystem. The model takes into account the coupling of carbon and a nutrient in the biomass and detritus, the nutrient limitation and the energy‐providing role of primary producers, the recycling role of decomposers, and the stoichiometric constraints leading to indirect competition for the nutrient. The model shows that two conditions must be met to ensure coexistence of primary producers and decomposers: (1) decomposers must be limited by the carbon provided by plant detritus, and (2) the difference between the carbon : nutrient ratios of primary producers and decomposers must be sufficiently small. Condition (1) is fulfilled if decomposers are better competitors than primary producers for nutrient uptake. When nutrient uptake by plants and decomposers has a Lotka‐Volterra form, these results are robust whether the nutrient cycle is closed or open. When nutrient uptake is donor controlled, however, coexistence is facilitated by an open nutrient cycle. We conclude that ecosystem persistence is not a trivial issue when stoichiometry is taken into account in ecological processes. Strict conditions on the carbon : nutrient ratios and competitive abilities of plants and microorganisms may be required. Given these theoretical results, we highlight the lack of experimental data concerning primary producer and decomposer coexistence conditions, and we suggest that more research has to be performed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass 3acarbon 3adetritus 3aecosystems 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3amutualism 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3aplants (botany) 3astoichiometry1 aLoreau, Michel0 tEcology.g2001 Nov., v. 82, no. 11 p.3069-3082dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082%5B3069:ESPPDI%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02098naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245007300163300001800236520120100254592002801455653001201483653000901495653001201504653002401516653002401540653001301564700002301577773011301600856007401713852000901787655001201796IND60131405520221118034446.0151127e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013140552DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.1942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCudworth, Nichole L.10aImportance of Scale in Nest-Site Selection by Arizona Gray Squirrels  ap. 1668-1674.  aNests provide a place for individuals to rest, raise young, avoid predators, and escape inclement weather; consequently, knowledge of habitat characteristics important to nest placement is critical for managing species of conservation concern. Arizona gray squirrels (Sciurus arizonensis) are endemic to mountains of southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. We investigated factors influencing nest-site selection at 4 spatial scales (forest-type, nest-site, nest-tree, and within-canopy placement) to provide ecological information and management recommendations for this sensitive species. Nest densities were 2.6 times higher in riparian than pine-oak woodlands. Nest sites had more large trees, snags, logs, and canopy cover and had lower slope. Arizona gray squirrels selected tall trees with more interlocking trees and tended to place nests adjacent to the main trunk. Regardless of scale, Arizona gray squirrels seemed to select nesting areas for their ability to provide protection from predators and the elements as well as access to food. Consequently, maintaining large trees with closed canopies and downed logs should be considered when determining land management plans.  aPublisher supplied data 0aArizona 0adrey 0ahabitat 0anest-site selection 0aSciurus arizonensis 0asquirrel1 aKoprowski, John L.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2011 Sept., v. 75, no. 7 p.1668-1674dThe Wildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fjwmg.1943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245011600158300001800274520101700292592002801309653003001337653001301367653002601380653002301406653004201429653002301471653003001494653002101524653002001545653003001565700002101595700002301616773011301639856007401752961001401826852000901840655001201849IND60131406020221118034513.0151127e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013140602DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.1992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerlut, Noah G.12aA Model for Integrating Wildlife Science and Agri-Environmental Policy in the Conservation of Declining Species  ap. 1657-1663.  aWe examined a case study where a successful wildlife-friendly model for intensively managed hayland was developed from field data and implemented locally as policy by a federal agency. Farmers were ensured a first hay-harvest with high protein content; after a 65-day delay (compared to the normal 35–40-day cutting cycle) farmers took a second harvest of greater quantity but decreased quality. Farmers were paid $247–333/ha in 2008–2010 to offset costs associated with the decreased nutritional content caused by the approximately 25-day second harvest delay. Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) reproductive rates improved from 0.0 to 2.8 fledglings per female per year. Creation and implementation of this policy required communication among scientists, federal agricultural agencies, farmers, and state and federal fish and wildlife departments.

To enhance the dewatering of secondary sludge, the effect of ultrasound waves, thermal treatment and chemical conditioning with NaOH have been studied. Two features of treated sludges were examined: their rheological behavior and their dewaterability. The rheological tests consisted of recording shear stress when the shear rate increases and decreases continuously and linearly with time, and when it increases and decreases in steps. Steady-state viscosity and thixotropy were obtained from the rheological tests, and both decreased significantly in all cases with increased treatment intensity. Centrifugation of ultrasonicated and thermally treated sludges allowed the total solid content to be increased by approximately 16.2% and 17.6%, respectively. These dewatered sludges had a lower viscosity and thixotropy than the untreated sludge. In contrast, alkali conditioning barely allowed the sludge to be dewatered by centrifugation, despite decreasing its viscosity and thixotropy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acentrifugation 3achemical engineering 3achemical treatment 3adewatering 3aheat treatment 3asewage sludge 3ashear stress 3aultrasonics 3aviscosity 3awastewater treatment 3awater content1 aMartinez-Elorza, Guillermo1 aLabanda, Jordi1 aLlorens, Joan0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 230 p.102-110dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0463Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012400167300001600291520096900307592002801276650001601304650001601320650001601336650002501352650001901377650000901396650002201405650002301427650001501450700001901465700002101484773009801505856008101603990002301684852000901707655001201716IND60093303220221120121812.0141103e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009330322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Myung-Hee10aDecarboxylated polyethylenimine-modified bacterial biosorbent for Ru biosorption from Ru-bearing acetic acid wastewater  ap. 303-307.  aIn order to develop a high-performance biosorbent for Ru biosorption from Ru-containing acetic acid wastewater, decarboxylated polyethylenimine (PEI)-modified bacterial biomass (DC-PEIB) was prepared through the PEI coating and esterification of carboxyl groups on the biomass surface. The raw biomass (RB) and PEI-modified biomass (PEIB) were also prepared for comparison with DC-PEIB. To confirm the surface modification, SEM and FTIR analyses were carried out and their results revealed that the DC-PEIB was well prepared according to the suggested modification method. The sorption kinetics showed that sorption equilibrium was reached within 60min. According to the Langmuir model, the maximum uptake of the DC-PEIB was estimated to be 47.1mg/g. Whereas those of RB, PEIB and PEI-Silica gel were 25.0, 34.4 and 11.4mg/g, respectively. Therefore, esterification of the carboxyl groups on the PEIB surface led to further enhancement of the Ru sorption capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3achemical engineering 3aesterification 3agels 3amicrobial biomass 3asorption isotherms 3awastewater1 aWon, Sung Wook1 aYun, Yeoung-Sang0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 230 p.303-307dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0873Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001900167245007300186300001800259500002000277520195300297592002802250650001502278650001702293650002202310650001702332650001802349650001502367650001402382650001402396650001002410650002202420650002002442650001102462650001002473651001202483700002302495773009902518852000902617856010702626655001202733IND2330176720221118184937.0170626e200210  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233017672DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[2691:FGJPSG]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuel, Jonathan10aFast‐growing juvenile pinyons suffer greater herbivory when mature  ap. 2691-2699.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe examined the hypothesis that tree‐ring analyses of juvenile growth traits could be used to predict herbivory during mature years. At Sunset Crater National Monument, Arizona, USA, some pinyon pines (Pinus edulis) are highly susceptible to the stem‐boring moth, Dioryctria albovittella, and suffer chronic attack, while other adjacent trees are resistant and have remained relatively moth‐free for years. Five major patterns emerged: (1) Susceptible trees suffer from 11 times more shoots killed per tree and produce <0.05 times as many cones as resistant trees. (2) This herbivore is largely restricted to reproductively mature trees that, at this site, are generally older than 46 yr. (3) Analysis of tree‐ring data from resistant and susceptible trees shows that trees that eventually became susceptible grew more vigorously during their attack‐free juvenile years than resistant trees (growth rings were 29% wider). However, when they matured and suffered chronic herbivory, susceptible trees produced growth rings 13% smaller than resistant trees. (4) Although previous studies showed that resistance was associated with higher oleoresin flow, we did not observe this pattern. Instead, we found that resistance was best correlated with slower juvenile growth rates. Current‐year shoots of susceptible mature trees averaged 50% larger than those on resistant mature trees. (5) Tree‐ring analyses supported the hypothesis of a trade‐off between growth and resistance. This study shows that dendrochronology can be used as a tool to predict future herbivory and demonstrates that the fastest growing juvenile trees suffer the poorest performance decades later when they become moth‐susceptible mature trees. Furthermore, it illustrates that traits associated with plant development can greatly affect herbivore distributions, and that herbivore selection pressures on juvenile trees can be very different than on mature trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioryctria 3aPinus edulis 3adendroclimatology 3agrowth rings 3agrowth traits 3aherbivores 3ajuveniles 3amonuments 3amoths 3aplant development 3asexual maturity 3ashoots 3atrees 3aArizona1 aWhitham, Thomas G.0 tEcology.g2002 Oct., v. 83, no. 10 p.2691-2699dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083%5B2691:FGJPSG%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02597naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009800166300001600264520150900280592002801789650002201817650001201839650002501851650000901876650001301885650001501898650001101913650001801924650002001942650001501962650001301977700002201990773009802012856008102110990002302191852000902214655001202223IND60093304120221119235812.0141103e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009330412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLodeiro, Pablo10aGold reduction in batch and column experiments using silica gel derivates and seaweed biomass  ap. 372-379.  aGold recovery from aqueous solution was studied in the present work. Two synthetic materials composed of immobilized chelating agent on silica gel, and the brown seaweed Sargassum muticum were used as reducing agents inducing gold colloid nanoparticles formation. The results showed that there is no pH effect and no interference on gold recovery by the presence of other metals in solution, such as Co, Ni, and Cr(VI). A strong complexing reagent for gold leaching, such as thiourea, was able to recover a significant amount of the gold previously reduced over the surface of the materials. The investigated synthetic materials presented much faster rate than the algae for gold recovery. A first order model with respect to the oxidizable groups and gold concentrations accuracy described the entire kinetic process. The rate constant of the reaction and the concentration of oxidizable groups per gram of material were obtained from kinetic data fit. Column studies were conducted varying the flow rate and the quantity of material used. Under favourable conditions of flow rate (1mL/min) and quantity of material in the column (⩾0.2g), more than 95% of the gold was recovery from the inlet solution. A mechanism based on the experimental evidences was proposed. FTIR and SEM analysis supported the suggested mechanism. Based on the results showed it can be concluded that the gold removal from aqueous solution is mainly based on a reduction mechanism where gold colloid nanoparticles are produced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSargassum muticum 3abiomass 3achemical engineering 3agold 3aleaching 3amacroalgae 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3areducing agents 3asilica gel 3athiourea1 aSillanpää, Mika0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 230 p.372-379dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.1053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245018000167300001600347520121300363592002801576650001901604650002501623650001901648650002501667650001801692650001801710650001601728650001601744700003101760700001901791700001901810773009801829856008101927990002302008852000902031655001202040IND60093304920221119235828.0141103e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009330492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayat, Yadollah10aTaguchi robust design to optimize supercritical carbon dioxide anti-solvent process for preparation of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane nanoparticles  ap. 432-438.  aApplication of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (HNIW) as an interested nitramine explosive has been developed during recent years.

The effects of different variables: temperature, pressure, HNIW concentration, flow rate of feeding solution, type of solvent, and surfactant on the size of produced HNIW particles were investigated under three different levels. By the aid of analysis of variance the effect of studied parameters on the size of prepared HNIW particles was evaluated. Analysis of variance revealed that the particle size of HNIW during SAS process could be tailored by tuning the effective parameters under their optimum levels. Meanwhile, optimum conditions for obtaining HNIW nanoparticles by SAS technique were determined.

The stability of the catalyst was tested in a long term experiment, showing some initial deactivation related to the formation of oxygenated groups on the carbon surface, but proving to be stable in the long run. The application of the monolith in a triphasic system was demonstrated to be favorable when compared to a biphasic system. The addition of catalyst did not improve the removal of the parent pollutants, but improves the mineralization degree, which is relevant, since the resulting by-products may be more harmful than the parent compounds. The application of the process using a natural water matrix showed some inhibition of the catalytic activity for some pollutants, mainly connected to the radical scavenging properties of some inorganic compounds. However, the catalyst still showed significant activity during these experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3achemical engineering 3ainorganic compounds 3amineralization 3ananofibers 3aozonation 3apollutants1 aÓrfão, José J.M.1 aPereira, Manuel F.R.1 aGarcia-Bordejé, Enrique1 aRoche, Pascal1 aBourdin, Delphine1 aHoussais, Béatrice1 aCoste, Marielle1 aDerrouiche, Salim0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 230 p.115-123dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0643Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03682naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002000167245007800187300001800265500002000283520235300303592002802656650001602684650002502700650001602725650001602741650002602757650001002783650001502793650001602808650001102824650001402835650001502849650001602864650001202880650001302892650001702905650001602922650001002938650001702948650001302965700001902978773009902997852000903096856010703105655001203212IND2330182320221118035439.0170626e200209  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233018232DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[2465:TEOSAN]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoon, Daniel C.14aThe effects of salinity and nutrients on a tritrophic salt‐marsh system  ap. 2465-2476.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn recent years, ecologists have begun to develop a more fine‐grained and integrative approach to examining the importance of top‐down and bottom‐up effects on herbivore populations by investigating how changes in abiotic heterogeneity affect the relative roles of these forces. We performed two factorial field experiments to determine how increasing salinity and nutrient supply affected the relative strengths of top‐down and bottom‐up forces among the gall‐making midge, Asphondylia borrichiae, its host plant Borrichia frutescens, and a suite of parasitoids. Salinity was increased by the addition of salt pellets, and nutrient supply was increased by the addition of fertilizer. In both experiments, parasitism pressure was decreased by trapping hymenopteran parasitoids with yellow sticky traps. In both experiments, bottom‐up manipulations had significant effects on gall density. Elevated salinity levels decreased the number of galls per 200 Borrichia stems, and fertilization increased the number of galls. In the salt‐stress experiment, increased salinity decreased gall parasitism, and in the fertilization experiment, fertilizer increased parasitism of galls, but the direct effects of these treatments on gall density outweighed the indirect effects mediated by parasitoids. Parasitoid‐removal treatments resulted in only small (and not statistically significant) changes in gall parasitism in the salt‐stress experiment, and there was no significant effect on gall density. In the fertilization experiment, parasitoid‐removal treatments reduced parasitism of galls, and this resulted in an increase in gall density over time. Thus, bottom‐up effects were strong and consistent in both experiments, but top‐down effects appeared weaker and inconsistent. Stem morphology, which was altered by salt and fertilizer, also affected gall density and parasitism, and there was some evidence that the strength of top‐down forces on gall density varied with stem type. The results of this study show that, in this system, top‐down effects of parasitism are dependent upon the bottom‐up effects of host plant quality and morphology resulting from abiotic heterogeneity. As such, the relative importance of top‐down effects can change depending upon the relative nutrient supply or salinity of the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsphondylia 3aBorrichia frutescens 3aHymenoptera 3afertilizers 3afield experimentation 3agalls 3aherbivores 3ahost plants 3amidges 3anutrients 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apellets 3asalinity 3asalt marshes 3asalt stress 3astems 3asticky traps 3atrapping1 aStiling, Peter0 tEcology.g2002 Sept., v. 83, no. 9 p.2465-2476dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083%5B2465:TEOSAN%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02690naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003000138245011100168300001600279520174400295592002802039653001302067653001602080653002202096653002302118653001202141653002402153700001802177773011002195856007402305852000902379655001202388IND60131409120221118034419.0151127e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013140912DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.2302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGray, Thomas Neill Edward10aLeopard Density in Post-Conflict Landscape, Cambodia: Evidence from Spatially Explicit Capture—Recapture  ap. 163-169.  aEffective conservation of large carnivores requires reliable estimates of population density, often obtained through capture-recapture analysis, in order to prioritize investments and assess conservation intervention effectiveness. Recent statistical advances and development of user-friendly software for spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) circumvent the difficulties in estimating effective survey area, and hence density, from capture-recapture data. We conducted a camera-trapping study on leopards (Panthera pardus) in Mondulkiri Protected Forest, Cambodia. We compared density estimates using SECR with those obtained from conventional approaches in which the effective survey area is estimated using a boundary strip width based on observed animal movements. Density estimates from Chao heterogeneity models (3.8 ± SE 1.9 individuals/100 km2) and Pledger heterogeneity models and models accounting for gender-specific capture and recapture rates (model-averaged density 3.9 ± SE 2.9 individuals/100 km2) were similar to those from SECR in program DENSITY (3.6 ± SE 1.0/100 km2) but higher than estimates from Jack-knife heterogeneity models (2.9 ± SE 0.9 individuals/100 km2). Capture probabilities differed between male and female leopards probably resulting from differences in the use of human-made trails between sexes. Given that there are a number of biologically plausible reasons to expect gender-specific variation in capture probabilities of large carnivores, we recommend exploratory analysis of data using models in which gender can be included as a covariate affecting capture probabilities particularly given the demographic importance of breeding females for population recovery of threatened carnivores.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCambodia 0acamera-trap 0acapture-recapture 0adensity estimation 0aleopard 0apopulation recovery1 aPrum, Sovanna0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2012 Jan., v. 76, no. 1 p.163-169dThe Wildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fjwmg.2303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006900166300001600235520151600251592002801767650001601795650003701811650001601848650002501864650002801889650001201917650001501929650001701944650001301961650001901974650003301993650002102026700002002047700001702067773009802084856008102182990002302263852000902286655001202295IND60093305720221119235659.0141103e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009330572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Myeongjin10aProcess dependent graphene/MnO₂ composites for supercapacitors  ap. 482-490.  aTwo types of graphene/MnO₂ composites were synthesized by different reaction procedures. S1 was synthesized as follows: first, nanoneedle MnO₂ was formed on the GO sheets using various functional groups (GO/MnO₂). In the second stage, GO/MnO₂ was reduced to graphene/MnO₂ (S1) via the dipping method. S2 was synthesized using a different reaction order: first, graphene oxide was reduced to graphene and nanoneedle MnO₂ was formed on graphene sheets. The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared composites were characterized by X-ray diffractometery, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Characterization indicated that the nanoneedle MnO₂ structures in the S1 composite were homogeneously dispersed on graphene sheets, whereas MnO₂ in the S2 composite formed aggregates due to absence of functional groups. The capacitive properties of S1 and S2 electrodes were measured using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge tests, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a three-electrode experimental setup with an aqueous solution of 1M Na₂SO₄ as the electrolyte. The S1 electrode exhibited a specific capacitance as high as 327.5Fg⁻¹at 10mVs⁻¹, which was higher than that of the S2 electrode (229.9Fg⁻¹). It is anticipated that the formation of nanoneedle MnO₂ on the GO surface following the reduction procedure could be a promising fabrication method for supercapacitor electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acapacitance 3achemical engineering 3adielectric spectroscopy 3adipping 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3agraphene 3amicrostructure 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry1 aHwang, Yongseon1 aKim, Jooheon0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 230 p.482-490dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0953Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001900167245011100186300001400297500002000311520134900331592002801680650001801708650002401726650002601750650001301776650001501789650001801804650001101822650001301833650002601846650001201872650002901884650001201913651001201925651000901937700002101946700002001967700002301987700002002010773009402030852000902124856010702133655001202240IND2334192920221118035602.0170626e200301  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233419292DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0079:ECABCW]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlawe, Grit A.10aEcological costs and benefits correlated with trypsin protease inhibitor production in nicotiana attenuata  ap. 79-90.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGenotypes of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata from different geographic regions in North America vary considerably in the level of constitutive and inducible trypsin protease inhibitors (TrypPIs), a potent direct defense, as well as in the production of herbivore‐induced volatiles that function as indirect defense. Genotypes collected from Arizona were found to lack the ability to produce TrypPIs at a transcriptional level, had decreased volatile production, but exhibited nicotine and growth responses that were not distinguishable from genotypes collected in Utah. In field trials with naturally occurring herbivores and in lab experiments with Manduca sexta larvae, Arizona genotypes were damaged more and sustained greater herbivore growth than the Utah genotypes. When Arizona and Utah genotypes were grown in competition, Arizona genotypes produced significantly more seed capsules than the Utah neighbor did. Moreover, jasmonate elicitation, which dramatically increased TrypPI production in only the Utah genotypes, reduced lifetime fitness measures of the Utah genotypes more than of the Arizona genotypes, demonstrating that TrypPI production is correlated with a fitness cost. The loss of both a direct and an indirect defense suggests a functional linkage between these types of defense. Corresponding Editor: R. F.

For example EU Landfill Directive 99/31/EC [41] prohibits landfilling of both liquid and untreated wastes with a target to reduce the current amount of bio-degradable wastes, including sewage sludge, 50% and 65% by the years 2013 and 2020, respectively. Anaerobic digestion has now proven to be the most energy efficient way of destroying and stabilizing waste activated sludge and the methane by-product is a form of fuel. It is demonstrated in this research that anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge, when coupled with mild ozone treatment (e.g., 1.33mg O₃/g-VSS), practically doubles the volume of biogas produced as compared to conventional digesters, while producing no waste sludge for disposal. Ozone treatment of the feed sludge also affects enhanced removal of endocrine disrupting compounds, EDCs, sorbed onto the sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3abiological treatment 3achemical engineering 3aenergy efficiency 3alandfills 3amethane 3aozonation 3aozone 3asewage sludge 3axenobiotics1 aMuz, M.1 aKomesli, O.T.1 aGökçay, C.F.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 230 p.499-505dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.1133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002000167245008200187300001800269500002000287520146800307592002801775650001301803650001201816650002201828773009901850852000901949856010701958655001202065IND2330180620221118035332.0170626e200209  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233018062DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[2361:LPDPAE]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPärtel, Meelis10aLocal plant diversity patterns and evolutionary history at the regional scale  ap. 2361-2366.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effect of evolutionary history on local‐scale diversity patterns has often been suggested, but not shown. I explored whether widely described local‐scale relationships between plant species richness and soil pH are related to evolutionary history. I expected positive relationships to occur between richness and pH if the pool of species that is suited for high pH soil is larger than the pool of species that is suited for low pH soil. In contrast, I expected negative relationships to occur between richness and pH if the pool of species that is suited for low pH soil is larger than the pool of species that is suited for high pH soil. I call this the species pool concept, because the direction of the relationship between richness and pH depends on whether the species pool has evolutionary origin on soils of high or low pH. I used 85 published studies from all over the world and found that positive relationships between richness and pH were significantly more probable in floristic regions where evolutionary centers were on high pH soils, and negative relationships between richness and pH were more probable in regions where evolutionary centers were on low pH soils. Because soil pH increases with latitude, I also found that the relationship between richness and pH was positive at high latitudes and negative at low latitudes. Consequently, local relationships between plant diversity and soil pH are clearly related to evolutionary history.  aPublisher supplied data 3alatitude 3asoil pH 3aspecies diversity0 tEcology.g2002 Sept., v. 83, no. 9 p.2361-2366dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083%5B2361:LPDPAE%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02339naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245016400162300001600326520115900342592002801501650001501529650001501544650001401559650002301573650002501596650001101621650001101632650001601643700001701659700001501676700001401691700001701705700002001722773009801742856008101840990002301921852000901944655001201953IND60093306420221119235829.0141103e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009330642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Qian12aA comparative investigation on the catalytic activity of H-Al-MCM-48 and H-Zr-MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieve on alkylation of phenol with tert-butyl alcohol  ap. 124-132.  aMesoporous H-Al (or Zr)-MCM-48 solid acid catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation method through using Al (or Zr)-MCM-48 mesoporous molecular sieves derived from conventional hydrothermal method as starting materials. These solid acid catalysts were characterized by XRD, TEM, NH₃-TPD and N₂ physical adsorption, respectively. The alkylation of phenol with tert-butyl alcohol was carried out over these solid acid catalysts. The effect of various factors including reactant molar ratio, weight hour space velocity (WHSV), reaction time and temperature on phenol conversion and product selectivity was investigated and the results were discussed. Experimental results reveal that the resulting solid acid catalysts still retained a typical cubic mesoporous framework of MCM-48. Under comparable conditions, the H-Al-MCM-48-25 catalyst exhibits much high catalytic activity and gives a maximum phenol conversion of 98.9% with 70.3% selectivity to 4-t-butyl phenol (4-TBP). The optimum reaction conditions over these solid acid catalysts are the following: WHSV=5h⁻¹, time=2h, temperature=140°C, the molar ratio of tert-butyl alcohol:phenol=2:1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalkylation 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical engineering 3aphenol 3asieves 3atemperature1 aShen, Yalong1 aWang, Qian1 aTian, Jun1 aZhou, Xuping1 aJiang, Tingshun0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 230 p.124-132dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0573Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02026naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007700163300001600240520107900256592002801335650002101363650001501384650002501399650003101424700001601455700001601471700001401487773009801501856008101599990002301680852000901703655001201712IND60093307520221119235254.0141103e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009330752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Guojun14aThe role of different properties of activated carbon in CO₂ adsorption  ap. 133-140.  aCO₂ separation from synthesis gas or flue gas by activated carbon (termed AC) has been widely used or received much attention in recent years. Due to the different origin and preparation methods of ACs, their physico-chemical properties are usually significantly different, including pore structure, surface properties and ash. Which parameter influences CO₂ adsorption and to what extent are still controversial in the literature. This work presents a systematical study in this aspect under conditions of pressure swing adsorption (PSA, 273.0–293.0K and PCO₂ of 0.01–0.10MPa). Results indicate that the surface properties of AC, exactly oxygen-containing functional groups, have little effect on CO₂ adsorption, while the volume of ultra-micropore (<0.7nm) has a significant effect on excess CO₂ adsorption capacity, showing a linear relationship at PSA conditions. The ash in biomass-derived AC, mainly K compound, has a positive effect on CO₂ adsorption while the ash in coal-derived AC, mainly Ca, Si, Al and Fe compounds, are inert to CO₂ adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3achemical engineering 3aphysicochemical properties1 aLiu, Zhenyu1 aLiu, Qingya1 aWu, Weize0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 230 p.133-140dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0853Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01695naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007500168300001800243520052600261592002800787596002500815596002500840650001800865650001200883650000900895650001400904650002000918700002200938700002600960700003000986700001601016700001901032700007101051773010701122856008301229852000901312655001201321IND60756708820221121040004.0211221e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075670882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-021-03090-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Lívia,10aInsulin stimulates β-alanine uptake in skeletal muscle cells in vitro  ap. 1763-1766.  aWe evaluated whether insulin could stimulate β-alanine uptake by skeletal muscle cells in vitro.

Although precise mechanisms to account for such phenomena are not fully known for all plant species, a combination of theoretical and empirically driven mechanisms often resolves this paradox. Here, we couple a series of direct and indirect field and laboratory exercises on one marine macrophyte, Zostera marina L. (eelgrass), to measured distances between new patches and established beds in order to elucidate the long‐distance dispersal and colonization potential of this marine seagrass. Detached, floating reproductive shoots with mature seeds were found to remain positively buoyant for up to 2 wk and retain mature seeds for up to 3 wk before release under laboratory conditions. Analysis of the detritus wrack along a remote shoreline found reproductive fragments with viable seeds up to 34 km from established, natural beds. Analysis of different regions of the Chesapeake Bay and coastal bays of the Delmarva Peninsula that once supported eelgrass populations, revealed natural patches at 13 sites ranging from 1 to 108 km from established populations. A combination of tidal currents and wind influences has the potential to move a passive particle at the surface (e.g., a floating reproductive fragment) up to 23 km in a 6‐h tidal window suggesting that most unvegetated areas in this region that can support eelgrass are within the colonization potential envelope. We suggest that, when combined with earlier work on seed dispersal ecology of this species, eelgrass has strong qualities for high colonization potential of new habitat. The finding of natural patches at such great distances from established beds when studied in the context of the dispersal mechanism (currents and wind) make the dispersal distances of this species one of the highest for angiosperms, comparable in scale to mangroves and coconuts. This new understanding of the dispersal dynamics of eelgrass is critical in the context of seagrass restoration in areas distant from established beds, maintenance of existing populations threatened by anthropogenic inputs of sediments and nutrients, and examining metapopulation concepts in seagrass ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZostera marina 3acoconuts 3adetritus 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3alife history 3anutrients 3aseagrasses 3asediments 3aseed dispersal 3aseeds 3ashoots 3ashorelines 3atides 3awind 3aChesapeake Bay1 aOrth, Robert J.0 tEcology.g2002 Dec., v. 83, no. 12 p.3319-3330dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083%5B3319:LDDPIA%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02957naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010500173300001600278520187400294592002802168650001102196650002502207650001602232650001702248650001902265650001402284650000702298650001502305650002502320700001902345700002002364773009802384856008102482990002302563852000902586655001202595IND60093307920221119235708.0141103e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009330792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPachuau, Lalramnghaki10aFerrate(VI) in wastewater treatment contaminated with metal(II)-iminodiacetic acid complexed species  ap. 141-148.  aThe aim of this investigation is to assess the suitability and applicability of ferrate(VI) in the treatment of wastewaters contaminated with the Cu(II)-IDA and Zn(II)-IDA (IDA: iminodiacetic acid) complexed species in an attempt to provide safe and environmentally benign treatment process. The study was conducted for the degradation of metal(II)-IDA, followed by the oxidation of IDA and simultaneous removal of metal(II) species by the coagulation/flocculation process obtained by the reduced Fe(VI) into Fe(III). The high purity of ferrate(VI) was synthesized by the wet oxidation process in the laboratory and a regulated dose was imparted to the water contained with metal(II)-IDA species in solution. The batch reactor operations were performed for various parametric studies viz., effect of solution pH and metal(II)-IDA concentration for a fixed dose of ferrate(VI). The pH dependence data obtained from varying pH from 8.0 to 12.0 showed that higher efficiency of degradation of Fe(VI) was occurred at lower pH value i.e., at pH 8.0. Similarly, the total organic carbon (TOC) values showed in accordance to the UV–Vis data that the lower pH values (i.e., pH at 8.0) favored an enhanced degradation/mineralization of IDA since low TOC values were obtained at low pH values. The simultaneous removal of Cu(II) and Zn(II) was obtained through the process showed that insignificant percent of metal (Cu(II) or Zn(II)) was removed by the process which was significantly enhanced at pH 12.0. The UV–Vis data recorded at different time intervals for the reduction of Fe(VI) at varied metal(II)-IDA concentrations was utilized to demonstrate the kinetics of degradation. Further, this was employed in obtaining the overall rate constant of the degradation. These kinetic data revealed that an efficient degradation of IDA was achieved using the Fe(VI) treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achemical engineering 3acoagulation 3aflocculation 3amineralization 3aoxidation 3apH 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aLee, Seung Mok1 aTiwari, Diwakar0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 230 p.141-148dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.0813Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle05005naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001700167245008600184300001600270500002000286520339800306592002803704650001103732650002403743650002603767650001203793650001103805650001503816650001203831650001903843650001003862650002803872650001303900650001103913650002103924650001903945650001903964650001303983650002103996650001904017650001504036650002504051650002304076650001304099650000904112650001804121650002004139650001104159650001504170650001104185700001904196773009604215852000904311856010704320655001204427IND2334197420221118035558.0170626e200301  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233419742DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0202:COANCI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrogan, Paul10aControls on annual nitrogen cycling in the understory of a subarctic birch forest  ap. 202-218.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCharacterization of the controls on annual nitrogen (N) cycling is critical to understanding the functioning of high‐latitude ecosystems and to predicting their responses to perturbations. Here, we describe an experimental evaluation of the effects of season and vegetation on annual N cycling in the understory heath vegetation of a subarctic birch forest. Our approach was to follow the partitioning of an isotopically enriched ¹⁵NH₄Cl addition between microbes, plants, and the soil solution at intervals through winter, and in the following summer. To investigate the direct influence of vegetation on ecosystem N cycling, the isotope was added to control plots and to plots from which plants had been removed early in the previous growing season. Our results indicate that the dynamics of both microbial carbon and N were similar in treatment and control plots, suggesting that the presence of intact plants had negligible influence on seasonal patterns of microbial growth or N accumulation in the soils of this ecosystem. Instead, ecosystem N cycling was dominated by a substantial turnover of recently acquired N from microbes during the winter–summer transition that corresponded to a significant increase in understory plant ¹⁵N uptake. Vascular plant ¹⁵N uptake and accumulation in belowground tissue was substantial at the onset of winter, but ceased once full winter conditions developed. By contrast, there was a rapid resumption of vascular plant N uptake and strong allocation to aboveground tissue at the onset of summer. Vascular plant types varied strongly in ¹⁵N enhancement, depending on physiological differences in N uptake capacity as well as differences in biomass. In particular, Vaccinium vitis‐idaea, Vaccinium myrtillus, and the herbs exhibited strong ¹⁵N acquisition capacities, despite their relatively low biomass. We found no consistent evidence that the evergreen vs. deciduous leaf habit contributed to species differences in N uptake capacity. Species capacity for allocation of ¹⁵N to new shoot tissue was closely correlated with aboveground production per unit total N and tended to be greatest in herbs and V. myrtillus, suggesting that inherent physiological capacities for N uptake and tissue allocation are important determinants of species productivity. Our results suggest a hierarchy of controls on annual N cycling. The importance of wintertime influences on annual ecosystem N cycling was indicated by ongoing net mineralization by microbes beneath snow cover and a critical N release from microbes during the winter–summer transition. By contrast, plant N uptake was confined to the snow‐free season. Thus, seasonal environmental changes caused a rapid microbial turnover of recently acquired N that then became available for plant uptake in the subsequent growing season. Although vascular plant species appeared to compete strongly with each other to acquire this N, neither their presence nor their total N uptake appreciably affected microbial N‐cycling activity. Together, these results suggest that season exerts primary control on annual N cycling in this ecosystem, and that its effect on microbial N turnover is a major process supplying N to plants. By comparison, the effects of understory vegetation on N cycling were small within the time frame of this experiment. Corresponding Editor: P. J.

In this study, a combination of thermal and facile exfoliation of graphite intercalated compounds (GICs) is thus, proposed. Graphite was intercalated in a mixture of sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide before being subjected to a rapid heat treatment at 900°C. The thermally expanded graphite was then exfoliated in solvents to produce graphene sheets. An optimisation of the limiting parameters was also carried out to determine the best approach. Results showed that an increase in the amount of oxidiser, extension of the thermal expansion time as well as an increase in the starting graphite flake size resulted in larger, thinner flakes. Tapping mode AFM analysis showed that the as produced flakes had minimal thicknesses ranging between 2 and 2.5nm with average lengths ranging from 0.5μm to 10μm. This study has improved upon existing syntheses methods resulting in the use of lower toxicity solvents, lowered costs and increase in dispersibility concentrations of up to a 100 times improvement from current syntheses.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3acost effectiveness 3adispersibility 3agraphene 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen peroxide 3asolvents 3asulfuric acid 3athermal expansion 3atoxicity1 aTan, Michelle T.T.1 aSimKhiew, Poi1 aChin, Jit Kai1 aLee, Hingwah1 aBien, D.C.S.1 aTeh, AunShih1 aSiong, Chiu Wee0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Sept., v. 231 p.1-11dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.06.1063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245018800170520119100358592002801549650002801577650001401605650001701619650001601636650002201652650002001674650001001694650002101704653002801725653001601753653002801769653005901797653002901856700001801885700002101903700001801924700002001942700001801962700001801980773010601998856008702104852000902191655001202200IND60733411720221122200137.0211015e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073341172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1251212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Byung Sun12aA green decontamination technology through selective biomineralization of algicidal microorganisms for enhanced astaxanthin production from Haematococcus pluvialis at commercial scale  aCurrently, there is a lack of an efficient, environmentally-benign and sustainable industrial decontamination strategy to steadily achieve improved astaxanthin production from Haematococcus pluvialis under large-scale outdoor conditions. Here, this study demonstrates for the first time that a CaCO₃ biomineralization-based decontamination strategy (CBDS) is highly efficient in selectively eliminating algicidal microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, during large-scale H. pluvialis cultivation under autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions, thereby augmenting the astaxanthin productivity. Under outdoor AT and MT conditions, the average astaxanthin productivity of H. pluvialis using CBDS in a closed photobioreactor system was substantially increased by 14.85- (1.19 mg L⁻¹ d⁻¹) and 13.65-fold (2.43 mg L⁻¹ d⁻¹), respectively, compared to the contaminated H. pluvialis cultures. Given the exponentially increasing demand of astaxanthin, a natural anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant drug, CBDS will be a technology of interest in H. pluvialis-based commercial astaxanthin production which has been hindered by the serious biological contaminations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaematococcus pluvialis 3aalgicides 3aantioxidants 3aastaxanthin 3abiomineralization 3adecontamination 3adrugs 3aphotobioreactors 0aHaematococcus pluvialis 0aAstaxanthin 0aAlgicidal microorganism 0aCaCO3 biomineralization-based decontamination strategy 0aMixotrophic culture mode1 aHong, Min Eui1 aSung, Young Joon1 aChoi, Hong Il1 aChang, Won Seok1 aKwak, Ho Seok1 aSim, Sang Jun0 tBioresource technology.g2021 July, v. 332 p.125121-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1251213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013700168300001400305520139400319592002801713650001301741650001801754650004301772650002601815650001201841650002201853650001401875650002001889650001001909650001101919651002201930651001201952700001901964700002201983773010502005856008102110852000902191655001202200IND60575617720221120074726.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057561772DNAL7 a10.1007/s00035-016-0177-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGabel, Anna-Rita10aGenetic variation and performance of the alpine plant species Dianthus callizonus differ in two elevational zones of the Carpathians  ap. 65-74.  aIn this investigation, we studied whether genetic variation and performance of the alpine plant species Dianthus callizonus differ between two different elevational zones of the southern Carpathians in Romania. We analysed 17 populations of the species from two study regions at 1700 and 2100 m above sea level in the Piatra Craiului Mountains applying AFLP analyses and morphological measurements. Following our results, population size differed between the two study regions and genetic variation within populations depended on population size. Population size and genetic variation within populations were higher in the study region located at 1700 m. By contrast, genetic variation between populations was nearly twice as large in the study region located at 2100 m. In a Mantel test, genetic and geographic distances between populations were clearly correlated. Moreover, individuals from the study region at 2100 m were significantly smaller, had fewer shoots, fewer flowers per shoot and produced seeds with a lower seed mass than individuals from the study region at 1700 m. The results of our study support the observation that changing environmental conditions along elevational gradients in mountain regions affect population size, genetic variation and performance of alpine plant species from different elevational zones, which should be considered in plant conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDianthus 3aalpine plants 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aenvironmental factors 3aflowers 3agenetic variation 3amountains 3apopulation size 3aseeds 3ashoots 3aCarpathian region 3aRomania1 aSattler, Julia1 aReisch, Christoph0 tAlpine botany.g2017 Apr., v. 127, no. 1 p.65-74dSpringer International Publishingx1664-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00035-016-0177-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245010100153520196100254592002802215650001202243650001902255650002302274650002202297650002002319650001502339650001602354650000902370650001102379650001102390650001502401650001702416650001602433650001702449650001602466700001902482700001802501700001202519700001702531773012002548856007402668852000902742655001202751IND60781130720221119132147.0220623e20220618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078113072DNAL7 a10.3390/w141219562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Xin 10aIdentification and Prediction of Crop Waterlogging Risk Areas under the Impact of Climate Change  aWaterlogging refers to the damage to plants by water stress due to excess soil water in the crop’s root zone that exceeds the maximum water holding capacity of the field. It is one of the major disasters affecting agricultural production. This study aims to add a crop waterlogging identification module to the coupled SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tools)-MODFLOW (Modular Finite Difference Groundwater Flow Model) model and to accurately identify and predict crop waterlogging risk areas under the CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6) climate scenarios. The result showed that: (1) The SWAT-MODFLOW model, which coupled with a crop waterlogging identification module, had good simulation results for LAI (Leaf Area Index), ET (Evapotranspiration), spring wheat yield, and groundwater level in the middle and lower reaches of the Bayin River; (2) The precipitation showed an overall increasing trend in the Bayin River watersheds over the next 80 years under the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. The temperature showed a clear increasing trend over the next 80 years under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios; (3) Under the SSP1-2.6 scenario, the mountain runoff from the upper reaches of the Bayin River was substantially higher than in other scenarios after 2041. The mountain runoff in the next 80 years will decrease substantially under the SSP2-4.5 scenario. The mountain runoff over the next 80 years showed an initial decrease and then an increasing trend under the SSP5-8.5 scenario; (4) During the historical period, the crop waterlogging risk area was 10.9 km². In the next 80 years, the maximum crop waterlogging area will occur in 2055 under the SSP1-2.6 scenario. The minimum crop waterlogging area, 9.49 km², occurred in 2042 under the SSP2-4.5 scenario. The changes in the area at risk of crop waterlogging under each scenario are mainly influenced by the mountain runoff from the upper reaches of the Bayin River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic models 3aleaf area index 3aprediction 3arhizosphere 3arisk 3arivers 3arunoff 3asoil water 3aspring wheat 3atemperature 3awater stress 3awater table1 aJin, Yanxiang 1 aZhai, Jingya 1 aFu, Di 1 aMao, Xufeng 0 tWater.g2022 June 18, v. 14, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141219563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013700160520151100297592002801808650001301836650000801849650001901857650001601876650001301892650001001905650001701915650001901932650001101951651001001962700001501972700001201987700002001999700001802019700002002037700001402057700001602071773013002087856007402217852000902291655001202300IND60751712120221119105228.0210925e20210914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075171212DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131836642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Xiangguang 10aVertical Structure of Air Pollutant Transport Flux as Determined by Ground-Based Remote Sensing Observations in Fen-Wei Plain, China  aAir pollutant transport plays an important role in local air quality, but field observations of transport fluxes, especially their vertical distributions, are very limited. We characterized the vertical structures of transport fluxes in central Luoyang, Fen-Wei Plain, China, in winter based on observations of vertical air pollutant and wind profiles using multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) and Doppler wind lidar, respectively. The northwest and the northeast are the two privileged wind directions. The wind direction and total transport scenarios were dominantly the northwest during clear days, turning to the northeast during the polluted days. Increased transport flux intensities of aerosol were found at altitudes below 400 m on heavily polluted days from the northeast to the southwest over the city. Considering pollution dependence on wind directions and speeds, surface-dominated northeast transport may contribute to local haze events. Northwest winds transporting clean air masses were dominant during clean periods and flux profiles characterized by high altitudes between 200 and 600 m in Luoyang. During the COVID-19 lockdown period in late January and February, clear reductions in transport flux were found for NO₂ from the northeast and for HCHO from the northwest, while the corresponding main transport altitude remained unchanged. Our findings provide better understandings of regional transport characteristics, especially at different altitudes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair pollutants 3aair quality 3aaltitude 3alidar 3aspectroscopy 3awind direction 3awinter 3aChina1 aHu, Qihou 1 aHu, Bo 1 aWang, Shuntian 1 aLiu, Hanyang 1 aXing, Chengzhi 1 aLin, Hua 1 aLin, Jinan 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Sept. 14, v. 13, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131836643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245016000165520110700325592002801432650002301460650001501483650001601498650001901514650001201533650002201545650002501567650001201592650002501604650002601629650002401655650001101679650002001690650001301710650001501723650001501738653003001753653003301783653004401816653003701860653002101897700001301918700001601931700001801947700001601965700001401981700001201995700005202007773011002059856008402169852000902253655001202262IND60645087120221118134107.0200128e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064508712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biteb.2019.1002332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mingrun10aBiological treatment of high strength ammonia wastewater containing 2,4-dichlorophenol in a membrane bioreactor: System performance and microbial community  aTwo membrane bioreactors (toxic MBR and blank MBR) were established and compared to treat high ammonia wastewater in the presence and absence of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). After 130 days operation, both MBRs expressed NH₄⁺-N removal efficiency (>95%) and 2,4-DCP removal efficiency was (96.47 ± 1.54) %. Specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) data showed that nitrifying bacteria receive more severe inhibition than heterotrophic bacteria. Trans-membrane pressure (TMP) data indicated that the presence of 2,4-DCP caused more serious membrane fouling. The protein/polysaccharide ratio increased to 1.1 and 6.3 in the loosely bound EPS (LB-EPS) and tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS) after 2,4-DCP addition. Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) showed that TB-EPS were mainly composed of aromatic and tryptophan PN-like substances, and LB-EPS of humic acid-like and fulvic acid-like substances. The microbial community analysis showed that the abundance of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Nitrospirae under 2,4-DCP stress increased from 22.56%, 27.10%, and 1.27% to 38.89%, 28.25% and 3.59%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3aFirmicutes 3aNitrospirae 3aProteobacteria 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiological treatment 3afouling 3amembrane bioreactors 3amicrobial communities 3anitrifying bacteria 3aoxygen 3apolysaccharides 3atoxicity 3atryptophan 3awastewater 0aMembrane bioreactor (MBR) 0a2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) 0aExtracellular polymeric substance (EPS) 0aExcitation-emission matrix (EEM) 0aMembrane fouling1 aHan, Fei1 aMeng, Zijun1 aYang, Qingwei1 aXu, Weiying1 aWei, Dong1 aDu, Bin1 aWei, Qin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3034-80460 tBioresource technology reports.g2019 Sept., v. 7 p.100233-dElsevier LtdwJournal:26760x2589-014X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2019.1002333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245005300161300001800214500001900232500002000251520091500271592002801186596004901214596004001263596005501303596004201358650001201400650001001412650000901422650002001431650001601451650000901467650001701476650001801493650001201511650003001523650001801553700001401571700005201585700001501637700001301652700001501665700001401680700001501694773012401709856007801833852000901911655001201920IND60709178820221118041406.0200903e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070917882DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2019003242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Gangyi10aIon‐induced PCR strategy for mercury detection  ap. 1517-1522.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMercury contamination is one of the most serious environmental problems. It can cause serious effects on the human health, such as case damage in the brain, nervous system, immune system, and kidney failure. Therefore, development of an accurate, sensitive, and simple operational detection method for mercury is very necessary. Herein, we report a new strategy for mercury ion detection based on commonly used PCR technique. High selectivity and sensitivity were achieved by the formation of the thymine‐Hg‐thymine (T‐Hg‐T) unnatural base pair at the 3’‐end of PCR primers. The detection results of PCR amplification in presence of mercury ion could be reported either by using agarose gel analysis or through real‐time fluorometric dye tracing for different detection purposes. To our knowledge, this study represents the first application of PCR based technique to the detection of metal ions.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cInnovative Team of Sichuan Province  cChengdu Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology  cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation 3aagarose 3abrain 3adyes 3aelectrophoresis 3afluorometry 3agels 3ahuman health 3aimmune system 3amercury 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arenal failure1 aWang, Wei1 aYuan, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0082-72301 aDong, Juan1 aCui, Xin1 aHuang, Xin1 aDeng, Yun1 aTang, Zhuo0 tElectrophoresis.g2020 Sept., v. 41, no. 16-17 p.1517-1522dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2019003243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012900159300001500288500002000303520225000323592002802573650001502601650001702616650001702633650002602650650001302676650001502689650001502704650001602719650001402735650001202749650001002761650001002771650001602781651001302797651001702810700003002827700002002857700004102877700002402918773011202942856007403054852000903128655001203137IND60588435420221119134408.0180117e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058843542DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.030012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaestri, Renan10aGeometric morphometrics meets metacommunity ecology: environment and lineage distribution affects spatial variation in shape  ap. 90-100.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPatterns of univariate trait variation across metacommunities are widely explored, as are searches for their underlying causes. Surprisingly, patterns of multivariate shape remain unknown, and the search for drivers of functional traits of communities often neglect the biogeographical distribution of phylogenetic clades. Our aim was to investigate multivariate shape distribution across metacommunities and to determine the main environmental drivers of shape beyond/taking into account the phylogenetic distribution of lineages. We obtained mean skull and mandible shape for 228 species of Neotropical sigmodontine rodents through geometric morphometrics (GM), and then calculated mean shapes for 1° × 1° cells across the Neotropics based on the incidence of sigmodontines. We investigated the effects of lineage distribution on mean trait variation by using phylogenetic fuzzy weighting to calculate principal coordinates of phylogenetic structure (PCPS). Effects of environmental variables on shape variation incorporating phylogenetic composition were realized through redundancy analysis. We found that the different distributions of major lineages throughout the Neotropics were responsible for much of the mean shape variation. The association of landscape features with tribal groupings (Oryzomyini with Amazonia and Phyllotini and Abrotrichini with the Andes) were standouts. Environmental variables and lineage distribution explain the same (i.e. shared) portion of shape variation, suggesting phylogenetic niche conservatism at the metacommunity level. Seasonality in temperature and land cover were the best environmental predictors of mean shape: larger tympanic bullae, incisive foramina, and check teeth are all associated with highly seasonal and less vegetated areas. Our new approach of using GM shape across metacommunities was demonstrably useful in understanding large‐scale biogeographical patterns of shape variation and identifying its underlying causes. The overlap between environmental variables and phylogenetic lineage distribution suggests that a process of niche conservatism is likely: the phenotype–environment correlation is mediated by the differential biogeographical distribution of the main clades.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotropics 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3aenvironmental factors 3ageometry 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3amorphometry 3aphylogeny 3arodents 3askull 3ateeth 3atemperature 3aAmazonia 3aAndes region1 aMonteiro, Leandro Rabello1 aFornel, Rodrigo1 ade Freitas, Thales Renato Ochotorena1 aPatterson, Bruce D.0 tEcography.g2018 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.90-100dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3867072x0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.030013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001500180245018400195300001800379506007600397520165700473592002802130506003702158650002802195650001102223650000902234650001202243650001502255650002302270650001302293700002402306700002102330700002202351700002002373700001802393700002202411773012102433856007502554852000902629655001202638IND60558922820221207140328.0161120e20130808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055892282DNAL7 a10.1021/jp401551t2doi7 aPMC38090232pmcid7 a238953392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Nan10aDistance-Independent Charge Recombination Kinetics in Cytochrome c–Cytochrome c Peroxidase Complexes: Compensating Changes in the Electronic Coupling and Reorganization Energies  ap. 9129-9141.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCharge recombination rate constants vary no more than 3-fold for interprotein ET in the Zn-substituted wild type (WT) cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP):cytochrome c (Cc) complex and in complexes with four mutants of the Cc protein (i.e., F82S, F82W, F82Y, and F82I), despite large differences in the ET distance. Theoretical analysis indicates that charge recombination for all complexes involves a combination of tunneling and hopping via Trp191. For three of the five structures (WT and F82S(W)), the protein favors hopping more than that in the other two structures that have longer heme → ZnP distances (F82Y(I)). Experimentally observed biexponential ET kinetics is explained by the complex locking in alternative coupling pathways, where the acceptor hole state is either primarily localized on ZnP (slow phase) or on Trp191 (fast phase). The large conformational differences between the CcP:Cc interface for the F82Y(I) mutants compared to that the WT and F82S(W) complexes are predicted to change the reorganization energies for the CcP:Cc ET reactions because of changes in solvent exposure and interprotein ET distances. Since the recombination reaction is likely to occur in the inverted Marcus regime, an increased reorganization energy compensates the decreased role for hopping recombination (and the longer transfer distance) in the F82Y(I) mutants. Taken together, coupling pathway and reorganization energy effects for the five protein complexes explain the observed insensitivity of recombination kinetics to donor–acceptor distance and docking pose and also reveals how hopping through aromatic residues can accelerate long-range ET.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acytochrome-c peroxidase 3aenergy 3aheme 3amutants 3aperoxidase 3aphysical chemistry 3asolvents1 aKuznetsov, Alex V.,1 aNocek, Judith

Methylation of the RNA components of the translational machinery has been studied extensively and is important for structure stability, ribosome biogenesis, and translational fidelity. However, the functional effects of ribosomal protein methylation by their cognate methyltransferases are still largely unknown. Previous work has shown that the ribosomal protein Rpl3 methyltransferase, histidine protein methyltransferase 1 (Hpm1), is important for ribosome biogenesis and translation elongation fidelity. In this study, yeast strains deficient in each of the ten ribosomal protein methyltransferases in S. cerevisiae were examined for potential defects in ribosome biogenesis and translation. Like Hpm1-deficient cells, loss of four of the nine other ribosomal protein methyltransferases resulted in defects in ribosomal subunit synthesis. All of the mutant strains exhibited resistance to the ribosome inhibitors anisomycin and/or cycloheximide in plate assays, but not in liquid culture. Translational fidelity assays measuring stop codon readthrough, amino acid misincorporation, and programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting, revealed that eight of the ten enzymes are important for translation elongation fidelity and the remaining two are necessary for translation termination efficiency. Altogether, these results demonstrate that ribosomal protein methyltransferases in S. cerevisiae play important roles in ribosome biogenesis and translation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiogenesis 3acycloheximide 3aeukaryotic cells 3amethylation 3amethyltransferases 3amutants 3aprotein subunits 3aribosomal proteins 3aribosomes 3astop codon 3atranslation (genetics) 3ayeasts 0aRibosomal protein 0aRibosome biogenesis 0aTranslation elongation 0aTranslation fidelity 0aAminoacyl-tRNA 0aPeptidyl transferase1 aWhite, Jonelle1 aClarke, Steven1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7303-66320 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Feb. 12, v. 470 p.552-557dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.01.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100001900162245010400181300001600285520149900301592002801800650000901828650001801837650002901855650002001884650002801904650001501932650002601947650001401973650001301987650001302000650001202013650001302025650002602038650002102064650001202085650002302097650002502120650001002145650003502155650003702190650001202227650001402239650000902253650002002262650003902282650004002321650000902361650002502370650003302395700002202428700001702450700001702467773014402484852000902628856008002637655001202717IND2207084220221118204517.0200421e19990101enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220708422DNAL7 a107195642pmid7 a10.1080/0963748991010672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussein, Laila10aNutritional quality and the presence of anti-nutritional factors in leaf protein concentrates (LPC)  ap. 333-343.  aLeaf protein concentrates were prepared from 25 different plant species. The concentrates contained acceptable levels of all essential amino acids; except methionine which was limiting with chemical scores ranging between 13.5-96%. LPCs from sesbania, nebergrass, lufa and sweet pepper were lethal to the rats. PER ranged between 0.28 for safflower LPC up to 1.95 for rape. Positive nitrogen balance was obtained with diets based on LPCs with mean values ranging between 6.4 and 22.42 mg N per day. True nitrogen digestibility fluctuated between 72.4% for sweet potato LPC up to 97.9% for LPC prepared from safflower. BV ranged between 60.5 for sunflower LPC to 97.26 for carrot LPC. NPU values of LPCs were 49.4 for sunflower LPC up to 86.5% for rape LPC. There was a positive correlation coefficient between BV and the respective NPU. Highest utilizable protein was obtained with turnip LPC. Tested LPC's contain 0.6-6.8% tannin. Saponin was absent in 11 LPCs. Lufa LPC showed the highest saponin content followed by nebergrass and sesbania LPCs. Trypsin inhibitory activity was quite low. Prelimenary results show that rats consumed diet based on lufa, nebergrass and sesbania LPCs died within the first few days of the experiment. Low growth rates were obtained for drum-dried samples prepared from carrot, but this was not the case for drum-dried samples prepared from chard. The activity of liver alanine amino transferase was also determined and indicated toxicity of some LPCs to liver.  aPublisher supplied data 3arats 3aanimal models 3aleaf protein concentrate 3anutritive value 3aantinutritional factors 3amethionine 3aessential amino acids 3amortality 3atoxicity 3asaponins 3atannins 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anitrogen balance 3atrypsin 3atrypsin inhibitors 3aalanine transaminase 3aliver 2aAlanine Transaminasexanalysis 2aAmino Acids, Essentialxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aDigestion 2aMale 2aNutritive Value 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aPlant Proteinsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTrypsin Inhibitorsxanalysis1 aEl-Fouly, Mohamed1 aEl-Baz, F.K.1 aGhanem, S.A.0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g1999 Jan. 1, v. 50, no. 5 p.333-343dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0963748991010673Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02977naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245010600213300001400319520148700333592002801820650001501848650002101863650002101884650002501905650001201930650002001942650001201962650001901974650002401993650001502017650000902032650001902041650001302060650000702073650001102080650002002091653002902111653001902140653001502159653001702174653001102191700001602202700001702218700002102235700001402256773009502270856008502365852000902450655001202459IND60554429320221121043754.0161024e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055442932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.02.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, A.I.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1929-164010aOptimization of a chromatographic stationary phase based on gellan gum using central composite design  ap. 46-52.  aTo develop a new stationary phase of easy production, low cost, biocompatible, biodegradable and low unspecific adsorption, a three-dimensional network was prepared by combining the natural polysaccharide of gellan with divalent cations. The stability of this cation exchange chromatographic matrix was optimized by using an experimental design tool. The optimal conditions proposed for the gellan gel formulation were 48mM ZnSO4, 0% DMF, 25°C, 0.75% gellan and 0.5h. The applicability of gellan matrix was tested by chromatographic assays with three model proteins (bovine serum albumin (BSA), α-chymotripsin and lysozyme). The results showed that the retention occurred in function of the net charge of each protein in MES buffer pH 6.2 and the elution was performed by increase of ionic strength to 750mM NaCl in MES buffer pH 6.2. Lysozyme was the more retained protein due to its positive charge more effective than α-chymotripsin, while BSA did not interact with the matrix due to its negative charge at these conditions. Dynamic binding capacity assays were accomplished to characterize this matrix and to compare with commercial resins. The values of dynamic binding capacity from gellan gel were 3.9mg/mL and 17.4mg/mL, at 10% and 50% of breakthrough, respectively. In this way, gellan gel might be a promising chromatographic matrix to explore ionic interactions and to be applied in different purification strategies, getting the best benefit from its use at low cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abinding capacity 3abiodegradability 3abovine serum albumin 3abuffers 3acation exchange 3acations 3achromatography 3aexperimental design 3agellan gum 3agels 3aionic strength 3alysozyme 3apH 3aresins 3asodium chloride 0aCentral composite design 0aChromatography 0aGellan gum 0aIon exchange 0aMatrix1 aRocha, L.A.1 aDias, J.M.L.1 aPassarinha, L.A.1 aSousa, A.0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 957 p.46-52dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.02.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009500165300001100260520149300271592002801764596007901792596005901871650001501930650001301945650001301958650001301971650001401984650001201998650002102010650002502031650000902056650002002065650001402085700001502099700001602114700001602130773013902146856008202285852000902367655001202376IND60684358020221122184857.0201223e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068435802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-020-4451-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xiaojun10aUsing Aeration to Enhance Phosphorus Adsorption and Immobilization by the Sediment and LMB  ap. 93.  aDissolved oxygen (DO) in the overlying water is important in influencing internal phosphorus (P) release. However, the potentially associative effect of DO on the P adsorption and immobilization by La-modified bentonite (LMB) has not been quantified. This 80-day incubation experiment showed the synergistic effect of DO and LMB in the overlying water, which caused the reduction of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) by 51% (DO = 5 mg L⁻¹) and 77% (DO = 7 mg L⁻¹) on average, respectively, compared with the DO of 3 mg L⁻¹. In addition, the DIP in the pore water decreased from 1.12 mg P L⁻¹ (control) to 0.014 mg P L⁻¹ (5 mg L⁻¹) and 0.004 mg P L⁻¹ (7 mg L⁻¹). Besides, the Fe²⁺ and NH₄⁺ concentrations were also reduced significantly in the pore water, suggesting the rise in the redox potential in the sediment, which helped P immobilization. Chemical P-fractionation experiments indicate that the Fe-P reduction in sediment was the most significant, reduced by 14%, followed by NH₄Cl-P (12%), causing a reduction by 13% (3 mg L⁻¹), 23% (5 mg L⁻¹) and 27% (7 mg L⁻¹) of mobile P in the surface 7-cm sediment, respectively. However, the released P ions were rapidly adsorbed by the Al ions and Ca ions, as well as their compounds, thereby leading to the obvious rise in inert P in the sediment. Accordingly, it was suggested that DO and LMB had a synergistic effect on external P adsorption and immobilization.  aPublisher supplied data  aSJCX18_0870cGraduate Research and Innovation Projects of Jiangsu Province  a51778393cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aadsorption 3aaeration 3aaluminum 3aammonium 3abentonite 3acalcium 3adissolved oxygen 3ainorganic phosphorus 3airon 3aredox potential 3asediments1 aLi, Dapeng1 aXu, Chutian1 aHuang, Yong0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2020 Mar., v. 231, no. 3 p.93-93dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-020-4451-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01283naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245007300159300001600232520036100248592002800609650001700637650001600654650002800670650002300698651001000721700001200731700001400743773013700757856007800894852000900972655001200981IND60559186720221122211707.0161128e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055918672DNAL7 a10.5735/085.053.06162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Wen-Hua10aPrimulina gigantea (Gesneriaceae), a New Species from Guangxi, China  ap. 426-430.  aA new species of Gesneriaceae, Primulina gigantea F.

To achieve high efficiency, designers and operators of WWTPs must, therefore, consider all influencing factors, including salinity. With increasing salinity, oxygen transfer increases compared to tap water (TW), due to the inhibition of bubble coalescence. Previous saline water (SW) experiments showed that by using small slits in the diffuser membrane design, oxygen transfer and aeration efficiency increase further. In this study, we present a modified approach for considering the salt effect on oxygen transfer and assess the transferability of SW results to saline-activated sludge (sAS) conditions. Therefore, we operated a pilot-activated sludge plant over 269 days with a saline industrial wastewater influent. The oxygen transfer of disc-diffusers with two different membrane designs was measured continuously via the off-gas method. The salt concentration (cSₐₗₜ) measured via ion analysis ranged between 4.9 and 11 g/L. Despite a high cSₐₗₜ fluctuation, COD elimination was >90% all the time. Our results confirm previous SW results. Oxygen transfer in sAS is up to three times higher compared to non-saline conditions. Aeration efficiency shows that despite a higher pressure drop, diffusers with smaller slits are to be recommended in order to improve aeration in sAS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aaeration 3aindustrial wastewater 3aoxygen 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asalt concentration 3atap water1 aSchwarz, Maximilian 1 aTrippel, Jana 1 aEngelhart, Markus 1 aWagner, Martin 0 tWater.g2022 June 19, v. 14, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141219643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245022800164300001800392520066900410592002801079650002501107650001901132650001301151650002201164650003201186650002301218650001401241650002201255700002401277700002801301700001901329700002601348773012201374856007401496852000901570655001201579IND60618163120221120110859.0181029e20180219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061816312DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra11872d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukumaran, Sri Devi10a2-Aryl-3-(arylideneamino)-1,2-dihydroquinazoline-4(3H)-ones as inhibitors of cholinesterases and self-induced β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation: biological evaluations and mechanistic insights from molecular dynamics simulations  ap. 7818-7831.  aA series of 2-aryl-3-(arylideneamino)-1,2-dihydroquinazoline-4(3H)-ones were evaluated as inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and self-induced β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation.

Indeed, the emissions from agricultural machinery have a significantly negative impact on ambient air, thereby contributing to Climate Change. This study analyses combine harvesters and justifies their optimization in order to increase resource efficiency as well as reduce any negative impact on the environment. Data from 90 combine harvesters in Lithuania and Latvia from 2016 to 2018 is collected using telematics, and the parameters that directly influence engine exhaust emissions are analyzed, such as operation time, grain unloading method, fuel consumption, and auto-steering, according to the engine-operating modes of harvesting, transportation, and idling. Statistically reliable strong correlations can be found between harvesting time and idling time, as well as between fuel consumption during harvesting and idling modes. On average, roughly 20% of the operating time consists of idling and roughly 15% of transportation; moreover, roughly 14% of the diesel fuel is used per year in the aforementioned engine modes. In addition, the auto-steering function enables the efficient use of diesel fuel (average cost per combine harvester is reduced by 0.2 t year⁻¹), thereby reducing air pollution (pollution per combine harvester is reduced on average by 0.6 t year⁻¹). The results suggest telematics system data can be effectively used for data analysis, problem identification, and decision-making with respect to pollution prevention and optimizing combine harvester operation.

A mesoporous structure and anatase crystallites were comfirmed by TEM, XRD and BET. The prepared catalysts exhibited good photocatalytic activity under both ultraviolet and visible light irradiation for methyl orange (MO) degradation. The XPS, UV–vis and FT-IR spectra indicated the high active sites on the surface were caused by doping Mo and performing the sulfation. The composite catalyst with 0.5% Mo dosage showed the highest photocatalytic activity. And the composite catalyst can be recycled for 6times, remaining 90.0% MO degradation ratio under UV irradiation. The high surface area and high active sites on the composite surface are considered as the key factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3achemical engineering 3airradiation 3amethyl orange 3asurface area 3aultraviolet radiation1 aChen, Feng1 aDai, Honghu1 aYang, Jintao1 aZhong, Mingqiang0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 June 1, v. 225 p.695-703dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.03.1103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009300170300001600263520131600279592002801595650001101623650001401634650001201648650002101660650002201681650004001703650002501743650001501768650001301783650001101796650002301807650001401830653001401844653001201858653002001870653002201890653001701912653002801929700001901957700002101976700002001997700001902017700002002036700001702056700001902073700001802092700001902110700001702129773012102146856008202267852000902349655001202358IND60528642020221123034636.0160716e20160212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052864202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.01.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomatsu, Hirotake10aIsolated human islets require hyperoxia to maintain islet mass, metabolism, and function  ap. 534-538.  aPancreatic islet transplantation has been recognized as an effective treatment for Type 1 diabetes; however, there is still plenty of room to improve transplantation efficiency. Because islets are metabolically active they require high oxygen to survive; thus hypoxia after transplant is one of the major causes of graft failure. Knowing the optimal oxygen tension for isolated islets would allow a transplant team to provide the best oxygen environment during pre- and post-transplant periods. To address this issue and begin to establish empirically determined guidelines for islet maintenance, we exposed in vitro cultured islets to different partial oxygen pressures (pO2) and assessed changes in islet volume, viability, metabolism, and function. Human islets were cultured for 7 days in different pO2 media corresponding to hypoxia (90 mmHg), normoxia (160 mmHg), and hyerpoxia (270 or 350 mmHg). Compared to normoxia and hypoxia, hyperoxia alleviated the loss of islet volume, maintaining higher islet viability and metabolism as measured by oxygen consumption and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion responses. We predict that maintaining pre- and post-transplanted islets in a hyperoxic environment will alleviate islet volume loss and maintain islet quality thereby improving transplant outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumans 3ahyperoxia 3ahypoxia 3ain vitro culture 3ainsulin secretion 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aislets of Langerhans 3ametabolism 3anormoxia 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3aviability 0aHyperoxia 0aHypoxia 0aIslet viability 0aInsulin secretion 0aIslet volume 0aOxygen consumption rate1 aKang, Dongyang1 aMedrano, Leonard1 aBarriga, Alyssa1 aMendez, Daniel1 aRawson, Jeffrey1 aOmori, Keiko1 aFerreri, Kevin1 aTai, Yu-Chong1 aKandeel, Fouad1 aMullen, Yoko0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Feb. 12, v. 470 p.534-538dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.01.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012700166300001600293520152400309592002801833650001101861650001201872650001401884650002501898650001301923650001501936650001501951650000701966650002301973700001401996700001902010700001702029700001402046700001702060773009702077856008102174990002302255852000902278655001202287IND60093270620221120200346.0141103e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009327062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.03.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaporale, A.G.10aEffect of competing ligands on the sorption/desorption of arsenite on/from Mg–Fe layered double hydroxides (Mg–Fe-LDH)  ap. 704-709.  aLayered double hydroxides (LDHs) show excellent capacity to sorb and exchange anions. Although arsenic (As) has a high affinity for sorbents containing Fe, only few studies have been carried out on the sorption of arsenite [As(III)] onto a Fe-based LDH. In this work we studied the sorption of As(III) onto a LDH containing Mg and Fe (Mg–Fe-LDH), as affected by: (i) pH; (ii) the presence of increasing concentrations of organic [citrate (CIT) and oxalate (OX)] and inorganic [phosphate (PO₄), selenite (SeO₃) and sulphate (SO₄)] ligands, (iii) the effect of residence time on the desorption of As(III) by these ligands, and; (iv) the kinetics of desorption of As(III) by PO₄. The As(III) sorption isotherms, carried out at different pHs, indicated a good affinity of the harmful oxyanion for the sorption sites of the Mg–Fe-LDH. This material was able to remove efficiently As(III) from contaminated solutions over a wide range of pH, but more in acidic than in alkaline systems. Competing ligands differently prevented the As(III) sorption on Mg–Fe-LDH, according to the following order: SO₄<OX<<SeO₃<CIT<PO₄. The desorption of As(III) by these anions decreased with increasing As(III) residence time on LDH surfaces. A comparison between the sorption/desorption of As(III) and As(V) on/from Mg–Fe-LDH in the presence or absence of anions highlights that less As(III) than As(V) is sorbed, whereas more As(III) than As(V) is desorbed by all the selected organic and inorganic ligands, but PO₄.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3achemical engineering 3acitrates 3adesorption 3ahydroxides 3apH 3asorption isotherms1 aPigna, M.1 aAzam, S.M.G.G.1 aSommella, A.1 aRao, M.A.1 aViolante, A.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 June 1, v. 225 p.704-709dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.03.1113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003400139245020400173520128500377592002801662650002301690650000801713650005201721650002001773650002301793650001501816650001301831650001401844650001501858650001001873651001201883651001101895700003701906700003101943700002001974700002001994700002302014700003402037700002602071700002602097700002402123700003502147700002902182700002802211700002302239700003202262700001702294700002902311700003102340700002302371700001802394700002602412700002102438700002002459700002902479773012002508856007402628852000902702655001202711IND60781131720221119132202.0220623e20220608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078113172DNAL7 a10.3390/w141218422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSosa-Hernández, Juan Eduardo10aExtensive Wastewater-Based Epidemiology as a Resourceful Tool for SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance in a Low-to-Middle-Income Country through a Successful Collaborative Quest: WBE, Mobility, and Clinical Tests  aThe COVID-19 pandemic has challenged healthcare systems worldwide. Efforts in low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs) cannot keep stride with infection rates, especially during peaks. A strong international collaboration between Arizona State University (ASU), Tec de Monterrey (TEC), and Servicios de Agua y Drenaje de Monterrey (Local Water Utilities) is acting to integrate wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) of SARS-CoV-2 in the region as a complementary approach to aid the healthcare system. Wastewater was collected from four sewer catchments in the Monterrey Metropolitan area in Mexico (pop. 4,643,232) from mid-April 2020 to February 2021 (44 weeks, n = 644). Raw wastewater was filtered and filter-concentrated, the RNA was extracted using columns, and the Charité/Berlin protocol was used for the RT-qPCR. The viral loads obtained between the first (June 2020) and second waves (February 2021) of the pandemic were similar; in contrast, the clinical cases were fewer during the first wave, indicating poor coverage. During the second wave of the pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 quantification in wastewater increased 14 days earlier than the COVID-19 clinical cases reported. This is the first long-term WBE study in Mexico and demonstrates its value in pandemic management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3ahealth services 3ametropolitan areas 3amonitoring 3apandemic 3aprotocols 3awastewater 3awater 3aArizona 3aMexico1 aOyervides-Muñoz, Mariel Araceli1 aMelchor-Martínez, Elda M.1 aDriver, Erin M.1 aBowes, Devin A.1 aKraberger, Simona 1 aLucero-Saucedo, Sofia Liliana1 aFontenele, Rafaela S.1 aParra-Arroyo, Lizeth 1 aHolland, LaRinda A.1 aPeña-Benavides, Samantha Ayde1 aNewell, Melanie Engstrom1 aMartínez-Ruiz, Manuel 1 aAdhikari, Sangeet 1 aRodas-Zuluaga, Laura Isabel1 aRahul Kumar,1 aLópez-Pacheco, Itzel Y.1 aCastillo-Zacarias, Carlos 1 aIqbal, Hafiz M.

The wheat variety Longfumai 17 was treated by the mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate to produce a bulk M₂ generation, and the population included 1122 plants. A total length of 3906.80 kb nucleotides was analyzed, and the average mutation density was 1/244.17 kb. The identified mutations included G>A substitutions (43.75%), C>T substitutions (31.25%), A insertions (12.50%), T insertions (6.25%), and deletions (6.25%). These point mutations led to changes in amino acids and thus the encoded protein sequences, ultimately producing 18.75% of missense mutations, 12.50% of frame shift mutations, 6.25% of nonsense mutations, 25.00% of silent mutations and 37.50% of non-coding region mutations. In the kernel hardness gene Pinb and 3 starch synthesis genes waxy, Agp2 and SSIIa-A, we detected 16 different point mutations in 25 mutant lines. The Pinb gene harbored two missense mutations and a nonsense mutation; the C>T missense mutation resulted in a novel allele, this novel allele and the nonsense mutation alerted protein 3D structure; the waxy gene presented missense and frame shift mutations; the Agp2 gene carried a missense mutation; the SSIIa-A incurred a missense mutation and a frame shift mutation that resulted in premature protein termination. All the frame shift mutations, nonsense mutations and the Pinb novel allele resulted in allelic variation of their corresponding genes, which in turn affected their gene functions. The identified mutant lines can be used as intermediate materials in wheat quality improvement schemes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abiosynthesis 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3aframeshift mutation 3ahardness 3amissense mutation 3amutagens 3amutants 3anonsense mutation 3anucleotides 3apoint mutation 3aseeds 3astarch 3awheat1 aGuo, Huijun1 aWang, Yongbin1 aXie, Yongdun1 aZhao, Linshu1 aGu, Jiayu1 aZhao, Shirong1 aZhao, Baocun1 aWang, Guangjin1 aLiu, Luxiang0 tGenes & genomics.g2017 Apr., v. 39, no. 4 p.387-395dThe Genetics Society of Koreax1976-95717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13258-016-0504-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245008200155300001800237520109900255592002801354650003401382650001701416650002301433650001301456650002501469650000901494700002701503700001701530700002001547773012101567856007501688852000901763655001201772IND60558923620170926000000.0161120e20130808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055892362DNAL7 a10.1021/jp404500b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBille, Anna10aLocal Unfolding and Aggregation Mechanisms of SOD1: A Monte Carlo Exploration  ap. 9194-9202.  aCopper, zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is a ubiquitous homodimeric enzyme, whose misfolding and aggregation play a potentially key role in the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). SOD1 aggregation is thought to be preceded by dimer dissociation and metal loss, but the mechanisms by which the metal-free monomer aggregates remain incompletely understood. Here we use implicit solvent all-atom Monte Carlo (MC) methods to investigate the local unfolding dynamics of the β-barrel-forming SOD1 monomer. Although event-to-event variations are large, on average, we find clear differences in dynamics among the eight strands forming the β-barrel. Most dynamic is the eighth strand, β8, which is located in the dimer interface of native SOD1. For the four strands in or near the dimer interface (β1, β2, β7, and β8), we perform aggregation simulations to assess the propensity of these chain segments to self-associate. We find that β1 and β2 readily self-associate to form intermolecular parallel β-sheets, whereas β8 shows a very low aggregation propensity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyotrophic lateral sclerosis 3adissociation 3aphysical chemistry 3asolvents 3asuperoxide dismutase 3azinc1 aJónsson, Sigurdur

Raw and ripened pu-erh tea extract (PETe) have the effect of reducing body weight gain and fat accumulation, which are associated with gut microbiota. However, little is known about the difference of raw and ripened PETe on the regulation of gut microbiota. Here, our results suggested that supplementation of raw and ripened PETe displayed similar anti-obesogenic effect in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity mice, by attenuating the body weight gain, fat accumulation, oxidative injury, and low-grade inflammation, improving the glucose tolerance, alleviating the metabolic endotoxemia, and regulating the mRNA and protein expression levels of the lipid metabolism-related genes. 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples indicated that raw and ripened PETe intervention displayed different regulatory effect on the HFD-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis at different taxonomic levels. The microbial diversity, the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as well as F/B ratio were reversed more closer to normal by ripened PETe. Phylotypes of Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Muribaculaceae, and Rikenellaceae which are negatively correlated with obesity were enhanced notably by the intervention of ripened PETe, while Erysipelotrichaceae and Lactobacillaceae which have positive correlation with obesity were decreased dramatically. In addition, the treatment of ripened PETe had better effect on the increase of benefical Bacteroides, Alistipes, and Akkemansia and decrease of obesity associated Faecalibaculum and Erysipelatoclostridium (p < 0.05). These findings suggested that pu-erh tea especially ripened pu-erh tea could serve as a great candidate for alleviation of obesity in association with the modulation of gut microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aErysipelotrichaceae 3aLachnospiraceae 3aLactobacillaceae 3aRuminococcaceae 3abody weight changes 3acorrelation 3adysbiosis 3aendotoxemia 3afood research 3aglucose tolerance 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipids 3aobesity 3aoxidative toxicity 3aphylotype 3aprotein synthesis 3atea 0aPu-erh tea 0aC57BL/6 mice 0a16S rRNA sequencing 0aGut microbiota1 aZhao, Yan1 aChen, Xiangming1 aZhou, Huiyu1 aYang, Yucheng1 aZhang, Xueqin1 aHuang, Yayan1 aZhang, Na1 aLui, Edmund M.K.1 aXiao, Meitian0 tFood research international.g2021 June, v. 144 p.110360-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1103603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245008600162300001400248500002000262520158900282592002801871650001701899650002401916650001501940650001201955650001501967650001101982650002401993650001502017650000902032651001402041700002102055700002102076773011102097856007402208852000902282655001202291IND60588436520221119134727.0180117e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058843652DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.025392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaller, Donald M.10aDo metacommunity mass effects predict changes in species incidence and abundance?  ap. 11-23.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMetacommunity matrices contain data on species incidence or abundance across sites, compactly portraying community composition and how it varies over sites. We constructed models based on an initial metacommunity matrix of either species incidence or abundance to test whether such data suffice to predict subsequent changes in incidence or abundance at each site. The models reflect both species and site mass effects in using products of the row and column totals to predict the incidence or abundance of each species expected at each site. We tested these models against empirical data on vascular plant incidence and abundance collected from two sets of forested sites in both the 1950s and 2000s. Predictions from these models parallel observed changes in species incidence and abundance in these distinctly different metacommunities and differ greatly from null model predictions. The abundance model shows greater power than the incidence model reflecting its higher information content. Predictions were more accurate for the more diverse forests of southern Wisconsin that are changing quickly in response to succession and fragmentation. Simulations show that these results are robust but sensitive to sampling intensity. Because these models require no data on site conditions or species’ characteristics, they provide a useful baseline to assess more complex models based on species’ functional traits, local site conditions, or landscape context. They may also prove useful to conservation biologists seeking to predict local population declines and extinction risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acommunity structure 3aextinction 3aforests 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 3arisk 3aWisconsin1 aMudrak, Erika L.1 aRogers, David A.0 tEcography.g2018 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.11-23dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3867072x0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.025393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01632naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007900164300001600243500001100259520068100270592002800951650001200979650002100991650001501012650001001027650002201037650001401059650002201073650001601095773010501111856008101216852000901297655001201306IND60575619220221121224937.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057561922DNAL7 a10.1007/s13258-017-0522-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Nam-Soo14aThe genomes and transposable elements in plants: are they friends or foes?  ap. 359-370.  aReview  aTransposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements that are present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The ubiquity and abundance of these self-replicating entities, bereft of cellular function, had earned them the label of ‘genomic parasites’. However, the status of TEs has been revised, with ample genomic and biological evidence now portraying them as “genomic gold”. They are perceived as a major participant in the evolution of species. This review addresses the classification of TEs as well as their role and significance in the evolution of genomes, genetic diversity, gene regulation, and exaptation of contemporary species of the plant and animal kingdoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aeukaryotic cells 3aexaptation 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aparasites 3aprokaryotic cells 3atransposons0 tGenes & genomics.g2017 Apr., v. 39, no. 4 p.359-370dThe Genetics Society of Koreax1976-95717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13258-017-0522-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245011200168520128600280592002801566650001201594650002801606650002001634650001101654650002201665650001101687650001301698650001201711651001701723651001801740651001001758651001101768653002001779653002301799653001001822653001201832700001501844700001701859700001501876700001601891700005601907773011001963856008802073852000902161655001202170IND60733413220221122165050.0210527e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073341322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1056302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Zheng10aKey barriers to the commercial use of the Northern Sea Route: View from China with a fuzzy DEMATEL approach  aThe unprecedented reduction in the Arctic sea ice may lead to shipping shortcuts through the Arctic region. Among these, the Northern Sea Route (NSR) linking Europe and Asia has received wide attention because of its potential to save time and energy compared with the conventional southerly transit. However, limited by various factors, the NSR has not witnessed sustained commercial operation, that is, no shipping companies have started regular services there. By reviewing existing literature, we classify 10 factors that have influenced NSR development into four categories: natural conditions, commercial costs, service support, and political considerations. We evaluate the interdependent relationships among these factors through a fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory model (DEMATEL), an effective approach in identifying the cause–effect chain in an uncertain and complex decision-making environment. The most critical elements restricting Arctic NSR development include extreme climate, political considerations, and sea ice condition based on expert inputs. This study discusses relations among these factors as well as their policy implications, which could contribute to the decision making of shipping companies and policy focus of the government.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acoastal zone management 3adecision making 3aenergy 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apolitics 3asea ice 3aArctic Ocean 3aArctic region 3aChina 3aEurope 0aArctic shipping 0aNorthern Sea Route 0aFuzzy 0aDEMATEL1 aNie, Anwei1 aChen, Jihong1 aGe, Jiawei1 aZhang, Chen1 aZhang, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1367-18340 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 July 01, v. 208 p.105630-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1056303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02166naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011300158300001800271520105400289592002801343650002201371650001401393650001101407650002301418650001101441650002201452650001101474650001301485700001501498700002701513700001201540700001801552700001701570773012101587856007501708852000901783655001201792IND60558923920221118075002.0161120e20130808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055892392DNAL7 a10.1021/jp40493462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Cheol Ho10aSolvent Electronic Polarization Effects on Na+–Na+ and Cl––Cl– Pair Associations in Aqueous Solution  ap. 9273-9279.  aThe formation of like-ion pairs, Na⁺–Na⁺ and Cl––Cl–, in aqueous solution was studied by high-level ab initio methods, classical molecular dynamics (MD), QM/TIP5P, and QM/EFP MD (quantum mechanics/effective fragment potential molecular dynamics). Ab initio calculations on model clusters revealed that the Na⁺(H₂O)ₙNa⁺ (n = 2–4) clusters were significantly more stabilized by bridged waters than the corresponding Cl–(H₂O)ₙCl– clusters. QM/EFP MD simulations in solution also predicted a clear local minimum near 3.6 Å only for the Na⁺–Na⁺ pair, suggesting that Na⁺–Na⁺ pairs may be more likely to form than Cl––Cl– pairs in solution. Analysis of the hydration structures further showed that two-water bridged Na⁺–Na⁺ pairs were dominant at the local minimum. The preferred formation of Na⁺ like-ion pairs in solution appeared to come from significant short-range effects, in particular, charge delocalization (polarization) between the bridged oxygen p and the vacant valence Na⁺ orbitals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3achlorides 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxygen 3aquantum mechanics 3asodium 3asolvents1 aRe, Suyong1 aRashid, Mohammad H.

After acquiring real-time land-cover information, the edge of the network transmits all the hyperspectral images by satellites with low-latency and high-efficiency to the cloud computing center, which are provided by satellite IoT. A gigantic amount of remote sensing data bring challenges to the storage and processing capacity of traditional satellite systems. When hyperspectral images are used in annotation of land-cover application, data dimension reduction for classifier efficiency often leads to the decrease of classifier accuracy, especially the region to be annotated consists of natural landform and artificial structure. This paper proposes encoding spectral-spatial features for hyperspectral image classification in the satellite Internet of Things system to extract features effectively, namely attribute profile stacked autoencoder (AP-SAE). Firstly, extended morphology attribute profiles EMAP is used to obtain spatial features of different attribute scales. Secondly, AP-SAE is used to extract spectral features with similar spatial attributes. In this stage the program can learn feature mappings, on which the pixels from the same land-cover class are mapped as closely as possible and the pixels from different land-cover categories are separated by a large margin. Finally, the program trains an effective classifier by using the network of the AP-SAE.

Little is known about the trophodynamics of P-CTXs in coral reef systems. The present study explores the distribution, transfer, and trophic magnification of P-CTX-1, -2, and -3 in coral reef systems with high (ciguatoxic) and low (reference) ciguatoxicity in a CFP-endemic nation by use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In ciguatoxic coral reef systems, P-CTXs were detected in 54% of herbivorous fishes [total P-CTXs <0.500–1670 pg/g wet weight (ww)], 72% of omnivorous fishes (<0.500–1810 pg/g ww), and 76% of carnivorous fishes (<0.500–69 500 pg/g ww), as well as a lobster (Panulirus penicillatus; 2.36 pg/g ww) and an octopus (Octopodidae; 2.56 pg/g ww). The dominant P-CTXs in grazers and piscivorous fishes were P-CTX-2 and -1, respectively. No significant correlation between P-CTX levels and lipid content in three target predatory fishes indicated that accumulation of P-CTXs does not depend on fat content. A weak but significant positive relationship was observed between δ¹⁵N and P-CTX-1 levels, but further investigation is required to confirm its biomagnification potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOctopodidae 3aPanulirus penicillatus 3abioaccumulation 3aciguatera 3acoral reefs 3afood webs 3aherbivorous fish 3alipid content 3aliquid chromatography 3alobsters 3anitrogen 3aomnivores 3apiscivores 3apredatory fish 3astable isotopes 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicity 3aKiribati1 aWai, Tak-Cheung1 aMurphy, Margaret B.1 aChan, Wing Hei1 aWu, Jia Jun1 aLam, James C.

Results indicated that, compared to the control, LED treatment maintained higher chlorophyll (Chl) content, as well as a lower respiration rate, malondialdehyde content, and polyphenol oxidase activity. The activity of chlorophyll-degrading enzymes, including chlorophyllase, Mg-dechelatase, chlorophyll-degrading peroxidase, and pheophytinase were also lower in the LED-treated plants. Additionally, the activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as peroxidase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase were higher in LED-treated plants than in control plants. Results indicated that the LED treatment maintained the quality and prolonged the shelf-life of garland chrysanthemum, and that the mechanism associated with the beneficial effect of LED lighting may be related to the maintenance of membrane integrity, enhancement of antioxidant enzyme activity, and the inhibition of Chl degradation.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0400901cNational Key R & D Program of China  aCARS-23cChina Agriculture Research System Project  aQNJJ201709cYoung Investigator Fund of Beijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences  a20180404cspecial innovation ability construction fund of Beijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences  a20180705cspecial innovation ability construction fund of Beijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences 3aChrysanthemum carinatum 3aGlebionis coronaria 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3acatechol oxidase 3acell respiration 3achlorophyll 3achlorophyllase 3aenzyme activity 3airradiation 3alight emitting diodes 3alighting 3amalondialdehyde 3aperoxidase 3apolyphenols 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature1 aGu, Sitong1 aZuo, Jinhua1 aGao, Lipu1 aWang, Qing1 aJiang, Aili0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2019 Dec., v. 13, no. 4 p.3005-3014dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-019-00221-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01666naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245012200167300001600289520060100305592002800906650001100934650001700945650002100962650000900983650001300992650002701005650001401032700001901046700001501065700001901080700002001099773010301119856008501222852000901307655001201316IND4486565820221119222437.0150810e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448656582DNAL7 a10.1016/S1671-2927(11)60026-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWANG, Zhan-li11aANovel Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme Inhibitory Peptide from the Milk Casein: Virtual Screening and Docking Studies  ap. 463-467.  aAngiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) plays an important physiological role in the regulation of hypertension.

Various innate and adaptive immune cells that are integrated in this complex networking system may represent promising targets for developing immunotherapeutics for treating specific immune diseases. A spectrum of phytochemicals have been isolated, characterized and modified for development and use as prevention or treatment of human diseases. Many cytotoxic drugs and antibiotics have been developed from phytocompounds, but the application of traditional or new medicinal plants for use as immunomodulators in treating immune diseases is still relatively limited. In this review, a selected group of medicinal herbs, their derived crude or fractionated phytoextracts and the specific phytochemicals/phytocompounds isolated from them, as well as categorized phytocompound groups with specific chemical structures are discussed in terms of their immunomodulatory bioactivities. We also assess their potential for future development as immunomodulatory or inflammation-regulatory therapeutics or agents. New experimental approaches for evaluating the immunomodulatory activities of candidate phytomedicines are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibiotics 3aautoimmune diseases 3achemical structure 3achronic diseases 3acytotoxicity 3ahuman diseases 3ahypersensitivity 3aimmune system 3aimmunomodulation 3aimmunomodulators 3aimmunotherapy 3amedicinal plants 3aneoplasms 3aphytopharmaceuticals1 aChen, Hui-Ming1 aYang, Ning-Sun0 tAdvances in Botanical Research.g2012, v. 62 p.197-272dElsevier Science & Technologyx0065-22967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-394591-4.00004-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011000168300001800278520181500296592002802111650001402139650001802153650001602171650002102187650002302208650001002231650002102241650001702262650001202279650002502291650002302316650001302339650001902352700002002371700002102391700002202412700002202434700002902456700003102485700001902516773014002535856008302675852000902758655001202767IND60083991420221118023003.0141101e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008399142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eclnm.2011.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerli, Manuela10aImprovement of nutritional status in malnourished cirrhotic patients one year after liver transplantation  ap. e142-e147.  aBACKGROUND & AIMS: Liver transplantation is a major procedure often undertaken in patients in poor nutritional status. Few studies have examined the modification of nutritional status after liver transplantation. We aimed at analyzing the modification of nutritional status occurring in liver recipients during the first year. METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive patients submitted to liver transplantation were studied. A complete nutritional assessment, was performed before and at 3, 6 and 12 months after transplantation. Insulin and C-peptide plasma levels were determined and insulin sensitivity was estimated. RESULTS: According to subjective global assessment 56% of patients were malnourished at transplant. In malnourished patients nutritional status further deteriorated at 3 months but improved 6 and 12 months after transplantation. Fat mass significantly increased from before to 12 months after transplant (median triceps skinfold: 10.8 vs 15.2 mm, p = 0.03) while parameters of muscle mass showed minor variations (median arm muscle circumference: 23.4 vs 24.0 cm, p = 0.3). The daily calorie intake also improved (27 vs 32 kcal/kg/die, p = 0.007) and protein intake increased (0.8 vs 1.3 g/kg, p = 0.02). In patients without malnutrition nutritional status and dietary intake showed minor variations after transplantation. Hyperinsulinemia was normalized and insulin sensitivity improved in all patients post-transplant. CONCLUSIONS: During the first 12 months after liver transplant a significant improvement in nutritional status is achieved in patients previously malnourished. Fat deposits show the more rapid improvement while the amelioration of muscle mass requires a longer period. The increased dietary intake and improved insulin sensitivity are associated to these changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ac-peptide 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3ahyperinsulinemia 3ainsulin resistance 3aliver 3aliver transplant 3amalnutrition 3amuscles 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional status 3apatients 3aprotein intake1 aGiusto, Michela1 aRiggio, Oliviero1 aGentili, Federica1 aMolinaro, Antonio1 aAttili, Adolfo Francesco1 aCorradini, Stefano Ginanni1 aRossi, Massimo0 te-SPEN, the European e-journal of clinical nutrition and metabolism.g2011 June, v. 6, no. 3 p.e142-e147dElsevier Ltdx1751-49917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclnm.2011.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012700170300001600297520084800313592002801161650001101189650001901200650001601219650002201235650002701257650001901284653002301303653002801326653003201354653001401386700002301400700002001423700001801443773011901461856008201580852000901662655001201671IND60720671720221118014616.0211030e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072067172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.spc.2020.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasan, Md.

The study considers warehouse operations and transportation logistic systems as the sources of emissions. Several examples are presented, followed by sensitivity analysis for different scenarios. The result shows that under the carbon regulations, profit and carbon emission reduction is proportional to the green technology investment, while demand increase with the green technology promotion. Further analysis has shown that for the carbon tax system policy, the carbon price has influenced the total profit significantly. The decreasing emission level results in a higher profit, while the carbon cap and the carbon limit do not affect the total profit significantly.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3ainventories 3aissues and policy 3asustainable technology 3atransportation 0aCarbon regulations 0aEconomic order quantity 0aGreen technology investment 0aPromotion1 aRoy, Tutul Chandra1 aDaryanto, Yosef1 aWee, Hui-Ming0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2021 Jan., v. 25 p.604-621dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2020.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245007900205300001600284520137700300592002801677650001501705650002101720650002501741650002801766650001601794653002101810653002801831653001501859653002601874653003301900653001901933700002301952700005901975773015402034856008202188852000902270655001202279IND60720671820221118014530.0211030e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072067182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.spc.2020.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBöckel, Alexa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7978-347110aBlockchain for the Circular Economy: Analysis of the Research-Practice Gap  ap. 525-539.  aExtant research claims that the circular economy concept has enormous potential to overcome downsides of status quo economic activities and to contribute to sustainable development, but that the concept also faces challenges in realizing its potential. Blockchain technology has been suggested as one possible critical solution to overcome the current barriers of implementing the circular economy concept. This article addresses the nascent research field of blockchain for a circular economy and examines current developments, from both research and practice. By developing and conducting a research-practice gap analysis using a systematic literature review, this article identifies patterns of interests and opportunities for research and practice and uncovers mutual blind spots that need to be addressed in either sphere. A systematic literature review and qualitative analysis covering 57 diverse documents (journal articles, contents linked from twitter, and google results) revealed three key findings: 1) a clear terminology of blockchain types, their technical properties and benefits are lacking in research, 2) trust and verification are major potential benefits but a challenge to create, and 3) a closer examination of possible benefits and challenges of blockchain technologies for the circular economy with its links to sustainable development is crucial.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablockchain 3acircular economy 3aqualitative analysis 3asustainable development 3aterminology 0acircular economy 0asupply chain management 0ablockchain 0aresearch-practice gap 0asystematic literature review 0asustainability1 aNuzum, Anne-Katrin1 aWeissbrod, Ilka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6104-33330 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2021 Jan., v. 25 p.525-539dElsevier B.V.aInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2020.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245023800168300001600406520134100422592002801763653002701791653001801818653001501836653002201851653001401873700002101887700002001908773012601928856008402054852000902138655001202147IND60128844220221120102907.0151116e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012884422DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-2585-40.4.5472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaman, Jeffrey10aSt. Louis Encephalitis Virus in Wild Birds During the 1990 South Florida Epidemic: The Importance of Drought, Wetting Conditions, and the Emergence of Culex nigripalpus (Diptera: Culicidae) to Arboviral Amplification and Transmission  ap. 547-554.  aWe analyzed the prevalence of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies to St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus in wild birds during the 1990 SLE epidemic in Indian River County. The initial presence of SLE HI antibody was associated significantly with modeled drought 15 wk prior, wetting conditions 1 wk prior, and the emergence of the Florida SLE virus vector, Culex nigripalpus, 5 wk prior. Our findings indicated that three factors conspired to create the 1990 epidemic: (1) a large population of susceptible wild birds; (2) severe springtime drought, which facilitated amplification of the SLE virus among the Cx. nigripalpus and a portion of the wild bird population; and (3) continued rainfall and wetting of the land surface in the summer and early fall, which sustained a large, host-seeking Cx. nigripalpus population. The continued biting and reproductive activity of Cx. nigripalpus maintained epizootic transmission throughout the summer and early fall in Indian River County. The high level of SLE virus amplification resulted in spillover transmission to humans. We hypothesize that without the continued reproductive activity of the vector mosquito, brought about by excessive summer and fall wetness, the unprecedented SLE virus amplification and consequent transmission to humans would not have been realized in 1990.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSt. Louis encephalitis 0aamplification 0awild birds 0aCulex nigripalpus 0ahydrology1 aDay, Jonathan F.1 aStieglitz, Marc0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2003 July, v. 40, no. 4 p.547-554dEntomology Dept., B.P.

The World Health Organization estimates that up to 80% of people still rely mainly on traditional remedies such as herbs for their medicine, resulting in the increasing demand for medicinal plants. About 85% of traditional medicines involve the use of plant extracts. However, a large number of medicinal plants are needed to be investigated for their possible pharmaceutical value. Many pharmaceutical industries harness wildly growing plant populations for the supply of raw materials for extraction of medicinally important compounds. Many of the medicinal plants are severely threatened owing to illicit and indiscriminate collection and destruction of natural habitat. Advanced biotechnological methods of culturing plant cells and tissue provide an alternative means for rapid propagation and conservation of rare and endangered and/or commercially important medicinal plants. This chapter reviews the work carried out by our group in Taiwan on in vitro propagation of Pinellia ternata, Momordica charantia, Gentiana scabra var Bunge and Taraxacum formosanum and production of secondary metabolites from the callus of Stephania tetrandra, hairy root of Salvia miltiorrhiza and cell suspension culture of Gentiana davidii and Dioscorea doryophora.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea 3aGentiana scabra 3aMomordica charantia 3aPinellia ternata 3aSalvia miltiorrhiza 3aStephania tetrandra 3aTaraxacum 3aWorld Health Organization 3aantibiotics 3acallus 3acell suspension culture 3acells 3ahabitats 3ahealth hazards 3aherbal medicines 3aherbs 3amedicinal plants 3apeople 3apharmaceutical industry 3aplant extracts 3apopulation 3araw materials 3asecondary metabolites 3atraditional medicine 3aTaiwan1 aKuo, Chao-Lin1 aZhang, Hongji,1 aChan, Hsiao-Sung1 aChen, Emily Chin-Fun1 aChueh, Fu-Shin1 aTsay, Hsin-Sheng0 tAdvances in Botanical Research.g2012, v. 62 p.35-55dElsevier Science & Technologyx0065-22967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-394591-4.00002-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245012100176300001200297520127000309592002801579650002101607650002201628650001601650650003601666650001801702650001501720700007201735700002801807700003301835773015201868856008202020852000902102655001202111IND60608225220221116151702.0181023e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060822522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-018-6878-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraromi, Dauda Olurotimi10aModeling of an activated sludge process for effluent prediction—a comparative study using ANFIS and GLM regression  ap. 495.  aIn this paper, nonlinear system identification of the activated sludge process in an industrial wastewater treatment plant was completed using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and generalized linear model (GLM) regression. Predictive models of the effluent chemical and 5-day biochemical oxygen demands were developed from measured past inputs and outputs. From a set of candidates, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and a fuzzy brute-force search were utilized in selecting the best combination of regressors for the GLMs and ANFIS models respectively. Root mean square error (RMSE) and Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R-value) served as metrics in assessing the predicting performance of the models. Contrasted with the GLM predictions, the obtained modeling results show that the ANFIS models provide better predictions of the studied effluent variables. The results of the empirical search for the dominant regressors indicate the models have an enormous potential in the estimation of the time lag before a desired effluent quality can be realized, and preempting process disturbances. Hence, the models can be used in developing a software tool that will facilitate the effective management of the treatment operation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3acomputer software 3afuzzy logic 3aindustrial wastewater treatment 3alinear models 3aprediction1 aMajekodunmi, Olukayode Titus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9773-67481 aAdeniran, Jamiu Adetayo1 aSalawudeen, Taofeeq Olalekan0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 Sept., v. 190, no. 9 p.495-495dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6878-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245019700164300002000361520109500381592002801476650001101504650002901515650001701544650001001561650002001571650002301591650001501614650001901629650001101648651002101659651001501680700001801695700002001713700002001733700001801753773012701771856007501898852000901973655001201982IND60534811120170606000000.0160803e20131217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053481112DNAL7 a10.1021/es403364z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Laurentiis, Elisa10aOptical and Photochemical Characterization of Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter from Lakes in Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica. Evidence of Considerable Photoreactivity in an Extreme Environment  ap. 14089-14098.  aWater samples from shallow lakes located in Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica, were taken in the austral summer season and characterized for chemical composition, optical features, fluorescence excitation–emission matrix (EEM) and photoactivity toward the generation of •OH, ¹O₂, and ³CDOM* (triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter). The optical properties suggested that CDOM would be largely of aquagenic origin and possibly characterized by limited photochemical processing before sampling. Moreover, the studied samples were highly photoactive and the quantum yields for the generation of ³CDOM* and partially of ¹O₂ and •OH were considerably higher compared to water samples from temperate environments. This finding suggests that water in the studied lakes would have considerable ability to photosensitize the degradation of dissolved compounds during the austral summer, possibly including organic pollutants, also considering that the irradiance conditions of the experiments were not far from those observed on the Antarctic coast during the austral summer.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3adissolved organic matter 3afluorescence 3alakes 3alight intensity 3aoptical properties 3apollutants 3asinglet oxygen 3asummer 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica1 aBuoso, Sandro1 aMaurino, Valter1 aMinero, Claudio1 aVione, Davide0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 Dec. 17, v. 47, no. 24 p.14089-14098dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes403364z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010800168300001800276520130900294592002801603650001101631650001701642650001101659650002501670650001201695650001101707650002601718650001301744650001401757650000901771650001701780650001601797650001001813700002001823700002101843700002401864700001701888773014001905856008302045852000902128655001202137IND60083991920221118023029.0141101e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008399192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eclnm.2011.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLayec, Sabrina10aNeurological and hematological complications of copper deficiency during exclusive jejunal tube feeding  ap. e187-e189.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hematological and neurological complications of copper deficiency have been described a few years ago, occurring mostly in patients with history of gastric resection. We report a case of copper deficiency during exclusive jejunal tube feeding, corrected by gastric but not by jejunal copper supplements. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 46-year old woman, with exclusive jejunal tube feeding after esophageal cancer was investigated for unexplained anemia and leucopenia. The occurrence of neurological disability, mimicking vitamin B12 deficiency, led us to monitor copper status, which revealed a profound deficiency. Because we failed to restore plasma copper level through jejunostomy in spite of large amounts of copper, a gastrostomy was performed. Afterwards, a standard feeding mixture supplied through gastrostomy tube was sufficient to maintain copper plasma level and allowed for stopping supplementation. CONCLUSION: Patients with exclusive jejunal tube feeding run a high risk of copper deficiency because of the fundamental role of the duodenal, and probably gastric, mucosa in copper absorption. Copper deficiency mimics vitamin B12 deficiency and its status should be systematically explored in post-surgical conditions by-passing the proximal gastrointestinal tract.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3acase studies 3acopper 3aesophageal neoplasms 3ajejunum 3amucosa 3anutrient deficiencies 3apatients 3aresection 3arisk 3atube feeding 3avitamin B12 3awomen1 aGarin, Laurence1 aTrivin, Florence1 aMénard, Dominique,1 aPicot, Denis0 te-SPEN, the European e-journal of clinical nutrition and metabolism.g2011 Aug., v. 6, no. 4 p.e187-e189dElsevier Ltdx1751-49917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclnm.2011.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006900148245011200217300001600329520176100345592002802106650002502134650002902159650002202188650001402210650002102224650002102245650002002266650001402286650003302300650001602333650001102349650001802360650001402378650001402392650001402406650002502420650001402445650001102459650001502470651001002485700001502495700001802510700001302528700001602541700001502557700002002572700001802592773011202610856008202722852000902804655001202813IND60701166120221120170349.0200707e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070116612DNAL7 a10.1007/s12600-020-00796-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLakshmi Prasad, M.

Leaf blight samples collected from sunflower growing areas during rainy season were colonized by Alternariaster helianthi while samples collected during spring season incited by Alternaria alternata. Among two Alternaria species, A. helianthi was the predominant pathogen among the isolates. A total of 220 A. helianthi isolates; 30 A. alternata isolates collected during 2009–10 to 2011–12 from infected sunflower leaves in nine states of India were characterized based on phenotypic, molecular and pathogenic aggressiveness. Molecular identification based on phylogenic analysis using partial internal transcribed spacer regions showed that A. helianthi and A. alternata isolates separated into 11 phylogenetic groups. The pathogenicity on sunflower cultivars KBSH-1, KBSH-44, DRSF-108, PI-535890, TX-16R, Morden revealed that some A. helianthi isolates were highly aggressive with blighting on Morden and DRSF-108. Based on aggressiveness on sunflower cultivars, four groups identified in A. helianthi isolates; three groups in A. alternata isolates.

Probabilistic, generalised regression, radial basis function as well as 2- and 3-layer multilayer perceptron-type neural networks were investigated to determine the most robust and accurate model for this purpose. Multi-layer perceptrons most frequently yielded the best correlations in 8 out of 10 methods. Averaged correlations of predicted versus measured tR across all methods were R²=0.918, 0.924 and 0.898 for the training, verification and test sets respectively. Predictions of blind test compounds (n=8–84 cases) resulted in an average absolute accuracy of 1.02±0.54min for all methods. Within this variation, absolute accuracy was observed to marginally improve for shorter runtimes, but was found to be relatively consistent with respect to analyte retention ranges (~5%). Finally, optimised and replicated network dependency on molecular descriptor data is presented and critically discussed across all methods. Overall, ANNs were considered especially suitable for suspects screening applications and could potentially be utilised in bracketed-type analyses in combination with high resolution mass spectrometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquids 3amass spectrometry 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3ascreening 0aRetention time prediction 0aNon-target analysis 0aSuspect screening 0aHigh resolution mass spectrometry 0aEmerging contaminants1 aMcEneff, Gillian L.0 tTalanta.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 147 p.261-270dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.09.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04410naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010500169300001200274520156400286592002801850596005001878596006001928596011201988596011502100596005402215650001802269650002502287650002402312650002002336650001002356650001102366650001702377650001002394650001502404650000902419650001402428650001602442650002102458650001502479650002602494650001602520650002402536700003302560700001902593700001702612700002102629700002102650700002502671700002202696700002202718700002002740700002102760700001902781700001702800700002202817700002302839700002102862700002102883700002002904700002202924700002102946700001902967700002902986700002703015700002203042700002203064700002203086700002003108700002403128700001903152700002403171700002003195700002303215700006703238773014703305856008303452852000903535655001203544IND60783099720221116184116.0220824e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078309972DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-022-04445-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuebner, Kerstin10aATF2 loss promotes tumor invasion in colorectal cancer cells via upregulation of cancer driver TROP2  ap. 423.  aIn cancer, the activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) has pleiotropic functions in cellular responses to growth stimuli, damage, or inflammation. Due to only limited studies, the significance of ATF2 in colorectal cancer (CRC) is not well understood. We report that low ATF2 levels correlated with worse prognosis and tumor aggressiveness in CRC patients. NanoString gene expression and ChIP analysis confirmed trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2) as a novel inhibitory ATF2 target gene. This inverse correlation was further observed in primary human tumor tissues. Immunostainings revealed that high intratumoral heterogeneity for ATF2 and TROP2 expression was sustained also in liver metastasis. Mechanistically, our in vitro data of CRISPR/Cas9-generated ATF2 knockout (KO) clones revealed that high TROP2 levels were critical for cell de-adhesion and increased cell migration without triggering EMT. TROP2 was enriched in filopodia and displaced Paxillin from adherens junctions. In vivo imaging, micro-computer tomography, and immunostainings verified that an ATF2ᴷᴼ/TROP2ʰⁱᵍʰ status triggered tumor invasiveness in in vivo mouse and chicken xenograft models. In silico analysis provided direct support that ATF2ˡᵒʷ/TROP2ʰⁱᵍʰ expression status defined high-risk CRC patients. Finally, our data demonstrate that ATF2 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the cancer driver TROP2. Therapeutic TROP2 targeting might prevent particularly the first steps in metastasis, i.e., the de-adhesion and invasion of colon cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data  aSCHN477/18-1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aCA17118cEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology  aLM2015040cCzech Centre for Phenogenomics, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences  aRVO 68378050cCzech Centre for Phenogenomics, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences  aZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0109cUniverzita Karlova v Praze 3acell movement 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acomputer simulation 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3aliver 3ametastasis 3amice 3aprognosis 3apseudopodia 3asurface antigens 3atomography 3atranscription factors 3atrophoblast 3axenotransplantation1 aErlenbach-Wuensch, Katharina1 aProchazka, Jan1 aSheraj, Ilir1 aHampel, Chuanpit1 aMrazkova, Blanka1 aMichalcikova, Tereza1 aTureckova, Jolana1 aIatsiuk, Veronika1 aWeissmann, Anne1 aFerrazzi, Fulvia1 aKunze, Philipp1 aNalli, Enise1 aSammer, Elisabeth1 aGehring, Annemarie1 aCheema, Marie M.1 aEckstein, Markus1 aPaap, Eva-Maria1 aSoederberg, Agnes1 aFischer, Corinna1 aPaul, Sushmita1 aMahadevan, Vijayalakshmi1 aNdreshkjana, Benardina1 aMeier, Melanie A.1 aMuehlich, Susanne1 aGeppert, Carol I.1 aMerkel, Susanne1 aGrützmann, Robert,1 aRoehe, Adriana1 aBanerjee, Sreeparna1 aHartmann, Arndt1 aSedlacek, Radislav1 aSchneider-Stock, Regine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0482-531X0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2022 Aug., v. 79, no. 8 p.423-423dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-022-04445-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007900164300001600243520138200259592002801641650001101669650001701680650001201697650001201709650002301721650001101744651001001755653002501765653002601790653002101816653001001837700001701847773011901864856008201983852000902065655001202074IND60720672320221118014619.0211030e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072067232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.spc.2020.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Xiaobo10aDoes industrial structure distortion impact the energy intensity in China?  ap. 551-562.  aIndustrial structure change can affect aggregate energy intensity through sector transfer effect. There are still obvious structural distortions in the process of China's industrial structure change. This structural distortion will inevitably have an adverse impact on the allocation efficiency of resources (including energy), which may hinder the decline of aggregate energy intensity. Based on the idea of ​​equalized labor productivity across sectors under the equilibrium of free entry and exit, this paper measures the industrial structure distortion index of China's provinces from 1978 to 2016, and examines the impact of the structural distortion index on China's energy intensity by using conventional panel data model estimators. The results show that during the period of 1978-2016, China's industrial structure distortion index decreased significantly, and the distortion index was a key determinant of the energy intensity at the province level. We also found that energy price and import and export were important factors driving the decline of China's energy intensity, and FDI had an obvious negative effect, while R&D expenditure had no significant impact on it. In order to reduce the energy intensity, China should dedicate to eliminating the micro-roots of the industrial structure distortion, establish a market-based factor price formation mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aexports 3aimports 3alabor productivity 3aprices 3aChina 0aIndustrial structure 0aStructural distortion 0aEnergy intensity 0aChina1 aLin, Boqiang0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2021 Jan., v. 25 p.551-562dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2020.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245005000175300001400225500001500239520107200254592002801326650003101354650002201385650001201407650001501419650001501434650001401449650002501463650001301488650000901501650001601510650001001526650001701536650001001553653001801563653001001581773010501591856009001696852000901786655001201795IND60111738520221122083349.0150809s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011173852DNAL7 a10.1016/B978-0-12-394279-1.00004-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTouzet, Pascal10aMitochondrial Genome Evolution and Gynodioecy  ap. 71-98.  a2019-12-04  aGynodioecy is a breeding system frequently encountered in flowering plants. It consists of the co-occurrence of hermaphrodites and females in populations. Gynodioecy is generally under nuclear-cytoplasmic control, which involves mitochondrial sterilizing genes and nuclear genes that restore male fertility. Sterilizing mitochondrial genomes have been described in crops in which cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is cryptic, i.e. not maintained in populations of wild relative species. However, the isolation of sterilizing genes has led to the definition of a profile that can help to find candidate genes in CMSs found in gynodioecious species. We discuss the expected effect of two alternative evolutionary dynamics of gynodioecy on mitochondrial diversity and describe the pattern of diversity observed at the gene and genome levels. On the basis of whole sequence analyses of mitochondrial genomes in beet and maize, we suggest that CMS mitochondrial genomes might exhibit a faster evolution rate, and a clue to its cause might be found in male sterility itself.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3asequence analysis 3afemales 3apopulation 3agynodioecy 3aevolution 3amitochondrial genome 3abreeding 3acorn 3asterilizing 3agenes 3aAngiospermae 3abeets 0aMagnoliophyta 0acrops0 tAdvances in Botanical Research.g2012, v. 63 p.71-98dElsevier Science & Technologyx0065-22967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-394279-1.00004-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245011600207300001200323520161300335592002801948596007301976596004402049596004402093650001302137650001502150650001302165650002102178650001302199650002502212650001702237650002002254650002902274650001202303650001502315650001802330650001402348650002502362700002302387700001902410700002402429700002602453700002202479700002202501773015202523856008202675852000902757655001202766IND60608225420221116151654.0181023e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060822542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-018-6882-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmaral, A.

Thus, for analogous WWTP operating in equivalent operating conditions, similar protozoa and metazoa communities can be found. Indeed, the protozoa and metazoa biota monitoring can be considered a quite useful tool for assessing the functioning of biological WWTP. Furthermore, the use of chemometric techniques in WWTP monitoring is becoming widespread to enlighten interrelationships within the plant, especially when a large collection of data can be obtained. In the current study, the protozoa and metazoa communities of three different types of WWTP, comprising one oxidation ditch, four trickling filters, and three conventional activated sludge plants, were monitored. For that purpose, metazoa, as well as the main protozoa groups (flagellates, free-swimming, crawling and sessile ciliates, and testate amoeba) were determined in terms of contents and relative abundance. The collected data was further processed by chemometric techniques, such as cross-correlation, principal components, multivariate ANOVA, and decision trees analyses, allowing to successfully identify, and characterize, the different studied WWTP, and thus, being able to help monitoring and diagnosing operational problems.  aPublisher supplied data  aUID/BIO/04469/2013cPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology  aPOCI-01-0145-FEDER-006684cCOMPETE 2020  aNORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000004cBioTecNorte 3aAnimalia 3aCiliophora 3aProtozoa 3aactivated sludge 3aaeration 3aanalysis of variance 3achemometrics 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3afilters 3amonitoring 3anitrification 3aoxidation 3awastewater treatment1 aLeal, Cristiano S.1 aVaz, A.

Plants were grown in symbiosis with the AMF Funelliformis mosseae, Rhizophagus irregularis, Claroideoglomus claroideum or left uninoculated, and 14 days after sowing half of the plants were inoculated with P. ultimum. Plants were harvested 14, 21 and 28 days after sowing and analyzed for dry weights, AMF colonization and P. ultimum infection. The results showed three scenarios of biological control by the AM symbioses: AM with F. mosseae fully counteracted the plant growth depression caused by the pathogen; R. irregularis AM resulted in plant growth depression, but counteracted plant growth depression by the pathogen; AM symbiosis with C. claroideum caused plant growth depression and had no biological control effect against P. ultimum.Overall, the study showed biocontrol features of AMF in terms of tolerance induction though depending on species of AMF. Such differential traits of AMF should be considered when developing biocontrol strategies against root rot in cucumber.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClaroideoglomus claroideum 3aCucumis sativus 3aPythium ultimum 3aRhizophagus irregularis 3abiological control 3acucumbers 3amechanism of action 3amycorrhizal fungi 3apathogens 3aplant growth 3aroot rot 3asowing 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aBiocontrol 0aCucumber 0aFunctional compatibility in arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis 0aSoil borne pathogens 0aOomycetes 0aDisease tolerance1 aCabral, Carmina1 aLarsen, John0 tBiological control.g2020 Feb., v. 141 p.104133-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2019.1041333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01757naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245006600169300001600235520089200251592002801143650002001171650001701191650001301208650002001221650001801241700002201259700001601281773009401297856005501391852000901446655001201455IND4501443220221119000850.0150416e200006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450144322DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.00577.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasu, Sanjib10aBayesian Inference for Kappa from Single and Multiple Studies  ap. 577-582.  aCohen's kappa coefficient is a widely popular measure for chanceâcorrected nominal scale agreement between two raters. This article describes Bayesian analysis for kappa that can be routinely implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology. We consider the case of mâ¥ 2 independent samples of measured agreement, where in each sample a given subject is rated by two rating protocols on a binary scale. A major focus here is on testing the homogeneity of the kappa coefficient across the different samples. The existing frequentist tests for this case assume exchangeability of rating protocols, whereas our proposed Bayesian test does not make any such assumption. Extensive simulation is carried out to compare the performances of the Bayesian and the frequentist tests. The developed methodology is illustrated using data from a clinical trial in ophthalmology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMarkov chain 3abiometry 3aclinical trials 3aophthalmology1 aBanerjee, Mousumi1 aSen, Ananda0 tBiometrics.g2000 June, v. 56, no. 2 p.577-582dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.00577.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008300167300001600250520156700266592002801833650002101861650000901882650001101891650002001902650001501922650001801937650003001955650001201985650001201997650002002009650001002029650001102039650001402050650002702064650002302091650001102114650001802125650001502143650001102158651001002169653001102179653001402190653002602204700001702230700001802247700001602265700001502281773011202296856008402408852000902492655001202501IND60291407820221120182820.0150701e20150703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6029140782DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2014.9631002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBangar, Y.C.10aSeasonal variation in morbidity pattern in cattle by log-linear model approach  ap. 283-286.  aThe present study was carried out to understand the seasonal variations in pattern of various diseases in cattle of Pune division of Maharashtra state of India during January 2010 to December 2010. Data of 1538 cattle (both dairy and beef, both male and female), mostly cross-breds, were collected from randomly selected 421 livestock owners by stratified two-stage random sampling design from study area. A log-linear model was used to understand the seasonal variation in incidence of various diseases in cattle. Out of total 1538 cattle, 342 cattle were found affected due to various diseases during study period. The chi-square analysis of data revealed that there was unlike pattern of incidences of various diseases in three seasons. Overall incidence of all diseases was high in winter (41.23%) followed by rainy (39.18%) than that of in summer (19.59%). Overall incidences of reproductive diseases (17.84%) and digestive diseases (11.11%) were major problems in whole study period. A log-linear modelling showed that the odds of incidences of reproductive diseases were significantly higher in summer as well as in rainy season than in winter season. Winter season was dominated by occurrences of digestive diseases as compared to any other diseases. It is suggested that field veterinarians and personnel in animal husbandry sector should give emphasis on providing more information to farmers regarding adoption of standard managemental practices to avoid losses due to reproductive diseases, digestive diseases and other problems in different seasons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal husbandry 3abeef 3acattle 3acattle diseases 3acrossbreds 3adata analysis 3adigestive system diseases 3afarmers 3afemales 3ahuman resources 3amales 3amodels 3amorbidity 3areproductive disorders 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3aveterinarians 3awet season 3awinter 3aIndia 0acattle 0amorbidity 0aseason and log-linear1 aDohare, A.K.1 aKolekar, D.V.1 aAvhad, S.R.1 aKhan, T.A.0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2015 July 3, v. 43, no. 3 p.283-286dTaylor & Francisx0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2014.9631003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012700169300001400296520104400310592002801354650001701382650002001399650002101419650001001440650001601450650002201466650002001488650002001508650001901528650001801547650001401565650002301579650002401602650002101626650001401647653002201661653001001683653001801693653002101711653002101732653001401753700002001767700001601787700001901803773010401822856008401926852000902010655001202019IND60591411820221118140836.0180319e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059141182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2017.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarman, Ananya10aPhospholipases play multiple cellular roles including growth, stress tolerance, sexual development, and virulence in fungi  ap. 55-69.  aPhospholipases are ubiquitous enzymes that hydrolyze phospholipids. Based on the cleavage site of the ester linkage in the substrate phospholipids, phospholipases are classified into four major types, phospholipase A (PLA), phospholipase B (PLB), phospholipase C (PLC), and phospholipase D (PLD), which are further classified into various subtypes. Phospholipases hydrolyze phospholipids into various signaling products including phosphatidic acid (PA), diacylglycerol (DAG), free fatty acids (FFAs), and lyso-phospholipids (LPLs). These signaling products regulate numerous processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics, growth, homeostasis, membrane remodeling, nutrient acquisition, secretion, signal transduction, stress tolerance, sexual development, and virulence in various organisms including fungi. Due to these key cellular roles, phospholipases are also promising targets in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In this review, we discuss current knowledge about the cellular roles of different classes of phospholipases in fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytoskeleton 3adiacylglycerols 3afree fatty acids 3afungi 3ahomeostasis 3alysophospholipase 3aphospholipase C 3aphospholipase D 3aphospholipases 3aphospholipids 3asecretion 3asexual development 3asignal transduction 3astress tolerance 3avirulence 0aCalcium signaling 0aFungi 0aPhospholipids 0aSecond messenger 0aStress tolerance 0aVirulence1 aGohain, Dibakar1 aBora, Utpal1 aTamuli, Ranjan0 tMicrobiological research.g2018 Apr., v. 209 p.55-69dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2017.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245015100174300001800325520140800343592002801751596003901779650003401818650002601852650002101878650002401899650002601923650002601949650002501975650002502000650001702025650001802042650001602060650001702076650001702093650001602110650001302126650001402139650002002153700006202173700003002235773013402265856008302399852000902482655001202491IND60675162220221120161303.0220726e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067516222DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-019-00232-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTepsongkroh, Benjarat10aAntioxidant properties and selected phenolic acids of five different tray-dried and freeze-dried mushrooms using methanol and hot water extraction  ap. 3097-3105.  aMushrooms are health foods due to their nutritional values and antioxidant properties. This study investigated chemical properties, total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant activities (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl; DPPH and 2, 2-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid); ABTS) and selected phenolic acids from five different tray-dried and freeze-dried mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus, Pleurotus pulmonarius, Schizophyllum commune, Volvariella volvacea and Lentinus edodes). The extracts were prepared using methanol and hot water extractions. The results revealed that V. volvacea had the highest protein (28.70%) and ash (9.48%) contents. There were significant differences among some tray dried and freeze dried mushrooms regarding TPC, DPPH and ABTS. However, tray drying tended to improve TPC, DPPH and ABTS in P. ostreatus, P. pulmonarius and L. edodes. Among five mushroom species, both methanol and hot water extractions of V. volvacea had the highest TPC, DPPH and ABTS values but there were no significant differences between mushrooms prepared using tray drying and freeze drying. Moreover, the yield and contents of gallic acid and p-hydroxybenzoic acid from the hot water extracts were higher than from the methanol extracts. Therefore, tray-dried V. volvacea had the most potential as a natural antioxidant and could be used as a functional ingredient in healthy food products.  aPublisher supplied data  aPHD58I0001cThailand Research Fund 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3a4-hydroxybenzoic acid 3aLentinula edodes 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aPleurotus pulmonarius 3aSchizophyllum commune 3aVolvariella volvacea 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3afreeze drying 3agallic acid 3ahealth foods 3ahealthy diet 3aingredients 3amethanol 3amushrooms 3anutritive value1 aJangchud, Kamolwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7747-76731 aTrakoontivakorn, Gassinee0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2019 Dec., v. 13, no. 4 p.3097-3105dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-019-00232-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01654naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245010300174300001600277520063000293592002800923653001300951653001400964653001300978653001400991653001301005700002301018700002101041700002001062700002701082773012601109856008401235852000901319655001201328IND60128845020221122034547.0151116e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012884502DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-2585-40.4.5902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphree Bacon, Rendi10aDNA Evidence of Borrelia lonestari in Amblyomma americanum (Acari: Ixodidae) in Southeast Missouri  ap. 590-592.  aAmblyomma americanum collected near Lake Wappapello, Missouri, tested positive for Borrelia lonestari using polymerase chain reaction and sequence analyses of B. lonestari 16S rRNA and flagellin (flaB) genes.

Heterotrophic protists represent the majority of Excavata, as only the Euglenida contain a green plastid, apparently acquired by secondary endosymbiosis. The sister group of Euglenida, the mostly parasitic Kinetoplastida, have an extremely complex mitochondrial DNA (kinetoplast DNA), which is usually composed of thousands of mutually interlocked DNA circles. Most mRNAs encoded by this genome are rendered translatable only after they undergo intricate editing via insertions and/or deletions of uridines. The mitochondrial DNA of the other sister group, Diplonemida, is unique as its transcripts must be massively trans-spliced before translation. None of these complex mechanisms has so far been found in the mitochondrial genome and transcriptome of Euglena gracilis, the best studied member of Euglenida. Its mitochondrial DNA exists in the form of numerous differently sized linear fragments. Their significant fraction is non-coding and full of various repeats, which intersperse fragments of a handful of protein-coding genes. Mostly photosynthetic dinoflagellates and parasitic apicomplexans with a relic plastid constitute a large and diverse group within alveolates. All species of this group share the most reduced mitochondrial genome found, containing just three, and in some cases probably two, protein-coding genes along with highly fragmented rRNA genes, and no tRNA genes. Mitochondrial genomes of dinoflagellates and those of smaller groups within the apicomplexa–dinoflagellata assemblage, perkinsids and chromerids, in all cases have a recombining, highly scrambled sequence, and frequently demonstrate other non-canonical features in structure and expression: fused genes, extensive RNA editing, trans-splicing, 5′ oligoU caps, loss of start and stop codons, extensive translational frameshifting. Some of these oddities apparently appeared in several groups independently, probably due to relaxed selective constraints in tiny organellar genomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3astop codon 3amessenger RNA 3atranslation (genetics) 3aribosomal RNA 3asymbiosis 3amitochondrial genome 3aKinetoplastida 3atrans-splicing 3atransfer RNA 3atranscriptome 3aDinophyceae 3aRNA editing 3akinetoplast DNA 3aEuglena gracilis 0aApicomplexa 0aMiozoa 0agenes1 aLukeš, Julius0 tAdvances in Botanical Research.g2012, v. 63 p.127-153dElsevier Science & Technologyx0065-22967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-394279-1.00006-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013800164500001900302520168700321592002802008650001502036650001502051650001202066650001502078650002002093650001102113650001702124650000702141650001502148650002302163650001902186653003602205653005702241653006702298653002102365653002502386653002402411653003002435700001502465700001602480773011502496856008202611852000902693655001202702IND60720672620221118014625.0210212e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072067262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scp.2020.1003502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaini, Jyoti10aCadmium removal from water by green synthesized nanobioadsorbent [SiO2@DOPP]: Mechanism, isotherms, kinetics and regeneration studies  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, dried orange peel powder [DOPP] is chemically modified with nanosilica (SiO₂) employing sonication technique to produce nanobioadsorbent [SiO₂@DOPP]. [SiO₂@DOPP] This nanoadsorbent was evaluated for Cd²⁺ removal from aqueous systems. Successful functionalization of [DOPP] into nanosilica was confirmed by various analytical techniques like XRD, FTIR, SEM, EDX, TEM, DLS, pHzₚc and TGA. XRD, FTIR and EDX confirmed the emergence of new peaks after modification of [DOPP] by nanosilica and adsorption of Cd²⁺ onto [SiO₂@DOPP]. Further, TGA spectrum suggested that [SiO₂@DOPP] nanoadsorbent is thermally more stable than [DOPP]. pH plays a major role to Cd²⁺ adsorption onto [SiO₂@DOPP]. The optimum conditions for Cd²⁺ removal include pH = 6.5 and 0.03g adsorbent dose with 100 min contact time. Different adsorption isotherms models [best fitted-(Langmuir adsorption model)], adsorption kinetics [best fitted–(Pseudo second order and Intraparticle diffusion)] were examined for the removal of Cd²⁺. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity [qₘₐₓ] was 142 mg/g. Thermodynamic evaluation indicates the endothermic and spontaneous nature of Cd²⁺ adsorption onto [SiO₂@DOPP]. Furthermore complexation mechanism of Cd²⁺ onto [SiO₂@DOPP] is discussed in detail. The results indicate involvement of functional group interactions, π–metal interactions, proton exchange, chelate complexes and electrostatic interactions during adsorption of Cd²⁺ onto [SiO₂@DOPP]. Based on the results it has been inferred that [SiO₂@DOPP] is a promising nanobioadsorbent to manage environment burden of Cd²⁺ from aqueous systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acadmium 3aendothermy 3agreen chemistry 3amodels 3aorange peels 3apH 3asonication 3asorption isotherms 3athermodynamics 0aDried orange peel powder [DOPP] 0aSilica modified dried orange peel powder [SiO2@DOPP] 0aCd2+ adsorbed modified dried orange peel powder [Cd@SiO2@DOPP] 0aNanobioadsorbent 0aAdsorption isotherms 0aAdsorption kinetics 0aChelate-complex mechanism1 aGarg, V.K.1 aGupta, R.K.0 tSustainable chemistry and pharmacy.g2021 Apr., v. 19 p.100350-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23279x2352-55417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scp.2020.1003503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008300164300001600247520100000263592002801263650001801291650002401309650002201333650001401355650001501369650001501384650002101399650001001420650002001430650001301450650001901463650002801482650001701510653001701527653001401544653003101558700001201589700001701601700001801618700001701636700001701653700007101670773011201741856008201853852000901935655001201944IND60674941620221120081836.0200522e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067494162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2019.10.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhan, Yaoyao10aMicroRNAs involved in innate immunity regulation in the sea cucumber: A review  ap. 297-304.  aThe sea cucumber is one of the most economically significant echinoderms. The immunity against exogenous stimulation of sea cucumber is of great academic and economic importance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short endogenous non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are considered as vital regulators of both innate and adaptive immune responses in most eukaryotes. In sea cucumbers, some miRNAs (such as miR-133, miR-137, and miR-2008, among others) that participate in the regulation of innate immunity have been recently identified and characterized. This review focuses on those known miRNAs and their corresponding target genes that participate in the regulation of the complement system, Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis pathways in sea cucumbers. Moreover, we cover immune-related miRNA investigations in sea cucumbers that provide insights into developing more miRNA-based biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for sea cucumber diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolothuroidea 3aToll-like receptors 3aadaptive immunity 3aapoptosis 3abiomarkers 3acomplement 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3ainnate immunity 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3areactive oxygen species 3atherapeutics 0aSea cucumber 0aMicroRNAs 0aInnate immunity regulation1 aLiu, Li1 aZhao, Tanjun1 aSun, Jingxian1 aCui, Dongyao1 aLi, Yingying1 aChzhan, I︠A︡t︠s︡in,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4508-54340 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 Dec., v. 95 p.297-304dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.10.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245013700211300001600348506007600364520090700440592002801347506003701375650001901412650001101431650001001442650002901452650001501481650001901496650001501515650001101530650001301541650001401554651002001568700002101588700002201609773009101631856008101722852000901803655001201812IND60158903820221207092507.0150530e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6015890382DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-015-0658-42doi7 aPMC44477012pmcid7 a260223222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarvey, E.

Inputs of DOC and CDOM are predicted to increase with climate change, affecting coastal ecosystems. We found that the relationships between DOC, CDOM, salinity, and Secchi depth all differed between the two coastal areas studied; the W Gulf of Bothnia with high terrestrial input and the NW Baltic Proper with relatively little terrestrial input. The CDOM:DOC ratio was higher in the Gulf of Bothnia, where CDOM had a greater influence on the Secchi depth, which is used as an indicator of eutrophication and hence important for Baltic Sea management. Based on the results of this study, we recommend regular CDOM measurements in monitoring programmes, to increase the value of concurrent Secchi depth measurements.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3acolor 3adissolved organic carbon 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3amonitoring 3arunoff 3asalinity 3aturbidity 3aGulf of Bothnia1 aKratzer, Susanne1 aAndersson, Agneta0 tAmbio.g2015 June, v. 44, no.

Consequently, a plethora of analytical methods has been developed to decipher microbial biomarkers for various diseases, cluster different ecosystems based on microbial content, and infer functional potential of the microbiome as well as analyze its temporal behavior. Development of user-friendly visualization methods and frameworks is necessary to analyze this data and infer taxonomic and functional patterns corresponding to a phenotype. Thus, new methods as well as application of pre-existing ones has gained importance in recent times pertaining to the huge volume of the generated microbiome data.

Several separation methods were employed to obtain maximum potato starch recovery from the industrial wastewater. Centrifugation was proved to be the most effective means of separation. Following potato starch recovery, a variety of chemical and physico-chemical properties were investigated. Potato starch quality and consistency were assessed and monitored across a 1Â year period, between 2007 and 2008. Based on the various starch characteristics that were obtained, it was established that the recovered potato starch was of a high quality and is therefore suitable for subsequent processing, without the need of performing any pre-treatment. Properties including total starch, damaged starch, protein, lipid and amylose content, as well as gelatinisation and retrogradation, were evaluated and a high level of consistency throughout the course of 1Â year was recorded.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3acentrifugation 3agelatinization 3aphysicochemical properties 3apotato starch 3apotatoes 3apretreatment 3aretrogradation 3awastewater1 aShuttleworth, P.

In our methodology, MP samples added with EW, XO, or XO/EW mixture (1%, v/v) are prepared, and after multiple FT cycles, the XO or XO/EW-treated samples show significant (p < 0.05) inhibition on the decrease of sulfhydryl content and the increase of carbonyl content of MP. Compared with EW, XO or XO/EW could delay the increase of surface hydrophobicity and the decline of secondary and tertiary structural properties of MP, indicating that XO or XO/EW could more effectively increase the stability of MP conformation. Meanwhile, XO/EW could more effectively reduce the decrease of gel strength and gel water holding capacity, and the increase in the T₂ relaxation time of MP gel, confirming that XO/EW could substantially improve the MP gel-forming ability. Analysis of intermolecular interaction force proves that, compared with EW, XO/EW could reduce the content decrease of ionic and hydrogen bonds in MP gel. Overall, XO/EW could improve the stability of MP functional properties over multiple FT cycles. This study provides a new perspective for the potential commercial application of EW as a low-calorie cryoprotectant in aquatic products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulter alburnus 3acryoprotectants 3aegg albumen 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3agel strength 3agels 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3axylooligosaccharides1 aXiong, Zhouyi 1 aWalayat, Noman 1 aLorenzo, José M.,1 aNawaz, Asad 1 aXiong, Hanguo 0 tFoods.g2021 Aug. 26, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods100920073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008100164300001400245520152300259592002801782650002501810650002901835650001201864650003901876650001801915650001001933650001901943650001201962650002101974650001201995650004302007650001402050650001302064650002302077650001302100653002502113653001202138653003402150653001602184653002402200700002202224700006002246700002302306700001902329700001902348700006202367700005902429773010402488856008402592852000902676655001202685IND60591412020221118140459.0180319e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059141202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2018.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe, Arpan10aAntidiabetic “gliptins” affect biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans  ap. 79-85.  aStreptococcus mutans, a dental caries causing odontopathogen, produces X-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase (Sm-XPDAP, encoded by pepX), a serine protease known to have a nutritional role. Considering the potential of proteases as therapeutic targets in pathogens, this study was primarily aimed at investigating the role of Sm-XPDAP in contributing to virulence-related traits. Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP IV), an XPDAP analogous enzyme found in mammalian tissues,is a well known therapeutic target in Type II diabetes. Based on the hypothesis that gliptins, commonly used as anti-human-DPP IV drugs, may affect bacterial growth upon inhibition of Sm-XPDAP, we have determined their ex vivo antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity towards S. mutans. All three DPP IV drugs tested reduced biofilm formation as determined by crystal violet staining. To link the observed biofilm inhibition to the human-DPP IV analogue present in S. mutans UA159, a pepX isogenic mutant was generated. In addition to reduced biofilm formation, CLSM studies of the biofilm formed by the pepX isogenic mutant showed these were comparable to those formed in the presence of saxagliptin, suggesting a probable role of this enzyme in biofilm formation by S. mutans UA159. The effects of both pepX deletion and DPP IV drugs on the proteome were studied using LC–MS/MS. Overall, this study highlights the potential of Sm-XPDAP as a novel anti-biofilm target and suggests a template molecule to synthesize lead compounds effective against this enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiofilm 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adental caries 3adrugs 3agentian violet 3amammals 3amicrobial growth 3amutants 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apathogens 3aproteome 3aserine proteinases 3astaining 0aStreptococcus mutans 0aBiofilm 0aX-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase 0aSaxagliptin 0aShot-gun proteomics1 aPompilio, Arianna1 aFrancis, Jenifer1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4928-04991 aSutcliffe, Iain C.1 aBlack, Gary W.1 aLupidi, Giulio1 aPetrelli, Dezemona1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5210-48941 aVitali, Luca A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3367-60880 tMicrobiological research.g2018 Apr., v. 209 p.79-85dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2018.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245012000209500001900329520135800348592002801706650002501734650002001759650001201779650002601791650001201817651001001829653003401839653002501873653003201898653001301930653003601943700002101979700002302000773011502023856008202138852000902220655001202229IND60720672820221118014642.0210212e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072067282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scp.2020.1003552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalabrò, Paolo S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2153-945710aHow does separate collection efficiency influence biological stability of commingled Italian municipal solid waste?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aItaly developed over the last two decades a fairly efficient separate collection system but still about 30% of municipal solid waste (MSW) collected is destined to landfilling. Italian Regulation adopts the Dynamic Respirometric index (DRI) as the key parameter for evaluating the waste biological stability of MSW prior to landfilling. On the basis of a recent literature survey, this paper aims at evaluating how much DRI (used as aerobic waste stability index) and the biochemical methane potential (used as anaerobic waste stability index) of commingled (mixed) waste, respectively before and after a simulated biological treatment, are influenced by separate collection. Experimental data confirm that enhanced separate collection results in a reduction of the putrescible content of commingled waste. However, the reduction of DRI due to separate collection only (about 20%) is insufficient to approve direct landfilling without any biological pretreatment since the required standard is not achieved, while its implementation decreases efficiently both indices in the order of 50–75%. It is also delineated that only the joint use of an aerobic and an anaerobic index gives complete and reliable information on commingled waste stability, which optimizes the treatment of municipal waste for increasing the overall sustainability of the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological treatment 3agreen chemistry 3amethane 3amunicipal solid waste 3asurveys 3aItaly 0aBiochemical methane potential 0aBiological stability 0aDynamic respirometric index 0aLandfill 0aMechanical biological treatment1 aFazzino, Filippo1 aPangallo, Domenica0 tSustainable chemistry and pharmacy.g2021 Apr., v. 19 p.100355-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23279x2352-55417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scp.2020.1003553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245014600165300002000311520149200331592002801823650002401851650002701875650001801902650002401920650002901944650001601973650001901989650002202008650001302030650002002043650001502063650001002078650002602088650002202114650001602136650002402152700001902176700002202195700002302217700002302240773012702263856007502390852000902465655001202474IND60534811820170606000000.0160803e20131217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053481182DNAL7 a10.1021/es403470s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aČvančarová, Monika10aBiotransformation of the Antibiotic Agent Flumequine by Ligninolytic Fungi and Residual Antibacterial Activity of the Transformation Mixtures  ap. 14128-14136.  aFlumequine, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, is applied preferably in veterinary medicine, for stock breeding and treatment of aquacultures. Formation of drug resistance is a matter of general concern when antibiotics such as flumquine occur in the environment. Thus, biodegradation of flumequine in solution was investigated using five different ligninolytic fungi. Irpex lacteus, Dichomitus squalens, and Trametes versicolor proved most efficient and transformed more than 90% of flumequine within 6 or even 3 days. Panus tigrinus and Pleurotus ostreatus required up to 14 days to remove >90% of flumequine. Analyses of the metabolites by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry suggest different transformation pathways for the different fungal strains. Structure proposals were elaborated for 8 metabolites. 7-Hydroxy-flumequine and flumequine ethyl ester were identified as common metabolites produced by all ligninolytic fungi. The largest variety of metabolites was formed by D. squalens. Residual antibacterial activity of the metabolite mixtures was tested using gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. While for the less efficient P. tigrinus and P. ostreatus cultures the antibacterial activities corresponded to the residual concentrations of flumequine, a remarkable antibacterial activity remained in the D. squalens cultures although flumequine was transformed to more than 90%. Obviously, antibacterially active transformation products were formed by this fungal strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aIrpex lacteus 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3abiodegradation 3abiotransformation 3abreeding 3adrug resistance 3aflumequine 3afungi 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3aveterinary medicine1 aMoeder, Monika1 aFilipová, Alena,1 aReemtsma, Thorsten1 aCajthaml, Tomáš,0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 Dec. 17, v. 47, no. 24 p.14128-14136dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes403470s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245013500204500001900339520171700358592002802075650002402103650001702127650001202144650002002156650001302176650001802189650001602207650001102223650003302234650001302267653002402280653001602304653002602320700002102346700002302367700002202390700001902412773011502431856008202546852000902628655001202637IND60720672920221118014702.0210212e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072067292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scp.2020.1003562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŞahin, Selin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9989-982310aEnhanced extraction of high added-value products from Hibiscus sabdariffa using automatic solvent extractor: Kinetics and modeling  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHibiscus sabdariffa was extracted by means of automatic solvent extraction, which is a perfect alternative in terms of Green Chemistry. Therefore, ethanol and water solution was selected as the solvent system when considering the principles (price, safety and convenience for health) of Green Chemistry. The process parameters of the extraction system was selected as ethanol concentration (10–80%), washing time for the extraction (40–60 min) and particle size of the solid Hibiscus sabdariffa sample (0.5–2 mm). Total polyphenols and anthocyanins were the response (measured) variables for the optimization of the automatic solvent extraction system by application of Face Centered Central Composite Design of Response Surface Method. The best findings for the total polyphenols and anthocyanins were 164.695 mg-GAE/g-dried plant and 28.349 mg-C3G/g-dried plant under the optimal conditions of the process (80% ethanol concentration, 60 min of washing time and 0.5 mm of particle size of the solid material). The most effective parameter was found as the solvent concentration followed by paticle size (P < 0.0001) for the recovery of total polyphenols, whereas the most significant process variable for the anthocyanins recovery was particle size, followed by ethanol concentration and washing time (P < 0.0001). Modeling of the kinetic data was performed by the second-order kinetic model and film theory. Effective diffusivities of total polyphenols and anthocyanins were calculated as 2.5 and 1.97 × 10⁻¹⁰ m² s⁻¹ on the basis of kinetic evaluation. Additionally, the functional groups of the bioactive substances were also monitored by Fourier Transformed Infrared spectrometer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHibiscus sabdariffa 3aanthocyanins 3aethanol 3agreen chemistry 3akinetics 3aparticle size 3apolyphenols 3aprices 3aresponse surface methodology 3asolvents 0aBioactive compounds 0aFilm theory 0aEffective diffusivity1 aKurtulbaş, Ebru1 aPekel, Ayşe Gizem1 aToprakçı, İrem1 aBilgin, Mehmet0 tSustainable chemistry and pharmacy.g2021 Apr., v. 19 p.100356-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23279x2352-55417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scp.2020.1003563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008600168300001800254500001900272520150900291592002801800650001201828650001101840650002801851650001601879650001101895650002701906650001201933650001601945650001301961650001401974650002201988650001102010651001102021700002002032700002002052700005602072773012602128856008202254852000902336655001202345IND60701166920221121134036.0200707e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070116692DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-019-00721-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndreão, P.

Around 80% of Brazil’s biomass electricity is generated from sugarcane bagasse. However, the process of generating energy from bagasse using calcination leads to a by-product residue, sugarcane bagasse ash (SCBA), which requires disposal. A simple beneficiation protocol for sugarcane bagasse ash (SCBA) consisting of adequate calcination, grinding and density separation was explored in this study. SCBA was collected from industrial boilers in Brazil and treated to produce three different ashes, including the original untreated ash and two ashes collected from the top and bottom of a water-washing density separation process. Portland cement pastes incorporating 20% SCBA partial replacement for cement were made. Upon controlled burning and grinding, electrical conductivity and Chapelle tests indicated that SCBA had significant pozzolanic activity, with the top separated ash yielding best results. Mercury intrusion porosimetry showed that SCBA cement pastes had more refined porosity compared to that of the control paste. Fine SCBA particles ensured heterogeneous nucleation and promoted pore size refinement. Inductive coupled plasma testing indicated low levels of heavy metals leaching. Results demonstrate that SCBA can be beneficiated to provide an effective pozzolanic material, without harmful leachates released to the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acement 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3agross domestic product 3amercury 3aporosimetry 3aporosity 3asugarcane 3asugarcane bagasse 3awastes 3aBrazil1 aSuleiman, A.

Differences in medical and health insurance systems, as well as in regional policies incommoded the comparison of the spread and decay in different cities and countries. The spread and decay durations in the cities of the four studied countries were reordered and calculated based on an asymmetric bell-shaped model. We acquired the values of the ambient temperature, absolute humidity, and population density to perform multivariable analysis. We found a significant correlation (p < 0.05) of the spread and decay durations with population density in the four analyzed countries. Specifically, spread duration showed a high correlation with population density and absolute humidity (p < 0.05), whereas decay duration demonstrated the highest correlation with population density, absolute humidity, and maximum temperature (p < 0.05). The effect of population density was almost nonexistent in China because of the implemented strict lockdown. Our findings will be useful in policy setting and governmental actions in the next pandemic, as well as in the next waves of COVID-19.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aJapan 3aabsolute humidity 3aambient temperature 3acomparative study 3ahealth insurance 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apandemic 3apopulation density 3aChina 3aEngland 3aGermany 0aCOVID-19 0aTemperature 0aMultivariable analysis1 aKodera, Sachiko1 aAnzai, Daisuke1 aGomez-Tames, Jose1 aRashed, Essam A.1 aHirata, Akimasa0 tOne health.g2021 June, v. 12 p.100203-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23485x2352-77147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.1002033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03384naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245016300172300001600335520169200351592002802043650002302071650001602094650001802110650001902128650001502147650002402162650002202186650002202208650001102230650002002241650001402261650002302275650001302298650001102311650000902322653002202331653002002353653001102373653001202384653002302396653002302419700002902442700002202471700002302493700001602516700002502532700001702557700002002574700001902594773011202613856008402725852000902809655001202818IND60291409320221120162846.0150701e20150703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6029140932DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2014.9631042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Soto, M.A.10aEffects of a combining feed grade urea and a slow-release product on performance, dietary energetics and carcass characteristics of steers fed finishing diets  ap. 303-308.  aRecent findings have shown that microbial nitrogen flow and digestible energy of diet are increased when urea (U) is combined with a slow-release urea product (SRU) in diets with a starch:acid detergent fibre (S:ADF) ratio of 4.5, while feed grade U has shown greater effects on growth performance or dietary energy utilization when the diet contains a S:ADF ratio of greater than 5.0. These results can be partially explained by the better synchronization of ruminal degradation rates between those U sources with the carbohydrates of the diets. Therefore, 60 crossbreed steers (372.4 ± 15 kg) were used to evaluate the effects of combining U and SRU in a diet with a S:ADF ratio of 4.5 vs. U that was supplemented in diets with different S:ADF ratios (3.5, 4.5 and 5.5) on growth performance, dietary energetics and carcass characteristics. U combination did not affect average daily gain (ADG), but reduced dry matter intake [DMI, as % of body weight (BW)] enough to increase feed efficiency (G:F) and dietary net energy (NE). As the S:ADF ratio increased, the DMI, ADG, G:F and NE of diet increased linearly. Irrespective of the S:ADF ratio, U diets did not modify neither the observed-to-expected NE ratio nor the apparent retention per unit DMI, while U combination increased by 7.2% and 8.4%, respectively, the observed-to-expected dietary ratio and the apparent retention per unit DMI. U combination had no effect on carcass characteristics. As the S:ADF ratio increased, carcass weight and LM area were increased linearly. Combining feed grade U and SRU in diets with a 4.5 starch:fibre ratio resulted in positive effects on the efficiency of utilization of dietary energetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3acarbohydrates 3acarcass weight 3adetergents 3adietary supplements 3adigestible energy 3adry matter intake 3aenergy 3afeed conversion 3afinishing 3agrowth performance 3anitrogen 3asteers 3aurea 0aslow-release urea 0afinishing diets 0asteers 0aOptigen 0adietary energetics 0agrowth performance1 aAguilar-Hernández, J.A.1 aDávila-Ramos, H.1 aEstrada-Angulo, A.1 aRíos, F.G.1 aUrías-Estrada, J.D.1 aBarreras, A.1 aCalderón, J.F.1 aPlascencia, A.0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2015 July 3, v. 43, no. 3 p.303-308dTaylor & Francisx0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2014.9631043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245016000212300001200372520157600384592002801960596007301988650002202061650002002083650000902103650001702112650002002129650001402149650002602163650001402189650001602203650002302219650001902242650002102261650001002282650001902292650002402311650001602335650001902351700002202370700002402392773010802416856008202524852000902606655001202615IND60608226020221116151636.0180904e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060822602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-018-2227-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández, Fernando,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5158-202910aHeat stress effects on reproductive traits in cultivated and wild sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.): evidence for local adaptation within the wild germplasm  ap. 146.  aHeat stress (HS) is a major threat to current and future crop production. Crop improvement for HS tolerance is a major tool for dealing with HS and crop wild relatives (CWR) offer the greatest variability for such improvement. Here, we evaluated the HS tolerance on four reproductive traits in cultivated and wild sunflower and tested for local adaptation to HS within the wild germplasm. Three cultivars and 23 wild populations (from native and invasive ranges) were grown in field experiments for 2 years. Flowering heads were covered with white (control) and black (HS) paper bags during seven consecutive days. Additionally, biogeographic tools were used to test for local adaptation. HS increased air temperature on black bags compared to the white ones by 9.4 °C on average and strongly decreased seed number and yield with smaller effects on head diameter and seed weight. We found large variability for HS tolerance, mainly in seed number and yield. The invasive group outperformed the cultivated and native groups in both years. Biogeographic analysis reveals a clinal variation in HS tolerance, populations from wetter (but not from warmer) environments were more tolerant to HS. In addition, the positive correlation observed between reproductive traits under control conditions and HS tolerance helps to explain the better performance of the invasive populations. We proposed the use of invasive populations for future sunflower improvements in HS tolerance and the adoption of biogeographic tools in another CWR species to identify HS tolerant populations.  aPublisher supplied data  a2012-2854cAgencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica 3aHelianthus annuus 3aair temperature 3abags 3abiogeography 3acrop production 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3agermplasm 3aheat stress 3aindigenous species 3ainflorescences 3ainvasive species 3apaper 3aplant breeding 3areproductive traits 3aseed weight 3awild relatives1 aPoverene, Mónica1 aPresotto, Alejandro0 tEuphytica.g2018 Aug., v. 214, no. 8 p.146-146dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-018-2227-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100005800162245005600220300001600276520097800292592002801270650002501298650002301323650002101346650001101367650000901378650001401387650001701401650005301418650001201471650003101483650003601514650003601550650002601586650001101612650003601623650001401659650002001673773014401693852000901837856008001846655001201926IND2207065420221118202530.0200421e19990101enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220706542DNAL7 a107195752pmid7 a10.1080/0963748991011752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCervato, Roberta Cazzola, Benvenuto Cestaro, Giovanna10aStudies on the antioxidant activity of milk caseins  ap. 291-296.  aThe antioxidant properties of milk casein subunits (alpha-casein, beta-casein and kappa-casein) were evaluated in liposomal models. All the subunits of casein are able to inhibit Feinduced peroxidation of arachidonic acid inserted into multilamellar liposomes of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (0.2mM and 0.8mM, respectively). The peroxidation was monitored as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and the strongest inhibitory effect occurred when 500 mug of alpha-casein were added to 0.5ml of liposomal suspension. At this concentration, peroxidation was completely inhibited in our experimental conditions (incubation for 2h at room temperature, with a mixture of ferrous sulfate and ascorbate, 50 and 500muM final concentration, respectively). The mechanisms of antioxidant action are complex, but the strongest effect is achieved by modifying the Fe2+/Fe3+ equilibrium; in fact, caseins seem to favour the autoxidation of iron, and thus inhibit lipid peroxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphosphatidylcholines 3alipid peroxidation 3aarachidonic acid 3acasein 3amilk 3aoxidation 3aantioxidants 2a1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholinexpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aArachidonic Acidsxpharmacology 2aAscorbate Oxidasexpharmacology 2aCaseinsxpharmacology 2aCattle 2aFerrous Compoundsxpharmacology 2aLiposomes 2aMilkxchemistry0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g1999 Jan. 1, v. 50, no. 4 p.291-296dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0963748991011753Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02502naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245013500171520111600306592002801422650002101450650001101471650002401482650002201506650001301528650002301541650001601564650002601580650002501606650002201631650001101653653004901664653001301713653001901726653002901745653003401774700002001808700001801828700002001846773010601866856008701972852000902059655001202068IND60733410020221123043700.0211015e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073341002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1251002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Hyun-Jin10aEffect of microbial community structure in inoculum on the stimulation of direct interspecies electron transfer for methanogenesis  aTo investigate how the seed microbial community structure affects the improvement of methanogenesis efficiency through direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET), a biomethane potential (BMP) test was conducted using sludge collected from a total of six anaerobic digesters. DIET-stimulating microbial populations were investigated by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Correlations between microbial community composition and methane production performance by DIET were analyzed. The methane production rate increased under all conditions when granular activated carbon (GAC) was injected regardless of the inoculum type. However, redundancy analysis indicated a significant correlation between the inoculum microbial community and lag time. In a network analysis, Methanolinea species distributed in the inocula formed a single modularity with lag time, suggesting that the methanogens in the inocula might reduce the lag time of methanogenesis through DIET. Overall, this study revealed that the inoculum microbial community composition is an important factor affecting methane production efficiency by DIET.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3abiogas 3acommunity structure 3aelectron transfer 3ainoculum 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence analysis 3asludge 0aDirect interspecies electron transfer (DIET) 0aInoculum 0aMethanogenesis 0aMethanogenic performance 0aMicrobial community structure1 aLee, Sang-hoon,1 aLim, Tae-Guen1 aPark, Hee-Deung0 tBioresource technology.g2021 July, v. 332 p.125100-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1251003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011300166300001600279520142600295592002801721650002101749650001901770650002301789650002001812650003901832650001601871650002001887650001001907650001601917650001101933650002001944650001201964650002101976650001301997650001402010650002002024650001502044653002002059653002602079653002402105653003202129700001902161700002102180700001602201700002002217700002002237700002002257700001902277700002002296700002002316773012102336856008202457852000902539655001202548IND60528639720221119003538.0160716e20160212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052863972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.01.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSato, Chisato10aFibroblast growth factor-23 induces cellular senescence in human mesenchymal stem cells from skeletal muscle  ap. 657-662.  aAlthough muscle wasting and/or degeneration are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease, it remains unknown whether FGF-23 influences muscle homeostasis and regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in skeletal muscle are distinct from satellite cells and have a known association with muscle degeneration. In this study we sought to investigate the effects of FGF-23 on MSCs isolated from human skeletal muscle in vitro. The MSCs expressed FGF receptors (1 through 4) and angiotensin-II type 1 receptor, but no traces of the Klotho gene were detected. MSCs and satellite cells were treated with FGF-23 and angiotensin-II for 48 h. Treatment with FGF-23 significantly decreased the number of MSCs compared to controls, while treatment with angiotensin-II did not. FGF-23 and angiotensin-II both left the cell counts of the satellite cells unchanged. The FGF-23-treated MSCs exhibited the senescent phenotype, as judged by senescence-associated β-galactosidase assay, cell morphology, and increased expression of p53 and p21 in western blot analysis. FGF-23 also significantly altered the gene expression of oxidative stress regulators in the cells. In conclusion, FGF-23 induced premature senescence in MSCs from skeletal muscle via the p53/p21/oxidative-stress pathway. The interaction between the MSCs and FGF-23 may play a key role in the impaired muscle reparative mechanisms of chronic kidney disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aangiotensin II 3abeta-galactosidase 3acell senescence 3afibroblast growth factor receptors 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3akidney diseases 3amuscles 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3aphenotype 3askeletal muscle 3astem cells 0aSkeletal muscle 0aMesenchymal stem cell 0aCellular senescence 0aFibroblast growth factor-231 aIso, Yoshitaka1 aMizukami, Takuya1 aOtabe, Koji1 aSasai, Masahiro1 aKurata, Masaaki1 aSanbe, Takeyuki1 aSekiya, Ichiro1 aMiyazaki, Akira1 aSuzuki, Hiroshi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Feb. 12, v. 470 p.657-662dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.01.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011500169300001600284520140700300592002801707650001201735650002701747650002601774650001501800650001701815650001501832650001101847650001101858650001501869650001601884650001801900650002101918650001601939650001701955700001601972700001501988773010702003856008202110852000902192655001202201IND60654044920221118012838.0190722e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065404492DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-019-00859-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChien, Wen-Chieh10aAppropriate management practices help enhance odonate species richness of small ponds in peri-urban landscapes  ap. 757-768.  aAdult odonate biodiversity was investigated to understand their relationship with pond management practices and environmental conditions in a rapidly urbanized landscape. Twenty-four farm ponds in Taoyuan City were selected and classified into five pond groups based on pond management practices. In total, 21 species, 17 genera, and 6 families of odonates were recorded for a total of 5701 individuals between June 2014 and July 2015. The abundance of Odonata was unrelated to pond size or distance to the nearest pond; however, odonate species richness was negatively and significantly correlated with pond size. Pond management practices considerably affected pond aquatic macrophytes and dike construction materials. Ecology park ponds under intense human management and undisturbed ponds without any human management had higher species richness than did the ponds in the other three fish farming groups. Species richness was highest in small and human-modified ponds. By contrast, species richness was lowest in two fish farming pond groups. These results suggest that pond management practices can increase or reduce odonate species richness depending on the alteration of pond microhabitat features. Our observations suggest that the enhanced habitat quality of small ponds provides an opportunity to protect freshwater biodiversity for local governmental civil servants in urbanized landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdonata 3aconstruction materials 3aenvironmental factors 3afarm ponds 3afish culture 3afreshwater 3ahumans 3aimagos 3alandscapes 3amacrophytes 3amicrohabitats 3aspecies richness 3aurban areas 3aurbanization1 aLi, Mei-Hui1 aLi, Xinru,0 tUrban ecosystems.g2019 Aug., v. 22, no. 4 p.757-768dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870259x1083-81557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-019-00859-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011600164300001800280520168600298592002801984650001102012650001302023650002202036650002402058650000902082650001202091650001802103650001902121650001202140650002102152650001902173650001302192773010302205856007902308852000902387655001202396IND60425811220221121002527.0151011e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6042581122DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.123972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Adam G.10abatemanater: a computer program to estimate and bootstrap mating system variables based on Bateman's principles  ap. 1396-1402.  aBateman's principles continue to play a major role in the characterization of genetic mating systems in natural populations. The modern manifestations of Bateman's ideas include the opportunity for sexual selection (i.e. Iₛ – the variance in relative mating success), the opportunity for selection (i.e. I – the variance in relative reproductive success) and the Bateman gradient (i.e. βₛₛ – the slope of the least‐squares regression of reproductive success on mating success). These variables serve as the foundation for one convenient approach for the quantification of mating systems. However, their estimation presents at least two challenges, which I address here with a new Windows‐based computer software package called batemanater. The first challenge is that confidence intervals for these variables are not easy to calculate. batemanater solves this problem using a bootstrapping approach. The second, more serious, problem is that direct estimates of mating system variables from open populations will typically be biased if some potential progeny or adults are missing from the analysed sample. batemanater addresses this problem using a maximum‐likelihood approach to estimate mating system variables from incompletely sampled breeding populations. The current version of batemanater addresses the problem for systems in which progeny can be collected in groups of half‐ or full‐siblings, as would occur when eggs are laid in discrete masses or offspring occur in pregnant females. batemanater has a user‐friendly graphical interface and thus represents a new, convenient tool for the characterization and comparison of genetic mating systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abreeding 3acomputer software 3aconfidence interval 3aeggs 3afemales 3aleast squares 3amating systems 3aprogeny 3asexual selection 3auser interface 3avariance0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2015 Nov., v. 15, no. 6 p.1396-1402dBlackwell Pub.x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.123973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01783naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008400168300001600252520081600268592002801084650001601112650001201128650001301140650002201153650001601175650001901191650001001210700001701220700001801237773011101255856008201366852000901448655001201457IND60617076420221120171825.0181023e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061707642DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517592062011022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEricksen, R.

In these experiments, the loading is stopped at a given level and a portion of the fabric is encapsulated. The fabric is then unloaded, sectioned, and photographed. Measurements on the photographs reveal the changes in weave geometry and yarn cross section with loading. The initial geometrical data are used in a large deformation mechanical model, which couples yarn bending and stretching effects to predict theoretical displacement-force relations for the fabric. Experimental and theoretical deflection-force curves are in good agreement; they show that during initial loading the response is dominated by yarn bending, while for large loads the response is dominated by yarn stretching.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3afabrics 3ageometry 3amechanical models 3aphotographs 3atextile fibers 3ayarns1 aDavis, A.

In order to analyze the key factors affecting a city’s water resilience, this research establishes an urban water resilience evaluation model. The DEMATEL method is used to calculate the intensity of the interaction among the water resilience indicators and to establish their causal relationships. Then, an ANP structured diagram is established and the weighting of the water resilience evaluation index for the city of Wuhan is obtained using the Super Decisions software. The key water resilience factors for Wuhan are shown to have significant mutual influences, with the main factors found to be the utilization of rainwater resources, the utilization of reclaimed water, and the total annual runoff control of the city. This method provides a sound basis for the evaluation of urban water resilience with scope to extend this to other cities. The results provide useful guidance for policy makers and other key stakeholders in supporting more sustainable urban development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acomputer software 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3arain 3arunoff 3astakeholders 3aurban development 3awastewater treatment 3awater management1 aKong, Yuli 1 aProverbs, David 1 aZhang, Yuwan 1 aZhang, Yuan 1 aXu, Jitao 0 tWater.g2022 June 16, v. 14, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141219423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01877naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012100154300001800275520080800293592002801101650001101129650001901140650001001159650001601169650001401185650000901199650001701208650001801225650001301243700002001256700001601276700001901292773012101311856007401432852000901506655001201515IND60618160920221122140254.0181029e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061816092DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra11804j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Min10aLuminescent metal clusters/barium sulfate composites for white light-emitting devices and anti-counterfeiting labels  ap. 2866-2871.  aThe applications of luminescent metal nanoclusters (NCs) in device fabrication have been greatly limited by their tough solidifying process and poor stability.

The state-of-the-art setup constructed with LEDs as UV light sources that illuminate through optical fibers directly into an NMR testing tube at a fixed wavelength of 365 nm is appropriate for various polymeric materials and biologically active substances. The selected experimental protocol uses a series of periods of irradiation and dark periods, thus providing opportunities to conduct an effective thiol–ene “click” reaction and simultaneously study the kinetics of the photochemical reaction with the exposure time, as well as macromolecular association directly in a solution applying the whole types of NMR methods: from conventional ¹H or ¹³C NMR to diffusion NMR spectroscopy (DOSY). In addition, the molecular mass characteristics of the prepared copolymers were studied by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). The observed differences in the reaction rates as well as in the size of species formed (the corresponding hydrodynamic radiuses Rₕ of aggregates) as a result of the coupling process of parent PAGE prepolymers and model PEG thiols were thoroughly discussed and the reaction pathway proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acomposite polymers 3agel chromatography 3ahydrodynamics 3airradiation 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3amonitoring 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoptical fibers 3aphotochemical reactions 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolyethylene glycol 3astable isotopes 3athiols 3aultraviolet radiation 3awavelengths1 aDangalov, Miroslav1 aVassilev, Nikolay G.1 aNovakov, Christo P.0 tRSC advances.g2020 July 02, v. 10, no. 42 p.25214-25222dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra03902k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02122naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008600161300001600247500001900263500002000282520089700302592002801199596006201227596006601289650002701355650000901382650001401391650001401405650002401419650000901443651001301452700001801465700002501483700002201508773012301530856007401653852000901727655001201736IND60709177020221118041328.0200903e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070917702DNAL7 a10.1111/agec.125892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagnan, Nicholas10aHusbands’ and wives’ risk preferences and improved maize adoption in Tanzania  ap. 743-758.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResearch on technology adoption typically assumes that the preferences of a single individual—the household head—determine household‐level decisions. This study uses experimentally derived prospect theory‐based risk preferences from couples in Tanzania to test whether men's and women's risk preferences, which often diverge, influence the adoption of improved maize varieties. We find that women's risk aversion and men's loss aversion are negatively correlated with improved variety use. The tendency of men to overweight small probabilities is negatively associated with adoption, whereas the tendency of women to do so is positively associated. These findings suggest that technology adoption research should look beyond the preferences of the household head, and that technology promoters should consider targeting both men and women in their education and dissemination efforts.  aPublisher supplied data  cAustralian Center for International Agricultural Research  cCGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets 3aagricultural economics 3acorn 3acultivars 3aeducation 3ainnovation adoption 3arisk 3aTanzania1 aLove, Abby M.1 aMishili, Fulgence J.1 aSheremenko, Ganna0 tAgricultural economics.g2020 Sept., v. 51, no. 5 p.743-758dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41636x0169-51507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/agec.125893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012500165300001600290500001500306520120900321592002801530650001101558650002101569650002201590650001501612650002501627650003301652650001501685650000701700650001301707650001601720650001501736650001201751650001901763650001501782653000901797700001801806700001801824773009701842856008101939990002302020852000902043655001202052IND60093267920221120205833.0141103e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009326792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.03.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAghayean, H.,10aSamarium and dysprosium removal using 11-molybdo-vanadophosphoric acid supported on Zr modified mesoporous silica SBA-15  ap. 509-519.  a2019-12-06  aSynthesis of 11-molybdo-vanadophosphoric acid supported on Zr modified mesoporous silica SBA-15 has been carried out to develop new and efficient composite adsorbent of samarium and dysprosium metal ions in aqueous solution. The preparation was performed using two stages. Initially, the surface of mesoporous silica was modified with Zr ions in ethanol solution and then heteropoly acid was encapsulated using aqueous incipient wetness onto pores of mesoporous silica. The obtained products were characterized by inductively coupled plasma (ICP), XRD, N₂ adsorption–desorption isotherms, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), zeta potential analyzer and FT-IR. In order to examine adsorption behavior of this compound for samarium and dysprosium removal in aqueous solutions, the effect of pH, contact time, concentration of metal ions and temperature were investigated under batch system conditions. The results suggest that this methodology provides the general synthesis of supported heteropolymetalate with large surface areas, and ordered nanoporous structures that can be used as an adsorbent for efficient removal of lanthanide metal ions from aqueous solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3asilica 3athermogravimetry 3aaqueous solutions 3adysprosium 3achemical engineering 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aadsorbents 3apH 3asamarium 3atemperature 3ametal ions 3aethanol 3azeta potential 3aadsorption 0aions1 aMahjoub, A.R.1 aKhanchi, A.R.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 June 1, v. 225 p.509-519dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.03.0923Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011300165300001600278500001500294520175000309592002802059650002302087650001902110650001702129650002502146650001802171650002302189650002102212650001202233650001902245650001102264650001902275650001502294650001202309650002002321650001302341650002102354650002102375651001802396653001502414700002702429700002002456700001902476700002402495700002302519700001802542773012202560856008102682852000902763655001202772IND60575616020221120034158.0170728e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057561602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-016-1014-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoury, Zineb10aQuarantining the Sahara desert: growth and water-use efficiency of Aleppo pine in the Algerian Green Barrier  ap. 139-152.  a2019-12-06  aThe Algerian Green Barrier, mainly composed of native and artificial Aleppo pine forests, spreads along the pre-Saharan steppes and is threatened by anthropogenic and natural disturbances, including climate change. We hypothesized that the ecophysiological functioning of this conifer has been substantially modified in reaction to recent warming and drought much beyond the expected effect of CO₂ fertilization. Our aim was to characterize the long-term performance (1925–2013) of native Aleppo pines thriving at their southernmost distribution. We used tree-ring width (TRW) and carbon isotope discrimination (Δ¹³C) to characterize basal area increment (BAI) and intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi) at three sites. BAI remained stable or slightly increased over time, with mean values ranging between 4.0 and 6.3 cm² year⁻¹. Conversely, site-Δ¹³C decreased from −0.022 to −0.014‰ year⁻¹ along time, which translated into WUEi increases of ca. 39%. This strong physiological reaction indicated that pines were responding simultaneously to rising CO₂ and drier conditions, inducing a progressively tighter stomatal control of water losses. However, WUEi increments were essentially unrelated to BAI and did not affect carbon reserves, which suggests a high resilience to climate change. This finding could be due to shifts in growing season towards earlier months in winter–spring, as suggested by temporal changes in climate factors underlying Δ¹³C and TRW. Our study highlights the substantial plasticity of Aleppo pine, but this species is unlikely to follow a similar pace of ecophysiological adjustments according to unprecedented low Δ¹³C records and lack of WUEi stimulation observed from 2000 onwards.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemporal variation 3acarbon dioxide 3agrowth rings 3awater use efficiency 3aecophysiology 3aconiferous forests 3aPinus halepensis 3adrought 3aclimate change 3acarbon 3agrowing season 3aplasticity 3asteppes 3astable isotopes 3aconifers 3astand basal area 3aclimatic factors 3aSahara Desert 0abasal area1 aShestakova, Tatiana A.1 aHimrane, Hocine1 aTouchan, Ramzi1 aKherchouche, Dalila1 aCamarero, J.

However, the resulting hyperspectral images (HSIs) come at the cost of increased storage requirements, increased computational time to process, and highly redundant data. Thus, dimensionality reduction techniques are necessary to decrease the number of spectral bands while retaining the most useful information. Our contribution is two-fold: First, we propose a filter-based method called interband redundancy analysis (IBRA) based on a collinearity analysis between a band and its neighbors. This analysis helps to remove redundant bands and dramatically reduces the search space. Second, we apply a wrapper-based approach called greedy spectral selection (GSS) to the results of IBRA to select bands based on their information entropy values and train a compact convolutional neural network to evaluate the performance of the current selection. We also propose a feature extraction framework that consists of two main steps: first, it reduces the total number of bands using IBRA; then, it can use any feature extraction method to obtain the desired number of feature channels. We present classification results obtained from our methods and compare them to other dimensionality reduction methods on three hyperspectral image datasets. Additionally, we used the original hyperspectral data cube to simulate the process of using actual filters in a multispectral imager.  aPublisher supplied data  cIntel Corporationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100002418  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata collection 3aentropy 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aneural networks1 aSheppard, John W.1 aLogan, Riley D.1 aShaw, Joseph A.0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Sept. 13, v. 13, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131836493Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle01597naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009900159300002000258520056300278592002800841650001500869650002200884650002200906650001700928650001600945700001700961700001900978700001800997700001701015700001901032773012501051856007401176852000901250655001201259IND60700872220221120145757.0200704e20200630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070087222DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra03984e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Sanjeev12aA novel fabrication of electrospun polyacrylonitrile/NaYF₄:Eu⁺³ light emitting nanofibers  ap. 24855-24861.  aPolyacrylonitrile/NaYF₄:Eu⁺³ nanophosphor composite nanofibers have been successfully prepared using the electrospinning technique.

Acidity, surface species and NH₃-SCR performance over commercial WO₃/TiO₂ and V₂O₅WO₃/TiO₂ have been investigated. The incomplete dispersion of tungsten oxide gives rise to the formation of crystalline WO₃ on titania surface, and the mounts of surface Brønsted acid sites decrease consequently. From the TPR and Raman spectra, it is indicated that two-dimensional vanadium species exhibits a tendency to moderately anchor onto titania surface in the immediate vicinity of tungsten species. It is also found that amorphous tungsten oxide has different impacts on the dispersion of vanadium species over titania surface at variable loadings of vanadia. At low vanadium loadings, amorphously distorted tungsten species show promoting effects on the formation and dispersion of two-dimensional vanadium species. With vanadium loadings increasing, amorphous tungsten species exert compressing effects on surface vanadium species and lead to the aggregation of vanadium oxide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical engineering 3atungsten 3avanadium1 aYang, Shijian1 aChang, Huazhen1 aPeng, Yue1 aLi, Junhua0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 June 1, v. 225 p.520-527dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.04.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012200161300002000283520162000303592002801923650003401951650002201985650001302007650001802020650003702038650002602075650001102101650001802112650001402130650002402144650003302168650001802201650001602219650002102235650001902256650001102275700001802286700001502304700002002319700002002339700003602359700001202395700001802407700001702425773012502442856007402567852000902641655001202650IND60700872620221120154229.0200704e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070087262DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra04114a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnstone, E.

Stoichiometric amounts of Pb₃(VO₄)₂ and PdI₂ were batched and reacted at elevated temperatures in sealed vessels. Batched material was also subjected to high-energy ball-milling (HEBM) in order to reduce reaction time and the potential for iodine volatilization during subsequent reaction at 200–500 °C. The resulting products were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, IR spectroscopy, thermal analysis and Pd K XANES. Results showed that PdI₂ can function as a sacrificial iodine source for the formation of iodovanadinite, prototypically Pb₁₀(VO₄)₆I₂, however, the incorporation of Pd into this phase was not definitively observed. The sacrificial reaction mechanism involved the decomposition of PdI₂ to Pd metal and nascent I₂, with the latter incorporated into the iodovanadinite Pb₁₀(VO₄)₆I₂ phase. In comparison to processing using standard solid state reaction techniques, the use of HEBM prior to high temperature reaction generates a more homogeneous end-product with better iodine retention for this system. Overall, the key novelty and importance of this work is in demonstrating a method for direct immobilisation of undissolved PdI₂ from nuclear fuel reprocessing, in a composite wasteform in which I-129 is immobilised within a durable iodovandinite ceramic, encapsulating Pd metal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aceramics 3aencapsulation 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aiodine 3anuclear fuels 3apalladium 3areaction mechanisms 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astoichiometry 3atemperature 3athermal analysis 3avolatilization 3awastes1 aBailey, D.

The peak in runoff usually coincides with the highest air temperatures which drive meltwater production. This process is often accompanied by the release of sediments from within the glacier system that are transported and suspended in high concentrations as they reach the proglacial realm. Sediment-laden meltwater is later transported to the marine environment and is expressed on the surface of fjords and coastal waters as sediment plumes. Direct monitoring of these processes requires complex and time-intensive fieldwork, meaning studies of these processes are rare. This paper demonstrates the seasonal dynamics of the Trebrevatnet lake complex and evolution of suspended sediment in the lake and sediment plumes in the adjacent Ekmanfjorden. We use the Normalized Difference Suspended Sediment Index (NDSSI) derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images for the period between 2016–2021. We propose a new SSL index combining the areal extent of the sediment plume with the NDSSI for quantification of the sediment influx to the marine environment. The largest observed sediment plume was recorded on 30 July 2018 and extended to more than 40 km² and a SSL index of 10.4. We identified the greatest sediment concentrations in the lake in the beginning of August, whereas the highest activity of the sediment plumes is concentrated at the end of July. The temporal pattern of these processes stays relatively stable throughout all ablation seasons studied. Sediment plumes observed with the use of optical satellite remote sensing data may be used as a proxy for meltwater runoff from the glacier-fed Trebrevatnet system. We have shown that remote-sensing-derived suspended sediment indexes can (after proper in situ calibration) serve for large scale quantification of sediment flux to fjord and coastal environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acase studies 3aevolution 3aglaciers 3alakes 3alatitude 3amarine environment 3arunoff 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3asediments 3asnowmelt 3asuspended sediment 3aNorway1 aWieczorek, Iwo 1 aTallentire, Guy D.1 aDemidionov, Mihail 1 aUher, Jakub 1 aStrzelecki, Mateusz C.0 tWater.g2022 June 07, v. 14, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141218403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010000167300001100267520220600278592002802484650001502512650001402527650002702541700001902568773011902587856008102706852000902787655001202796IND60575616620221120042636.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057561662DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-017-2278-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrommer, Jon E.10aPhenotypic correlations capture between-individual correlations underlying behavioral syndromes  ap. 50.  aThe presence of variation in behavior on the between-individual level is considered the hallmark of personality. In contrast, behavioral syndromes are commonly recognized when documented on the phenotypic level, which is a mix of between-individual and residual (within-individual) correlations. Phenotypic and between-individual correlations need not align, and investigations on different levels of the same syndrome may hence lead to opposite inferences. Between-individual correlations, arguably, provide stronger evidence for an intrinsically determined behavioral syndrome than phenotypic correlations. We compiled 109 literature estimates of between-individual and phenotypic correlations between behaviors from 30 studies, performed on 22 species covering a wide range of taxa. Contrary to our expectation, the phenotypic correlation in behaviors was, on average, a reasonable predictor of the between-individual correlation in terms of magnitude and sign. Although our finding does not warrant the use of the phenotypic correlation as a suitable approximation of the between-individual correlation for any particular study, it does suggest that the phenotypic correlations used to infer the majority of behavioral syndromes to date have provided a reasonable characterization of syndrome associative strength. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Aspects of personality often correlate and are then said to form a behavioral syndrome. Syndromes are interesting because they signal that multiple behaviors may share causal drivers. Most syndromes to date are based on correlations of measured behaviors (phenotypes), but any pattern on the phenotypic level is likely influenced by uncontrolled associations between the focal behaviors which are expected to reduce the phenotypic correlation relative to the correlation on the underlying individual level. If so, behavioral ecologists may have underestimated the associative strength of behavioral syndromes. Based on over 100 published estimates of individual-level and phenotypic correlations between aspects of personality, we show that the phenotypic correlation provides a reasonable estimate of the magnitude and sign of individual-level correlations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecologists 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic correlation1 aClass, Barbara0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2017 Mar., v. 71, no. 3 p.50-50dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-017-2278-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01356naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245004600164300001600210520057500226592002800801650001200829650001900841650001000860700001800870773011100888856008200999852000901081655001201090IND60617077020221120181331.0181023e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061707702DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517592062011092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRust, J.

C.10aEffects of Lime and Phosphorus Application on Phosphorus Runoff Risk  ap. 5459-5471.  aLime was investigated as a soil amendment to decrease phosphorus (P) loss in runoff from two Delaware sandy loam soils, one high and one low in P. Soils were limed at three rates (control and target pH values of 6 and 6.8, respectively), packed into runoff boxes (2,000Â cmÂ²) and received simulated rainfall (80Â mmÂ hâ»Â¹ for 30Â min). Lime showed potential to decrease P loss in runoff, but its effectiveness was soil specific and dependant on other management factors also. Lime decreased dissolved reactive P (DRP) and dissolved organic P (DOP) loss by 20â25 and 52â93Â %, respectively, for the high-P soil and particulate P (PP) by 13Â % for the low-P soil. The majority of P lost in runoff was DOP (3â29Â %) or PP (64â96Â %). Lime increased PP losses from the finer-textured soil following P application, indicating that increased P sorption can lead to increased losses if P is sorbed to more erodable particles. Initial soil P status was more important than liming in determining P loss. While amendments may decrease P losses in the short term, addressing nutrient imbalances at the field scale is clearly necessary in the long term. Losses increased significantly following inorganic P application. Although P was sorbed rapidly, with less than 2Â % of added P removed in runoff, mean concentrations in excess of 700Â Î¼gÂ lâ»Â¹ DRP, 2,500Â Î¼gÂ lâ»Â¹ OP and 6,500Â Î¼gÂ lâ»Â¹ PP were recorded for both soils immediately following P application.  aPublisher supplied data 3alosses from soil 3aphosphorus 3arainfall simulation 3arisk 3arunoff 3asandy loam soils 3asoil amendments 3aDelaware1 aSims, J.

Ponds can flood in the autumn, winter, or spring, and thus the environmental conditions faced by emerging zooplankton can be very different. We performed an experiment in a climatic chamber where we simulated annual variation in natural temperature and light conditions to study how differences in pond-filling season affected zooplankton assemblage composition. We sampled sediments from a temporary pond and placed them in aquariums that were filled with water during three different seasons: autumn (October), winter (January), and spring (March). Zooplankton abundance, species richness, diversity, and assemblage composition differed significantly among treatments, and post-inundation temperature and pH appeared to be the main drivers of these differences. Diversity was highest in the winter treatment. It was lower in the autumn treatment and the spring treatment, and no indicator species were present in the latter. Our results suggest that interannual variability in initial inundation conditions favours the emergence of different species and thus contributes to high species richness in the egg bank. However, climate change and/or groundwater drawdown could delay pond flooding, impoverishing the zooplankton assemblage in the long term.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3aclimate change 3adrawdown 3aeggs 3agroundwater 3aindicator species 3apH 3aspecies richness 3aspring 3atemperature 3awinter 3azooplankton1 aFernández-Zamudio, R.1 aLozano, Mayca1 aDíaz-Paniagua, C.0 tHydrobiologia.g2020 Mar., v. 847, no. 5 p.1195-1205dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-019-04163-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001600189245009200205300001600297506007600313520122300389592002801612506003701640650002501677650001201702650001001714650001701724650001201741650002301753650001001776650001701786650001901803650001301822650001301835650001601848650000901864650001201873650001301885650001201898650002201910650001401932650001801946650001101964650001201975650000901987650001701996653002302013653001902036653001602055653002502071653000902096653000702105653000702112653000702119653000702126653000702133700001302140700002202153773012102175856008202296852000902378655001202387IND60528640620221207133150.0160716e20160212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052864062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.01.0962doi7 aPMC47626682pmcid7 a268015542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Xianghu10aPostnatal lethality and abnormal development of foregut and spleen in Ndrg4 mutant mice  ap. 613-619.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNDRG4 is a member of the NDRG family (N-myc downstream-regulated gene), which is highly expressed in brain and heart. Previous studies showed that Ndrg1-deficient mice exhibited a progressive demyelinating disorder of peripheral nerves and Ndrg4-deficient mice had spatial learning deficits and vulnerabilities to cerebral ischemia. Here, we report generation of Ndrg4 mutant alleles that exhibit several development defects different from those previously reported. Our homozygous mice showed growth retardation and postnatal lethality. Spleen and thymuses of Ndrg4−/− mice are considerably reduced in size from 3 weeks of age. Histological analysis revealed abnormal hyperkeratosis in the squamous foregut and abnormal loss of erythrocytes in the spleen of Ndrg4−/− mice. In addition, we observed an abnormal hind limb clasping phenotype upon tail suspension suggesting neurological abnormalities. Consistent to these abnormalities, Ndrg4 is expressed in smooth muscle cells of the stomach, macrophages of the spleen and neurons. Availability of the conditional allele for Ndrg4 should facilitate further detailed analyses of the potential roles of Ndrg4 in gut development, nervous system and immune system.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabnormal development 3aalleles 3abrain 3aerythrocytes 3aforegut 3agrowth retardation 3aheart 3ahomozygosity 3ahyperkeratosis 3aischemia 3alearning 3amacrophages 3amice 3amutants 3amyocytes 3aneurons 3aperipheral nerves 3aphenotype 3asmooth muscle 3aspleen 3astomach 3atail 3athymus gland 0aGrowth retardation 0aHyperkeratosis 0aErythrocyte 0aConditional knockout 0aNDRG 0aES 0aPP 0awt 0awp 0arp1 aLi, Jing1 aBaldwin, H.

Herein, lysozyme in complex egg white matrix was chosen as the model protein for demonstrating the purification of low‐content peptide via an FFE coupled with gel fitration chromatography (GFC). The crude lysozyme in egg while was first separated via free‐flow zone electrophoresis (FFZE). After that, the fractions with lysozyme activity were condensed via lyophilization. Thereafter, the condensed fractions were further purified via a GFC of Sephadex G50. In all of the experiments, a special poly(acrylamide‐ co‐acrylic acid) (P(AM‐co‐AA)) gel electrophoresis and a mass spectrometry were used for identification of lysozyme. The conditions of FFZE were optimized as follows: 130 μL/min sample flow rate, 4.9 mL/min background buffer of 20 mM pH 5.5 Tris‐Acetic acid, 350 V, and 14 °C as well as 2 mg/mL protein content of crude sample. It was found that the purified lysozyme had the purity of 80% and high activity as compared with its crude sample with only 1.4% content and undetectable activity. The recoveries in the first and second separative steps were 65% and 82%, respectively, and the total recovery was about 53.3%. The reasons of low recovery might be induced by diffusion of lysozyme out off P(AM‐co‐AA) gel and co‐removing of high‐abundance egg ovalbumin. All these results indicated FFE could be used as alternative tool for purification of target solute with low abundance.  aPublisher supplied data  a31727801cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aegg albumen 3aeggs 3afreeze drying 3agel chromatography 3agel electrophoresis 3agels 3alysozyme 3amass spectrometry 3aovalbumin 3apeptides 3aprotein content 3asolutes1 aJiang, Ziqin1 aLiu, Zhen1 aChen, Ling1 aZhang, Qiang1 aTian, Youli1 aSuhail, ʻĀmir,1 aKhan, Muhammad Idrees1 aXiao, Hua1 aLiu, Xiaoping1 aWang, Yuxing1 aLi, Honggen1 aWu, Hanyu1 aLiu, Weiwen1 aCao, Chengxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3873-51120 tElectrophoresis.g2020 Sept., v. 41, no. 16-17 p.1529-1538dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2019004793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02209naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245010100201300001800302500001900320520118800339592002801527650001001555650001101565650001301576650000801589650001801597650001101615650002501626700001401651773012701665856008201792852000901874655001201883IND60684356820221122114054.0200219e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068435682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-020-04184-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuber, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2102-317812aA conceptual model for unbiased calculations of invertebrate abundances from freeze core samples  ap. 1301-1314.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFreeze coring is a commonly used method for the investigation of the bed sediment fauna of rivers. It is considered to produce quantitative numbers of invertebrate abundance in different depth layers. Calculations of abundance use total volume of the freeze core sample as spatial reference. This definition of sample volume is incorrect. In the present, study freeze core samples are shown to consist of two parts: (1) a cylindrical inner core in which the pore water has turned into ice and (2) all parts of sediment, which protrude from this inner core. Invertebrates are fixed only within the inner core since the protruding parts contain no pores and therefore no invertebrate habitat. In samples from gravel rivers, the protruding parts form a considerable bias, which depends on the size of the core and the coarseness of the sediment. In the present study, total volume of individual core segments varied between 97 and 248% of actual sample volume. The inner core can be measured directly to avoid the bias. The procedure is proposed for future studies to produce unbiased, comparable values of invertebrate abundance and consequently reliable data on vertical distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3afauna 3agravel 3ahabitats 3aice 3ainvertebrates 3amodels 3aspatial distribution1 aHauer, C.0 tHydrobiologia.g2020 Mar., v. 847, no. 5 p.1301-1314dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04184-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013000166300001600296520150500312592002801817650001601845650001301861650001601874650001801890650002201908650002601930650002201956650004401978700002702022700002502049773012402074856008102198852000902279655001202288IND4393495620221122043445.0151024e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439349562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-007-1067-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodoy, Simone C.10aDetermination of the Hydroxyl Value of Soybean Polyol by Attenuated Total Reflectance/Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy  ap. 503-508.  aA rapid method for the quantitative determination of the hydroxyl value (OHV) of hydroxylated soybean oils by HATR/FTIR spectroscopy is described. Calibration standards were prepared by the formic acid/hydrogen peroxide method and OH values were determined by the official method of AOCS Tx 1a-66, covering an analytical range of 3.5–125 mg of KOH/g of sample. A partial least squares (PLS) calibration model for the prediction of the hydroxyl value (OHV) was developed based on eight different spectral subregions between 3,150 and 990 cm⁻¹ and combinations of them. On average, 36 samples were used for the modeling and 17 were used for external validation. The resulting calibration was linear over the analytical range and had a standard deviation of 2.334. Validation of the method was carried out by comparing the OHV of a series of hydroxylated soybean oils predicted by the PLS model to the values obtained by the AOCS standard method. A correlation coefficient of R ² = 0.9843 and RMSEC and RMSEP values of, respectively, 3.393 and 3.643 were obtained. After the calibration of the spectrometer, the OHV could be obtained in 2–3 min per sample, a major improvement over conventional wet chemical methods. The advantages of these methodologies are that they do not destroy the sample, have a lower cost, expedite the analysis and do not produce residues. Therefore, they may yield excellent results when used to quantify OHV of soybean polyols obtained by hydroxylation reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3asoybean oil 3ahydroxylation 3achemical analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3aspectral analysis 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy1 aFerrão, Marco Flôres1 aGerbase, Annelise E.0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2007 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.503-508dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-007-1067-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01347naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006300166300001600229520041400245592002800659650001100687650001200698650000900710650002100719650001900740650001000759700001600769700001700785700001700802773011100819856008200930852000901012655001201021IND60617077420221120181337.0181023e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061707742DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517592062012032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsumoto, Y.10aProperties of Double-Core Twin Spun Silk Yarns and Fabrics  ap. 710-714.  aThis paper is concerned with the method of producing a novel silk/cotton composite yarn with improved tensile properties.

Profiling the dynamics of metabolic changes during ripening and CA storage is vital for understanding the governing molecular mechanism. In this study, the dynamics of the primary metabolism of ‘Jonagold’ apples during ripening in regular air (RA) storage and initiation of CA storage was profiled. 1‐Methylcyclopropene (1‐MCP) was exploited to block ethylene receptors and to get insight into ethylene mediated metabolic changes during ripening of the fruit and in response to hypoxic stress. Metabolic changes were quantified in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the Yang cycle and synthesis of the main amino acids branching from these metabolic pathways. Partial least square discriminant analysis of the metabolic profiles of 1‐MCP treated and control apples revealed a metabolic divergence in ethylene, organic acid, sugar and amino acid metabolism. During RA storage at 18°C, most amino acids were higher in 1‐MCP treated apples, whereas 1‐aminocyclopropane‐1‐carboxylic acid (ACC) was higher in the control apples. The initial response of the fruit to CA initiation was accompanied by an increase of alanine, succinate and glutamate, but a decline in aspartate. Furthermore, alanine and succinate accumulated to higher levels in control apples than 1‐MCP treated apples. The observed metabolic changes in these interlinked metabolites may indicate a coordinated adaptive strategy to maximize energy production.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 3a1-methylcyclopropene 3aair 3aalanine 3aamino acid metabolism 3aapples 3aaspartic acid 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3adiscriminant analysis 3aenergy 3aethylene 3aglutamic acid 3aglycolysis 3aleast squares 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aoxygen 3areceptors 3aripening 3ashelf life 3asuccinic acid 3atricarboxylic acid cycle1 aBeshir, Wasiye F.1 aHertog, Maarten L.A.T.M.1 aNicolai, Bart M.1 aGeeraerd, Annemie H.0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2015 Nov., v. 155, no. 3 p.232-247dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.123513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001500189245010800204300001600312506007600328520111400404592002801518506003701546650001401583650001901597650001601616650002901632650001901661650002201680650002401702650001201726650001601738650001801754650001501772650001601787650001701803650001701820650001801837650001401855650002801869650001501897653002501912653001701937653000901954653000801963653000801971653000901979653002801988653001802016700001602034700002002050700001602070700002202086700001802108773012102126856008202247852000902329655001202338IND60528640820221207123023.0160716e20160212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052864082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.01.0982doi7 aPMC47565892pmcid7 a267972752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Lixue10aIdentification of novel cell survival regulation in diabetic embryopathy via phospholipidomic profiling  ap. 599-605.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDiabetes mellitus in early pregnancy causes birth defects by disturbing metabolic homeostasis and increasing programmed cell death in the embryo. Over-activation of phospholipase Cβ3 and γ1 suggests disturbed phospholipid metabolism, which is an important in regulation of cell signaling and activity. Metabolomic examinations reveal significant changes in the profile of phospholipid metabolism. Among the metabolites, levels of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) are increased. PIP2 effector PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is activated. Activation of protein kinase Bα (PKBα, or AKT1) and mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) is decreased. Inhibition of PLCs and PTEN suppresses over-generation of reactive oxygen species and inhibition of PLCs prevents fragmentation of mitochondria in neural stem cells cultured in high glucose. These observations suggest that maternal hyperglycemia disrupts phospholipid metabolism, leading to perturbation of mitochondrial dynamics and redox homeostasis and suppression of the PKB-mTOR cell survival signaling in the embryos.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3acell viability 3achromosomes 3acongenital abnormalities 3acultured cells 3adiabetes mellitus 3aembryonic mortality 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ahyperglycemia 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amitochondria 3aphospholipids 3apregnancy 3areactive oxygen species 3astem cells 0aDiabetic embryopathy 0aPhospholipid 0aPTEN 0aPKB 0aAKT 0amTOR 0aReactive oxygen species 0aMitochondrion1 aLiu, Peiyan1 aGill, Kirandeep1 aReece, E.A.1 aCheema, Amrita K.1 aZhao, Zhiyong0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Feb. 12, v. 470 p.599-605dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.01.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03448naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245018100165300001400346520204000360592002802400650001302428650002002441650001002461650002802471650002602499650001502525650002102540650001202561650002702573650002902600653003702629653003102666653001502697653002702712653002102739653002102760700002202781700002202803773009502825856008502920852000903005655001203014IND60554428320221121094134.0161024e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055442832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.02.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yan10aSimultaneous quantification of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor agonists in rodent plasma by on-line solid phase extraction and LC–MS/MS  ap. 24-29.  aPeptide agonists of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and the cholecystokinin-1 receptor (CCK1-R) have therapeutic potential because of their marked anorexigenic and weight lowering effects. Furthermore, recent studies in rodents have shown that co-administration of these agents may prove more effective than treatment either of the peptide classes alone. To correlate the pharmacodynamic effects to the pharmacokinetics of these peptide drugs in vivo, a sensitive and robust bioanalytical method is essential. Furthermore, the simultaneous determination of both analytes in plasma samples by a single method offers obvious advantages. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) is well suited to this goal through its ability to simultaneously monitor multiple analytes through selected reaction monitoring (SRM). However, it is a challenge to find appropriate conditions that allow two peptides with widely disparate physiochemical properties to be simultaneously analyzed while maintaining the necessary sensitivity for their accurate plasma concentrations. Herein, we report an on-line solid phase extraction (SPE) LC–MS/MS method for simultaneous quantification of the CCK1-R agonist AC170222 and the GLP-1R agonist AC3174 in rodent plasma. The assay has a linear range from 0.0975 to 100ng/mL, with lower limits of quantification of 0.0975ng/mL and 0.195ng/mL for AC3174 and AC170222, respectively. The intra- and inter-day precisions were below 15%. The developed LC–MS/MS method was used to simultaneously quantify AC3174 and AC170222, the results showed that the terminal plasma concentrations of AC3174 or AC170222 were comparable between groups of animals that were administered with the peptides alone (247±15pg/mL of AC3174 and 1306±48pg/mL of AC170222), or in combination (222±32pg/mL and 1136±47pg/mL of AC3174 and AC170222, respectively). These data provide information on the drug exposure to aid in assessing the combination effects of AC3174 and AC170222 on rodent metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3acholecystokinin 3adrugs 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3aliquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3apharmacokinetics 3arodents 3asolid phase extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aGlucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 0aCholecystokinin-1 receptor 0aLC–MS/MS 0aSolid phase extraction 0aPharmacokinetics 0aPharmacodynamics1 aRoth, Jonathan D.1 aTaylor, Steven W.0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 957 p.24-29dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.02.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03911naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008000157300001400237500002000251520209000271592002802361650001502389650002002404650001402424650001502438650002602453650001702479650001402496650001202510650001402522650002002536650002202556650001302578650002002591650001002611650001902621650001902640650001002659650001302669650001402682650001102696650001402707650002502721650000902746650001602755650001102771650001602782651001902798700001702817700001402834700001502848700001302863700001802876700001802894700001702912700001302929700002602942700001702968700001702985700001703002773011103019856007403130852000903204655001203213IND60588434720221119140527.0180117e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058843472DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.032332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGange, A. C.10aTrait‐dependent distributional shifts in fruiting of common British fungi  ap. 51-61.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDespite the dramatic phenological responses of fungal fruiting to recent climate warming, it is unknown whether spatial distributions of fungi have changed and to what extent such changes are influenced by fungal traits, such as ectomycorrhizal (ECM) or saprotrophic lifestyles, spore characteristics, or fruit body size. Our overall aim was to understand how climate and fungal traits determine whether and how species‐specific fungal fruit body abundances have shifted across latitudes over time, using the UK national database of fruiting records. The data employed were recorded over 45 yr (1970–2014), and include 853 278 records of Agaricales, Boletales and Russulales, though we focus only on the most common species (with more than 3000 records each). The georeferenced observations were analysed by a Bayesian inference as a Gaussian additive model with a specification following a joint species distribution model. We used an offset, random contributions and fixed effects to isolate different potential biases from the trait‐specific interactions with latitude/climate and time. Our main aim was assessed by examination of the three‐way‐interaction of trait, predictor (latitude or climate) and time. The results show a strong trait‐specific shift in latitudinal abundance through time, as ECM species have become more abundant relative to saprotrophic species in the north. Along precipitation gradients, phenology was important, in that species with shorter fruiting seasons have declined markedly in abundance in oceanic regions, whereas species with longer seasons have become relatively more common overall. These changes in fruit body distributions are correlated with temperature and rainfall, which act directly on both saprotrophic and ECM fungi, and also indirectly on ECM fungi, through altered photosynthate allocation from their hosts. If these distributional changes reflect fungal activity, there will be important consequences for the responses of forest ecosystems to changing climate, through effects on primary production and nutrient cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricales 3aBayesian theory 3aBoletales 3aRussulales 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiogeography 3abody size 3aclimate 3adatabases 3aectomycorrhizae 3aforest ecosystems 3afruiting 3afruiting bodies 3afungi 3ageoreferencing 3aglobal warming 3ahosts 3alatitude 3alifestyle 3amodels 3aphenology 3aprimary productivity 3arain 3asaprotrophs 3aspores 3atemperature 3aUnited Kingdom1 aHeegaard, E.1 aBoddy, L.1 aAndrew, C.1 aKirk, P.1 aHalvorsen, R.1 aKuyper, T.

This form of plasticity requires the formation of association between information and an appropriate behavioural response. Such a connection is the result of a complex interaction between evolutionary pre-programmed cue-response behaviour (innate behavioural response) and cumulated lifetime experience (learning). The evolution of learning and innate behavioural responses is likely to depend on their respective fitness costs and benefits. However, as natural selection will indirectly affect each form through global behavioural plasticity, it is critical to understand how each form interacts with the other. The inclusion of innate behavioural plasticity and learning in behaviour is likely to result in more than the mere sum of each plastic form. In this review we investigate the costs and benefits of learning and innate behavioural responses and the effect of one on the other in their evolution. We highlight the need for more explicit study of the interaction between innate behavioural response and learning in natural systems for a better understanding of behavioural plasticity. 3aenvironmental factors 3alearning 3anatural selection1 aBurns, James G.0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2010 May, v. 24, no. 3 p.571-583dSpringer Netherlandsx0269-76537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-009-9336-y 7aarticle02538naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001300146245014500159300001800304500002400322500001500346520102300361650001701384650002201401650002801423650002201451650001701473650001601490650001401506650001301520650002101533650001401554653001601568653002101584653002901605700001401634700001401648700001301662700001101675700001401686700001301700773016201713852000901875856007701884930003301961945002501994946001302019655001202032IND4408851120221121221340.0080812e20080709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440885112DNAL7 a10.1021/jf800740z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aZhao, Q.10aSynthesis and Insecticidal Activities of Novel N-Sulfenyl-N'-tert-butyl-N,N'-diacylhydrazines. 2.

The hypothesis was to test divergence from the Additive Dose Model (ADM), as a reference model. The Fvj parameter [(Fm − Fj)/Fm] and two new parameters, based on the slope at the J and the I step of the Kautsky curve, measured 2 days after spraying, and biomass 3 weeks after spraying, were used as responses. Synergistic effects of mixtures of isoxaflutole with numerous herbicides have been patented and were thus the working hypothesis. The shapes of isoboles, a contour plot of all mixtures of two herbicides that give the same effect, was variable, but the results of the mixtures with isoxaflutole, however, did not show statistically significant departure from the ADM. This applies to all endpoints: biomass and the Kautsky curve parameters, Fvj, Slope-I and Slope-J. The variability of isobole shapes is discussed, as is the use of statistical assessment of isobole parameters. The parameters from the Kautsky curves after 48 h predicted the isobole just as well as biomass after 20 days and could be used as a rapid scan for the divergence of joint action of mixtures from the ADM, long before visible symptoms develop. 3aBeta vulgaris 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3aisoxaflutole 3ametribuzin 3amodels 3aprediction1 aSTREIBIG, J.C.1 aCEDERGREEN, N.0 tWeed research.g2011 Feb., v. 51, no. 1 p.23-32dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0043-17377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2010.00824.x 7aarticle02236naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125072000900143072000900152100001100161245012100172300001600293500002400309500001500333520084100348650001801189650002501207650002301232650002601255650002001281650001601301650003201317650002301349650002301372650001701395650001301412653002401425653001201449700001601461700001801477773010801495852000901603856008301612930003301695945002501728946001301753655001201766IND4408855420221121221357.0080812e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440885542DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-98-8-08672doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF2001 aSy, O.10aRecombinant Inbred Line Differential Identifies Race-Specific Resistance to Phytophthora Root Rot in Capsicum annuum  ap. 867-870.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA differential series is the normal method for identification of races within a plant pathogen and a host interaction. A host differential is extremely useful for phytopathological as well as breeding purposes. A set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed and characterized for race differentiation of Phytophthora root rot caused by Phytophthora capsici. The highly resistant Capsicum annuum accession Criollo de Morelos-334 was hybridized to a susceptible cultivar, Early Jalapeno, to generate the RIL population. The host differential characterized 17 isolates of P. capsici into 13 races. The establishment of a stable host differential for the P. capsici and C. annuum interaction will assist researchers in understanding the complex inheritance of resistance to Phytophthora root rot and to develop resistant cultivars. 3asweet peppers 3aPhytophthora capsici 3agenetic resistance 3alaboratory techniques 3aCapsicum annuum 3ahost plants 3ahost-parasite relationships 3astrain differences 3adisease resistance 3ainbred lines 3aroot rot 0adifferential series 0astrains1 aSteiner, R.1 aBosland, P.W.0 tPhytopathology.g2008 Aug., v. 98, no. 8 p.867-870dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-98-8-08673Available from publisher's Web site  a20090106b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/02  aOther US 7aarticle01638naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001800127245004700145300001800192520083800210650001001048650001801058650001101076650002201087700001901109700001801128700002001146773008001166852000901246930003301255945002501288946001101313655001201324IND4388397520221121185716.0070302e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438839752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

They are respectively 220 859 and 231 801 bp in size and contain 132 and 147 predicted genes. The genomes are related most closely in the central regions, where 40 genes are conserved convincingly. Nineteen of these genes are also conserved in a fish herpesvirus, Ictalurid herpesvirus 1. The terminal regions of the genomes are largely not conserved and contain many of the 15 families of related genes present in each genome. The frog herpesviruses are unique among sequenced herpesviruses in that the three exons of the gene encoding the putative ATPase subunit of terminase are not specified by the same DNA strand and in that they encode a putative DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase and have extensively methylated genomes. 3afrogs 3aHerpesviridae 3agenome 3asequence analysis1 aCunningham, C.1 aSauerbier, W.1 aMcKinnell, R.G.0 tJournal of general virology.g2006 Dec., v. 87 p.3509-3514x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20070727b20070802c00000000  aINDdDFXe2007/05/21  aNon-US 7aarticle01980naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245008500142300001800227500001500245520100400260650001801264650002201282650002301304650002001327653001501347700001501362700002501377700002701402700001701429700001401446773008001460852000901540930003301549945002501582946001101607655001201618IND4388399420221121152039.0070302e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438839942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

By arranging viral transgenes as inverted repeats it is thus possible to obtain strong repression of incoming viruses. Due to the high sequence specificity of RNA silencing, this technology has hitherto been limited to the targeting of single viruses. Here it is shown that efficient simultaneous targeting of four different tospoviruses can be achieved by using a single small transgene based on the production of minimal sized chimaeric cassettes. Due to simultaneous RNA silencing, as demonstrated by specific siRNA accumulation, the transgenic expression of these cassettes rendered up to 82 % of the transformed plant lines heritably resistant against all four viruses. Thus RNA silencing can be further improved for high frequency multiple virus resistance by combining small RNA fragments from a series of target viruses. 3aplant viruses 3atransgenic plants 3adisease resistance 3aOrthotospovirus 0aTospovirus1 aLohuis, D.1 aPoppel, P.M.J.A. van1 aGeerts-Dimitriadou, C.1 aGoldbach, R.1 aPrins, M.0 tJournal of general virology.g2006 Dec., v. 87 p.3697-3701x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20070727b20070802c00000000  aINDdDFXe2007/06/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02899naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245013000144300001600274520123900290650001201529650001301541650002801554650001601582650001501598650002801613650000901641650002001650650002101670650001301691650001701704650003001721650006301751650001201814650003501826650000901861650001101870650005301881650002901934650003001963650002801993650005602021650002502077653001302102653001702115700001702132700001702149700001702166773008402183852000902267930003302276945001302309946001102322655001202333IND2198945820221121152116.0990526e199812  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219894582DNAL7 a99151512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKyles, A.E.10aComparison of transdermal fentanyl and intramuscular oxymorphone on post-operative behaviour after ovariohysterectomy in dogs  ap. 245-251.  aThe effects of transdermal fentanyl and IM oxymorphone on behavioural and physiological responses, after ovariohysterectomy in dogs, were investigated. The study involved three groups of 10 dogs: fentanyl/surgery (FS), oxymorphone/surgery (OS), fentanyl/control (FC). A transdermal fentanyl delivery system (50 micrograms hour-1) (FS and FC) was applied 20 hours before surgery, or IM oxymorphone (OS) was administered. After ovariohysterectomy (FS and OS) or anaesthesia alone (FC), dogs were continuously videotaped for 24 hours and a standardised hourly interaction with a handler performed. The videotapes were analysed, and interactive and non-interactive behaviours evaluated. In addition, pain and sedation scores, pulse and respiratory rates, rectal temperature, arterial blood pressure, plasma cortisol and plasma fentanyl concentrations were measured. This study showed that transdermal fentanyl and IM oxymorphone (0.05 mg kg-1) produced comparable analgesic effects over a 24 hour recording period. IM oxymorphone produced significantly more sedation and lower rectal temperatures than transdermal fentanyl. There were no significant differences between groups in respiratory and heart rates, and arterial blood pressures. 3afemales 3afentanyl 3atransdermal application 3aovariectomy 3aanalgesics 3aintramuscular injection 3apain 3aanimal behavior 3abody temperature 3acortisol 3ahysterectomy 2aAdministration, Cutaneous 2aAnalgesics, Opioidxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aFentanylxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aHysterectomyxveterinary 2aInjections, Intramuscular 2aOvariectomyxveterinary 2aOxymorphonexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aPostoperative Period 0aefficacy 0adrug effects1 aHardie, E.M.1 aHansen, B.D.1 aPapich, M.G.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1998 , v. 65, no. 3 p.245-251x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle04219naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245017000173300001800343500001500361520287600376650001903252650001703271650002103288653001703309653000903326653001803335700001403353700001703367700001403384700002303398700002003421700001803441700002103459700001703480700001603497773014603513852000903659856008503668930003303753946001103786655001203797IND4437453220221121152050.0100522e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443745322DNAL7 a10.1007/s00432-009-0748-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchindlbeck, Christian 10aTopoisomerase IIα expression rather than gene amplification predicts responsiveness of adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy in women with primary breast cancer  ap. 1029-1037.  a2019-12-04  aIntroduction Adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy (AbCTX) is a standard treatment for patients with primary breast cancer. Its main target is topoisomerase IIα (TopIIa), a nuclear protein which is important for DNA replication and mitosis. We propose that the overexpression of the TopIIa protein or amplification of the TopIIa gene may be useful in predicting increased responsiveness towards AbCTX. Methods Tumor tissues of 118 patients who received adjuvant AbCTX were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) for TopIIa and HER2. For IHC, the primary antibodies 485 (Dako) and NCL-TOPOIIA (Novocastra) were used. FISH analysis was performed with the SPEC HER2/CEP 17 Dual Color Probe (Zytovision) and LSI TOP 2A Spectrum Orange/CEP 17 Spectrum Green probe (Abbott). TopIIa IHC was evaluated by the immunoreactive score (IRS). FISH amplification was stated at an HER2-TopIIa/CEP 17 ratio ≥2, deletion of TopIIa at a ratio <0.8. Results The median age of the patient population was 50 years (range 23-77), 76 (64%) had tumors >2 cm in size, 98 (85%) were nodal positive, and 72 (66%) estrogen-receptor positive. Chemotherapy regimes consisted of epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (EC 40 pts), EC-CMF (18 pts), FAC/FEC (33 pts), anthracycline-taxane combinations (23 pts) and others (4 pts). After IHC, it was found that 19% of the tumors were positive for HER2 (3+) and the median IRS for TopIIa staining was 2 (49% positive); 28 (24%) tumors showed HER2 amplification, therefrom 20/22 (91%) within the HER2 3+ group. TopIIa gene was amplified in 17 cases (16%) and deletion was seen in 6 (5%) tumors. Of all cases with HER2 gene amplification, 14 (50%) cases of TopIIa co-amplification and one case of deletion were seen. Looking at histological parameters, TopIIa IHC correlated with nodal status (P = 0.018) and high grading (G3) (P = 0.047). After a median follow-up of 42 months (range 1-242), a significant prognostic factor for local recurrence was HER2 positivity (IHC P = 0.013 and FISH P = 0.023). Thirty-two patients developed metastasis (27%), which was correlated with HER2 FISH positivity (P = 0.024) and, as a trend, Top IIa IHC negativity (P = 0.094); 25 (21%) patients died from the disease. Negative prognostic parameters were the lack of estrogen-receptor expression (P = 0.008), lymphangiosis (P = 0.02), and TopIIa IHC negativity (P = 0.03). Conclusion In this cohort of patients, HER2 positivity indicated higher rates of local and distant recurrence. In contrast, TopIIa IHC positivity predicted lower risk of metastases and death, thus being a positive-predictive factor for the responsiveness to AbCTX. TopIIa gene amplification did not add predictive information. Therefore, we conclude that TopIIa protein expression might rather be the target of anthracyclines independent from gene copy number. 3aanthracyclines 3adrug therapy 3abreast neoplasms 0achemotherapy 0aHER2 0aTopoisomerase1 aMayr, D. 1 aOlivier, C. 1 aRack, B. 1 aEngelstaedter, V. 1 aJueckstock, J. 1 aJenderek, C. 1 aAndergassen, U. 1 aJeschke, U. 1 aFriese, K. 0 tJournal of cancer research and clinical oncology.g2010 July, v. 136, no. 7 p.1029-1037dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0171-52167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00432-009-0748-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04362naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245012000163300001600283520257000299650002302869650002802892650002002920650001302940650002102953650002702974650003203001650003103033650001603064650002703080650002603107650001603133650001503149650002803164650002603192650001603218650002203234650001503256650001603271650001103287650001303298650001203311651001003323653001603333653002703349653001403376700001603390700001603406700001603422700001603438700001303454700001803467773012303485852000903608856008503617930003303702946001303735655001203748IND4437805120221121152045.0100528e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443780512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-010-9632-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Xichang 10aAnnual dynamics of the abundance of fish larvae and its relationship with hydrological variation in the Pearl River  ap. 217-225.  aWe studied daily periodicity, taxonomic composition and annual variation of fish larvae abundance from a survey of the Zhaoqing section of the Pearl River over a 3-year period, 2006-2008, and collected 52 species, in eight families and 16 orders. The fish larval samples were numerically dominated by six species, Barbel Chub (Squaliobarbus curriculus) 33.1%, Black Guangdong Bream (Megalobrama hoffmanni) 20.6%, Yellowfin (Xenocypris argentea) 15.4%, Mud Carp (Cirrhina molitorella) 10%, Common Sawbelly (Hemiculter leucisculus) 4.3%, and Freshwater Bream (Parabramis pekinensis) 3.1%. These six species accounted for 86.5% of total numbers. Black Carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), Grass Carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), Silver Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and Bighead Carp (Aristichthys nobilis) are four of the most economically important fish species in China, and accounted for approximately 4.6% of the total. When compared with historical records from 1931, there are obvious changes in the fish larvae community. Chinese Sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis), Seasonal Shad (Macrura reevesi) and Long Spiky-head Carp (Luciobrama macrocephalus) populations have disappeared and there are also decreases in several other economically important fish populations. We observed a delay in spawning time of Black Carp, Grass Carp, Silver Carp and Bighead Carp, which may be the result of the hydrological regime change in the Pearl River. We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and cross-covariance function (CCF) to analyze the relationship between fish larvae and environmental variables. Our results clearly show that discharge affects the majority of fish larvae, with the various species having different responses. Larval abundances of 15 species such as Black Carp, Grass Carp, Silver Carp, Bighead Carp, Mud Carp and Black Guangdong Bream are significantly and positively related to the discharge. Other species such as Chinese Noodlefish (Leucosoma chinensis) and Rhinogobius olivaceus are negatively related to the discharge. Abundances of larval Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) and Eleotris oxycephala were not related to the discharge. As most economic fish species are affected by discharge, we also conclude that changes of hydrological regime, mainly caused by river damming, will result in the decline of fisheries resources in the Pearl River. The findings of this study have important implications for our ability to model the responses of fish larvae to environmental flows for the purpose of river regulation. 3aAcipenser sinensis 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aCyprinus carpio 3aEleotris 3aGambusia affinis 3aHemiculter leucisculus 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3aHypophthalmichthys nobilis 3aMegalobrama 3aMylopharyngodon piceus 3aParabramis pekinensis 3aRhinogobius 3aXenocypris 3acorrespondence analysis 3aenvironmental factors 3afish larvae 3afishery resources 3afreshwater 3aperiodicity 3arivers 3aspawning 3asurveys 3aChina 0aPearl River 0aHydrological variation 0aAbundance1 aLi, Xinhui 1 aLek, Sovan 1 aLi, Yuefei 1 aWang, Chao 1 aLi, Jie 1 aLuo, Jianren 0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2010 July, v. 88, no. 3 p.217-225dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0378-19097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-010-9632-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03193naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009500165300001400260520178800274650003002062650002002092650002302112650001502135650001602150650001502166650001802181650001302199650002102212650001102233650001502244650002102259650001902280650001102299650001202310650002402322650001502346651001802361653001702379653001502396653001902411700002402430773010702454852000902561856008502570930003302655946001102688655001202699IND4439133420221121152059.0100625e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443913342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-009-9394-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, Mark B. 10aPatterns of hydrologic control over stream water total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratios  ap. 15-30.  aMany ecologists and biogeochemists explore the interaction of the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles by addressing N:P ratios. While N:P ratios are recognized as broadly important to the composition and functioning of lotic ecosystems, the fundamental controls on stream water N:P ratio variation remains poorly understood. Low N:P ratio (less than 16) streams appear more likely in arid climates than in mesic climates, suggesting possible hydrologic or landscape controls. We explored the importance of watershed hydrology to the variation of total N to total P (TN:TP) ratios in stream water, and whether such variation is characteristically different across watershed classes based on mean annual precipitation and median observed TN:TP ratio. Nonparametric scatter plot analysis was applied to normalized TN:TP ratios and associated discharge (Q) measurements from 57 minimally-impacted watersheds from the contiguous United States. At the seasonal scale, TN:TP ratios showed a negative relationship with Q in semiarid climates and a positive relationship with Q in humid climates. Over storm event scales, TN:TP ratios decline with increasing Q across all watershed classes. The results broadly indicate hydrology is an important driver of TN:TP ratio variation over multiple time scales. We hypothesize that the broad differences across watershed classes are driven by variation in the nature of connectivity (frequency and magnitude of connections) of the landscape to streams. A strong physical control of N:P ratios in stream water is in stark contrast to the biological control of N:P ratios in the oceans, suggesting that application of stoichiometric theory—developed using marine systems—to lotic systems requires a broader consideration of controlling factors. 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abiogeochemistry 3abiological control 3aecologists 3ahumid zones 3alandscapes 3alotic systems 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aoceans 3aphosphorus 3aphysical control 3asemiarid zones 3astorms 3astreams 3awatershed hydrology 3awatersheds 3aUnited States 0aConnectivity 0aN:P ratios 0aStream ecology1 aFinlay, Jacques C. 0 tBiogeochemistry.g2010 July, v. 99, no. 1-3 p.15-30dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0168-25637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-009-9394-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20100628b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02943naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245012400144300001600268520161200284650001501896650001401911650001901925650001001944650001401954650001201968650001801980650001101998650002902009650002002038650000902058650001402067650003002081650002902111650003102140650003302171653001302204700001502217700001902232700001802251700001502269700001502284773008402299852000902383930003302392945001302425946001102438655001202449IND2198941820221121152115.0990526e199812  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219894182DNAL7 a99151422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, O.V.10aEffect of stage of gestation and foetal number on plasma concentrations of a pregnancy serum protein (PSP-60) in cattle  ap. 195-199.  aThis study characterised the peripheral plasma concentration of PSP-60 throughout gestation, and examined the effect of stage of gestation and foetal number on this protein in Holstein cows after non-surgical embryo transfer. Cows (n=12) were divided into two groups; Group I contained single embryo recipient cows (n=5), Group 2 contained twin-embryo recipient cows (n=7). Blood was collected approximately every third day from day 0 (first day of standing oestrus), then daily for the last 10 days of gestation and until one day post-partum. Two of the twin-embryo recipient cows had abnormal pregnancies, consequently data from them was considered separately. In both groups PSP-60 increased progressively from about day 20 post-oestrus to 20 days pre-partum (from 0.9 +/- 0.2 to 49.7 +/- 8.7 ng ml-l, and from 1.3 +/- 0.6 to 115 +/- 34.9 ng ml-l (mean +/- SEM), in singleton and twin-bearing groups, respectively). The mean concentrations between 20 and 10 days pre-partum increased dramatically by about six-fold (P<0.001) in singleton-bearing cows (from 49.7 +/- 8.7 ng ml-l to 283.8 +/- 73.7 ng ml-l) to over two-fold in twin-bearing cows (from 115 +/- 34.9 ng ml-l to 284 +/- 98.2 ng ml-l). The mean concentrations of the two groups were indistinguishable between 10 days pre-partum and parturition. Cows giving birth prematurely to stillborn calves or to a schistosomus reflexus calf exhibited abnormal PSP-60 profiles. Our findings indicate that peripheral plasma PSP-60 concentrations are correlated to the stage of gestation and foetal number, and assist in predicting foeto-placental viability. 3adairy cows 3apregnancy 3ablood proteins 3afetus 3aviability 2aAnimals 2aCattlexblood 2aFemale 2aFetal Deathxveterinary. 2aGestational Age 2aMale 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Proteinsxblood 2aPregnancy, Animalxblood 2aPregnancy, Multiplexblood 2aRadioimmunoassayxveterinary 0atwinning1 aCamous, S.1 aTakenouchi, N.1 aTakahashi, T.1 aHirako, M.1 aSasaki, N.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1998 , v. 65, no. 3 p.195-199x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03653naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245013700158300001600295500002400311500001500335520189500350650002102245650002502266650002802291650001402319650001602333650002902349650001202378650001702390650002102407650001802428650001902446650001602465650001102481650001602492650002702508650001802535650002702553650001702580650001202597650001702609650001802626650001802644650001202662650001302674650000702687650002502694650002002719650002502739650001302764653001502777700001202792700001802804700001902822700001302841773010402854852000902958856004802967655001203015IND4456863520221121152126.0110417e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445686352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-011-0548-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Xuan10aIsolation and characterization of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria from walnut and their effect on growth and phosphorus mobilization  ap. 437-446.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objectives of this work were to isolate and characterize walnut phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) and to evaluate the effect of inoculation with the selected PSB stains to walnut seedlings fertilized with or without insoluble phosphate. Thirty-four PSB strains were isolated and identified under the genera Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Bacillus, Cupriavidus, Agrobacterium, Acinetobacter, Arthrobacter, Pantoea, and Rhodococcus through a comparison of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequences. All isolated PSB strains could solubilize tricalcium phosphate (TCP) in solid and liquid media. Phosphate-solubilizing activity of these strains was associated with a drop in the pH of medium. A significantly negative linear correlation was found between culture pH and phosphorus (P) solubilized from inorganic phosphate. Three isolates Pseudomonas chlororaphis (W24), Bacillus cereus (W9), and Pseudomonas fluorescens (W12) were selected for shade house assays because of their higher phosphate-solubilizing abilities. Under shade house conditions, application of W24 or W12 remarkably improved plant height, shoot and root dry weight, and P and nitrogen (N) uptake of walnut seedlings. These increases were higher on combined inoculation of PSB with TCP addition. The most pronounced beneficial effect on growth of walnut plants was observed in the co-inoculation of the three PSB strains with TCP addition. In comparison, the isolate of W9 failed to increase available soil P, nutrient levels in plants, or to promote plant growth, suggesting that more insoluble phosphate compounds than tricalcium phosphate should be used as substrates to assess the phosphate-solubilizing ability of PSB under greenhouse conditions. The present results indicated that strains P. chlororaphis or P. fluorescens could be considered for the formulation of new inoculants of walnut, even of more woody plants. 3anutrient content 3ainorganic phosphorus 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aseedlings 3aCupriavidus 3aPseudomonas chlororaphis 3awalnuts 3aArthrobacter 3aStenotrophomonas 3aAgrobacterium 3asolubilization 3agreenhouses 3ashoots 3acorrelation 3afertilizer application 3aribosomal DNA 3aRhodococcus (bacteria) 3aplant growth 3arooting 3awoody plants 3aAcinetobacter 3aculture media 3aPantoea 3anitrogen 3apH 3anucleotide sequences 3aBacillus cereus 3atricalcium phosphate 3abacteria 0aphosphorus1 aLiu, Xu1 aZhu, Tian Hui1 aLiu, Guang Hai1 aMao, Cui0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2011 May, v. 47, no. 4 p.437-446dSpringer-Verlagx0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-011-0548-2 7aarticle01531naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009300124300001600217520071000233650001100943650001500954650001600969650002500985650002401010650002601034700001901060773008401079852000901163930003301172945001301205946001101218655001201229IND2198946020221121152111.0990526e199812  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219894602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDorny, P.10aEvaluation of a macro method for the routine determination of serum pepsinogen in cattle  ap. 259-262.  aEstimation of serum pepsinogen concentration in cattle is used to aid the detection of clinical or subclinical infections with the abomasal nematode Ostertagia ostertagi. An inexpensive, simple micro method for the routine determination of pepsinogen concentration in bovine serum samples is described which is based on the hydrolysing effect of serum on buffered bovine albumin substrate. Comparison of this assay with a macro method, based on the same principle, gave almost identical results in the range of 0 to 10 Units tyrosine. The reproducibility of the assay was shown to be very satisfactory, intra-assay and day-to-day coefficients of variations were less than 4.7 and 8 per cent, respectively. 3acattle 3apepsinogen 3ablood serum 3aOstertagia ostertagi 3anematode infections 3adiagnostic techniques1 aVercruysse, J.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1998 , v. 65, no. 3 p.259-262x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03352naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245016500142300001600307520177600323650001002099650003602109650002402145650001702169650001502186650002302201650000902224650001902233650006602252650008002318650001202398650002302410650003602433650000902469650002702478650001502505650003702520650001002557650006502567650001402632700001502646700001902661700001602680773008402696852000902780930003302789945001302822946001102835655001202846IND2197256920221121152043.0990226e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219725692DNAL7 a98398972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRioux, S.10aEvaluation of the protective efficacy of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 detoxified lipopolysaccharides or O-polysaccharide-protein conjugate in pigs  ap. 165-167.  aThe major adhesin of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, has been previously identified as the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Experiments in our laboratory have shown that mice immunised with different A pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 LPS preparations were protected against a challenge with a virulent A pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 isolate. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the protection of pigs against experimental A pleuropneumoniae infection following immunisation with two of these LPS preparations. Groups of five specific pathogen free (SPF) pigs were injected twice with one of the following antigen preparations: detoxified LPS, O-polysaccharide-BSA conjugate, a commercial bacterin, or PBS. Two weeks after the second injection, pigs were challenged intranasally with a virulent A pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 strain. Upon macroscopic examination, fibrino-haemorrhagic pleuropneumonia, compatible with A pleuropneumoniae infection, was observed in one to four pigs in each group. The more extensive lesions were present in control, unimmunised pigs and in animals vaccinated with the O-polysaccharide-BSA conjugate. The highest survival rate was recorded when the pigs had been immunised with detoxified LPS or the commercial bacterin. Taken together, our results suggest that a protection comparable with the one obtained with a commercial bacterin was observed when pigs were immunised with a single class of molecules, detoxified LPS. Most importantly, these results confirm the important role of A pleuropneumoniae LPS in protection against porcine pleuropneumonia. Finally, our results also support the idea that mice are not an appropriate model for the evaluation of porcine pleuropneumonia vaccines. 3aswine 3aActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae 3alipopolysaccharides 3aimmunization 3aMycoplasma 3adisease prevention 3amice 3adisease models 2aActinobacillus Infectionsximmunologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aActinobacillus pleuropneumoniaexclassificationximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Vaccines 2aLipopolysaccharidesximmunology 2aMice 2aO Antigensximmunology 2aSerotyping 2aSpecific Pathogen-Free Organisms 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesximmunologyxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aVirulence1 aGirard, C.1 aDubreuil, J.D.1 aJacques, M.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1998 , v. 65, no. 2 p.165-167x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02982naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001100144245012200155300001600277500001500293520167900308650002701987650001902014650001902033650002702052650002102079650001502100650002202115650001402137653001502151653001802166653001702184653002802201700001602229700001702245700001602262700001702278700001502295700001302310700002102323773007802344852000902422930003302431945002502464946001102489655001202500IND4383193320221121121733.0060829e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438319332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Immunocytochemical and biochemical analyses were carried out to characterize the poorly understood viroplasms of the phytoreovirus Rice dwarf virus (RDV). Within 6 h of inoculation of cells, viroplasms, namely discrete cytoplasmic inclusions, were formed that contained the non-structural proteins Pns6, Pns11 and Pns12 of RDV, which appeared to be the constituents of the inclusions. Formation of similar inclusions in non-host insect cells upon expression of Pns12 in a baculovirus system and the association of molecules of Pns12 in vitro suggested that the inclusions observed in RDV-infected cells were composed basically of Pns12. Core proteins P1, P3, P5 and P7 and core virus particles were identified in the interior region of the inclusions. In contrast, accumulation of the outer capsid proteins P2, P8 and P9 and of intact virus particles was evident in the peripheral regions of the inclusions. These observations suggest that core particles were constructed inside the inclusions, whereas outer capsid proteins were assembled at the periphery of the inclusions. Viral inclusions were shown to be the sites of viral RNA synthesis by labelling infected cells with 5-bromouridine 5'-triphosphate. The number of viroplasms decreased with time post-inoculation as their sizes increased, suggesting that inclusions might fuse with one another during the virus-propagation process. Our results are consistent with a model, proposed for vertebrate reoviruses, in which viroplasms play a pivotal role in virus assembly. 3acytoplasmic inclusions 3ainsect vectors 3aviral proteins 3aNephotettix cincticeps 3aRice dwarf virus 3acell lines 3avirus replication 3ainfection 0aviroplasms 0aPns12 protein 0acell biology 0anon-structural proteins1 aShimizu, T.1 aHagiwara, K.1 aKikuchi, A.1 aMoriyasu, Y.1 aSuzuki, N.1 aChen, H.1 aOhmura, Takashi.0 tJournal of general virology.g2006 Feb., v. 87 p.429-438x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20060911b20061003c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/09/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02168naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245006400187300001600251500001500267520102400282650001601306650001801322650001801340650001201358650001401370650002201384650001801406653001001424653001701434653000901451700002601460700002301486773012101509852000901630856008501639930003301724946001301757655001201770IND4436373020221121121720.0100430e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443637302DNAL7 a201913732pmid7 a10.1007/s10158-010-0097-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Robert J. 12aA review of FMRFamide- and RFamide-like peptides in metazoa  ap. 111-153.  a2019-12-04  aNeuropeptides are a diverse class of signalling molecules that are widely employed as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in animals, both invertebrate and vertebrate. However, despite their fundamental importance to animal physiology and behaviour, they are much less well understood than the small molecule neurotransmitters. The neuropeptides are classified into families according to similarities in their peptide sequence; and on this basis, the FMRFamide and RFamide-like peptides, first discovered in molluscs, are an example of a family that is conserved throughout the animal phyla. In this review, the literature on these neuropeptides has been consolidated with a particular emphasis on allowing a comparison between data sets in phyla as diverse as coelenterates and mammals. The intention is that this focus on the structure and functional aspects of FMRFamide and RFamide-like neuropeptides will inform understanding of conserved principles and distinct properties of signalling across the animal phyla. 3avertebrates 3aneuropeptides 3ainvertebrates 2aAnimals 2aFMRFamide 2aLysophospholipids 2aNeuropeptides 0aPhyla 0aNeuropeptide 0aFaRP1 aPapaioannou, Sylvana 1 aHolden-Dye, Lindy 0 tInvertebrate neuroscience.g2009 Dec., v. 9, no. 3-4 p.111-153dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1354-25167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10158-010-0097-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01984naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245008600185300001600271520079300287650001501080650001201095650001401107650001501121650002401136650001101160650002301171653002801194653002301222653001801245653002701263700001301290700001901303773012601322852000901448856008501457930003301542946001101575655001201586IND4434958220221121121652.0100402e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443495822DNAL7 a196852432pmid7 a10.1007/s00285-009-0290-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriedman, Avner 10aCell cycle control at the first restriction point and its effect on tissue growth  ap. 881-907.  aCell cycle is controlled at two restriction points, R ₁ and R ₂. At both points the cell will commit apoptosis if it detects irreparable damage. But at R ₁ an undamaged cell also decides whether to proceed to the S phase or go into a quiescent mode, depending on the environmental conditions (e.g., overpopulation, hypoxia). We consider the effect of this decision at the population level in a spherical tissue {r < R(t)}. We prove that if the cells have full control at R ₁, they can manipulate the size of R(t) to ensure that 0 < c ≤ R(t) ≤ C < ∞; simulations further show that R(t) can be made nearly stationary. In the absence of such control, R(t) will either increase to ∞ or decrease to 0.

If so, a lower survival should be expected for the male sex. From 1986 to 2000, 1801 carcasses of chamois were collected in the Maritime Alps Regional Park, Italy, where a protected, healthy, stable population of chamois occurred (c. 12 individuals 100 ha⁻¹). Each year, population structure from carcasses was consistent with that from the count carried out on the preceding year on live individuals. Demographic features (assessed from mortality data, as well as from live counts) showed a balanced age structure and a good adult survival (10% individuals older than 11 years). Mortality peaks showed a cyclic pattern of 3-4 years. Winter severity and local density affected survival, with no significant difference between sexes. The number of carcasses was dependent on the combination of snow depth and mean temperature, in winter. Both sexes showed nearly the same survivorship curves, with a quite similar life expectancy in the first year (males=6.8 years, females=7.0 years), and the same maximum age at death (16 years), as it may be expected in a monomorphic, monogamous species. This is, however, a rare event among polygynous species, with a high male competition for females and male juvenile dispersion, which normally affect male survival. The similar adult survival of the two sexes could be explained by comparable energetic costs and risks for reproduction, or through greater fat reserves put on by males, before the rut, which may lower their winter mortality. 3apolygyny 3ameat carcasses 3achamois 0asurvival rate 0alive counts1 aCanavese, G.1 aLovari, S.0 tJournal of zoology.g2010 Apr., v. 280, no. 4 p.379-386dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2009.00672.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100326b20100403c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02248naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011700163300001800280520113900298653003801437653003201475653004001507653002801547700002001575700002201595700002301617700002101640773012301661852000901784856008501793930003301878946001101911655001201922IND4437801020221121091208.0100528e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443780102DNAL7 a10.1007/s00396-010-2221-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImai, Yosuke 10aStudy on surface adsorption from cationic surfactant-electrolyte mixed aqueous solution including BF ₄ ⁻ ion  ap. 1005-1011.  aThe surface tension of aqueous mixtures of dodecyltrimethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (DTABF₄) and sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF₄) was measured as a function of total molality and composition of DTABF₄ at 298.15 K. The results were analyzed by originally developed thermodynamic equations and compared with those of dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB)-sodium bromide (NaBr) mixed system. It was indicated that BF ₄ ⁻ ions reduce the repulsion between DTA⁺ ions more effectively than Br⁻ ions in the adsorbed film. To investigate this difference more closely, the surface tension of DTAB-NaBF₄ and DTABF₄-NaBr mixed system was also measured. The data analysis revealed that BF ₄ ⁻ ions are adsorbed positively even for the pure NaBF₄ system and preferentially to Br⁻ ions in these mixtures. Furthermore, it was concluded that the side-by-side arrangement suggested in the adsorbed film of 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (HMIMBF₄) is due to not only the positive adsorption of BF ₄ ⁻ ions but also the capability of hydrogen bond formation between imidazolium ion and BF ₄ ⁻ ions. 0aAdsorbed film of ionic surfactant 0aSurface tension measurement 0aAdsorption of counterion to surface 0aSolvation of counterion1 aShimamoto, Kei 1 aTakiue, Takanori 1 aMatsubara, Hiroki 1 aAratono, Makoto 0 tColloid & polymer science.g2010 June, v. 288, no. 9 p.1005-1011dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0303-402X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00396-010-2221-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02123naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001200144245009000156300001800246500001500264520097000279650004101249650001701290650002501307650002201332650002401354650003301378650002601411653002201437653001701459653001901476653003001495653001701525700001301542773008001555852000901635930003301644945002501677946001101702655001201713IND4383174420221121091204.0060828e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438317442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Herein, the characterization of VP24, a major structural protein of WSSV, is described. When purified virions were subjected to Nonidet P-40 treatment to separate the envelopes from the nucleocapsids, VP24 was found to be present exclusively in the envelope fraction. Triton X-114 extraction also indicated that VP24 behaves as an envelope protein. Immunoelectron microscopy further confirmed that VP24 is located in the virion envelope. Far-Western experiments showed that VP24 interacts with VP28, another major envelope protein of the WSSV virion. To investigate the function of VP24, WSSV was neutralized with various amounts of anti-VP24 IgG and injected into crayfish. The results showed that anti-VP24 IgG could partially attenuate infection with WSSV. It is concluded that VP24 is an envelope protein and functions at an early stage in virus infection. 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3anucleocapsid 3ainvertebrate viruses 3acytopathogenicity 3aProcambarus clarkii 3aprotein-protein interactions 3anucleocapsid proteins 0aenvelope proteins 0aVP28 protein 0aviral proteins 0aWhite spot syndrome virus 0aVP24 protein1 aYang, F.0 tJournal of general virology.g2006 July, v. 87 p.1903-1908x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20060913b20061003c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/09/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02239naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001100144245008100155300001800236520096300254650002501217650001901242650003901261650002201300650002501322650001801347650001401365650002401379650002101403650003301424650001001457650002501467653003001492653001801522653003001540653002801570700001201598700001301610773008001623852000901703930003301712945002501745946001101770655001201781IND4383174620221121091142.0060828e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438317462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLi, L.10aCharacterization of an envelope protein (VP110) of White spot syndrome virus  ap. 1909-1915.  aA protein of 110 kDa (termed VP110) from the envelope fraction of White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) was identified by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. The resulting amino acid sequence matched an open reading frame (wsv035) containing an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif in the WSSV genome database. To validate the mass-spectrometry result, the C-terminal segment of the wsv035 open reading frame was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein, which was used to produce specific antibody. Analysis by Western blotting and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that VP110 was an envelope protein of WSSV. An interaction analysis was performed between VP110 and the host cells, using a fluorescence assay and a competitive-inhibition assay. The results showed that VP110 was capable of attaching to host cells and that adhesion could be inhibited by synthetic RGDT peptides, suggesting that the RGD motif in the VP110 sequence may play a role in WSSV infection. 3ainvertebrate viruses 3aviral proteins 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3amass spectrometry 3aamino acid sequences 3acell adhesion 3ainfection 3aProcambarus clarkii 3aWestern blotting 3aprotein-protein interactions 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 0aWhite spot syndrome virus 0aVP110 protein 0aimmunoelectron microscopy 0amolecular sequence data1 aLin, S.1 aYang, F.0 tJournal of general virology.g2006 July, v. 87 p.1909-1915x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20060913b20061003c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/09/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03060naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245006400192300001600256520147400272650002501746650001701771650001201788650005801800650005601858650003201914650002601946650001101972650003901983650004102022650002802063650002802091650002402119650005502143650002902198653001002227653002002237653000802257653002402265700002502289773011902314852000902433856009202442930003302534946001102567655001202578IND4431068220221121091120.0100111e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443106822DNAL7 a201930072pmid7 a10.1111/j.0105-2896.2009.00857.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalsh, Nicole C.10aBone remodeling in rheumatic disease: a question of balance  ap. 301-312.  aThe past decade has observed an explosion of new information regarding the impact of inflammation on bone. In rheumatic diseases, several factors that act as both immune modulators and regulators of bone homeostasis have been shown to mediate an imbalance in bone resorption and bone formation resulting in joint degeneration. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), focal bone loss is due to excess bone resorption by osteoclasts. Resorption is mediated in part by increased local expression of the cytokine receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) compared with expression of its decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG). Bone formation by osteoblasts is also impaired at erosion sites in RA, and inhibitors of the canonical Wingless (Wnt) signaling pathway, including DKK1, have been implicated in the suppression of normal osteoblast function at these sites. Inhibition of DKK1 in an animal model of RA attenuated bone erosion by increasing OPG expression as well as promoting bone formation. In contrast to RA, inflammation in the spondyloarthropathies often results in excess periosteal bone formation, highlighting that the net impact of inflammation on bone is specific to the site at which inflammation occurs, and the cell types, cytokines, and factors present within the local bone microenvironment. This fertile area of research bears watching for the identification of novel targets for the prevention of abnormal bone remodeling in inflammatory diseases. 3arheumatoid arthritis 3ainflammation 2aAnimals 2aArthritis, Experimentalximmunologyxphysiopathology. 2aArthritis, Rheumatoidximmunologyxphysiopathology. 2aBone Remodelingximmunology 2aCytokinesximmunology 2aHumans 2aInflammation Mediatorsximmunology 2aJointsximmunologyxphysiopathology. 2aOsteoblastsximmunology 2aOsteoclastsximmunology 2aSignal Transduction 2aSpondylarthropathiesximmunologyxphysiopathology. 2aWnt Proteinsximmunology 0aRANKL 0aosteoprotegerin 0aWnt 0aspondyloarthropathy1 aGravallese, Ellen M.0 tImmunological reviews.g2010 Jan., v. 233, no. 1 p.301-312dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0105-2896.2009.00857.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100111b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01940naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001100144245014800155300001800303520076500321650002001086650002301106650002501129650002201154650002501176650002201201650001901223650002501242650002101267650003501288653003501323653001601358700001001374773008001384852000901464930003301473945002501506946001101531655001201542IND4383176020221121091156.0060828e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438317602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Despite a number of therapeutic advancements, there is still an urgent need to develop a new class of therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Here, it was shown that 1'S-1'-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA), a small molecular compound isolated from the rhizomes of Alpinia galanga, inhibited Rev transport at a low concentration by binding to chromosomal region maintenance 1 and accumulating full-length HIV-1 RNA in the nucleus, resulting in a block in HIV-1 replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Additionally, ACA and didanosine acted synergistically to inhibit HIV-1 replication. Thus, ACA may represent a novel treatment for HIV-1 infection, especially in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. 3aAlpinia galanga 3aphenolic compounds 3aantiviral properties 3avirus replication 3ametabolic inhibitors 3aprotein transport 3aviral proteins 3aRNA-binding proteins 3amedicinal plants 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 0a1'S-1'-acetoxychavicol acetate 0aRev protein1 aLi B.0 tJournal of general virology.g2006 July, v. 87 p.2047-2053x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20060913b20061003c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/09/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03961naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009900164300001600263500001500279520254100294650002102835650002102856650001802877650001402895650002002909650001902929650001202948650002002960650001502980650002102995650001303016650001903029650003403048650001903082653002103101653003703122653001703159653001103176653000903187700002003196773012503216852000903341856008503350930003303435946001103468655001203479IND4438848020221121091121.0100619e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443884802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-010-0216-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Shiqiang 10aPhytoremediation for soils contaminated by phenanthrene and pyrene with multiple plant species  ap. 886-894.  a2019-12-04  aPurpose The remediation of soil polluted by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is of great importance due to the persistence and carcinogenic properties of PAHs. Phytoremediation has been regarded as a promising alternative among suggested approaches. For the establishment of highly effective remediation method and better understanding of the remediation mechanisms by plants, the potentials of three plant species and their planting patterns on the remediation efficacy were studied by pot experiments. Materials and methods Soils were amended with phenanthrene (Phe) or pyrene (Pyr) at five levels ranging from 0∼322 mg kg⁻¹, then incubated for 30 days. At each level of PAHs, four treatments were set as: (a) treatments 1, no plant and microbe-inhibited with addition of 0.1%NaN₃; (b) treatments 2, no plant and without the addition of NaN₃; (c) treatments 3, microbe-inhibited and planted; (d) treatments 4, planted and without inhibition of microbes. For each planted treatment, single cropping of rape (Medicago sativa), alfalfa (Brassica campestris), and white clover (Trifolium repens), and mixed cropping of rape with alfalfa and white clover were adapted. Seedlings of 7 days old were then cultivated. After 70 days cultivation, soil and plant of each treatment were sampled for analyses of PAHs. Results and discussion Rape, alfalfa, and white clover all significantly promoted the degradation of PAHs in soils; alfalfa and white clover showed higher efficiencies for the removal of PAHs. Averagely, about 41.46% of Phe or 33.69% of Pyr were removed from soils after 70-day plantation of alfalfa, and 38.75% of Phe or 36.29% of Pyr removed by white clover, as compared to the much lower degradation rates of 22.57% of Phe or 18.24% of Pyr for non-planted controls. Mixed cropping significantly enhanced the remediation efficiencies as compared to single cropping; about 74.87% of Phe or 62.81% of Pyr were removed by mixed cropping of rape and alfalfa, and 72.01% of Phe or 68.44% of Pyr by mixed cropping of rape and white clover. Conclusions The presence of vegetation significantly promoted the dissipation of Phe or Pyr in soils and remediation efficiency varied greatly among plant species and cropping patterns. Rape had the lowest ability for the removal of PAHs, while alfalfa showed highest ability for the remediation of Phe and white clover was most effective for Pyr. Mixed cropping of rape with alfalfa or white clover was however far better for the remediation of soil PAHs than single cropping. 3asoil remediation 3aTrifolium repens 3aphenanthrenes 3aseedlings 3aMedicago sativa 3amicroorganisms 3aalfalfa 3asoil amendments 3avegetation 3aphytoremediation 3aplanting 3amixed cropping 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3apolluted soils 0aCropping pattern 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aphenanthrene 0aPyrene 0aPAHs1 aPan, Shengwang 0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2010 July, v. 10, no. 5 p.886-894dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-010-0216-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02401naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001800193245007500211300001400286520113700300653002001437653004001457653003501497653002701532653004501559653005201604700001501656700001601671700002001687700001101707700002101718700001901739773014501758852000901903856009201912946001102004655001202015IND4439659920221121091155.0100709e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443965992DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1747-0285.2010.00996.x2doi7 aPMC29085322pmcid7 a205609782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Zunnan10aDerivatives of Salicylic Acid as Inhibitors of YopH in Yersinia pestis  ap. 85-99.  aYersinia pestis causes diseases ranging from gastrointestinal syndromes to bubonic plague and could be misused as a biological weapon. As its protein tyrosine phosphatase YopH has already been demonstrated as a potential drug target, we have developed two series of forty salicylic acid derivatives and found sixteen to have micromolar inhibitory activity. We designed these ligands to have two chemical moieties connected by a flexible hydrocarbon linker to target two pockets in the active site of the protein to achieve binding affinity and selectivity. One moiety possessed the salicylic acid core intending to target the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket. The other moiety contained different chemical fragments meant to target a nearby secondary pocket. The two series of compounds differed by having hydrocarbon linkers with different lengths. Before experimental co-crystal structures are available, we have performed molecular docking to predict how these compounds might bind to the protein and to generate structural models for performing binding affinity calculation to aid future optimization of these series of compounds. 0aclick chemistry 0adistance-dependent dielectric model 0adocking by simulated annealing 0aGeneralized Born model 0areceiver operating characteristics curve 0asensitivity and specificity of screening models1 aHe, Yantao1 aZhang, Xian1 aGunawan, Andrea1 aWu, Li1 aZhang, Zhong-Yin1 aWong, Chung F.0 tChemical biology & drug design.g2010 Aug., v. 76, no. 2 p.85-99dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3895937x1747-02857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0285.2010.00996.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle01498naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245010400205300001400309520043100323650001600754650002100770653001200791653001400803653001600817700001700833700002800850700001500878773011700893852000901010856008501019930003301104946001101137655001201148IND4436794120221121064521.0100507e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443679412DNAL7 a10.1007/s12104-009-9201-52doi7 aPMC36314262pmcid7 a199410922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarb, Adam W. 10aAssignment of ¹H, ¹³C and ¹⁵N backbone resonances of Escherichia coli LpxC bound to L-161,240  ap. 37-40.  aThe UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase LpxC catalyzes the committed reaction of lipid A biosynthesis, an essential pathway in Gram-negative bacteria.

In this study, a full-pedigreed population was produced from male and female grandparent breeding stock that was selected by haematocrit and by normal selection parameters. Matings were made between low (L), medium (M) and high (H) haematocrit parents: L x L, M x M, and H x H. In their progeny, both before and after cold exposure, there was a statistically linear relationship between actual haematocrit and their H, M and L grouping (P<0.0001); heritability of the haematocrit was high (0.46-0.81). Both the low haematocrit parent and progeny groups showed an increased bodyweight. Exposure of the progeny from all the parental groups to an ascites-predisposing cold environment caused similar losses from ascites in the progeny of all three groups. Although this finding was not the same as in the previous trial where the H haematocrit group was associated with high ascites mortality, it is hypothesized that other factors, such as arterial blood saturation with oxygen, interacted in these birds at genetic or environmental levels. 3abroiler chickens 3aselection criteria 3aheritability 3aascites 3adisease resistance 3acold stress 3aprogeny 3amortality 3abody weight 3ahematocrit 2aAnimals 2aAscitesxgeneticsxmortalityxveterinary. 2aBody Weight 2aBreedingxmethods 2aChickensxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHematocrit 2aLeast-Squares Analysis 2aMale 2aPoultry Diseasesxgeneticsxmortality. 0apredisposition1 aBellaiche, M.1 aBerman, E.1 aPerk, S.1 aDeeb, N.1 aNeumark, E.1 aCahaner, A.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1998 , v. 64, no. 2 p.105-109x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02482naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245011400147300001600261520096200277650001101239650001101250650001701261650001501278650001301293650003101306650001201337650001101349650002501360650001101385650004101396650002101437650001101458650002601469650000901495650006001504650008501564650002601649650003101675653001901706653002601725653002401751700001601775700002301791773008401814852000901898930003301907945001301940946001101953655001201964IND2196041320221121054918.0981217e199803  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219604132DNAL7 a96254732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, C.H.10aClose relationship between equine and human molluscum contagiosum virus demonstrated by in situ hybridisation  ap. 157-161.  aTo determine whether the virus responsible for human molluscum contagiosum (MCV) is the causal agent of a similar disease in horses, in situ hybridisations using cloned fragments of human MCV DNA labelled with digoxigenin were carried out on formalin-fixed biopsy sections of lesions from two horses with molluscum contagiosum-like skin lesions. In both instances there was evidence of specific hybridisation of the labelled probe to target DNA in the sections under high stringency conditions, identified by the development of a deep blue-purple stain in the cytoplasm of cells in the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum of the lesions and the absence of non-specific hybridisation in adjacent non-lesional areas of the epidermis. These results indicate that on the basis of very close homology of their viral DNA sequences, the causative virus of equine molluscum contagiosum is either identical with, or very closely related to, its human equivalent. 3ahorses 3ahumans 3askin lesions 3aPoxviridae 3aetiology 3anucleic acid hybridization 2aAnimals 2aBiopsy 2aDNA, Viralxanalysis 2aFemale 2aHorse Diseasesxpathologyxvirology. 2aHorsesxvirology 2aHumans 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aMale 2aMolluscum Contagiosumxpathologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aMolluscum contagiosum virusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSkinxpathologyxvirology. 0aidentification 0amolluscum contagiosum 0across hybridization1 aYager, J.A.1 aVan Rensburg, I.B.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1998 , v. 64, no. 2 p.157-161x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02290naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245013000163300001800293500002400311520108700335650002801422650002501450650001401475650001701489650003801506650004301544650002101587650001201608650002001620700001601640700001601656700001701672700001801689700001701707773012301724852000901847856004801856655001201904IND4442562420221121043311.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444256242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-010-1604-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fengyan10aBlooming in Cocoa Butter Substitutes Based Compound Chocolate: Investigations on Composition, Morphology and Melting Behavior  ap. 1137-1143.  aIncludes references  aTo provide a comprehensive analysis on the development of bloom on cocoa butter substitutes based compound chocolate, the morphology, chemical composition and melting behavior were examined.

This was confirmed qualitatively by using high performance liquid chromatography and differential scanning calorimetry, where different contents of triacylglycerols and melting behavior were observed in the bloom and the chocolate matrix. Moreover, polymorphism translation from β′ form to β form appeared in the bloom but did not in the chocolate matrix, which suggesting that polymorphism translation is the result rather than the cause of bloom formation. 3aatomic force microscopy 3achemical composition 3achocolate 3acocoa butter 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alight microscopy 3amelting 3apolarized light1 aLiu, Yuanfa1 aShan, Liang1 aJin, Qingzhe1 aWang, Xingguo1 aLi, Lingling0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2010 Oct., v. 87, no. 10 p.1137-1143dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-010-1604-z 7aarticle03577naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002500146245012800171300001600299500001500315520173100330650002102061650001202082650002502094650001902119650001202138650001602150650001902166650001502185650002402200650005102224650002002275650002802295650002502323650003602348650007002384650001102454650002202465650001102487650001802498650002002516650002502536650000902561650004902570650001502619650001502634650001702649653001802666700001302684700001202697700001402709700001502723700001802738773010302756852000902859930003302868945002502901946001302926655001202939IND4380143320221121032627.0060511e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438014332DNAL7 a165671522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNeumark-Sztainer, D.10aObesity, disordered eating, and eating disorders in a longitudinal study of adolescents: How do dieters fare 5 years later?  ap. 559-568.  a2019-12-05  aObjective: To determine if adolescents who report dieting and different weight-control behaviors are at increased or decreased risk for gains in body mass index, overweight status, binge eating, extreme weight-control behaviors, and eating disorders 5 years later. Design: Population-based 5-year longitudinal study. Participants: Adolescents (N=2,516) from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds who completed Project EAT (Eating Among Teens) surveys in 1999 (Time 1) and 2004 (Time 2). Main Outcome Measures: Weight status, binge eating, extreme weight control, and self-reported eating disorder. Statistical Analysis: Multiple linear and logistic regressions. Results: Adolescents using unhealthful weight-control behaviors at Time 1 increased their body mass index by about 1 unit more than adolescents not using any weight-control behaviors and were at approximately three times greater risk for being overweight at Time 2 (odds ratio [OR]=2.7 for girls; OR=3.2 for boys). Adolescents using unhealthful weight-control behaviors were also at increased risk for binge eating with loss of control (OR=6.4 for girls; OR=5.9 for boys) and for extreme weight-control behaviors such as self-induced vomiting and use of diet pills, laxatives, and diuretics (OR=2.5 for girls; OR=4.8 for boys) 5 years later, compared with adolescents not using any weight-control behaviors. Conclusions: Dieting and unhealthful weight-control behaviors predict outcomes related to obesity and eating disorders 5 years later. A shift away from dieting and drastic weight-control measures toward the long-term implementation of healthful eating and physical activity behaviors is needed to prevent obesity and eating disorders in adolescents. 3aeating disorders 3adieting 3alongitudinal studies 3ahuman behavior 3aobesity 3aadolescents 3aweight control 2aAdolescent 2aAdolescent Behavior 2aAdolescent Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aConfidence Intervals 2aDiet, Reducingxadverse effects 2aFeeding and Eating Disordersxepidemiologyxetiologyxpsychology. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aLogistic Models 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aObesityxepidemiologyxetiologyxpsychology. 2aOdds Ratio 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Factors 0aeating habits1 aWall, M.1 aGuo, J.1 aStory, M.1 aHaines, J.1 aEisenberg, M.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2006 Apr., v. 106, no. 4 p.559-568x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL  a20080612b20080704c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/07/17  aOther US 7aarticle02908naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100003000146245016000176300001600336500001500352520103500367650002001402650001401422650000901436650002301445650001201468650001701480650001101497650001801508650001401526650001001540650002701550650001001577650001001587650005001597650002401647650001001671650002201681650004101703650003701744650004501781650001101826650002201837650002001859650001101879650000901890650002401899650001001923650001701933650002701950653000901977653001501986653002602001700002102027700001502048773010302063852000902166930003302175945002502208946001302233655001202246IND4380146620221121032644.0060511e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438014662DNAL7 a165671572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This study examined the feasibility of substituting okra gum for 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% milk fat in frozen chocolate dairy dessert. Fifty-six consumers evaluated the frozen dairy desserts using a hedonic scale. Consumers rated color, smell, texture, flavor, aftertaste, and overall acceptability characteristics of all products as acceptable. All ratings were similar among the products except for the aftertaste rating, which was significantly lower for chocolate frozen dairy dessert containing 100% milk-fat replacement with okra gum compared with the control (0% milk-fat replacement) (P<0.05). Whereas melting points of all products were similar, melting rates slowed significantly as milk-fat replacement with okra gum increased, suggesting that okra gum may increase the stability of frozen dairy desserts (P<0.05). Overall, this study shows that okra gum is an acceptable milk-fat ingredient substitute in chocolate frozen dairy dessert. 3afat substitutes 3achocolate 3aokra 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3afood quality 3aflavor 3amelting point 3aice cream 3ataste 2aAbelmoschusxchemistry 2aAdult 2aCacao 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxprevention & control 2aChemistry, Physical 2aColor 2aConsumer Behavior 2aDairy Productsxanalysisxstandards. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFat Substitutesxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aFood Preservation 2aFood Technology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aTaste 2aTime Factors 2aTransition Temperature 0agums 0aaftertaste 0afrozen dairy products1 aCostantino, A.C.1 aGunn, L.H.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2006 Apr., v. 106, no. 4 p.594-597x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL  a20080612b20080704c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/07/17  aOther US 7aarticle03081naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245008500160300001600245520223200261650002602493650002502519650001502544650001802559653001902577773010302596852000902699930003302708945002502741946001302766655001202779IND4380229620221121032548.0060516e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438022962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWansink, B.10aPosition of the American Dietetic Association: food and nutrition misinformation  ap. 601-607.  aIt is the position of the American Dietetic Association (ADA) that food and nutrition misinformation can have harmful effects on the health, well-being, and economic status of consumers. Nationally credentialed dietetics professionals working in health care, academia, public health, the media, government, and the food industry are uniquely qualified to advocate for and promote science-based nutrition information to the public, function as primary nutrition educators to health professionals, and actively correct food and nutrition misinformation. Enormous scientific advances have been made in the area of food and nutrition, leading to a fine-tuning of recommendations about healthful eating. Consumers have become increasingly aware of the nutrition-health link and reliant on nutrition information to base their decisions, and have assumed partial responsibility for changing their eating behaviors. Unfortunately, these same trends also create opportunities for food and nutrition misinformation to flourish. News reports rarely provide enough context for consumers to interpret or apply the advice given, and preliminary findings often attract unmerited and misleading attention. Effective nutrition communication must be consumer-friendly and contain sufficient context to allow consumers to consider the information and determine whether it applies to their unique health and nutritional needs. Consistent with ADA's organizational vision that members “are the leading source of nutrition expertise,” ADA recognizes its responsibility to help consumers identify food and nutrition misinformation in the following ways: (a) ADA members should provide consumers with sound, science-based nutrition information and help them to recognize misinformation; (b) ADA members need to be the primary source of sound, science-based nutrition information for the media and to inform them when misinformation is presented; and (c) ADA members should continue to diligently work with other health care practitioners, educators, policy makers, and food and dietary supplement industry representatives to responsibly address the health and psychological, physiological, and economic effects of nutrition-related misinformation. 3anutrition information 3aconsumer information 3adietitians 3aorganizations 0aposition paper0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2006 Apr., v. 106, no. 4 p.601-607x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL  a20080612b20080704c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/07/17  aOther US 7aarticle02198naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100002100154245008000175300001600255500002400271520102900295650002201324650001601346650000901362650001701371650005901388650002401447650004601471700002201517700002201539700001801561700002501579700002101604700001701625773012301642852000901765856003801774655001201812IND4456422020221121001548.0110408e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445642202DNAL7 a212543282pmid7 a10.1002/ps.20962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalcer, Jesse L.10aSynthesis of new compounds related to the commercial fungicide tricyclazole  ap. 556-559.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Tricyclazole is a commercial fungicide used to control rice blast. As part of re-registration activities, samples of metabolites and process impurities are required. In addition, isotopically labeled tricyclazole samples are also required. RESULTS: Four new compounds related to tricyclazole are reported. An isotopically labeled sample of tricyclazole was prepared that contained two ¹⁵N atoms and one ¹³C atom. Radiolabeled tricyclazole with ¹⁴C at the triazole C3 position was also synthesized. A new process impurity in technical tricyclazole was identified and synthesized. A new metabolite of tricyclazole was identified, independently synthesized and characterized by X-ray crystallography. CONCLUSION: A previously unreported metabolite of tricyclazole has been identified and structurally characterized. In addition, a new process impurity has been identified by independent synthesis. Identification of these new compounds has facilitated the continued registration of this important fungicide. 3aX-ray diffraction 3ametabolites 3arice 3atricyclazole 2aFungicides, Industrialxchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aMolecular Structure 2aThiazolesxchemical synthesisxchemistry.1 aDeAmicis, Carl V.1 aJohnson, Peter L.1 aKlosin, Jerzy1 aWhiteker, Gregory T.1 aSrinivas Rao, C.1 aDai, Donghua0 tPest management science.g2011 May, v. 67, no. 5 p.556-559dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.2096 7aarticle02361naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001300127245014000140300001800280500001500298520108500313650001401398650001101412650001401423650002201437650001701459650002501476650002301501650001901524650001401543653003801557653001501595653001401610653002801624653002601652700001801678700001401696700001701710700001801727773008001745852000901825930003301834945002501867946001101892655001201903IND4397347420221120233751.0071101e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439734742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

ORFV encodes an orthologue of interleukin-10 (IL-10) that, whilst it closely resembles ovine IL-10 (91 % amino acid identity), shows only 75 % amino acid identity to human IL-10 (hIL-10). The anti-inflammatory potential of ORFV IL-10 in human ORFV infection was investigated by examining its immunosuppressive effects on THP-1 monocytes. ORFV IL-10 and hIL-10 were shown to have equivalent inhibitory effects on the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-activated monocytes, but differed in their abilities to inhibit monocyte proliferation. Structural modelling of ORFV IL-10 revealed differences from hIL-10 in residues predicted to interact with IL-10 co-receptor 2 (IL-10R2), whereas there were very few differences in the residues predicted to interact with IL-10R1. These findings suggest that the partial ability of ORFV IL-10 to inhibit THP-1 monocyte proliferation may be due to the absence of critical residues that mediate the interaction with human IL-10R2. 3aOrf virus 3ahumans 3amonocytes 3aimmunosuppression 3ainflammation 3aamino acid sequences 3acell proliferation 3ainterleukin-10 3asynthesis 0aimmunosuppression (physiological) 0ainhibitors 0acytokines 0amolecular sequence data 0ahuman THP-1 monocytes1 aMcCaughan, C.1 aTan, C.K.1 aMercer, A.A.1 aFleming, S.B.0 tJournal of general virology.g2007 June, v. 88 p.1677-1682x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/01/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03027naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245009300187300001800280520175900298650001502057650001602072650001802088650001202106650001402118650001102132650002702143650005802170650002202228653002502250653001002275653002402285700002102309700001802330700002502348773009202373852000902465856008502474930003302559946001302592655001202605IND4442106420221120233628.0100903e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444210642DNAL7 a202216982pmid7 a10.1007/s10495-010-0479-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarg, Abhishek D. 10aPhotodynamic therapy: illuminating the road from cell death towards anti-tumour immunity  ap. 1050-1071.  aPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizes the destructive power of reactive oxygen species generated via visible light irradiation of a photosensitive dye accumulated in the cancerous tissue/cells, to bring about their obliteration. PDT activates multiple signalling pathways in cancer cells, which could give rise to all three cell death modalities (at least in vitro). Simultaneously, PDT is capable of eliciting various effects in the tumour microenvironment thereby affecting the tumour-associated/-infiltrating immune cells and by extension, leading to infiltration of various immune cells (e.g. neutrophils) into the treated site. PDT is also associated to the activation of different immune phenomena, e.g. acute-phase response, complement cascade and production of cytokines/chemokines. It has also come to light that, PDT is capable of activating ‘anti-tumour adaptive immunity' in both pre-clinical as well as clinical settings. Although the ability of PDT to induce ‘anti-cancer vaccine effect' is still debatable, yet it has been shown to be capable of inducing exposure/release of certain damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) like HSP70. Therefore, it seems that PDT is unique among other approved therapeutic procedures in generating a microenvironment suitable for development of systemic anti-tumour immunity. Apart from this, recent times have seen the emergence of certain promising modalities based on PDT like-photoimmunotherapy and PDT-based cancer vaccines. This review mainly discusses the effects exerted by PDT on cancer cells, immune cells as well as tumour microenvironment in terms of anti-tumour immunity. The ability of PDT to expose/release DAMPs and the future perspectives of this paradigm have also been discussed. 3aimmunology 3aneutrophils 3aimmunotherapy 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis 2aHumans 2aImmunityxdrug effects 2aNeoplasmsxdrug therapyximmunologyxphysiopathology. 2aPhotochemotherapy 0aPhotodynamic therapy 0aDAMPs 0aAntitumour immunity1 aNowis, Dominika 1 aGolab, Jakub 1 aAgostinis, Patrizia 0 tApoptosis.g2010 Sept., v. 15, no. 9 p.1050-1071dBoston : Springer USx1360-81857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10495-010-0479-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03122naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245017300165300001600338520192800354650001002282650001302292650004302305653001102348700001802359700002002377700001602397700001902413700001902432700001802451700001802469700001602487773010702503852000902610856008502619930003302704946001102737655001202748IND4446014020221120233739.0101203e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444601402DNAL7 a10.1007/s00125-010-1940-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGjesing, A.

We aimed to study circulating levels of glucose, proinsulin, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) among individuals carrying the high-risk rs7903146 TT genotype and low-risk CC genotype following a meal test. Methods A meal challenge was performed in 31 glucose-tolerant men (age 54 ± 7 years and BMI 26 ± 3 kg/m²) with rs7903146 TT genotype and 31 glucose-tolerant age- and BMI-matched men with CC genotype (age 53 ± 6 years and BMI 26 ± 3 kg/m²). Serum proinsulin, insulin, C-peptide and plasma glucose, glucagon, GLP-1, GLP-2 and GIP were obtained 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 180, 210, and 240 min after ingestion of a standardised breakfast meal. Results An elevated incremental AUC for plasma glucose was observed among TT genotype carriers (CC carriers 21.8 ± 101.9 mmol/l × min vs TT carriers 97.9 ± 89.2 mmol/l × min, p = 0.001). TT carriers also had increased AUCs for proinsulin (CC carriers 6,030 ± 3,001 pmol/l × min vs TT carriers 6,917 ± 4,820 pmol/l × min, p = 0.03), C-peptide (CC carriers 397.6 ± 131.9 nmol/l × min vs TT carriers 417.1 ± 109.3 nmol/l × min, p = 0.04) and GIP (CC carriers 12,310 ± 3,840 pmol/l × min vs TT carriers 14,590 ± 5,910 pmol/l × min, p = 0.004). Conclusions/interpretation Middle-aged normoglycaemic individuals carrying the rs7903146 TCF7L2 risk TT genotype show early signs of dysregulated glucose metabolism, decreased processing of proinsulin and elevated GIP secretion following a meal challenge. 3agenes 3asecretin 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 0aTCF7L21 aKjems, L.

The behavior of these surfactants was studied either as pure components or after their formulation as pseudo-tetra-chain catanionic mixtures with phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and as cationic mixtures with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) used as control. The antimicrobial activity of the negatively charged formulations against Acinetobacter baumannii was maintained with respect to the surfactant alone, while a significant improvement of the antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus was observed, together with a strong decrease of hemolytic activity. The influence of the net charge of the catanionic vesicles on membrane selectivity was studied using model membranes. The dynamics of surface tension changes induced by the addition of 1414RAc/PG aqueous dispersions into phospholipid monolayers composed of zwitterionic DPPC as model system for mammalian membranes and of negatively charged PG mimicking cytoplasmic membrane of Gram-positive bacteria was followed by tensiometry. Our results constitute a proof of principle that tuning formulation can reduce the cytotoxicity of many surfactants, opening their possible biological applications. 3aAcinetobacter baumannii 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanti-infective properties 3acell membranes 3acytotoxicity 3adispersions 3aglycerol 3ahemolysis 3amammals 3aphospholipids 3aphysicochemical properties 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3azwitterions 0aAmino acid-based surfactant 0aAntimicrobial agent 0aPhosphatidylglycerol 0aPseudo-tetra-chain catanionic mixtures 0aDynamic surface tension1 aPérez, Lourdes.1 aPons, Ramon 1 aPinazo, Aurora 0 tAmino acids.g2011 Feb., v. 40, no. 2 p.721-729dVienna : Springer Viennax0939-44517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-010-0710-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02255naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100001400186245014100200300001400341520117600355650001401531650002001545653000801565653001401573700001701587700001901604700001601623773014001639852000901779856008501788939003301873946001101906655001201917IND4449537220221120200021.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444953722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11357-010-9160-x2doi7 aPMC30636392pmcid7 a205827312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHui, Liu 10aVariations in short tandem repeats deduced on the basis of the number of repeats and the relationship of these variations with longevity  ap. 63-68.  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the quantitative characteristics of short tandem repeat (STR) variations deduced on the basis of the number of STRs that are beneficial for human survival. The longevity group included 60 nonagenarian subjects, and the control group included 250 reference adults (age, 20-50 years). Alleles of 15 Combined DNA Index System STR loci were determined using a commercial polymerase chain reaction kit. An STR with the highest frequency distribution in a population (control group) was considered as a conservative STR, and the number of core unit repeats of this STR allele was considered as the median repeat number in the STR locus (STRm). The absolute difference between the STRm and the number of core unit repeats of other STR alleles can be considered as the quantitative marker of variation for that particular STR allele (M value). The mean M values of CSF1TPO in the longevity group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). These findings appear to suggest that at least one of the STR loci may be associated with longevity. The M value of STR may be a new and high-efficacy genetic marker. 3alongevity 3agenetic markers 0aSTR 0aVariation1 aWeijian, Yu 1 aXuelian, Deng 1 aQigui, Liu 0 tAge: the journal of the American Aging Association.g2011 Mar., v. 33, no. 1 p.63-68dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0161-91527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11357-010-9160-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03026naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245006900168300001800237500001500255520202600270650002402296650001402320650001702334653001402351653001702365653001802382700002402400700001302424773011302437852000902550856008502559930003302644946001102677655001202688IND4445193920221120200307.0101113e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444519392DNAL7 a10.1007/s00198-010-1236-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchlüssel, M.

The association of birth weight with bone parameters was much more evident for bone mineral content (BMC) rather than bone mineral density (BMD). This is an important finding since a reduction in BMC is strongly associated with an increased risk of fractures. Introduction The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review of studies that have investigated the association between birth weight (BW) and adult bone mass. Methods The search included English language articles, indexed in MEDLINE, using the key words: (“birth size” OR “birth weight” OR birthweight) AND (osteoporosis OR “bone mass” OR “bone density” OR “bone mineral density” OR “bone mineral content” OR “bone area”). A methodological quality appraisal of the reviewed studies was performed. Results Sixteen articles were reviewed. Eleven of 13 studies that measured BMC verified a positive effect of BW on this parameter, and nine even after adjustment for adult body size. Among the ten studies that found an unadjusted association between BW and BMD, two reported that the significance remained after adjustment for current body size. Interaction between prenatal and postnatal variables on the determination of adult bone mass was only tested by two studies. The results must be interpreted with caution due to the existence of few papers on the issue, as well as heterogeneous sample characteristics, investigated bone sites, and implemented analysis procedures. The aspects of methodological quality that frequently fail are as follows: representativeness of the planned and actually measured sample as well as proper adjustment for confounding. Conclusion Based on the amount of accumulated evidence, it is probable that BW have a positive association with adult BMC rather than BMD, which is an important finding for clinical and public health policies since a reduction in BMC is strongly associated with an increased fracture risk. 3aprospective studies 3anutrition 3abirth weight 0aBone mass 0aepidemiology 0aFetal program1 ados Santos Vaz, J. 1 aKac, G. 0 tOsteoporosis international.g2010 Dec., v. 21, no. 12 p.1981-1991dLondon : Springer-Verlagx0937-941X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00198-010-1236-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101113b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02835naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245009500144300001600239500001500255520104600270650002901316650001601345650001701361650001601378650001601394650000901410650001801419650003301437650001601470650002801486650001501514650001701529650001201546650004301558650002301601650002101624650005101645650004201696650004101738650002301779650001101802650001801813650002401831650001701855650002501872653001401897653002001911653001601931700001801947700002601965700002201991700001702013700001702030773008402047852000902131930003302140945001302173946001102186655001202197IND2138051620221120190212.0980807e199709  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213805162DNAL7 a94292542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDowns, L.G.14aThe effect of dietary changes on plasma lipids and lipoproteins of six Labrador retrievers  ap. 175-181.  a2019-12-05  aSix healthy, spayed female Labrador Retrievers (aged 5.5 to 11 years), kept under controlled conditions of exercise and housing, were fed a diet of 15 per cent fat, 24 per cent carbohydrate and 33 per cent protein for two weeks before and between each of three test diets, of differing fat to carbohydrate ratios (A 13:44, B 20:33, C 25:26 fat:carbohydrate gm per cent dry weight) given in a predetermined order for four weeks each.

It is almost universally assumed that cryogenic storage supports genetic and phenotypic stability of organisms. However, certain components of the cryopreservation process, particularly some cryoprotective additives (CPAs) and free radical mediated cryoinjury, may potentially cause genetic alterations. Genetic integrity in cryopreserved microalgae was assessed using a very sensitive molecular fingerprinting technique, AFLP, on 28 terrestrial microalgal strains. In about half of all investigated strains the AFLP fingerprints revealed, with high levels of reproducibility, clearly detectable genomic differences after cryopreservation employing a widely used standard two-step cooling protocol. Differences ranged from a single fragment position to multiple fragment changes and were compared to differences found between wild-type and UV-light- or radioisotope-induced mutants of Parachlorella kessleri. The basis of the changes are discussed in terms of their reversibility, as may be the case if they are attributed to DNA methylation and/or whether they are true mutations that may potentially manifest in the phenotype. The possibility that cryopreservation selects for genotypically different subpopulations of microalgae is also considered. 3aDNA methylation 3aadditives 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3acryopreservation 3afree radicals 3agenetic stability 3amicroalgae 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3atemperature1 aDay, John G.1 aHarding, Keith1 aHepperle, Dominik1 aLorenz, Maike1 aFriedl, Thomas0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2007 May, v. 94, no. 5 p.799-808dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.94.5.7993Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/ 7aarticle04342naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245015500192300001600347500002400363520185200387650002502239650002402264650001802288650002002306650001002326650002302336650002402359650001902383650001202402650002202414650002002436650002002456650002202476650001102498650003202509650006102541650004802602650003302650650002402683650003002707650002902737650001902766650001302785650001602798650005302814650002002867650002102887650001302908650001402921650004202935650005202977650004503029650008203074650004203156650003303198650004403231650004703275650001803322700001703340700001903357700001803376700002203394700001903416773009703435852000903532856005503541655001203596IND4458942520221120154035.0110610e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445894252DNAL7 a214183532pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04558.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJungkunz, Isabel10aAtHsp70-15-deficient Arabidopsis plants are characterized by reduced growth, a constitutive cytosolic protein response and enhanced resistance to TuMV  ap. 983-995.  aIncludes references  aArabidopsis thaliana contains 18 genes encoding Hsp70s. This heat shock protein superfamily is divided into two sub-families: DnaK and Hsp110/SSE. In order to functionally characterize members of the Hsp70 superfamily, loss-of-function mutants with reduced cytosolic Hsp70 expression were studied. AtHsp70-1 and AtHsp70-2 are constitutively expressed and represent the major cytosolic Hsp70 isoforms under ambient conditions. Analysis of single and double mutants did not reveal any difference compared to wild-type controls. In yeast, SSE protein has been shown to act as a nucleotide exchange factor, essential for Hsp70 function. To test whether members of the Hsp110/SSE sub-family serve essential functions in plants, two members of the sub-family, AtHsp70-14 and AtHsp70-15, were analysed. Both genes are highly homologous and constitutively expressed. Deficiency of AtHsp70-15 but not of AtHsp70-14 led to severe growth retardation. AtHsp70-15-deficient plants were smaller than wild-type and exhibited a slightly different leaf shape. Stomatal closure under ambient conditions and in response to ABA was impaired in the AtHsp70-15 transgenic plants, but ABA-dependent inhibition of germination was not affected. Heat treatment of AtHsp70-15-deficient plants resulted in drastically increased mortality, indicating that AtHsp70-15 plays an essential role during normal growth and in the heat response of Arabidopsis plants. AtHsp70-15-deficient plants are more tolerant to infection by turnip mosaic virus. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that AtHsp70-15-deficient plants display a constitutive stress response similar to the cytosolic protein response. Based on these results, AtHsp70-15 is likely to be a key factor in proper folding of cytosolic proteins, and may function as nucleotide exchange factor as proposed for yeast. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aTurnip mosaic virus 3aabscisic acid 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat treatment 3amutants 3astomatal movement 3astress response 3atranscriptomics 3atransgenic plants 3ayeasts 2aAbscisic Acidxpharmacology 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aCytosolxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Knockout Techniques 2aGene Silencing 2aGenotype 2aGermination 2aHSP70 Heat-Shock Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHot Temperature 2aImmunity, Innate 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Diseasesximmunologyxvirology. 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Stomataxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPotyvirusximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aProtein Isoformsxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aUp-Regulation1 aLink, Katrin1 aVogel, Florian1 aVoll, Lars M.1 aSonnewald, Sophia1 aSonnewald, Uwe0 tplant journal.g2011 June, v. 66, no. 6 p.983-995dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04558.x 7aarticle03359naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245012700201300001800328500002400346506007600370520182400446506003702270650002102307650001402328650001002342650001502352650002602367650001902393650001202412650000902424650001202433650001202445650001802457650002402475650001402499650002202513650001302535650001602548650001202564650001402576700001802590700002002608773013602628852000902764856008002773655001202853IND4402637320221207060114.0080309e20080315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440263732DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01668-072doi7 aPMC22682952pmcid7 a182231132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalcioni, Tania10aEvaluating the Flow-Cytometric Nucleic Acid Double-Staining Protocol in Realistic Situations of Planktonic Bacterial Death  ap. 1767-1779.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSince heterotrophic prokaryotes play an important biogeochemical role in aquatic ecosystems and have a high capacity to survive in extreme environments, easy-to-perform protocols that probe their physiological states and the effects of environmental variables on those states are highly desired. Some methodologies combine a general nucleic acid stain with a membrane integrity probe. We calibrated one of these, the nucleic acid double-staining (NADS) protocol (G. Grégori, S. Citterio, A. Ghiani, M. Labra, S. Sgorbati, S. Brown, and M. Denis, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 67:4662-4670, 2001), determining the optimal stain concentrations in seawater and the response to conditions that generate prokaryote death (such as heat) and to conditions that are known to produce death in plankton, such as nutrient limitation or flagellate grazing. The protocol was validated by comparison to two methods used to detect viability: active respiration by 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) and incorporation of tritiated leucine. We show that concentrations in the range of 5 to 20 μg ml⁻¹ of propidium iodide, simultaneous to a 10x concentration of Sybr green I, are best for detecting two separated populations of "live" (green cells) and "dead" (red cells) organisms. During exposure to heat and UVC, we observed that the number of live cells declined concurrently with that of actively respiring cells (CTC positive) and with total leucine incorporation. In seawater mesocosms, the NADS protocol allowed detection of bacterioplankton starvation-related death and flagellate predation. The protocol was also tested in deep profiles in the northwest Atlantic, demonstrating its potential for routine characterization of this fraction of the physiological diversity of marine heterotrophic prokaryotic plankton.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacterioplankton 3achlorides 3adeath 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aflow cytometry 3agrazing 3aheat 3aiodides 3aleucine 3anucleic acids 3aphysiological state 3apredation 3aprokaryotic cells 3aseawater 3atetrazolium 3atritium 3aviability1 aPapa, Stefano1 aGasol, Josep M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Mar. 15, v. 74, no. 6 p.1767-1779dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01668-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03583naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245017500143300001600318500001500334520151000349650001701859650001401876650002401890650002301914650002501937650002001962650002901982650001902011650001002030650002202040650002102062650000802083650003202091650002402123650001802147650002502165650001702190650002802207650002402235650004102259650004602300650002502346650003802371650003602409653001902445653001602464653001902480653002802499653001602527653001602543653001602559653001602575653002502591700001702616700001702633700001502650700001702665700001302682700001302695700001402708700001602722773006802738852000902806939003302815946001302848655001202861IND9206256920221120150106.0921009e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920625692DNAL7 a15295322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, N.10aMolecular analysis of rice dwarf phytoreovirus segment S1: interviral homology of the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase between plant- and animal-infecting reoviruses  ap. 240-247.  a2019-12-04  aWe have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the largest segment S1 of rice dwarf phytoreovirus (RDV), a member of the family Reoviridae, S1 is 4423 nucleotides long with a segment-specific inverted repeat located adjacent to the conserved termini (5'GGCAAA---- UGAU3'). A major open reading frame (bases 36 to 4367) on the S1 plus strand, which is preceded by a minicistron (bases 6 to 29), encodes the polypeptide P1) consisting of 1444 amino acids with a Mr of 164, 142. The sense-strand transcript derived from the full-length S1 cDNA, the minicistron of which was abolished, directed the synthesis of a polypeptide of 170 kDa in addition to smaller polypeptides in wheat germ extracts, and the 170-kDa product comigrated with the minor core protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Thus, P1 is assumed to be localized in the viral core particle. The consensus sequence element conserved in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is observed in the P1 amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence. Based on the dendrogram established from the sequence alignment around the polymerase module region, and sequence identity within the alignment, P1 of plant-infecting RDV was evolutionarily compared with VP1, lambda3, and VP1 of three other animal-infecting members of the family, rota-, reo-, and bluetongue viruses. Consequently, RDV S1 was shown to be more closely related to the rotavirus gene segment 1, in terms of molecular evolution, than the animal-infecting members are to one another. 3agenetic code 3aevolution 3aopen reading frames 3asequence alignment 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviral proteins 3agenes 3asequence homology 3aRice dwarf virus 3aRNA 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aGenes, Viral 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPlant Virusesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aRNA-Dependent RNA Polymerasexmetabolism. 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aReoviridaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0agenbank/d10222 0aembl/d90198 0agenbank/d90198 0amolecular sequence data 0addbj/d90198 0aembl/d10222 0atranslation 0addbj/d10222 0anucleotide sequences1 aTanimura, M.1 aWatanabe, Y.1 aKusano, T.1 aKitagawa, Y.1 aSuda, N.1 aKudo, H.1 aUyeda, I.1 aShikata, E.0 tVirology.g1992 Sept., v. 190, no. 1 p.240-247x0042-68227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02142naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001800127245010200145300001600247500001500263520106400278650001001342650001001352650002901362650001901391650001201410651001801422653002801440653001101468700001501479700001901494700001801513700001601531700001601547700001301563773007801576852000901654930003301663945002501696946001101721655001201732IND4383193820221120134236.0060829e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438319382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

During active surveillance of British sheep for TSEs, 29 201 sheep brain stem samples were collected from abattoirs and analysed for the presence of PrPSc. Of these samples, 54 were found to be positive by using an ELISA screening test, but 28 of these could not be confirmed initially by immunohistochemistry. These unconfirmed or atypical cases were generally found in PrP genotypes normally associated with relative resistance to clinical scrapie and further biochemical analysis revealed that they contained forms of PrPSc with a relatively protease-sensitive amyloid core, some resembling those of Nor98 scrapie. The presence of these atypical forms of protease-resistant PrP raises concerns that some TSE disorders of PrP metabolism previously may have escaped identification in the British sheep population. 3asheep 3abrain 3abiochemical polymorphism 3aPrPSc proteins 3ascrapie 3aGreat Britain 0aatypical PrPSc proteins 0aprions1 aThorne, L.1 aBarnicle, D.A.1 aEdwards, J.C.1 aElliott, H.1 aJackman, R.1 aHope, J.0 tJournal of general virology.g2006 Feb., v. 87 p.471-477x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20060912b20061003c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/09/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02830naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001300144245020300157300001600360520158300376650002701959650001601986650001902002650001902021650002402040650002402064650001902088650001402107650001402121650001402135653002502149653003002174653001702204700001602221700001502237773007802252852000902330930003302339945002502372946001102397655001202408IND4383193720221120134246.0060829e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438319372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aChiu, H.10aIdentification and immuno-electron microscopy localization of p40, a protein component of immunosuppressive virus-like particles from Leptopilina heterotoma, a virulent parasitoid wasp of Drosophila  ap. 461-470.  aLamellocytes are specialized larval blood cells of Drosophila that carry out encapsulation of metazoan pathogens such as parasitoid wasps. Large virus-like particles (VLPs) from two closely related virulent parasitoid wasp species, Leptopilina heterotoma and Leptopilina victoriae, suppress the host encapsulation response by promoting lysis of lamellocytes. The molecular basis of VLP-lamellocyte interaction and lamellocyte lysis is not understood. Here, it was shown that mature VLPs are composed of at least four major proteins. Polyclonal antisera against the most abundant L. heterotoma VLP protein, p40, cross-reacted with the most abundant L. victoriae VLP protein, p47.5. Immuno-electron microscopy (EM) of the long gland-reservoir complex revealed that p40 was expressed early in VLP biogenesis and was detected along with VLP precursors within the long gland cells and lumen. In the reservoir, VLPs had an angular core, resembled mature particles and p40 was detected outside the VLP cores. Immuno-EM staining of mature VLPs from both species localized the p40 and p47.5 proteins largely to the periphery of the VLPs and along the VLP spike-like projections. p40 staining was observed in VLP-treated host haemocytes. In vitro, anti-p40 antibody almost completely blocked the ability of L. heterotoma VLPs to promote lamellocyte lysis. Anti-p40 antibody blocked lysis by L. victoriae VLPs by >50 %. It is proposed that the VLP surface proteins p40 and p47.5 share antigenic determinants and significantly contribute to the strong virulence of their Hymenopteran hosts. 3aLeptopilina heterotoma 3aparasitoids 3ainsect viruses 3aviral proteins 3aprotein composition 3aimmunocytochemistry 3across reaction 3ahemocytes 3acytolysis 3aantiserum 0avirus-like particles 0aimmunoelectron microscopy 0alamellocytes1 aMorales, J.1 aGovind, S.0 tJournal of general virology.g2006 Feb., v. 87 p.461-470x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20060912b20061003c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/09/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02711naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245011900142300001600261500001500277520143000292650001201722650003701734650001101771650000801782650003001790650001701820650002001837650001801857650002201875650003501897650002201932653003001954700001501984700001501999700002702014700001702041700001502058700002402073773007802097852000902175930003302184945002502217946001102242655001202253IND4383193920221120134152.0060829e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438319392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDewals, B.10aCloning of the genome of Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 as an infectious and pathogenic bacterial artificial chromosome  ap. 509-517.  a2019-12-05  aAlcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AlHV-1), carried asymptomatically by wildebeest, causes malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) following cross-species transmission to a variety of susceptible species of the order Artiodactyla. The study of MCF pathogenesis has been impeded by an inability to produce recombinant virus, mainly due to the fact that AlHV-1 becomes attenuated during passage in culture. In this study, these difficulties were overcome by cloning the entire AlHV-1 genome as a stable, infectious and pathogenic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). A modified loxP-flanked BAC cassette was inserted in one of the two large non-coding regions of the AlHV-1 genome. This insertion allowed the production of an AlHV-1 BAC clone stably maintained in bacteria and able to regenerate virions when transfected into permissive cells. The loxP-flanked BAC cassette was excised from the genome of reconstituted virions by growing them in permissive cells stably expressing Cre recombinase. Importantly, BAC-derived AlHV-1 virions replicated comparably to the virulent (low-passage) AlHV-1 parental strain and induced MCF in rabbits that was indistinguishable from that of the virulent parental strain. The availability of the AlHV-1 BAC is an important advance for the study of MCF that will allow the identification of viral genes involved in MCF pathogenesis, as well as the production of attenuated recombinant candidate vaccines. 3arabbits 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3agenome 3aDNA 3amalignant catarrhal fever 3atransfection 3agene expression 3apathogenicity 3amolecular cloning 3aAlcelaphine gammaherpesvirus 1 3avirus replication 0aAlcelaphine herpesvirus 11 aBoudry, C.1 aGillet, L.1 aMarkine-Goriaynoff, N.1 aLeval, L. de1 aHaig, D.M.1 aVanderplasschen, A.0 tJournal of general virology.g2006 Mar., v. 87 p.509-517x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20060912b20061003c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/09/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02243naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001800127245015800145300001800303500001500321520110300336650002301439650003001462650002901492650001901521650001001540650003101550650002101581650001601602653002501618653002801643700001401671700001401685773008001699852000901779930003301788945002501821946001101846655001201857IND4375395520221120114018.0051021e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437539552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

As bICP0 is expressed constitutively during productive infection, it is considered to be the major viral regulatory protein. Like other alphaherpesvirus ICP0 homologues, bICP0 contains a zinc RING finger near its N terminus that activates transcription and regulates subcellular localization. In this study, evidence is provided that bICP0 represses the human beta interferon (IFN-beta) promoter and a simple promoter with consensus IFN-stimulated response elements following stimulation with double-stranded RNA (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid), IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) or IRF7. bICP0 also inhibits the ability of two protein kinases (TBK1 and IKKepsilon) to activate IFN-beta promoter activity. The zinc RING finger is necessary for inhibiting IFN-dependent transcription in certain cell types. Collectively, these studies suggest that bICP0 activates productive infection by stimulating viral gene expression and inhibiting IFN-dependent transcription. 3avertebrate viruses 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviral proteins 3agenes 3agene expression regulation 3apromoter regions 3ainterferons 0aBovine herpesvirus 1 0ainfected cell protein 01 aZhang, Y.1 aJones, C.0 tJournal of general virology.g2005 Oct., v. 86 p.2697-2702x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20070904b20071002c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02465naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245013400161300002100295520131100316650001101627650001601638650002201654650001501676650002001691650002301711650001501734650002401749650001101773650001701784651001201801700001801813700001701831700002701848773010001875852000901975930003301984945002502017946001302042655001202055IND4419408220221120114012.0090422e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441940822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aReggiani, P.10aUncertainty assessment via Bayesian revision of ensemble streamflow predictions in the operational river Rhine forecasting system  ap. W02428 (14 p.  aEnsemble streamflow forecasts obtained by using hydrological models with ensemble weather products are becoming more frequent in operational flow forecasting. The uncertainty of the ensemble forecast needs to be assessed for these products to become useful in forecasting operations. A comprehensive framework for Bayesian revision has been recently developed and applied to operational flood forecasting with deterministic weather forecasts. The Bayesian revision yields a posterior density, conditional on all information available to the forecaster at the onset of a forecast run. This conditional density objectively quantifies the uncertainty. Here the Bayesian approach is generalized for use with ensemble weather predictions. An end-to-end application of a Bayesian postprocessor for ensemble streamflow forecasts in the river Rhine forecasting system is presented. A verification of the postprocessor shows good performance when compared in terms of the ranked probability skill score to non-Bayesian uncertainty assessment, such as ranking threshold exceedance probabilities for members of a streamflow ensemble prediction. In this context it is also addressed how the proposed Bayesian processor can serve in supporting rational decision making for flood warning under conditions of uncertainty. 3arivers 3astream flow 3ahydrologic models 3aprediction 3aBayesian theory 3astatistical models 3aestimation 3aweather forecasting 3afloods 3acase studies 3aGermany1 aRenner, Matt.1 aWeerts, A.H.1 aGelder, P.A.H.J.M. van0 tWater resources research.g2009 Feb., v. 45, no. 2 p.W02428 (14 p-W02428 (14 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20090504b20090608c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/05/04  aOther US 7aarticle02166naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002100127245009200148300002100240520109100261650001101352650002501363650001301388650001201401650001101413650001301424650001601437650001501453650002201468650002201490650001901512651001201531700002601543700001901569773010001588852000901688930003301697945002501730946001301755655001201768IND4419407520221120104604.0090422e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441940752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W02431 (13 p.  aLarge-scale dispersion was studied in an unconsolidated, sandy, glaciofluvial, river-recharged, and confined aquifer in Germany. Groundwater observation wells from a 3.5-km-long transect located in flow direction from the river Oder into a large lowland area (Oderbruch polder) were sampled for noble gases in order to date the groundwater with the tritium and helium (3H-3He) technique. The apparent 3H-3He ages of the groundwater increased from only a few months to >40 years along the flow path. Highest values for initial 3H (sum of 3H and its decay product tritiogenic helium, 3He(tri)) were encountered in 2.6-km river distance. Concentrations of 4He in the water increased to 1.1 x 10(-7) cm3 STP/g with distance from the river. The initial 3H data enabled an estimation of the longitudinal dispersivity with a simplified one-dimensional transport model. The best fit of modeled and measured initial 3H data was obtained using a dispersivity of 120 m. Deviations of modeled hydraulic ages and measured apparent 3H-3He ages for older samples can be explained by dispersive mixing. 3arivers 3agroundwater recharge 3aaquifers 3atritium 3ahelium 3alowlands 3agroundwater 3aestimation 3asimulation models 3ahydrologic models 3adispersibility 3aGermany1 aSültenfuss, Jürgen.1 aPekdeger, Asaf0 tWater resources research.g2009 Feb., v. 45, no. 2 p.W02431 (13 p-W02431 (13 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20090504b20090608c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/05/04  aOther US 7aarticle01761naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245005800162300002000220520085500240650002101095650003001116650002201146650001301168650001401181650001501195650002901210773011601239930003301355945002501388946001301413852000901426655001201435IND4419405920221120104732.0090422e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441940592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W02505 (8 p.  aDepth-averaged reactive transport models are commonly used to represent field-scale contamination in groundwater aquifers. These models rely on simplifying the governing equations through defining a depth-averaged variable and vertically integrating the full reactive transport equation. This approach is exact provided that the governing equation is linear; however, vertically averaging a nonlinear conservation equation can introduce an error into the simplified model. We present a framework for analyzing this error so that the suitability of a depth-averaged reactive transport model can be assessed quantitatively before the model is implemented. This framework shows how the error introduced by depth-averaging reactive transport equations is governed by the parameters in the kinetic model and the geometry of the reactive transport problem. 3agroundwater flow 3agroundwater contamination 3ahydrologic models 3aaquifers 3aequations 3asoil depth 3asoil transport processes0 tWater resources research.g2009 Feb., v. 45, no. 2 p.W02505 (8 p-W02505 (8 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  a20090504b20090608c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/05/04  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245011000143300001800253500001500271520200000286650002502286650001802311650002502329650002002354650001102374650001402385653002502399653001702424700001802441700001502459773008002474852000902554930003302563945002502596946001102621655001202632IND4377198120221120094436.0060113e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437719812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aYoung, V.L.10aCharacterization of an exochitinase from Epiphyas postvittana nucleopolyhedrovirus (family Baculoviridae)  ap. 3253-3261.  a2019-12-05  aBaculovirus chitinases and other family 18 glycohydrolases have been shown to possess both exo- and endochitinase activities when assayed against fluorescent chito-oligosaccharides. Homology modelling of the chitinase of Epiphyas postvittana nucleopolyhedrovirus (EppoNPV) against Serratia marcescens chitinase A indicated that the enzyme possesses an N-terminal polycystic kidney 1 (PKD1) domain for chitin-substrate feeding and an α/β TIM barrel catalytic domain characteristic of a family 18 glycohydrolase. EppoNPV chitinase has many features in common with other baculovirus chitinases, including high amino acid identity, an N-terminal secretion signal and a functional C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum-retention sequence. EppoNPV chitinase displayed exo- and endochitinolytic activity against fluorescent chito-oligosaccharides, with Km values of 270 +/- 60 and 240 +/- 40 micromolar against 4MU-(GlcNAc)2 and 20 +/- 6 and 14 +/- 7 micromolar against 4MU-(GlcNAc)3 for native and recombinant versions of the enzyme, respectively. In contrast, digestion and thin-layer chromatography analysis of short-chain (GlcNAc)2-6 chito-oligosaccharides without the fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) moiety produced predominantly (GlcNAc)2, indicating an exochitinase, although low-level endochitinase activity was detected. Digestion of long-chain colloidal β-chitin and analysis by mass spectrometry identified a single 447 Da peak, representing a singly charged (GlcNAc)2 complexed with a sodium adduct ion, confirming the enzyme as an exochitinase with no detectable endochitinolytic activity. Furthermore, (GlcNAc)3-6 substrates, but not (GlcNAc)2, acted as inhibitors of EppoNPV chitinase. Short-chain substrates are unlikely to interact with the aromatic residues of the PKD1 substrate-feeding mechanism and hence may not accurately reflect the activity of these enzymes against native substrates.

  1 aWu, Jiasen10aDynamics and Distribution of Nutrition Elements in Bamboos  ap. 489-501.  a2019-12-04  aMao bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) with a high production and wide utilization has been planted in large scale in southern China, but little information about bamboo nutrition is available. The objective of this study was to reveal the dynamics of nutrition with growing time and the distribution of nutrition in different organs. It was found that the nutrition concentration of the whole plant generally declined with time during the period of 1-6 weeks owing to a dilution effect with the result of quickly increasing the biomass. The leaf concentration of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) changed regularly with high concentrations observed at age 1, 2, 4, and 6, and lower at age 3 and 5. While the concentration of N, P, and K in the branch and stem generally declined with the weeks, a rapid decrease occurred from weeks 1 to 2. The concentrations of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in bamboo leaf, branch, and stem appeared to be opposite to those of N, P, and K in corresponding plant parts. The elemental concentrations were greater (P < 0.05) in the leaves than in the branches and stems, while the storage of nutrition was greater (P < 0.05) in stem than in leaves and branch. A relative large total storage of nutrition, except P and Mg, were found in bamboo under an intensive management (IM) stand than those under extensive management (EM) stand. The total storage of different nutritions in the above-ground parts was in the order: K (243.0-285.6 kg ha-1) > N (154.5-207.8 kg ha-1) > P (10.4-12.2 kg ha-1). The nutrition stored in the bamboo plant would be removed away from the soil in every other year by the means of harvest of the bamboo trunk which is the largest nutrition pool of the bamboo plant. Therefore, supplementary nutrients, especially N and K, are strongly recommended in order to keep the productivity of bamboo. 3aphosphorus 3anutrient uptake 3adry matter accumulation 3asoil fertility 3aleaves 3anutrient management 3atemporal variation 3aharvesting 3anutrient transport 3aplant development 3aplant nutrition 3acalcium 3apotassium 3abranches 3acrop management 3aspecialty crops 3aplant age 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3aplant tissues 3anitrogen 3amagnesium 3anutrient reserves 3aChina 0abamboo (material) 0astems1 aXu, Qiufang1 aJiang, Peikun1 aCao, Zhihong0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2009, v. 32, no. 1-3 p.489-501x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL  a20090622b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/21  aOther US 7aarticle04158naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245007200155300001600227520245300243650001202696650001302708650001302721650001302734650001902747650002802766650001102794650001302805650002902818650002702847650000902874650001802883650001202901650001302913650001302926650001202939650001302951650000902964650001102973650001402984650001402998650001903012650000703031650001503038650001303053650001003066650002003076650001303096650001703109650002003126650002603146651001303172653001503185700002203200700002203222700001703244773010703261852000903368856007503377930003303452946001103485655001203496IND4438663520221120062307.0100618s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443866352DNAL7 a10.1071/SR091512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWisawapipat, W.10aSurface charge characteristics of variable charge soils in Thailand  ap. 337-354.  aSurface charge characteristics were investigated using a charge fingerprinting procedure for 90 samples from 32 profiles of highly weathered Oxisols and Ultisols derived from shale/limestone, basalt, granite, local alluvium, sedimentary, and metasedimentary rocks under tropical savanna and tropical monsoonal climates in Thailand. The charge fingerprints of 5 whole soils, after removal of organic matter and of kaolin and ion oxides from these soils, were also measured to clarify factors contributing to the variable charge behaviour. Phosphate sorption was determined and related to charge properties. Kaolin was the dominant mineral of the clay fraction with moderate amounts of goethite and hematite. Gibbsite was present in Oxisols formed on limestone and basalt under more humid conditions. All soils exhibited variable charge behaviour but the magnitude and rate of change in variable charge with pH varied greatly between Oxisols and Ultisols. Oxisols had higher amounts of variable charge than Ultisols, reflecting the differences in amounts of clay and extractable Fe and Al. Oxisols formed on basalt and limestone under more humid conditions had high values of anion exchange capacity (AEC) due to the contributions of goethite, gibbsite, and boehmite. The relationships of base cation exchange capacity (CECB) and AEC with pH were linear. Rates of change with pH of both negative and positive variable charge (Ac, Aa) were closely related to CEC, specific surface area (SSA), pH(NaF), and various forms of extractable Fe, Al, and Mn. The charge fingerprints of soil after removal of organic matter indicated that organic matter exerted a strong influence on both the magnitude of negative charge and rate of change with pH. Kaolin had permanent and variable charge, with SSA and crystal size (MCD₀₀₁) being highly predictive of the rate of change in variable negative charge with pH. Iron oxide concentrates exhibited strongly pH-dependent charge and the mean coherently diffracting length (MCD₁₁₀) of hematite was highly predictive of both the magnitude and rate of change in variable positive charge with pH. Charge coefficients (Ac, Ba) had highly significant (P=0.005) positive relationships with Langmuir and Freundlich phosphate sorption maximum coefficients (Xm, k), indicating that the surfaces of amorphous, poorly ordered, and crystalline Fe and Al oxides are prime sites for both P sorption and variable charge. 3aOxisols 3aUltisols 3aalluvium 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3aanion exchange capacity 3abasalt 3aboehmite 3acation exchange capacity 3acharge characteristics 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3aclimate 3agibbsite 3agoethite 3agranite 3ahematite 3airon 3akaolin 3alimestone 3amanganese 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphosphates 3asavannas 3ashale 3asodium fluoride 3asorption 3asurface area 3avariable charge 3avariable charge soils 3aThailand 0aP sorption1 aKheoruenromne, I.1 aSuddhiprakarn, A.1 aGilkes, R.J.0 tSoil research.g2010, v. 48, no. 4 p.337-354dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0004-95737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR091513Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02842naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245008500145300001600230500001500246520138000261650002001641650002901661650002601690650001101716650002501727650001001752650002501762650002201787650002401809650001801833650001501851650001701866650002801883650003001911650003101941650002901972653001602001653002802017653002102045653002002066653001802086700001302104700001402117700001602131700001602147700001402163773006802177852000902245930003302254946001302287655001202300IND9206258020221120062446.0921013e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920625802DNAL7 a15295552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamanaka, M.10aSequence analysis and editing of the phosphoprotein (P) gene of rinderpest virus  ap. 553-556.  a2019-12-04  aWe have cloned the cDNA of the phosphoprotein (P) gene of the virulent (Kabete "O") strain of rinderpest virus and provided a comparative analysis of its sequence with that of the P genes of measles, canine distemper, and phocid distemper viruses. The gene encodes two overlapping open reading frames of 1521 and 531 nucleotides. Use of the first ATG would produce a P polypeptide of 507 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 54,344. The second ATG would produce a C polypeptide of 177 residues with a predicted molecular weight of 19,927. In addition, the insertion of a G residue at position 740 generates an alternative mRNA potentially encoding the V polypeptide of rinderpest virus. The homology comparisons in P amino acid sequences between rinderpest and measles, between rinderpest and canine distemper, and between rinderpest and phocid distemper viruses are 60, 44, and 46%, respectively. A four-way comparison shows an identity of 34%. Similar homology comparisons with the C amino acid sequence between rinderpest and measles, rinderpest and canine distemper, and rinderpest and phocid distemper viruses are 56, 42, and 40%, respectively. A homology of 31% is found in a four-way comparison for the C polypeptide. From the point of the insertion of the G residue, there is a homology of 78% between the V polypeptides of rinderpest and measle viruses. 3aphosphoproteins 3aRinderpest morbillivirus 3aMeasles morbillivirus 3aclones 3aamino acid sequences 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence homology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Viral 2aGenes, Viral 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhosphoproteinsxgenetics 2aRinderpest virusxgenetics 2aViral Proteinsxgenetics 0acomparisons 0amolecular sequence data 0aRinderpest virus 0adistemper virus 0aMeasles virus1 aDale, B.1 aCrisp, T.1 aCordell, B.1 aGrubman, M.1 aYilma, T.0 tVirology.g1992 Sept., v. 190, no. 1 p.553-556x0042-68227nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03554naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245012800187300001600315520141900331650003001750650002501780650002601805650002701831650001701858650001501875650002301890650003201913650001901945650001001964650002801974650001302002650001102015650001702026650002802043650002002071650001402091650001502105650002602120650003802146650001702184650001902201650001702220650002102237650005502258650003102313650002902344650004202373650004002415650004802455650004702503653000802550653000802558653001802566700001802584700002302602773011002625852000902735856009202744930003302836946001102869655001202880IND4438355220221120045324.0100611e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443835522DNAL7 a202305062pmid7 a10.1111/j.0960-7412.2010.04206.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsai, Shuta12aA key enzyme for flavin synthesis is required for nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species production in disease resistance  ap. 911-924.  aNitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play key roles in plant immunity. However, the regulatory mechanisms of the production of these radicals are not fully understood. Hypersensitive response (HR) cell death requires the simultaneous and balanced production of NO and ROS. In this study we indentified NbRibA encoding a bifunctional enzyme, guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase II/3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase, which participates in the biosynthesis of flavin, by screening genes related to mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated cell death, using virus-induced gene silencing. Levels of endogenous riboflavin and its derivatives, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are important prosthetic groups for several enzymes participating in redox reactions, decreased in NbRibA-silenced Nicotiana benthamiana. Silencing NbRibA compromised not only HR cell death, but also the NO and ROS production induced by INF1 elicitin and a constitutively active form of NbMEK2 (NbMEK2DD), and also induced high susceptibility to oomycete Phytophthora infestans and ascomycete Colletotrichum orbiculare. Compromised radical production and HR cell death induced by INF1 in NbRibA-silenced leaves were rescued by adding riboflavin, FMN or FAD. These results indicate that flavin biosynthesis participates in regulating NO and ROS production, and HR cell death. 3aColletotrichum orbiculare 3aGTP cyclohydrolase I 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPhytophthora infestans 3abiosynthesis 3acell death 3adisease resistance 3aflavin-adenine dinucleotide 3agene silencing 3agenes 3ahypersensitive response 3aimmunity 3aleaves 3anitric oxide 3areactive oxygen species 3aredox reactions 3ascreening 2aCell Death 2aFlavinsxbiosynthesis 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Library 2aGene Silencing 2aGenes, Plant 2aImmunity, Innate 2aIntramolecular Transferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTobaccoxenzymologyxgeneticsximmunology. 0aFMN 0aFAD 0aNADPH oxidase1 aMase, Keisuke1 aYoshioka, Hirofumi0 tPlant journal.g2010 June, v. 62, no. 6 p.911-924dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0960-7412.2010.04206.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02509naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245007200204300001800276520145200294650001401746650001401760653000901774653001501783700001901798700002801817700002001845700002101865773013301886852000902019856008502028930003302113946001302146655001202159IND4444040120221120045341.0101022e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444404012DNAL7 a10.1007/s00280-010-1268-22doi7 aPMC29576582pmcid7 a209538592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jianli 10aResistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in lung cancer cell lines  ap. 1103-1111.  aPurpose A series of six lung cancer cell lines of different cell origin (including small cell and mesothelioma) were characterized immunohistochemically and the role of a series of protein candidates previously implicated in drug resistance were investigated. Methods These include colony-forming and cell growth assays, immunohistochemistry, siRNA knockouts, real-time PCR and western blots. Results No correlation was found with AKT, HO-1, HO-2, GRP78, 14-3-3zeta and ERCC1 levels and cisplatin nor oxaliplatin cytotoxicity, but an association was observed with levels of the enzyme, dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DDH); an enzyme previously implicated in the development of platinum resistance. The relationship appeared to hold true for those cell lines derived from lung epithelial primary tumors but not for the neuroendocrine/small-cell and mesothelioma cell lines. siRNA knockouts to DDH-1 and DDH-2 were prepared with the cell line exhibiting the greatest resistance to cisplatin (A549) resulting in marked decreases in the DDH isoforms as assessed by real-time PCR, western blot and enzymatic activity. The DDH-1 knockout was far more sensitive to cisplatin than the DDH-2 knockout. Conclusion Thus, sensitivity to cisplatin appeared to be associated with DDH levels in epithelial lung cancer cell lines with the DDH-1 isoform producing the greatest effect. Results in keeping with transfection experiments with ovarian and other cell lines. 3aneoplasms 3acisplatin 0aLung 0aResistance1 aEmara, Nashwa 1 aSolomides, Charalambos 1 aParekh, Hemant 1 aSimpkins, Henry 0 tCancer chemotherapy and pharmacology.g2010 Nov., v. 66, no. 6 p.1103-1111dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0344-57047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00280-010-1268-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20101022b20101108c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02031naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009500125300001600220520113300236650002301369650002201392650002401414650003001438650001101468650002701479650001901506650001801525700001801543700001601561773007301577852000901650939003301659946001301692655001201705IND9206268720221120040134.0921013e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920626872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, M.10aInteractions between Erwinia herbicola and E. amylovora on the stigma of hawthorn blossoms  ap. 914-918.  aErwinia herbicola HL9N13 is an effective biological control agent of fire blight disease of hawthorn. The interactions between E. herbicola and E. amylovora on the stigma of hawthorn blossoms were examined to assess the possible roles of competition and antibiosis in the mechanism of biological control of blossom blight. Preemptive and competitive colonization of the stigma by the biological control agent reduced the pathogen growth rate and final population. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that E. herbicola colonized the same sites on the stigmatic surface as E. amylovora in its epiphytic phase of development. The competitive advantage exhibited by E. herbicola may have resulted from antibiosis. Although E. herbicola HL9N13 produced a broad-spectrum antibiotic on potato-dextrose agar, it was not determined whether this antibiotic was produced in planta. The results suggest that stigma colonization by E. amylovora is prevented by preemptive or competitive occupation of colonization sites by E. herbicola and by the reduction in availability of a resource required by the pathogen for growth at these sites. 3aCrataegus monogyna 3aErwinia amylovora 3aPantoea agglomerans 3abiological control agents 3astigma 3aecological competition 3aultrastructure 3apathogenicity1 aEpton, H.A.S.1 aSigee, D.C.0 tPhytopathology.g1992 Sept., v. 82, no. 9 p.914-918x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03934naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245008900195300001800284520213000302650001902432650002002451650002102471650001602492650001202508650003102520650001902551650001502570650001502585650001202600650001602612650001702628650001502645650000902660650001302669650001102682650001402693650001602707650001102723650001202734650002102746650001402767650001102781650001602792650001202808650001702820650001202837651001102849653001302860653002102873653001802894653003202912653002102944700001902965700001902984773012403003852000903127856009203136930003303228946001103261655001203272IND4443389020221120040038.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444338902DNAL7 a206363452pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01731.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivrud, Inger Maren10aHow does local weather predict red deer home range size at different temporal scales  ap. 1280-1295.  a1. There is a rapidly growing literature on how climate affects populations of vertebrates. For large herbivorous mammals, most attention has been paid to demographic responses to climate variation. Much less information is available regarding how climate affects animal behaviour, i.e. the climate mechanisms. Further, the appropriate measurement scale of climate variables remains debated. Here, we investigate how local climate variables determine home range sizes at four temporal scales using the Börger-method on GPS telemetry data from 47 female red deer Cervus elaphus L. in Norway. 2. If local climate operates directly on the immediate activity level of the animal, we predict home range sizes to show season-specific variation on short temporal scale (weekly-daily) related to temperature and precipitation. If local climate operate indirectly through plant growth, we rather predict variation in home range sizes to be apparent on longer time scales (biweekly-monthly), and during summer only. 3. At all time scales home range size was positively correlated with temperature during winter and negatively during summer, while the effect of precipitation was season- and scale-specific, except when accumulating as snow. Extensive snow cover decreased home range size, indicating direct effects of climate. 4. The effects of local climate was weaker at the shortest time scales (weekly-daily) compared to the longest time scales (monthly-biweekly), while the effects of day length on home range size was only apparent on the monthly and daily scale. At the longest time scales variation in local climate had a large effect on home range size. This is consistent with climatic variables operating indirectly through plant growth, but we cannot exclude a certain direct effect even at longer time scales. 5. We show how local climate-home range size correlations measured over different temporal scales can be used to infer direct and indirect climate mechanisms. Insight on the behavioural basis of responses to climate enables more accurate predictions of possible nonlinear relationships to future global warming. 3aCervus elaphus 3aanimal behavior 3aclimatic factors 3acorrelation 3afemales 3aglobal positioning systems 3aglobal warming 3aherbivores 3ahome range 3amammals 3aphotoperiod 3aplant growth 3aprediction 3asnow 3asnowpack 3asummer 3atelemetry 3atemperature 3awinter 2aAnimals 2aDeerxphysiology 2aEcosystem 2aFemale 2aPhotoperiod 2aSeasons 2aTime Factors 2aWeather 3aNorway 0aactivity 0aanimal movements 0alocal climate 0aNorth Atlantic Oscillations 0ascale-dependence1 aLoe, Leif Egil1 aMysterud, Atle0 tJournal of animal ecology.g2010 Nov., v. 79, no. 6 p.1280-1295dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-87907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01731.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02654naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245008300179300001600262520118000278650001401458650001601472650001501488650001001503650000901513650002201522650002501544650006701569650001101636650001101647650001501658650002001673650000901693650001601702650001401718650001401732650002601746650003001772650006601802700001801868700001501886700001501901773009401916852000902010856008502019930003302104946001102137655001202148IND4440689320221120040207.0100730e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444068932DNAL7 a203937822pmid7 a10.1007/s15010-010-0021-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorer, N. 10aPrognostic factors of the mortality of postoperative intraabdominal infections  ap. 255-260.  aPurpose We investigated the relationship between the prognostic factors of postoperative peritonitis and mortality. Methods Data from 56 patients re-operated for postoperative secondary peritonitis in our hospital between 1991 and 2001 were collected retrospectively. Demographic features, comorbidity, malignancy, organ failure, type and timing of the primary operation, intraoperative findings, etiology of postoperative peritonitis, number of relaparotomies, source control failure, Mannheim peritonitis index (MPI), and mortality were noted. The time intervals between the first operation and relaparotomy, and between symptom onset and the second operation were also noted. Results The overall mortality rate was 32% (n = 18). Organ failure (p = 0.001), time elapse between symptoms and the second operation (p = 0.046), severity of peritonitis (p = 0.035), source control failure (0.047), and MPI scores (p = 0.032) were significantly related with the mortality of postoperative peritonitis in a univariate analysis. MPI score >30 had a higher mortality rate. Conclusion Delaying relaparotomy for more than 24 h and presence of organ failure result in higher mortality. 3amortality 3aperitonitis 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aDigestive System Diseasesxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxmortality. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLaparotomy 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPrognosis 2aROC Curve 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aSurgical Wound Infectionxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxmortality.1 aYorganci, K. 1 aElker, D. 1 aSayek, I. 0 tInfection.g2010 Aug., v. 38, no. 4 p.255-260dMunchen : Urban and Vogelx0300-81267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s15010-010-0021-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100730b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02830naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245006700188300001600255520168300271650001601954650001301970650002401983650001202007650003702019650003002056650001102086650002102097650002802118653002102146653001702167700002102184773010102205852000902306856008502315930003302400946001102433655001202444IND4437097120221120040312.0100514e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443709712DNAL7 a201432512pmid7 a10.1007/s10534-010-9297-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLegrand, Dominique 12aA critical review of the roles of host lactoferrin in immunity  ap. 365-376.  aLactoferrin (Lf) is an essential element of innate immunity, which refers to antigen-nonspecific defense mechanisms that a host uses immediately or within hours after exposure to an antigen. Following infection, Lf is released from neutrophils (PMNs) in blood and inflamed tissues and, such as other soluble pattern-recognition receptors of the innate immunity, Lf recognizes unique microbial molecules called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs): LPS from the gram-negative cell wall and bacterial unmethylated CpG DNA. However, unlike classical PAMPs receptors involved in the activation of immune cells, Lf may act either as a competitor for these receptors or as a partner molecule, depending on the physiological status of the organism. These immunomodulatory properties are explained by the ability of Lf to interact with proteoglycans and receptors on the surface of mammalian cells: cells of the innate (NK cells, neutrophils, macrophages, basophils, neutrophils and mast cells) and adaptive [lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells (APCs)] immune systems, and also epithelial and endothelial cells. Through these interactions, Lf is able to modulate the migration, maturation and functions of immune cells, and thus to influence both adaptive and innate immunities. The understanding of the roles of the host-expressed Lf in immunity comes from in vivo and in vitro studies with exogenous Lf which, although informative, rarely reflect the pathological, or non-pathological, conditions in the organism. In this review, the data from the literature will be critically analyzed in order to present a real picture of the regulatory roles of host Lf in immunity. 3alactoferrin 3aimmunity 3alipopolysaccharides 2aAnimals 2aCell Differentiationximmunology 2aCell Movementximmunology 2aHumans 2aImmunity, Active 2aLactoferrinximmunology 0aImmunomodulation 0aImmune cells1 aMazurier, Joël 0 tBioMetals.g2010 June, v. 23, no. 3 p.365-376dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0966-08447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10534-010-9297-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100514b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01689naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245010200161300001600263500002400279520067200303650001300975650001400988650001901002650001201021650001301033650001801046700002101064700002001085700001901105700001901124700001401143700001801157773009501175852000901270856004801279655001201327IND4410209420221120033138.0080912e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441020942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-008-9411-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuck, A.

Wild type and O-antigen-deficient mutant strains of B. japonicum were tested for biofilm formation on polyvinyl chloride (PVC) surfaces and motility on semi-solid (0·3%) agar media. After 7 days of incubation, the amount of biofilms formed by the mutant was c. 3·5-fold greater than that of the wild type. Unlike biofilm formation, the motility assay revealed that the mutant strain was less motile than the wild type. This study shows enhanced biofilm formation and decreased motility by the O-antigen-deficient mutant, suggesting that the lack of the O-polysaccharide of the rhizobial LPS is associated with biofilm-forming ability and movement. LPS plays an important role in both pathogenic and beneficial bacteria. It has also been reported that LPS deficiency negatively affects biofilm formation. However, our results demonstrate that the O-antigen-deficient mutant enhances biofilm formation, presumably through a significant increase in hydrophobicity. It is notable that the hydrophobicity of cell walls might be a key regulator in controlling biofilm development in B. japonicum. 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3aagar 3aantigens 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3acell walls 3ahydrophobicity 3amutants 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 2aBiofilms 2aBradyrhizobiumxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMutation 2aO Antigensxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0alipopolysaccharide 0aO-polysaccharide1 aJeong, S.-Y.1 aIn, Y.-H.1 aKim, K.-Y.1 aSo, J.-S.1 aChang, W.-S.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2010 May, v. 50, no. 5 p.452-456dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2010.02813.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100409b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03141naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245008400172300001800256500002400274520160100298650001501899650001201914650000901926650001701935650002401952650001401976650001101990650001302001650001702014650001702031650001602048650001702064650001202081650002002093650001302113650001102126650001502137650001602152650001202168650001602180653002602196653002702222653002602249653002702275653002902302700002102331700001802352700001602370773013702386852000902523856005502532655001202587IND4426007020221120033122.0090918e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442600702DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2009.02035.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehrah, Djaafar10aExtrusion parameters and consumer acceptability of a peanut-based meat analogue  ap. 2075-2084.  aIncludes references  aDespite its high protein content and low cost, defatted peanut flour (DPF) remains underutilised in human foods. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine the best extrusion parameters for a peanut-based textured meat analogue (TMA); (2) develop new TMA products from DPF and (3) evaluate their consumer acceptability. Preliminary runs using a wide range of extrusion parameters were conducted. A central composite RSM design was used to determine the optimal extrusion conditions within the best ranges revealed by the preliminary runs. Three levels of moisture, screw-speed and barrel temperature were used in 31 runs. Expansion ratio, bulk density, texture profile, water absorption/solubility indexes of the extrudates were determined and used as indicators of product quality. Peanut-based TMAs produced at optimal extrusion conditions were flavoured with beef flavour and evaluated by a 60-member sensory panel for flavour, texture, and overall liking, using a 9-point hedonic scale. Optimisation studies revealed that the most important extrusion conditions are in descending order: protein content, temperature, moisture and screw-speed. Extrusion conditions that produced the best TMA were 60-65% protein, 50-55% moisture, 160-165 °C and 80-90 r.p.m. Sensory acceptability of snacks incorporating peanut-based TMAs was similar or better than those containing soya-based TMAs in terms of flavour, texture, off-flavour and overall liking. TMA produced from inexpensive DPF has the potential to compete with commercial meat analogues, thereby adding value to the peanut industry. 3aabsorption 3abarrels 3abeef 3abulk density 3aconsumer acceptance 3aextrusion 3ahumans 3aindustry 3ameat analogs 3anew products 3aoff flavors 3apeanut flour 3apeanuts 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3asnacks 3asolubility 3atemperature 3atexture 3avalue added 0aDefatted peanut flour 0apeanut protein isolate 0asensory acceptability 0asingle-screw extrusion 0atexturised meat analogue1 aAhmedna, Mohamed1 aGoktepe, Ipek1 aYu, Jianmei0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2009 Oct., v. 44, no. 10 p.2075-2084dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2009.02035.x 7aarticle03565naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002500171245014500196300001600341520134000357650001301697650002101710650001601731650001001747650002001757650002601777650002001803650000901823650002301832650002401855650001801879650001101897650001001908650001201918650002501930650001801955650001001973650001501983650002601998650004702024650001202071650003502083650002102118650004002139650001802179650003302197650002102230650002102251650004902272650001302321653001902334653002302353653002502376700002102401700001802422700002102440700002302461700003102484700001702515700002002532773014602552852000902698856009202707930003302799946001102832655001202843IND4434174420221120033204.0100319e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443417442DNAL7 a191754532pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2008.00900.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValente, Luísa M.P.10aEffects of carbohydrate sources on growth, body composition and tissue lipid deposition of blackspot seabream, Pagellus bogaraveo (Brunnich)  ap. 212-219.  aRearing blackspot seabream has been associated with low growth rates and excessive lipid accumulation, resulting in a reduction of the edible yield. The effect of extruded diets containing different carbohydrate sources (wheat vs. wheat bran) was evaluated on 100 g blackspot seabream growth performance, feed utilization and fat deposition, taking into consideration the optimal dietary protein and lipid level described for smaller-sized fish. A fish meal-based diet was also tested as a control to assure maximal growth rates were achieved. The experiment was held in sea cages at environmental conditions. Duplicate groups of fish were distributed among six cages with a stocking density of 1.3 kg/m³ and hand-fed each diet for 7 months. At the end of the experiment, fish in all groups doubled their body weight attaining 190-230 g. Specific growth rate (0.3-04), feed conversion ratio (1.3-1.6) and protein gain (0.5-0.6 g/kg/day) were similar among treatments. The Hepatosomatic Index, the Viscerosomatic Index and final whole body composition did not vary significantly among dietary treatments; nevertheless, the inclusion of wheat bran induced a significant increase of liver lipid content and the highest mesenteric fat index. All diets were effective in reducing whole body and mesenteric fat compared with initial values. 3aPagellus 3abody composition 3abody weight 3acages 3adietary protein 3aenvironmental factors 3afeed conversion 3afish 3agrowth performance 3ahepatosomatic index 3alipid content 3alipids 3aliver 3arearing 3aspecific growth rate 3astocking rate 3awheat 3awheat bran 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxdrug effects 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Carbohydratesxpharmacology 2aDietary Fiber 2aDrug Administration Schedule 2aLipid Metabolism 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aSea Breamxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aTriticum 0afish nutrition 0aPagellus bogaraveo 0atissue lipid content1 aOlmedo, Mercedes1 aBorges, Pedro1 aSoares, Sílvia.1 aGomes, Emidio F.S.1 aÁlvarez-Blázquez, Blanca1 aPazos, Gemma1 aLinares, Fatima0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2010 Apr., v. 94, no. 2 p.212-219dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2008.00900.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100319b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02215naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100001900128245004800147300001600195500002400211520100600235650001101241650001301252650002601265650002101291650001701312650002201329650001601351650001301367650002201380650002201402653002101424700001501445700001401460700001701474773013601491852000901627856007401636930003301710945002501743946001301768655001201781IND4384780020221122203913.0061027e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438478002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aN200 0aF1101 aTorregrosa, A.10aMechanical Harvesting of Processed Apricots  ap. 499-506.  aIncludes references  aHand harvesting apricots is a time-consuming task, accounting for more than 60% of the total labor time of the crop in Spain. Moreover, the harvesting period is very short, around two weeks. This research aims to reduce costs by evaluating five mechanical harvesting systems on three different types of plantations. To detach the fruits, manual, tractor-hitched, and tractor-towed shakers were used in a range of 13.7 to 22.5 Hz that produced, at the branch level, peak accelerations of 51 to 590 m/s 2 . All detachable fruits fell in less than 2.4 s. Harvesting costs were reduced from 0.107 euro/kg for hand harvesting to 0.006 to 0.039 euro/kg for the mechanical systems, and the harvest rate per operator increased from 56 kg/h for hand harvesting to 448 to 7680 kg/h for the mechanical systems. The quality of mechanically harvested fruits was acceptable for processing. This study also demonstrated that selective harvesting of apricots according to maturity is difficult with vibratory systems. 3aPrunus 3aapricots 3amechanical harvesting 3afruit harvesters 3atree shakers 3amanual harvesting 3acrop damage 3aorchards 3amechanical damage 3acosts and returns 0aharvesting costs1 aMartin, B.1 aOrtiz, C.1 aChaparro, O.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2006 July, v. 22, no. 4 p.499-506dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070912b20071002c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/09/11  aOther US 7aarticle03398naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100001400128245007600142300001600218500002400234500001500258520195100273650001602224650001302240650002302253650002602276650000902302650002302311650003502334650002802369650002102397650001602418650002202434651001102456653001902467653002602486653002202512700001602534700001702550700001502567700002002582773013602602852000902738856007402747930003302821945002502854946001302879655001202892IND4384780320221122173739.0061027e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438478032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP210 0aF1201 aDogan, E.10aOn-Farm Scheduling Studies and CERES-Maize Simulation of Irrigated Corn  ap. 509-516.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA field study was conducted to evaluate an irrigation scheduling model (KanSched) using seven center pivot irrigated corn sites in south central Kansas from 1999 to 2001. Portions of each center pivot irrigation system were modified to apply various irrigation amounts. Site-specific irrigation, weather, and field data were used in KanSched to create comparative irrigation schedules for each test zone of each site. Those schedules were also used in the CERES-Maize corn growth simulation model. Irrigation treatments included deficit amounts ranging from 10 to 180 mm while excess irrigation amounts ranged from 8 to 139 mm. KanSched calculated crop evapotranspiration (ET(ks)) ranged from 370 to 488, 356 to 426, and 386 to 566 mm, while CERES-Maize simulated crop ET ranged from 418 to 585, 398 to 699, and 409 to 712 mm for all sites in 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively. Analyses of measured corn grain yield versus a KanSched water balance ratio [R(w) = (Net irrigation + Effective rain + Soil water depletion) / ET(ks)] indicated that crop yield was highest at a water balance ratio of 1.0 (full irrigation). Measured yield from all treatments ranged from 9.5 to 13.1, 7.4 to 14.4, and 3.8 to 16.1 Mg ha -1 while CERES-Maize simulated corn yield ranged from 7.9 to 13.8, 6.9 to 17.1, and 6.6 to 13.8 Mg ha -1 in 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively. In general, substantial deficit irrigation amounts reduced measured grain yield especially in drier years on south central Kansas farm sites. While the CERES-Maize model simulated average yield from all sites and years was equal to the average measured yield, the model over-predicted measured yields in the lower end of the measured yield range and under predicted yield in the upper end of the measured yield range. Thus, the CERES-Maize model may be adequate for large spatial and temporal simulations, but may not be adequate to simulate individual sites and deficit yield conditions. 3acrop models 3aZea mays 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation scheduling 3acorn 3adeficit irrigation 3aagricultural management models 3acenter pivot irrigation 3airrigation rates 3agrain yield 3airrigated farming 3aKansas 0aKanSched model 0airrigation management 0aCERES-Maize model1 aClark, G.A.1 aRogers, D.H.1 aMartin, V.1 aVanderlip, R.L.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2006 July, v. 22, no. 4 p.509-516dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070912b20071002c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/09/11  aOther US 7aarticle01801naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245009500167300001600262500002400278500001500302520065000317650001700967650002400984650001601008650001201024650001701036650000901053650002001062650001901082650003101101650001401132650001901146653001301165700001401178700001901192700001601211773010301227852000901330856005201339655001201391IND4463352020221122173759.0120604e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446335202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2003.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedlmeyer, F.10aEffect of protein composition and homogenisation on the stability of acidified milk drinks  ap. 331-336.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAcidified milk drinks are commonly stabilised by the presence of high methoxyl pectin. Pectin is electrosorbed to the protein particles and prevents their flocculation by steric hindrance. Furthermore, a weak mixed gel of casein and pectin reduces sedimentation. In this study acidified milk drinks were produced in a pilot plant with homogenisation pressures between 20 and 80 MPa. The target was to assess the influence of the protein particle size distribution on the stability of the acidified milks. Additionally, the process steps for the production of acidified milks were varied to examine the role of whey proteins in the stabilisation. 3awhey protein 3aprotein composition 3acasein gels 3apectins 3aflocculation 3amilk 3amilk production 3aacidified milk 3aparticle size distribution 3abeverages 3ahomogenization 0aproteins1 aBrack, M.1 aRademacher, B.1 aKulozik, U.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2004 Apr., v. 14, no. 4 p.331-336dElsevier Sciencex0958-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2003.09.009 7aarticle02678naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001400138245013400152300001800286520144100304650004401745650001501789650002301804650001201827650001701839650000901856650002101865650004401886650002201930650001301952650001601965700001801981700001901999773014102018852000902159856007802168930003302246946001302279655001202292IND4419340820221122173736.0090417e20090515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441934082DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.233482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aResmi, R.10aControl of molecular aggregation in symmetrically substituted π-conjugated bulky poly(p-phenylenevinylene)s and their copolymers  ap. 2631-2646.  aA new series of symmetrically substituted bulky PPV-copolymers based on poly(bis-2,5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (BEH-PPV) bearing tricyclodecane (TCD) pendants were synthesized to study the effect of chain aggregation in the π-conjugated polymer backbone. The composition of the copolymers was varied up to 100 mol % and the structures of the copolymer were confirmed by NMR and FTIR. The molecular weights of the copolymers were obtained as Mw = 11,500-1,78,800 depending on the TCD-incorporation in BEH-PPV. The origin of the π-aggregation was investigated using mixture of solvents (polar or nonpolar) or temperature as external stimuli. Absorption, photoluminescence, and time-resolved fluorescence decay techniques were employed as tools to trace molecular aggregation in solution and solid state. The TCD-substituted bulky copolymers showed almost twice the enhancement in photoluminescence compared with that of BEH-PPV. Solvent-induced aggregation studies of copolymers revealed the existence of strong molecular aggregation in BEH-PPV compared with that of bulky copolymers. Variable temperature studies further evidence for the reversibility of molecular aggregation on heating/cooling cycles and showed isosbetic points with respect to free and aggregated polymer chains. Time-resolved fluorescent studies confirmed the existence of free and aggregated π-conjugated species with a life time of 0.1 to 1.0 ns. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3acomposite polymers 3acooling 3afluorescence 3aheat 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphotoluminescence 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aAmrutha, S.R.1 aJayakannan, M.0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 May 15, v. 47, no. 10 p.2631-2646dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.233483Available from publisher's Web site  a20090417b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03395naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245009100172300001600263500002400279500001500303520169200318650002502010650001802035650001402053650001502067650002002082650001902102650002002121650001602141650001202157650001702169650002102186650001902207650001602226650002002242650001602262650001202278650001302290650001902303650002402322650000902346650002102355653001502376700002702391700002902418700002302447700002102470700002002491700002402511700001902535700002202554700002002576700001902596773010202615852000902717856005502726655001202781IND4451089220221122140858.0110322e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445108922DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01741.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToledo, Marisol10aClimate is a stronger driver of tree and forest growth rates than soil and disturbance  ap. 254-264.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  a1. Essential resources such as water, nutrients and light vary over space and time and plant growth rates are expected to vary accordingly. We examined the effects of climate, soil and logging disturbances on diameter growth rates at the tree and stand level, using 165 1‐ha permanent sample plots distributed across Bolivian tropical lowland forests. 2. We predicted that growth rates would be higher in humid than in dry forests, higher in nutrient‐rich than nutrient‐poor forests and higher in logged than non‐logged forests. 3. Across the 165 plots we found positive basal area increases at the stand level, which agree with the generally reported biomass increases in tropical forests. 4. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that climate variables, in particular water availability, were the strongest drivers of tree growth. More rainfall, a shorter and less intense dry period and higher temperatures led to higher tree growth rates. 5. Tree growth increased modestly with soil fertility and basal area growth was greatest at intermediate soil fertility. Surprisingly, tree growth showed little or no relationship with total soil nitrogen or plant available soil phosphorus. 6. Growth rates increased in logged plots just after logging, but this effect disappeared after 6 years. 7. Synthesis. Climate is the strongest driver of spatial variation in tree growth, and climate change may therefore have large consequences for forest productivity and carbon sequestration. The negative impact of decreased rainfall and increased rainfall seasonality on tree growth might be partly offset by the positive impact of increased temperature in these forests. 3acarbon sequestration 3aforest growth 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3adisturbed soils 3asoil fertility 3alowland forests 3adry forests 3aclimate 3aforest trees 3atropical forests 3aclimate change 3atemperature 3awater resources 3atree growth 3alogging 3anitrogen 3aspace and time 3aregression analysis 3arain 3astand basal area 0abasal area1 aPoorter, L.q(Lourens)1 aPeña‐Claros, Marielos1 aAlarcón, Alfredo.1 aBalcázar, Julio1 aLeaño, Claudio1 aLicona, Juan Carlos1 aLlanque, Oscar1 aVroomans, Vincent1 aZuidema, Pieter1 aBongers, Frans0 tjournal of ecology.g2011 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.254-264dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01741.x 7aarticle02788naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245014900171300001600320520157900336650002201915650002401937650002101961650001601982650002001998650001502018650002502033650002002058650001402078653002102092653002802113700002302141773011202164852000902276856008502285939003302370946001102403655001202414IND4449569220221122140810.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444956922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-010-9425-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerstes, Niels A. G. 10aDetection of refuge from enemies through phenological mismatching in multitrophic interactions requires season-wide estimation of host abundance  ap. 485-498.  aThe concept of “enemy-free space” (EFS) refers to ways of living that reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of a species to natural enemies. It has been invoked to explain host shifts of phytophagous insects. A demonstrated cause of EFS is escape from enemies in time, through phenological mismatching of herbivore development and enemy occurrence, leading to low percentages of predation/parasitism of herbivores occurring at a certain time. The mere measurement of percentage parasitism, however, is not sufficient to demonstrate EFS in certain cases. Here we present such a case, where parasitism was studied of a phytophagous insect (Phyllotreta nemorum), using two different host plant species in the field: an atypical, relatively rarely used, plant (Barbarea vulgaris), and a more widely used one (Sinapis arvensis). At one location we found a paradoxical result: on each separate sampling day throughout the season the percentage of parasitism of P. nemorum using a patch of B. vulgaris was not significantly different from, or even significantly higher than on a nearby patch of S. arvensis. The overall season-wide proportion parasitism of the flea beetle cohort using the B. vulgaris patch, however, was lower. We conclude that, in the year and at the location we studied, the patch of B. vulgaris provided enemy-free space to the herbivore in the form of a temporal refuge, and that the importance of enemy-free space in the use of an atypical host plant should be evaluated on the basis of season-wide sampling, including estimation of host population size. 3aBarbarea vulgaris 3aPhyllotreta nemorum 3aSinapis arvensis 3ahost plants 3anatural enemies 3aparasitism 3aphytophagous insects 3apopulation size 3apredation 0aEnemy-free space 0aAsynchrony in phenology1 ade Jong, Peter W. 0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2011 Mar., v. 25, no. 2 p.485-498dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0269-76537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-010-9425-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02274naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245008000158300001600238500002400254520124500278650002001523650001301543650005001556650001301606650001401619650000901633650002401642650002001666650002101686700001401707700001901721700001801740773009701758852000901855856004801864655001201912IND4427807920221122103211.0091023e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442780792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-009-9733-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Jun14aThe altitudinal dependence of recent rapid warming over the Tibetan Plateau  ap. 321-327.  aIncludes references  aThe Tibetan Plateau (TP) exerts significant impacts on its surroundings through its thermal and dynamical processes. In recent decades, especially since 2000, the TP has been experiencing a more rapid warming than its surrounding regions. This study uses Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) monthly averaged land surface temperature (LST) product to detect the recent warming trend with respect to elevations over the entire TP, because the number of weather stations from China Meteorological Administration (CMA) is rather limited in the western TP and, furthermore, are unavailable for areas higher than 4,800 m above sea level (ASL). The trend of MODIS LST is first validated against the warming trend estimated from near-surface air temperatures measured at CMA stations and the warming rate dependence on elevation is then derived from MODIS LST. The results indicate that the warming rate increases from 3,000 to 4,800 m ASL, and then becomes quite stable with a slight decline near the highest elevations. This altitudinal dependence of the warming rate has a significant implication for TP water resources and environmental changes, since most glaciers and snow surfaces are located above 5,000 m ASL over the TP. 3aair temperature 3aglaciers 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aplateaus 3asea level 3asnow 3asurface temperature 3awater resources 3aweather stations1 aYang, Kun1 aLiang, Shunlin1 aGuo, Xiaofeng0 tClimatic change.g2009 Nov., v. 97, no. 1-2 p.321-327dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-009-9733-9 7aarticle02839naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245010600180300001600286500002400302520148700326650001301813650000901826650001901835650001101854650002301865650001301888650003801901650001401939650003801953650003301991650002202024650000902046650001202055650003102067650002002098650002002118651001002138651001002148700001502158700001302173700001402186773010002200852000902300856004802309655001202357IND4409113220221122103311.0080815e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440911322DNAL7 a184278822pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-008-9122-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, H.

Based on nine years of field observation and K-mean clusters, 84 rainfall events were grouped into three rainfall regimes. Rainfall regime A is the group of events with strong rainfall intensity, high frequency, and short duration. Rainfall regime C consists of events with low intensity, long duration, and infrequent occurrence. Rainfall regime B is the aggregation of events of medium intensity and medium duration, and less frequent occurrence. The following results were found: (1) Different from traditional studies, runoff coefficient neither decreased nor increased, but presented peak value on the slope surfaces; (2) For individual plot, runoff coefficients induced by rainfall regime A were the highest, and those induced by rainfall regime C were the lowest; Downslope, the runoff coefficients induced by three rainfall regimes presented the same changing trend, although the peak value induced by regime A occurred on a shorter slope length compared to those by regime B and C; (3) Scale effect on runoff induced by rainfall regime A was the least, and that induced by rainfall regime C was the largest. These results can be explained by the interactions of crusting, soil moisture content, slope length and gradient, and erosion units, etc., in the context of different rainfall regimes. 3aplateaus 3arain 3arain intensity 3arunoff 3asoil water content 2aAltitude 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGeologic Sedimentsxanalysis 2aPlant Development 2aRain 2aSeasons 2aSoilxanalysisxstandards. 2aWaterxanalysis 2aWater Movements 3aChina 0aChina1 aCai, Q.

In this work, RNA amplification and labeling by NASBA and microarray analysis are combined in a one-step process. The NASBA reaction is performed in direct contact with capture probes. These probes are bound to surface-attached hydrogel spots generated at the chip surfaces by using a simple printing and UV irradiation process. Five gene expression and SNP parameters with known relevance in breast cancer diagnostics were chosen to demonstrate that multiplex NASBA-on-microarray analysis is possible. A minimum amount of 10 pg of total RNA was shown to be sufficient for the detection of the reference parameter RPS18, which demonstrates that the detection limit of the microarray-based NASBA assays theoretically allows single-cell assays to be performed.

The maximum piezoresistive stress coefficient (Π) of 1.52 x 10⁻³ MPa⁻¹ was noted at just above the percolation threshold concentration (Φ ~ 0.05 wt %) of SWCNT. This coefficient value exceeds those of metallic piezoresistive materials by two orders of magnitude (4.25 x 10⁻⁵ MPa⁻¹ for aluminum). The high piezoresistive characteristics appear to originate from a change in the intrinsic resistivity of the composite caused by the variation of the tunneling distance between conducting inclusions (SWCNTs) under compression or tension. 3aaluminum 3acarbon nanotubes 3ananocomposites 3aphysics 3apolymers1 aPark, Cheol1 aScholl, Jonathan A.1 aBrazin, Amy H.1 aHolloway, Nancy M.1 aHigh, James W.1 aLowther, Sharon E.1 aHarrison, Joycelyn S.0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 May 15, v. 47, no. 10 p.994-1003dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.217053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090417b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02681naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003100145245009700176300001600273520127900289650001501568650001601583650002301599650002001622650001501642650001701657650001701674650001701691650002101708650001701729650002401746650000901770650001401779650002201793653002001815653001501835653001601850653003101866700003201897700003301929773011101962852000902073856008502082930003302167946001102200655001202211IND4446344520221122075221.0101210e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444634452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-010-0193-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÁlvarez-González, Isela 10aInhibitory Effect of Grapefruit Juice on the Genotoxic Damage Induced by Ifosfamide in Mouse  ap. 369-373.  aThe consumption of grapefruit juice (GJ) has been associated with various activities potentially beneficial for human health, including protection against the DNA damage produced by various compounds. In the present report, we evaluated the capability of this juice to inhibit the rate of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPE) and sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) induced by the antineoplastic alkylating agent ifosfamide (IF). We tested the effect of administering 100, 500, and 1000 mg/kg of GJ in mouse and obtained the following results: a) with the high dose, a reduction of 72% in the rate of SCE induced by IF; b) a mean reduction of 65.3% in the rate of MNPE compared with the damage induced by IF at 48 h post-administration; c) no modification induced by GJ either on the cellular proliferation kinetics or in the mitotic index; and d) neither induction of bone marrow cytotoxicity by GJ nor a protective effect of the juice against the cytotoxicity induced by IF. These data showed a significant inhibitory effect of GJ against the chromosome damage induced by the tested agent; they also suggest the relevance of carrying out studies to clarify the involved mechanism of action as well as to determine the cancer chemopreventive capacity of the juice. 3aDNA damage 3abone marrow 3acell proliferation 3achemoprevention 3achromatids 3acytotoxicity 3aerythrocytes 3agenotoxicity 3agrapefruit juice 3ahuman health 3amechanism of action 3amice 3aneoplasms 3aprotective effect 0aAntimutagenesis 0aIfosfamide 0aMicronuclei 0aSister chromatid exchanges1 aMadrigal-Bujaidar, Eduardo 1 aSánchez-García, Vanesa Y. 0 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2010 Dec., v. 65, no. 4 p.369-373dBoston : Springer USx0921-96687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-010-0193-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20101211b20110101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02278naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245006800171300001800239520093000257650001801187650001801205650001201223650001001235650001101245650001801256650002401274650001601298650001801314653001301332653003001345653001601375653002201391653002201413700001501435700001901450700001701469700002201486700001701508773015001525852000901675856009201684930003301776946001101809655001201820IND4442775120221122075229.0100924e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444277512DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2010.02380.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Wei-Qiang10aStudies on different combined microwave drying of carrot pieces  ap. 2141-2148.  aThree different combined microwave (MW) drying methods were compared, namely microwave-assisted vacuum drying (MWVD), microwave-assisted freeze drying (MWFD), microwave-enhanced spouted bed drying (MWSD), in terms of drying rate, drying uniformity, product colour, rehydration ratio, retention of β-carotene and vitamin C, and energy consumption. The drying rate of MWVD and MWSD were much faster than that of MWFD. The largest drying rate was obtained in MWSD with 3.5 W g⁻¹. In general, the colour of MWSD products was very uniform. Rehydration ratio of MWFD carrot pieces was almost the same as the freeze-dried (FD) products and better than MWVD and MWSD products. In addition, the highest retention of carotene and vitamin C was observed in MWFD carrot pieces. No significant differences were observed in carotene and vitamin C between MWVD and MWSD products. However, the energy consumption in MWFD was the highest. 3aascorbic acid 3abeta-carotene 3acarrots 3acolor 3aenergy 3afreeze drying 3amicrowave treatment 3arehydration 3avacuum drying 0aCarotene 0acombined microwave drying 0adrying rate 0adrying uniformity 0arehydration ratio1 aZhang, Min1 aHuang, Lue-Lue1 aTang, Juming1 aMujumdar, Arun S.1 aSun, Jin-Cai0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2010 Oct., v. 45, no. 10 p.2141-2148dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2010.02380.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100924b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02063naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001800138245010600156300001800262520092300280650001201203650002801215650001101243650001501254650001501269650001401284650001301298650002701311650001401338650001601352700002301368700002401391773014101415852000901556856007801565930003301643946001301676655001201689IND4419341820221122055619.0090417e20090515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441934182DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.217032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Youn-Gyu10aFacile one-pot synthesis and characterization of novel nanostructured organic dispersible polyaniline  ap. 1024-1029.  aNovel polyaniline (PANI) with nanotube, nanosheet, and nanofiber shapes was facilely synthesized by a self-templating one-pot process. Anilinium-dodecylsulfate (DS) complex, obtained by mixing equivalent amounts of aniline and sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), played a template-like role in forming PANI nanostructures. It was found that the morphology and electrical conductivity of the PANI nanostructures changed with the amount of SDS and the reaction temperature. Nanotube-shaped PANI synthesized at the temperature of anilinium-DS complex formation in presence of SDS (concentration <0.12 M) showed high conductivity (12.9 S/cm). At higher temperature, the morphology changed to shape of a rose flower and electrical conductivity decreased to 3.95 S/cm. This suggested that both temperature and SDS concentration were key parameters for controlling the formation of the anilinium-DS complex that acted as a template. 3aaniline 3aelectrical conductivity 3amixing 3ananofibers 3ananosheets 3ananotubes 3apolymers 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asynthesis 3atemperature1 aKusunose, Takafumi1 aSekino, T.q(Tohru)0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 May 15, v. 47, no. 10 p.1024-1029dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.217033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090417b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02142naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002100142245006700163300001600230520136600246650001001612650002201622650001301644773008401657852000901741856008201750930003301832946001101865655001201876IND4419334320221122045027.0090417e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441933432DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2008001822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeng, Henry H.Q.14aThe genome-centric concept: resynthesis of evolutionary theory  ap. 512-525.  aModern biology has been heavily influenced by the gene-centric concept. Paradoxically, this very concept - on which bioresearch is based - is challenged by the success of gene-based research in terms of explaining evolutionary theory. To overcome this major roadblock, it is essential to establish new theories, to not only solve the key puzzles presented by the gene-centric concept, but also to provide a conceptual framework that allows the field to grow. This paper discusses a number of paradoxes and illustrates how they can be addressed by the genome-centric concept in order to further resynthesize evolutionary theory. In particular, methodological breakthroughs that analyze genome evolution are discussed. The multiple interactions among different levels of a complex system provide the key to understanding the relationship between self-organization and natural selection. Darwinian natural selection applies to the biological level due to its unique genetic and heterogeneous features, but does not simply or directly apply to either the lower non-living level or higher intellectual society level. At the complex bio-system level, the genome context (the entire package of genes and their genomic physical relationship or genomic topology), not the individual genes, defines the system and serves as the principle selection platform for evolution. 3agenes 3anatural selection 3atopology0 tBioEssays.g2009 May, v. 31, no. 5 p.512-525dWiley-VCH Verlagx0265-92477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2008001823Available from publisher's Web site  a20090417b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03010naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245012000144300001600264500001500280520145300295650001301748650002301761650001401784650002501798650001101823650001401834650003001848650002501878650003601903650001901939650002201958650002701980650001202007650001402019653001702033653002002050653002002070653002802090653001802118700001702136700001502153700001402168700001402182700001402196700002102210700001602231700001402247700001502261773007802276852000902354930003302363945002502396946001102421655001202432IND4377842420221122025031.0060213e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437784242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

These strains were subjected to sequence and phylogenetic analysis based on partial sequences of genome segments A and B. Although there is co-evolution of the two genome segments (70 % of strains kept the same genetic relatives in the segment A- and B-defined consensus trees), several strains (26 %) were identified with the incongruence length difference test as exhibiting a significantly different phylogenetic relationship depending on which segment was analysed. This suggested that natural reassortment could have occurred. One of the possible naturally occurring reassortant strains, which exhibited a segment A related to the vvIBDV cluster whereas its segment B was not, was thoroughly sequenced (coding sequence of both segments) and submitted to a standardized experimental characterization of its acute pathogenicity. This strain induced significantly less mortality than typical vvIBDVs; however, the mechanisms for this reduced pathogenicity remain unknown, as no significant difference in the bursal lesions, post-infectious antibody response or virus production in the bursa was observed in challenged chickens. 3achickens 3abursa of Fabricius 3aphenotype 3aneutralization tests 3agenome 3aphylogeny 3ainfectious bursal disease 3anucleotide sequences 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3aviral antigens 3agenetic variation 3amolecular epidemiology 3astrains 3avirulence 0aepidemiology 0avaccine strains 0anatural strains 0amolecular sequence data 0apathogenicity1 aRivallan, G.1 aToquin, D.1 aDarlu, P.1 aMorin, Y.1 aBeven, V.1 aBoisseson, C. de1 aCazaban, C.1 aComte, S.1 aGardin, Y.0 tJournal of general virology.g2006 Jan., v. 87 p.209-216x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20060306b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02871naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001300127245013800140300002100278520180300299650002102102650001002123650002202133650002902155650002702184650001302211650001702224650001702241650002202258650001302280700001802293773011802311852000902429930003302438945002502471946001302496655001202509IND4419408520221122025248.0090422e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441940852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGraf, T.10aVariable-density groundwater flow and solute transport in fractured rock: Applicability of the Tang et al. [1981] analytical solution  ap. W02425 (12 p.  aThe effect of fluid density variations on mixed convective (advective and density-driven) transport in fractured rock is examined. Assuming a representative natural hydraulic gradient in a vertical fracture, breakthrough curves for variable-density systems are shown to be significantly different from those with constant-density conditions for even very small solute source concentrations (as low as approximately 2.3 g L-1 total dissolved solids, corresponding to 6.4% of seawater salinity). We compare analytical solutions with results of fully coupled numerical simulations of variable-density groundwater flow and solute transport in fractured rock. Current analytical solutions for solute transport in fractured rock do not account for fluid density variations and therefore fail to predict variable-density transport. Using a mixed convection ratio analysis, we determine the hydrogeologic conditions where variable-density transport is important and hence when analytical solutions fail to predict variable-density transport in fractured rock. We present a modified velocity term that includes a density-driven flow component in a vertical fracture to account for fluid density variations. The modified velocity term is incorporated into the standard Tang et al. (1981) analytical solution. The original density-invariant analytical solution is shown to be applicable near a solute source and at early time, while the velocity-modified density-variant solution gives very good results for long-term and far-field behavior. These results suggest that analytical solutions may still be useful for analyzing variable-density transport in fractured rock. This study has implications for the analysis of dense plume transport in fractured rock where reliable long-term predictions are important. 3agroundwater flow 3arocks 3ahydrologic models 3asoil transport processes 3atotal dissolved solids 3aseawater 3asaline water 3ahydrogeology 3asimulation models 3avelocity1 aSimmons, C.T.0 tWater resources research.g2009 Feb., v. 45, no. 2 p.W02425 (12 p-W02425 (12 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20090504b20090608c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/05/04  aOther US 7aarticle01626naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002100127245005300148300002100201500001500222520071000237650001100947650001600958650001100974650000900985650001100994650002201005650001501027651001901042653001701061773011801078852000901196930003301205945002501238946001301263655001201276IND4419408420221122025203.0090422e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441940842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The ungauged lateral inflows are generated by a unit hydrograph rainfall-runoff model. The model is calibrated by optimizing the parameters of the functional form for the average cross section along the reach, the base lateral inflow and the peak of the unit hydrograph, and the rating curve extensions downstream and upstream. The model is confirmed by applying it to a synthetic river reach and then to the forecasting of floods in a reach of the River Wye, UK. 3arivers 3acalibration 3afloods 3arain 3arunoff 3ahydrologic models 3aprediction 3aUnited Kingdom 0aoptimization0 tWater resources research.g2009 Feb., v. 45, no. 2 p.W02426 (15 p-W02426 (15 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20090504b20090608c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/05/04  aOther US 7aarticle02339naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002800127245006500155300002000220500001500240520126100255650001301516650002701529650002301556650001001579650001101589650002901600650001301629650000901642650001301651650001801664650002201682650002901704653001201733773011601745852000901861930003301870945002501903946001301928655001201941IND4419408720221122025141.0090422e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441940872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGardner, Leonard Robert10aAssessing the accuracy of monitoring wells in tidal wetlands  ap. W02503 (5 p.  a2019-12-04  aGroundwater movement in marshes is driven by tidal fluctuations, evapotranspiration, and the infiltration of rainwater. These forcings act on time scales of several hours. Monitoring wells in marshes must, therefore, be able to react rapidly and accurately to changes in these forcings. To assess the response characteristics of a given well design, I define a well's time constant as the square of its radius divided by the product of the aquifer conductivity and the length of its screen. Using numerical simulations, I show that the logarithm of the mean deviation over a tidal cycle between the head in the well and the head in the adjoining undisturbed aquifer is linearly related to the logarithm of the well time constant. Similar logarithmic relationships occur for the maximum deviations on flood and ebb tides and the well time constant. Thus, wells in soils with low hydraulic conductivity must have smaller radii and longer screens than those in more conductive soils in order to have similar accuracy. Alternatively, the time constant can be lowered by incorporating the pressure sensor in a slug that displaces most of the water above the sensor and thereby greatly reduces the volume of water that must move between the well and the aquifer. 3awetlands 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aevapotranspiration 3awells 3afloods 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3aaquifers 3arain 3aaccuracy 3awetland soils 3ahydrologic models 3aenvironmental monitoring 0asensors0 tWater resources research.g2009 Feb., v. 45, no. 2 p.W02503 (5 p-W02503 (5 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20090504b20090608c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/05/04  aOther US 7aarticle02938naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245005200163300001600215520201700231650001902248653001602267653001902283653001802302700001602320700002002336700002302356773010702379852000902486856008502495930003302580946001102613655001202624IND4448580620221122002905.0110128e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444858062DNAL7 a10.1007/s11069-010-9576-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanti, P. M. 10aDebris-flow impact, vulnerability, and response  ap. 371-402.  aThis paper calls attention to vulnerable groups that are disproportionately affected by smaller, less-publicized debris flow events and do not always receive the advantages of recent technical advances. The most vulnerable groups tend to be economically restricted to live in relatively inexpensive and more dangerous locations, are often forced to live in topographically cramped areas due to expansion and development, and have limited influence and power needed to bring about mitigative efforts. Technical issues have long been the focus for debris-flow hazard reduction, but the collective judgment of many of those working toward natural hazards reduction, especially in developing countries, is that socio-cultural issues are at least as important as technical choices on the effectiveness of hazard and risk-reduction efforts. This awareness may result in (1) selecting simple designs that use local materials, local construction techniques and skills, and that recognize limited financial means; (2) selecting mitigative methods that require minimal maintenance, can withstand exposure to vandalism and scavenging, and will minimize misappropriation of resources; and (3) capitalizing on local techniques of dealing with other hazards, such as flooding, earthquakes, and landslides. Because of the difficulty in predicting and controlling debris flows, it is useful if mitigative systems can employ multiple elements to enhance the chance of success. These can include: education of the local populace, avoidance and warning to the degree possible, and some combination of channelization and interception of debris. For watersheds disturbed by fire, logging, mining, or construction, hillside treatment can be added to the mitigative methods to reduce water flow and sediment transport. Examples provided in this paper show that these mitigative systems can be tailored to fit widely varying socio-cultural settings, with different geological characteristics and different debris flow-triggering events. 3arisk reduction 0aDebris flow 0aSocio-cultural 0aVulnerability1 aHewitt, K. 1 aVanDine, D.

Because NPP cannot be measured directly, researchers use field-measured surrogates as input variables in various equations designed to estimate 'true NPP'. This has led to considerable debate concerning which equations most accurately estimate 'true NPP'. This debate has influenced efforts to assess NPP in grasslands, with researchers often advocating more complex equations to avoid underestimation. However, this approach ignores the increase in statistical error associated with NPP estimates as a greater number of parameters and more complex mathematical functions are introduced into the equation. Using published grassland data and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, we assessed the relative variability in NPP estimates obtained using six different NPP estimation equations that varied in both the number of parameters and intricacy of mathematical operations. Our results indicated that more complex equations may result in greater uncertainty without reducing the probability of underestimation. The amount of uncertainty associated with estimates of NPP was influenced by the number of parameters as well as the variability in the data and the nature of the mathematical operations. For example, due to greater variability in the field-measured belowground data than aboveground data, estimates of belowground NPP tended to have more uncertainty than estimates of aboveground NPP. An analysis in which the input data were standardized allowed us to isolate the details of the calculations from the variability in the data in assessing the propagation of uncertainty. This analysis made clear that equations with product terms have the potential to magnify the uncertainty of the inputs in the estimates of NPP although this relationship was complicated by interactions with data variability and number of parameters. Our results suggest that more complex NPP estimation equations can increase uncertainty without necessarily reducing risk of underestimation. Because estimates can never be tested by comparison to “true NPP”, we recommend that researchers include an assessment of propagation of statistical error when evaluating the 'best' estimation method. 3agrasslands 3aprimary productivity 3aMonte Carlo method 3asimulation models 3aequations 3abiomass 3aMexico1 aWade, A.

Intensive expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 in zones of invasive growth of the tumor was associated with enhanced accumulation of β-catenin in the nuclei of tumor cells in peripheral zones of 28% studied tumors. The presence of nuclear β-catenin and increased content of metalloproteinase 9 in the tumor were associated with abnormal accumulation of laminin in cell cytoplasm and with the absence of collagen IV-containing basal membranes. These changes were typical of tumors with high invasive and metastatic potential. Our findings suggest that β-catenin, matrix metalloproteinase 9, laminin, and collagen IV are important predictors of clinical course of rectal cancer and that the peculiarities of protein expression related to the risk of liver metastases have concordant patterns and are most pronounced in invasive front of the tumor. 3acolorectal neoplasms 3alaminin 0aβ-catenin 0amatrix metalloproteinase 9 0atype IV collagen1 aKushlinskii, N.

Therefore, it is important that we understand, and be able to predict, how RSOIL responds to climate change. Although a positive, significant temperature effect on RSOIL has long been recognized, recent studies emphasize the overriding importance of current photosynthesis in controlling RSOIL. We tested the hypothesis that model inclusion of intra-annual variations in aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) significantly improves RSOIL estimates over predictions based on soil temperature alone. We also evaluated the possibility that canopy production is less directly linked to RSOIL, by testing the hypothesis that intersite differences in RSOIL correlate more strongly with root biomass than with ANPP. We tested these hypotheses by measuring RSOIL, ANPP, and root biomass at four Iowa grasslands that differed in aboveground growth phenology and productivity. Among all sites, intra-annual variations in RSOIL were most strongly related to soil temperature (R ² = 0.89), not ANPP (R ² = 0.53). All sites responded identically to changes in soil temperature (site-by-temperature P = 0.53), but inconsistently to variation in aboveground dynamics (site-by-canopy P < 0.0001). Incorporating canopy dynamics into temperature-based predictive models improved model R ² by a maximum of 0.01. Among-site differences in RSOIL were related to root biomass (P < 0.001) but not ANPP (P = 0.34). We found no useful linkage between canopy characteristics and intra-annual or site-specific RSOIL predictions, perhaps because shoot and root dynamics were not consistently linked through time or among sites. 3agrassland soils 3aC3 plants 3aC4 plants 3asoil respiration 3atemporal variation 3aprediction 3asoil temperature 3aprimary productivity 3abiomass 3acarbon 3anitrogen content 3asoil water content 3aIowa1 aRaich, James W.0 tEcosystems.g2006 Sept., v. 9, no. 6 p.909-920dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-005-0093-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20070611b20070702c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/06/11  aOther US 7aarticle03540naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100002000172245008300192300001800275500015900293500002400452500001500476520176000491650001702251650002502268650001902293650002202312650002202334650002402356650001902380650001502399650002102414650001602435651001802451653001702469653002002486653002302506653002202529653002202551700001902573700001802592700002602610700001902636700003202655700002002687773010802707852000902815856006902824930003302893945002502926946001102951655001202962IND4384746920221121232446.0061025e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438474692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-006-9019-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aK001 0aJ2001 aFrelich, Lee E.10aEarthworm invasion into previously earthworm-free temperate and boreal forests  ap. 1235-1245.  aIn the special issue  / edited by P.F.

The invasion of European earthworms into previously earthworm-free temperate and boreal forests of North America dominated by Acer, Quercus, Betula, Pinus and Populus has provided ample opportunity to observe how earthworms engineer ecosystems. Impacts vary with soil parent material, land use history, and assemblage of invading earthworm species. Earthworms reduce the thickness of organic layers, increase the bulk density of soils and incorporate litter and humus materials into deeper horizons of the soil profile, thereby affecting the whole soil food web and the above ground plant community. Mixing of organic and mineral materials turns mor into mull humus which significantly changes the distribution and community composition of the soil microflora and seedbed conditions for vascular plants. In some forests earthworm invasion leads to reduced availability and increased leaching of N and P in soil horizons where most fine roots are concentrated. Earthworms can contribute to a forest decline syndrome, and forest herbs in the genera Aralia, Botrychium, Osmorhiza, Trillium, Uvularia, and Viola are reduced in abundance during earthworm invasion. The degree of plant recovery after invasion varies greatly among sites and depends on complex interactions with soil processes and herbivores. These changes are likely to alter competitive relationships among plant species, possibly facilitating invasion of exotic plant species such as Rhamnus cathartica into North American forests, leading to as yet unknown changes in successional trajectory. 3asoil ecology 3aenvironmental impact 3aboreal forests 3aplant communities 3atemperate forests 3aecological invasion 3asoil structure 3aearthworms 3ainvasive species 3aLumbricidae 3aNorth America 0asoil biology 0asoil properties 0aearthworm invasion 0aexotic earthworms 0acommunity ecology1 aHale, Cindy M.1 aScheu, Stefan1 aHoldsworth, Andrew R.1 aHeneghan, Liam1 aBohlen, P.

These areas share many ecological, climatic and historical characteristics and are devoid of indigenous earthworm fauna due to Quaternary glaciations. These regions are being colonized by a similar suite of exotic lumbricid species and it is unlikely that this is the result of chance, but rather indicates that these species have particular characteristics making them successful invaders. The present macro-scale distributions of earthworm species in northern Russia show little connection to the pattern of the last glaciation. Rather, the primary factors that determine the current distributions of earthworm species include climatic conditions, the life history traits of different earthworm species, the suitability of habitat and intensity and patterns of human activity. In the western Great Lakes region of North America, there are three primary factors affecting current distributions of exotic earthworm species including the patterns of human activity and land use practices, the composition of particular source populations of earthworms associated with different vectors of transport and the soil and litter properties of habitats across the region. Disturbance of a habitat does not appear to be a prerequisite to the invasion and establishment of exotic earthworms. Analysis of the macro-scale distributions of Lumbricidae species in northeastern Europe may provide important insights into the potential of invasive European earthworm species to spread in North America, and identify potentially invasive species. 3adispersal behavior 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitat preferences 3aecological invasion 3afrost resistance 3aanthropogenic activities 3aearthworms 3ainvasive species 3aLumbricidae 3aclimatic factors 3adisturbed soils 3aGreat Lakes region 3aEastern European region 3aRussia 3aNorth America 3aNorthern European region 0aearthworm invasion 0aexotic earthworms 0aenvironmental factors 0ajump dispersal1 aHale, Cindy M.1 aHoldsworth, Andrew R.1 aVsevolodova-Perel, Tamara S.0 tBiological invasions.g2006 Sept., v. 8, no. 6 p.1223-1234dKluwer Academic Publishersx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-006-9018-43electronic resource  a20061122b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02676naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001600163245006700179300001800246500002400264500001500288520115300303650002101456650001701477650001001494650002201504650002301526650002101549650002401570650002601594650002101620651001001641651001901651651001201670651001201682651001501694653001801709653002601727653003201753653002501785653002601810653002601836700001701862773010801879852000901987856006901996930003302065945002502098946001102123655001202134IND4384747620221121232604.0061025e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438474762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-005-0422-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aF6001 aPratt, R B 10aDo Invasive Trees have a Hydraulic Advantage over Native Trees  ap. 1331-1341.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe hypothesis was tested that invasive trees have hydraulic traits that contribute to their invasive nature. Five pairs of co-occurring invasive and native trees, in mesic habitats, were selected: (1) Tamarix ramosissima and Salix amygdaloides; (2) Robinia pseudoacacia and Alnus rhombifolia (3) Schinus terebinthifolius and Myrica cerifera; (4) Ligustrum sinense and Acer negundo; and (5) Sapium sebiferum and Diospyros virginiana, respectively. Resistance to cavitation (the water potential [Ψ x ] at 75% loss of hydraulic conductivity [Ψ₇₅]) was not consistently greater for invasive compared to native species (Ψ₇₅=-1.91 and -1.67 MPa, respectively). Xylem specific conductivity (K s), a measure of xylem efficiency, was not different between native and invasive species (K s = 3.50 and 3.70 kg s-¹ MPa-¹ m-¹, respectively). The lack of difference for resistance to cavitation among invasive and native species suggests that the sampled invaders are not more tolerant to water stress than co-occurring native species. Apparently the spread and invasive nature of the sampled species cannot be explained by hydraulic traits alone. 3amesic conditions 3awater stress 3atrees 3aplant competition 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3axylem water potential 3astress tolerance 3aIdaho 3aSouth Carolina 3aFlorida 3aGeorgia 0aWashington 0axylem density 0acavitation resistance 0axylem specific conductivity 0ahydraulic efficiency 0aplant-water relations 0abiological resistance1 aBlack, R.

We conducted a greenhouse experiment to study the effects of defoliation and soil fungi on competition between the invasive weed Centaurea solstitialis and C. solstitialis and Avena barbata, a naturalized Eurasian annual grass, and Nassella pulchra, a native California bunchgrass. Surprisingly, considering the explosive invasion of grasslands by C. solstitialis, Avena and Nassella were strong competitors and reduced the invader's biomass by 80.2% and 80.1% over all defoliation and soil fungicide treatments, respectively. However, our experiments were conducted in artificial environments where competition was probably accentuated. When fungicide was applied to the soil, the biomass of C. solstitialis was reduced in all treatment combinations, but reduction in the biomass of the invader had no corollary impact on the grasses. There was no overall effect of defoliation on the final biomass of C. solstitialis as the invader compensated fully for severe clipping. In fact, the directional trend of the clipping effect was +6.4% over all treatments after eight weeks. A significant neighbor x soil fungicide x clipping effect suggested that the compensatory response was the strongest without soil fungicide and when C. solstitialis was alone (+ 19%). Our key finding was that the compensatory response of C. solstitialis in all treatments was associated with an increase in the weed's negative effects on Nassella and Avena - there was a significant decrease in the total biomass of both grasses and the reproductive biomass of Avena in pots with clipped C. solstitialis. Our results were obtained in controlled conditions that may have been conducive to compensatory growth, but they suggest the existence of mechanisms that may allow C. solstitialis, like other Centaurea species, to resist herbivory. 3aindigenous species 3aCentaurea solstitialis 3aweeds 3ainvasive species 3adefoliation 3afungicides 3asoil fungi 3aplant growth 3acompensatory growth 3aplant competition 3aAvena barbata 3aNassella 3agrasses 0ainvasive weeds 0aexotic weeds 0aNassella pulchra 0aplant biomass 0anative grasses 0anaturalized grasses1 aKim, Judy 1 aMahall, Bruce E. 0 tBiological invasions.g2006 Sept., v. 8, no. 6 p.1389-1397dKluwer Academic Publishersx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-006-0003-83electronic resource  a20061121b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03574naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001700181245014900198300001800347500015900365500002400524500001500548520176700563650002002330650001902350650002202369650002302391650002002414650002402434650001502458650002102473650002402494650002002518650002002538651001902558651001402577651001202591651001102603653001502614653001702629653002202646700001402668700001302682700001702695700001702712773010802729852000902837856006902846930003302915945002502948946001102973655001202984IND4384747420221121232500.0061025e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438474742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-006-9024-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aJ200 0aF100 0aJ8001 aBaker, G.

We consider various case studies (e.g., earthworm invasions in agricultural soils in Australia and Brazil) and deliberate introductions of earthworms into reclaimed mine sites, landfills and cutaway peat in the U.K. and Ireland. Invasions of exotic earthworms, such as European Lumbricidae in Australia, have been geographically extensive, but remain very patchy at regional and field scales. Their impacts on soil properties, plant production and other biota are therefore also likely to be patchy. Various methods have been developed to deliberately inoculate exotic earthworms into disturbed lands, with varying degrees of success. The factors controlling success are, in general, poorly understood. A broad range of impacts of invasive earthworms on soil properties (e.g., soil structure, nutrient availability, burial of surface materials, incidence of root diseases) and plant yield and quality have been reported. Less is known of the impacts of invasive earthworms on other soil fauna, but they are likely to occur due to alterations in food availability and habitat structure. Influences on other biota are likely to extend to aboveground communities as well as those belowground. Introductions of earthworms to disturbed lands can yield substantial benefits in agricultural productivity and amelioration of soil degradation. However, the potential impact of the promotion or control of such introductions on non-target biota and ecosystem processes in pristine ecosystems nearby should be considered. 3acrop production 3aanimal ecology 3aagricultural land 3aintroduced species 3asoil properties 3asoil microorganisms 3aearthworms 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3areclaimed soils 3adisturbed soils 3aUnited Kingdom 3aAustralia 3aIreland 3aBrazil 0asoil fauna 0asoil biology 0aexotic earthworms1 aBrown, G.1 aButt, K.1 aCurry, J.

Barbed goatgrass, Aegilops triuncialis L., is a cleistogamous annual grass with a native range throughout the Mediterranean Basin and Asia and introduced to California during the last century. It is considered a serious noxious range weed and is one of the few exotic plant species that is invading serpentine soil habitats. We examined whether patterns of molecular variation are consistent with a single or multiple introduction events into California and further, if individual populations show evidence for a genetic bottleneck during introduction. Fingerprinting patterns, using microsatellite loci derived from Triticum aestivum, were investigated for 57 Eurasian accessions, broadly spanning the native range and for 108 individuals from 11 localities in California. There is strong evidence for an extreme bottleneck in this species as it colonizes its new range because we detected only three multilocus genotypes occurring in California and 36 genotypes in Eurasia. In California one of the genotypes differs from one other by only one fragment and only occurs in one individual. This suggests two separate introductions. Each population is composed of highly uniform individuals and the two main genotypes are geographically separated. A. triuncialis is still expanding its range in California despite genomic uniformity after a strong bottleneck and its recently increased rate of spread is not correlated to a high within-population variability created by multiple introductions. 3afounder effect 3agrasses 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aAegilops triuncialis 3ageographical variation 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3anoxious weeds 3aintroduced plants 3aCalifornia 0amultiple introductions 0aplant introduction history 0apopulation genetics1 aHammond, John I. 1 aJorgensen, Chad M. 1 aPark, Timothy W. 1 aGerlach, John D. 1 aRice, Kevin J. 1 aMcKay, John K. 0 tBiological invasions.g2006 Sept., v. 8, no. 6 p.1355-1366dKluwer Academic Publishersx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-005-2463-73electronic resource  a20061121b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02258naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245011600174300001800290520099000308650001201298650001101310650002301321650002101344650001901365650001101384650001101395650002001406650002301426653002101449653001901470653001601489653003901505700002301544700002101567773012201588852000901710856008501719930003301804946001101837655001201848IND4442093420221121222536.0100903e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444209342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-010-9599-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatton MacDonald, Darla 10aWillingness to Pay and Willingness to Accept Compensation for Changes in Urban Water Customer Service Standards  ap. 3145-3158.  aIn this paper, we explore the use of choice modelling for obtaining implicit prices for attributes associated with changes in the reliability of household water services. While not often estimated in practice, the collection of information about willingness to accept compensation is relevant for utilities as customers often have implicit or explicit property rights for particular levels of customer service. Given ageing infrastructure in many cities, maintaining customer service standards requires large capital expenditures. It may be more economically efficient to allow standards to decline in some areas and compensate consumers. Therefore it is useful to understand the value of attributes of water service provision using willingness to accept and how this differs from willingness to pay. We therefore estimate both willingness to accept and willingness to pay measures, and find that respondents value a larger range of attributes using the willingness to accept approach. 3acapital 3acities 3aconsumers (people) 3acustomer service 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3aprices 3aproperty rights 3awillingness to pay 0aChoice modelling 0aPrice of water 0aUrban water 0aWillingness to accept compensation1 aMorrison, Mark D. 1 aBarnes, Mary B. 0 tWater resources management.g2010 Sept., v. 24, no. 12 p.3145-3158dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0920-47417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-010-9599-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02217naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245010300178300001600281520105500297650002601352650002001378650002401398650002601422653002501448653002501473653003101498653003101529653001701560700002201577773011801599852000901717856008501726930003301811946001101844655001201855IND4440085320221121222559.0100716e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444008532DNAL7 a203643502pmid7 a10.1007/s00422-010-0386-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGigi, S. 10aQuantitative analysis of directional strengths in jointly stationary linear multivariate processes  ap. 119-133.  aIdentification and analysis of directed influences in multivariate systems is an important problem in many scientific areas. Recent studies in neuroscience have provided measures to determine the network structure of the process and to quantify the total effect in terms of energy transfer. These measures are based on joint stationary representations of a multivariate process using vector auto-regressive (VAR) models. A few important issues remain unaddressed though. The primary outcomes of this study are (i) a theoretical proof that the total coupling strength consists of three components, namely, the direct, indirect, and the interference produced by the direct and indirect effects, (ii) expressions to estimate/calculate these effects, and (iii) a result which shows that the well-known directed measure for linear systems, partial directed coherence (PDC) only aids in structure determination but does not provide a normalized measure of the direct energy transfer. Simulation case studies are shown to illustrate the theoretical results. 3aquantitative analysis 2aEnergy Transfer 2aModels, Theoretical 2aMultivariate Analysis 0aDirectional strength 0aMultivariate process 0aPartial directed coherence 0aDirected transfer function 0aInterference1 aTangirala, A.

Macrogard was fed at doses of 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 g kg⁻¹ of pellets for 1 month. The blood, spleen and head kidney from 10 fish of each group were separated and analysed for immunity parameters. Twenty tench from each group were infected with A. hydrophila. Macrogard at doses 1 and 2 g kg⁻¹ of feed significantly (P < 0.05) increased the phagocytic activity of macrophages and proliferative response of mitogens stimulated lymphocytes. The same doses significantly (P < 0.05) increased lysozyme activity and Ig level in serum, compared to the control and dose 0.5 g kg⁻¹ of feed. The challenge test showed that Macrogard reduced mortality of tench after experimental infection (5-35%). 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aTinca tinca 3ablood serum 3adefense mechanisms 3afish 3akidneys 3alymphocytes 3alysozyme 3amacrophages 3amortality 3apellets 3aphagocytosis 3aspleen 0aBeta-glucan1 aZakęś, Zdzisław 1 aTerech-Majewska, Elżbieta 1 aKazuń, Krzysztof 1 aLepa, Agnieszka 1 aGłąbski, Edward 0 tReviews in fish biology and fisheries.g2010 Sept., v. 20, no. 3 p.435-439dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0960-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-009-9133-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100821b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02781naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245012700166300001800293520123900311650001601550650002801566650001401594650001101608650001201619650001801631650001501649650002201664650001001686650001501696650001801711650001501729650003701744650001901781650001301800651001001813653003301823653001201856653002801868653002201896653001401918653002001932700001901952700001401971773014001985852000902125856008502134930003302219946001102252655001202263IND4443710920221121222516.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444371092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-010-0377-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoudhury, Bula 10aDistribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in marshy and shoreline vegetation of Deepar Beel Ramsar Site of Assam, India  ap. 1965-1971.  aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) symbiosis was thought to be rare in wetland plant roots, although several recent studies suggested that this association might be important in wetland ecosystems. In this research work we have studied the distribution of AMF in the marshy and shoreline vegetation of Deepar Beel Ramsar site of Assam, India. The study reveals the percentage of mycorrhizal colonization in the roots of different plant species which were observed from 20.89 to 86.47% and particularly found larger among the members of the family Poaceae. The Vetiveria zizanioides L. from the family Cyperaceae showed the highest (86.47%) percentage of root colonization, however, only one plant species viz. Scirpus lateriflorus Gmel. from the same family was found to be nonmycorrhizal. The rhizospheric soil samples of most of the plant species were found to be dominated by Glomus morphotypes. All total 18 AMF morphotypes were recorded which comprises four genera viz. Glomus (66.67%), Acaulospora (16.66%), Gigaspora (11.11%) and Scutellospora (5.56%). The observation of diversity of AMF in 25 different plant species among the wetland plants gives a glimpse of AMF diversity and their host selectivity in the said ecosystem. 3aAcaulospora 3aChrysopogon zizanioides 3aGigaspora 3aGlomus 3aScirpus 3aScutellospora 3aecosystems 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aroots 3ashorelines 3asoil sampling 3avegetation 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awetland plants 3awetlands 3aIndia 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0aWetland 0aDeepar Beel Ramsar site 0aRoot colonization 0aDiversity 0aPlant community1 aKalita, M.

The arginine-dependent NOS activity is sensitive to NOS inhibitor L-NAME and aminoguanidine (AG), with L-NAME being more effective than AG. Endogenous NO production, NOS and mitochondrial nitrite-reducing activities are predominately presented in young leaves and especially in young white roots and young stems. Root and stem mitochondria can reduce nitrite to nitric oxide at the expense of NADH, however, this mitochondrial nitrite-reducing activity is absent in leaves. 3aMalus domestica 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aapples 3adevelopmental stages 3aleaves 3amitochondria 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3anitrites 3aroots 3astems 3atrees 0aL-arginine1 aYang, H.

These cases illustrate the changing nature of travel and the need to obtain a relevant travel history and adequate laboratory procedures.

The results showed that the autoxidation of H2Q was spin-restricted and extremely slow in acidic and neutral pH range, but this process can be dramatically accelerated when rGO was added. In the presence of 33.3mgL⁻¹ rGO, more than 76.0% of H2Q was oxidized to BQ within 36h. The enhancement effects of rGO were attributed to the combined contribution of the high chemical reactivity of graphenic edges and defects on rGO and the high electron conductivity of graphene basal surface of rGO. It is proposed that dissolved oxygen reacted with graphenic edges and defects of rGO to produce surface-bound oxygen intermediates, which capture H atoms from the phenolic hydroxyl groups of H2Q and facilitate the generation of semiquinone radical (SQ⁻). The generated SQ⁻ continued to transfer an electron to molecular oxygen to yield superoxide radical (O2⁻) and BQ. As a chain-carrying radical, O2⁻ further reacted with H2Q to produce SQ⁻ and H2O2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aautoxidation 3abenzoquinones 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroquinone 3amoieties 3aoxygen 3apH 3asuperoxide anion1 aLi, Lingyun1 aSun, Lixiang1 aPei, Zhiguo1 aXie, Jieli1 aZhang, Shuzhen0 tCarbon.g2015 Aug., v. 89 p.74-81dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01581naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011500165300001200280520056300292592002800855650001400883650000900897650001500906650002200921650001300943650001600956650000900972700002200981700001901003773014201022856008201164852000901246655001201255IND60440078320221117224540.0220306e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044007832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-015-2608-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Guyoung10aRemediation of Pentachlorophenol-Contaminated Soil by Non-specific Abiotic Reactions Using Heme and Hemoglobin  ap. 358.  aTo treat PCP-contaminated soil, abiotic methods for PCP degradation have been developed, where heme or powder hemoglobin acts as a catalyst and hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. Degradation of PCP had the first-order kinetics, and rate coefficients, k, were 0.073 and 0.104/day for heme and hemoglobin, respectively, indicating that the hemoglobin was a more efficient catalyst than heme. Approximately 96 % of the initial PCP was degraded at day 35. Thus, hemoglobin might be recommended as the catalyst of choice, since it is much less expensive than heme.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aheme 3ahemoglobin 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxidants 3aremediation 3asoil1 aStevens, David K.1 aChung, Namhyun0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2015 Nov., v. 226, no. 11 p.358-358dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-015-2608-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007500167300001600242500001500258520103200273592002801305650001601333650001801349650001101367650001401378650001101392650002901403650000901432650001201441650001301453650002001466650001201486650002601498653001601524653000801540653000801548653001001556653000601566653000801572653001301580700001601593700002001609700001801629700002001647700001901667700002201686700002001708700001701728700002101745773012201766856008201888852000901970655001201979IND60089796020221118022758.0160728e20130906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008979602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamane, Takuya10aTranscriptional regulation of the legumain gene by p53 in HCT116 cells  ap. 613-618.  a2019-12-06  aLegumain (EC 3.4.22.34) is an asparaginyl endopeptidase. Strong legumain activity was observed in the mouse kidney, and legumain was found to be highly expressed in tumors. We previously reported that bovine kidney annexin A2 was co-purified with legumain and that legumain cleaved the N-terminal region of annexin A2 at an Asn residue in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we found a p53-binding site in intron 1 of the human legumain gene using computational analysis. To determine whether transcription of the legumain gene is regulated by p53, HCT116 cells were transfected with p53 siRNA and the effect of knockdown of p53 expression on legumain expression was examined. The results showed that expression levels of both legumain mRNA and protein were decreased in the siRNA-treated cells. Furthermore, enzyme activity of legumain was also increased by doxorubicin and its activity was reduced by knockdown of p53 in HCT116 cells. These results suggest that legumain expression and its enzyme activity are regulated by p53.  aPublisher supplied data 3adoxorubicin 3amessenger RNA 3ahumans 3aneoplasms 3acattle 3atranscription (genetics) 3amice 3akidneys 3alegumain 3aenzyme activity 3aintrons 3asmall interfering RNA 0aDoxorubicin 0aDXR 0aMCA 0agenes 0aZ 0ap53 0aLegumain1 aMurao, Sato1 aKato-Ose, Izumi1 aKashima, Lisa1 aYuguchi, Motoki1 aKozuka, Miyuki1 aTakeuchi, Keisuke1 aOgita, Hisakazu1 aOhkubo, Iwao1 aAriga, Hiroyoshi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Sept. 06, v. 438 p.613-618dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01852naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007400166300001400240520073400254592002800988650002001016650002501036650002301061650001301084650001401097650001801111650001101129650002001140650001801160650001601178650001101194700001901205700002901224773010001253856008101353990002301434852000901457655001201466IND60093098220221118011803.0141103e20120315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009309822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.04.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArslan, Yeşim10aKinetic study of hemicellulosic sugar production from hazelnut shells  ap. 23-28.  aHazelnut shells are important agricultural waste in Turkey for potential ethanol production.

S.10aRe-alimentation strategy to manoeuvre body condition and carcass characteristics in cull ewes  ap. 61-69.  aImprovement in body condition and carcass traits through nutritional intervention was studied in cull ewes. Sixty-eight adult non-productive Malpura ewes (average body weight 26.7 ± 0.33 kg) were randomly divided into four equal groups: G0 maintained on free grazing for 8 h on protected natural rangeland with ad libitum guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) straw (GS) after grazing; G1, G2 and G3 fed with supplemental concentrate at the rate of 250 g, 2.5% of live weight (LW) and ad libitum, respectively. The experiment was continued for 90 days and daily feed intake, weekly LW and body condition score (BCS) were recorded. Intake and digestibility of nutrients were assessed by indicator method. Rumen fermentation attributes and blood biochemical profile were studied to assess the dietary effects and animals were slaughtered at the end of experiment for evaluation of carcass characteristics. Higher dry matter (DM) intake and improvement in plane of nutrition was observed in G2 and G3 with a higher LW gain (LWG) and improvement in BCS than in G0. The digestibility of DM, organic matter, CP, ADF and cellulose was higher (P < 0.05) in G2 and G3 than in G0. A lower ruminal pH and ammonia N but higher total N and trichloroacetic acid-precipitable N, an increase in holotrichs, spirotrichs and total protozoa population, increase in haemoglobin but decrease in serum total cholesterol and non-esterified fatty acids were observed in high-concentrate-fed groups. Carcass attributes revealed increase (P < 0.05) in empty LW, dressing yield, eye muscle area, subcutaneous and intramuscular fat, decrease in shear force value and higher (P < 0.05) protein content in Longissimus dorsi muscle in test groups than in the control. Above all, the G2 animals had better rumen environment and blood biochemical attributes and consumed more feed with enhanced digestibility that supported higher LWG at better feed conversion efficiency, improvement in BCS and carcass quality. Thus, re-alimentation of cull ewes with challenged feeding of concentrate at 2.5% of LW on a basal roughage diet for a period of 3 months may have promise for better economic return to the farmers with possibly meeting quality mutton for human consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyamopsis tetragonoloba 3aProtozoa 3aadults 3aammonium nitrogen 3ablood serum 3abody condition 3abody weight 3acarcass evaluation 3acarcass quality 3acellulose 3acholesterol 3acosts and returns 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adressing percentage 3aewes 3afarmers 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeeding level 3afree fatty acids 3agrazing 3ahemoglobin 3ahumans 3aintramuscular fat 3alongissimus muscle 3amutton 3anutrients 3anutritional intervention 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aprotein content 3arangelands 3arumen 3arumen fermentation 3astraw 0acull ewes 0anutrient utilization 0arumen and blood profile 0abody condition score 0acarcass characteristics1 aSoren, N.

The multi-model ensemble (MME) tends to simulate the ENSO-associated shift of SPCZ orientation, especially for the 1-month forecast lead. The migration of the SPCZ orientation indices associated with ENSO phases is clear in the observation and the MME. The variation of the SPCZ strength and area associated with ENSO phases is not as clear as in the SPCZ orientation. In spite of marginal changes in the SPCZ strength and area related to ENSO phases, the SPCZ strength becomes a bit stronger during El Niño and weaker during La Niña, which is represented in individual models and MME. The performance of the MME in simulating the variability of the SPCZ orientation, strength and area is also examined. We found that the MME reasonably predicts the observed interannual variability of the western portion of the SPCZ, with systematic and marginal shift southward. Compared to the western part of the SPCZ, the MME seems to have a limitation in predicting the variability of the eastern part. In comparison to the SPCZ orientation, the MME is not capable of predicting the strength and area of the SPCZ. The interannual variability of the SPCZ strength in the MME is systematically weaker compared to that in the analysis. By comparison with SPCZ orientation and strength, the SPCZ area is not resolved in the MME. The SPCZ is a main source of precipitation in the South Pacific, and the SPCZ predictability also influences high impact weather prediction such as tropical cyclones. Therefore, skillful predictions of seasonal variability of the SPCZ could benefit users who utilize the seasonal forecasting information for their decision making in many applicable sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3aclimate 3adecision making 3ahurricanes 3alead 3amodels 3aprediction 3aseasonal variation 3aweather forecasting0 tClimate dynamics.g2018 May, v. 50, no. 9-10 p.3237-3250dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-3802-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245010800164300001400272520119300286592002801479650002801507650002501535650002101560650001801581650000901599650002401608650001501632650001001647650001601657650001901673650001901692650001301711650001401724650002601738650001501764653003201779653002501811653002201836653001001858700002001868700001401888773010401902856007902006852000902085655001202094IND60480036120221120110446.0160125e20140912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048003612DNAL7 a10.2478/abcsb-2014-00062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStawski, Karol10aExpression Patterns of Convergently Overlapping Arabidopsis Thaliana Gene Pairs OHP-NDP1 and OHP2-MES14  ap. 80-89.  aThe function of one-helix proteins (OHPs) in the thylakoid membrane remains poorly understood but may be linked to plant photosystem protection. In Arabidopsis, the 3'UTRs of the genes encoding OHP and OHP2 partially overlap with NDP1 and MES14 respectively. Antisense orientation of genes has the potential to form double-stranded transcript (dsRNA) molecules which can be processed to siRNA and trigger RNA interference (RNAi). Natural siRNAs are induced by abiotic and biotic stresses. We examined whether the expression of the OHP-NDP1 and OHP2-MES14 gene pairs is regulated in this way. Both OHP genes, but neither NDP1 nor MES14, were activated by light in etiolated seedlings, whereas cold and prolonged heat treatment elevated the OHP transcript level. Expression of OHP2 was down-regulated after 2 h of osmotic and heat stress, while salt and osmotic stress increased MES14 transcript levels. No inverse regulation of these overlapping gene pairs was observed, excluding RNAi as a regulatory mechanism in the tested conditions. The presence of alternatively polyadenylat-ed transcripts of the studied genes raises the possibility of another regulatory mechanism of 3'UTR overlap.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3' untranslated regions 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aRNA interference 3abiotic stress 3acold 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aetiolation 3agenes 3aheat stress 3aheat treatment 3aosmotic stress 3aproteins 3aseedlings 3asmall interfering RNA 3athylakoids 0aAlternative polyadenylation 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aoverlapping genes 0a3'UTR1 aBanach, Mariusz1 aGoc, Anna0 tActa biologica Cracoviensia.g2014 Sept. 12, v. 56, no. 1 p.80-89dDe Gruyter Openx1898-02957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/abcsb-2014-00063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01983naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010300165300001600268500001900284520105200303592002801355650001101383650001401394650001601408650001001424650001301434651001401447700001701461773010101478856008101579852000901660655001201669IND60700688820221122231101.0200703e20121210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070068882DNAL7 a10.1163/22119434-000020162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuffels, Hans10aTaxonomy and song of the cicada Ayesha serva (Walker, 1850) from the coasts of northern Sundaland  ap. 269-283.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe genus Ayesha belongs to the tribe Dundubiini and is distinguished from other genera of the tribe by the spatulate and strongly overlapping male opercula. The synonymy of three species, Cosmopsaltria vomerigera Breddin, 1901, Dundubia lelita Kirkaldy, 1902 and Cicada elopurina Distant, 1888, which are treated as junior synonyms of A. serva (Walker, 1850) in the literature, is confirmed. Two other species, A. spathulata Stål, 1870 and A. operculissima Stål, 1870, are synonymized here with A. serva, so that Ayesha now becomes a monotypic genus. Ayesha serva is redescribed and recorded from Greater Natuna Island, the northern parts of Borneo and Sulawesi and the southern Philippines; the species is mainly found in trees on the beach, in mangroves and other coastal forests. The broad band long lasting monotonous calling song has a very simple and constant pattern. It consists of a fast repetition of many echemes of duration from 41.7 to 79.0 ms, which are composed of 8 to 19 pulses with a repetition rate of 240 pulses per second.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorneo 3aCicadidae 3aPhilippines 3amales 3ataxonomy 3aIndonesia1 aTrilar, Tomi0 tTijdschrift voor entomologie.g, v. 155, no. 2-3 p.269-283dBrillwJournal:1965x0040-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22119434-000020163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245006100171300001200232520079700244592002801041650001401069650002201083650001001105650001301115650001801128650001901146650001901165650001801184650001201202650001801214650001601232650001201248650002501260650001601285650002801301700004101329700003701370700002801407700002501435773014201460856008201602852000901684655001201693IND60440078620221117224531.0220306e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044007862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-015-2611-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuari, Emi Brinatti10aAzo Dye Acid Blue 29: Biosorption and Phytotoxicity Test  ap. 361.  aMany products contain dyes, such as fabrics. However, most of the industry-generated waste is improperly handled, which causes serious environmental problems for the bodies of water that receive textile effluents. This study aimed to analyze the effect of biosorbents and biosorption techniques on decolorizing the textile azo dye Acid Blue 29 in an aqueous solution employing pine sawdust. Pine sawdust is low-cost substrate with minor environmental impact. A toxicity test was performed with Lactuca sativa seeds to determine the LC₅₀ of the dye. Subsequently, a biosorption test was performed to determine the toxicity of the resulting solutions. We observed that biosorption is a very feasible technique for the discoloration of the solutions and promotes reduction in their toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeffluents 3aaqueous solutions 3aseeds 3aazo dyes 3adiscoloration 3adecolorization 3aLactuca sativa 3aphytotoxicity 3asawdust 3asurface water 3abiosorbents 3afabrics 3aenvironmental impact 3abiosorption 3alethal concentration 501 ade Almeida, Érica Janaina Rodrigues1 ade Jesus Sutta Martiarena, Maria1 aYamagami, Nívea Santos1 aCorso, Carlos Renato0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2015 Nov., v. 226, no. 11 p.361-361dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-015-2611-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245008200182500001900264520153100283592002801814650002101842650001901863650001801882650001101900650001901911650001301930650001501943650001501958650002101973650001301994650002402007650002102031650001502052650001302067650002702080653002202107653001702129653001402146653001102160653000902171653001302180653001802193700001902211700002402230773010702254856008802361852000902449655001202458IND60700059020221122083120.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070005902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.1113542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLitchfield, Sebastian G.14aThe influence of plastic pollution and ocean change on detrital decomposition  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPlastic pollution and ocean change have mostly been assessed separately, missing potential interactions that either enhance or reduce future impacts on ecosystem processes. Here, we used manipulative experiments with outdoor mesocosms to test hypotheses about the interactive effects of plastic pollution, ocean warming and acidification on macrophyte detrital decomposition. These experiments focused on detritus from kelp, Ecklonia radiata, and eelgrass, Zostera muelleri, and included crossed treatments of (i) no, low and high plastic pollution, (ii) current/future ocean temperatures, and (iii) ambient/future ocean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO₂). High levels of plastic pollution significantly reduced the decomposition rate of kelp and eelgrass by approximately 27% and 36% in comparison to controls respectively. Plastic pollution also significantly slowed the nitrogen liberation from seagrass and kelp detritus. Higher seawater temperatures significantly increased the decomposition rate of kelp and eelgrass by 12% and 5% over current conditions, respectively. Higher seawater temperatures were also found to reduce the nitrogen liberation in eelgrass. In contrast, ocean acidification did not significantly influence the rate of macrophyte decomposition or nutrient liberation. Overall, our results show how detrital processes might respond to increasing plastic pollution and ocean temperatures, which has implications for detrital-driven secondary productivity, nutrient dynamics and carbon cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEcklonia radiata 3aZostera marina 3aacidification 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adetritus 3aecosystems 3amacroalgae 3amarine pollution 3anitrogen 3aocean acidification 3apartial pressure 3aseagrasses 3aseawater 3asecondary productivity 0aPlastic pollution 0aOcean change 0aEstuaries 0aCoasts 0aKelp 0aSeagrass 0aDecomposition1 aSchulz, Kai G.1 aKelaher, Brendan P.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2020 Sept., v. 158 p.111354-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.1113543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009400159300001800253520161600271592002801887650001201915650001701927650002101944650001901965650001401984650002301998650001702021650002302038650001302061700001902074700001702093700002102110700002302131700001902154700001602173773013102189856007502320852000902395655001202404IND60540937820221123002551.0160820e20140212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054093782DNAL7 a10.1021/ja410031n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujii, Tomohiko10aDesign and Synthesis of a FlAsH-Type Mg2+ Fluorescent Probe for Specific Protein Labeling  ap. 2374-2381.  aAlthough the magnesium ion (Mg²⁺) is one of the most abundant divalent cations in cells and is known to play critical roles in many physiological processes, its mobilization and underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we describe a novel fluorescent Mg²⁺ probe, “KMG-104-AsH”, composed of a highly selective fluorescent Mg²⁺ probe, “KMG-104”, and a fluorescence-recoverable probe, “FlAsH”, bound specifically to a tetracysteine peptide tag (TCtag), which can be genetically incorporated into any protein. This probe was developed for molecular imaging of local changes in intracellular Mg²⁺ concentration. KMG-104-AsH was synthesized, and its optical properties were investigated in solution. The fluorescence intensity of KMG-104-AsH (at λₑₘ/ₘₐₓ = 540 nm) increases by more than 10-fold by binding to both the TCtag peptide and Mg²⁺, and the probe is highly selective for Mg²⁺ (Kd/Mg = 1.7 mM, Kd/Cₐ ≫ 100 mM). Application of the probe for imaging of Mg²⁺ in HeLa cells showed that this FlAsH-type Mg²⁺ sensing probe is membrane-permeable and binds specifically to tagged proteins, such as TCtag-actin and mKeima-TCtag targeted to the cytoplasm and the mitochondrial intermembrane space. KMG-104-AsH bound to TCtag responded to an increase in intracellular Mg²⁺ concentration caused by the release of Mg²⁺ from mitochondria induced by FCCP, a protonophore that eliminates the inner membrane potential of mitochondria. This probe is expected to be a strong tool for elucidating the dynamics and mechanisms of intracellular localization of Mg²⁺.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3amagnesium 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3aoptical properties 3aproteins1 aShindo, Yutaka1 aHotta, Kohji1 aCitterio, Daniel1 aNishiyama, Shigeru1 aSuzuki, Kōji,1 aOka, Kotaro0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Feb. 12, v. 136, no. 6 p.2374-2381dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja410031n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245009500207520101500302592002801317650001101345650002201356650000901378650001201387650001801399650001701417650001601434653002401450653003201474653001701506653002001523653002001543700002101563773009001584856008501674852000901759655001201768IND60759648220221121044440.0220110e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075964822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1228192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZahedi, Rahim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6837-872910aExergy analysis and optimization of Rankine power and ejector refrigeration combined cycle  aThis article proposes a combined cycle which consists of the hybrid Rankine power cycle and Ejector refrigeration cycle. This cycle is capable of producing thermal and refrigeration powers simultaneously. The proposed cycle can function through the heat exhausting from gas turbines, energy dissipations of factories, solar energy, or geothermal energy. In this research, Exergy analysis is used to improve the cycle; and Parametric analysis is used to investigate the effects of thermodynamic characteristics on the performance of the cycle. The results indicate that the most exergy dissipations occur as a result of irreversibilities and that ejectors have a significant role in such irrevesibilities. It has also been noted that factors such as the inlet pressure to turbine, turbine outlet pressure, and the temperature of condenser and evaporator have a considerable effect on turbine's output power and exergy efficiency of the cycle. The optimized exergy efficiency is 24.52% under the given condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexergy 3ageothermal energy 3aheat 3ahybrids 3arefrigeration 3asolar energy 3atemperature 0aRankine power cycle 0aEjector refrigeration cycle 0aOptimization 0aIrreversibility 0aExergy analysis1 aDaneshgar, Sareh0 tEnergy.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 240 p.122819-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1228193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03577naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245007100164300001600235500001500251520166600266592002801932650002401960650004301984650001202027650001502039650001902054650001602073650002802089650002802117650005202145650001402197650001402211650001402225650003702239650002002276650002602296650003102322650001402353650002102367650002902388653003102417653002802448653002102476653002902497653001702526653002802543700001502571700001802586700001902604700001602623700001302639700002402652700001902676700001802695700001302713773012202726856008202848852000902930655001202939IND60089796520221118022725.0160728e20130913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008979652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Ruosong10aAntibacterial activity and mechanism of action of ε-poly-l-lysine  ap. 148-153.  a2019-12-06  aε-Poly-l-lysine (ε-PL)2ε-Poly-l-lysine (ε-PL).2 is widely used as an antibacterial agent because of its broad antimicrobial spectrum. However, the mechanism of ε-PL against pathogens at the molecular level has not been elucidated. This study investigated the antibacterial activity and mechanism of ε-PL against Escherichia coli O157:H7 CMCC44828. Propidium monoazide-PCR test results indicated that the threshold condition of ε-PL for complete membrane lysis of E. coli O157:H7 was 10μg/mL (90% mortality for 5μg/mL). Further verification of the destructive effect of ε-PL on cell structure was performed by atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Results showed a positive correlation between reactive oxygen species (ROS)3Reactive oxygen species (ROS).3 levels and ε-PL concentration in E. coli O157:H7 cells. Moreover, the mortality of E. coli O157:H7 was reduced when antioxidant N-acetylcysteine was added. Results from real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)4Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).4 indicated that the expression levels of oxidative stress genes sodA and oxyR were up-regulated 4- and 16-fold, respectively, whereas virulence genes eaeA and espA were down-regulated after ε-PL treatment. Expression of DNA damage response (SOS response)5DNA damage response (SOS response).5 regulon genes recA and lexA were also affected by ε-PL. In conclusion, the antibacterial mechanism of ε-PL against E. coli O157:H7 may be attributed to disturbance on membrane integrity, oxidative stress by ROS, and effects on various gene expressions, such as regulation of oxidative stress, SOS response, and changes in virulence.  aPublisher supplied data 3amechanism of action 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aregulon 3aDNA damage 3aacetylcysteine 3aantibiotics 3areactive oxygen species 3aatomic force microscopy 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3apathogens 3amortality 3apropidium 3atransmission electron microscopy 3acell structures 3aEscherichia coli O157 3agene expression regulation 3avirulence 3aoxidative stress 3aantibacterial properties 0aReal-time quantitative PCR 0aReactive oxygen species 0aε-Poly-l-lysine 0aEscherichia coli O157:H7 0aantioxidants 0aAntibacterial mechanism1 aXu, Hengyi1 aWan, Cuixiang1 aPeng, Shanshan1 aWang, Lijun1 aXu, Hong1 aAguilar, Zoraida P.1 aXiong, Yonghua1 aZeng, Zheling1 aWei, Hua0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Sept. 13, v. 439 p.148-153dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245004400206520112400250592002801374650001801402650002001420650001401440650001301454650001301467650000901480653003101489653003301520653002401553653001001577653000801587653000901595653001001604653001001614653000801624653000801632773012101640856008301761852000901844655001201853IND60666221120221120134326.0191231e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066622112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tcam.2019.1003612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD.

Study listings remain permanently recorded in the AAHSD such that the AAHSD serves as a running archive of veterinary clinical studies conducted, informing investigators of studies performed both presently and in the past as well as providing an opportunity for investigators to make public the outcomes and conclusions of studies that have been completed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal health 3aclinical trials 3adatabases 3amedicine 3apatients 3apets 0aveterinary clinical trials 0aveterinary clinical registry 0aveterinary research 0aAAHSD 0aAKC 0aAVMA 0aIACUC 0aJAVMA 0aNIH 0aWHO0 tTopics in companion animal medicine.g2019 Dec., v. 37 p.100361-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000157x1938-97367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcam.2019.1003613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245008800209300001800297520172800315592002802043650001202071650001802083650001102101650001302112650001602125650001602141700003102157700001902188773012602207856008202333852000902415655001202424IND60592874020221119210918.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059287402DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-017-3845-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Boisséson, Eric1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0330-402110aOcean heat content variability in an ensemble of twentieth century ocean reanalyses  ap. 3783-3798.  aThis paper presents a ten-member ensemble of twentieth century Ocean ReAnalyses called ORA-20C. ORA-20C assimilates temperature and salinity profiles and is forced by the ECMWF twentieth century atmospheric reanalysis (ERA-20C) over the 1900–2010 period. This study attempts to identify robust signals of ocean heat content change in ORA-20C and detect contamination by model errors, initial condition uncertainty, surface fluxes and observing system changes. It is shown that ORA-20C trends and variability in the first part of the century result from the surface fluxes and model drift towards a warmer mean state and weak meridional overturning circulation. The impact of the observing system in correcting the mean state causes the deceleration of the warming trend and alters the long-term climate signal. The ensemble spread reflects the long-lasting memory of the initial conditions and the convergence of the system to a solution compatible with surface fluxes, the ocean model and observational constraints. Observations constrain the ocean heat uptake trend in the last decades of the twentieth century, which is similar to trend estimations from the post-satellite era. An ocean heat budget analysis attributes ORA-20C heat content changes to surface fluxes in the first part of the century. The heat flux variability reflects spurious signals stemming from ERA-20C surface fields, which in return result from changes in the atmospheric observing system. The influence of the temperature assimilation increments on the heat budget is growing with time. Increments control the most recent ocean heat uptake signals, highlighting imbalances in forced reanalysis systems in the ocean as well as in the atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3asalinity 3atemperature 3auncertainty1 aBalmaseda, MagdalenaAlonso1 aMayer, Michael0 tClimate dynamics.g2018 May, v. 50, no. 9-10 p.3783-3798dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-3845-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245012700206520129200333592002801625650001701653650002101670650001501691650001101706650002101717650001701738650001001755650001801765650002501783650001901808650002101827650001901848650001801867650001001885650001601895650002501911650002201936653002001958653002601978653001702004653002002021653002102041700001902062700001602081700001402097700001602111700001602127700001302143700001802156773009002174856008502264852000902349655001202358IND60759648420221121044410.0220110e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075964842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1228212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Jiaji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8882-429514aThe thermal behavior and flame retardant performance of phase change material microcapsules with modified carbon nanotubes  aThe organic shell materials and phase change material (PCM) show the drawbacks of low thermal conductivity, poor thermal stability and flammability, restricting the application of the PCM microcapsules. A novel Fe₃O₄/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modified PCM microcapsule (Fe–C-PCM) was successfully fabricated by the in-situ polymerization method and applied in the rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF-Fe-C-PCM) in this study. The results indicated that Fe₃O₄ microspheres with a diameter of about 200 nm were formed on CNTs. The thermostability of Fe–C-PCM was better than that of normal PCM microcapsules, which was proved by the results of TGA and MCC. The DSC results showed that the CNTs in Fe–C-PCM acted as internal and external heat transfer channels to ameliorate the thermal conductivity of PMMA. The results of cone calorimeter test indicated that RPUF-Fe-C-PCM had large inhibitory effect on the heat and smoke release of composite during the combustion process. The test results from small room model test and infrared thermal imager suggested that RPUF-Fe-C-PCM kept the indoor temperature stable within a certain range and exhibited excellent ability to absorb/release heat. These properties will greatly promote the application of Fe–C-PCM in insulation materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimeters 3acarbon nanotubes 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3afoams 3aheat transfer 3ainsulating materials 3amicroparticles 3aphase transition 3apolymerization 3apolyurethanes 3asmoke 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 3athermal stability 0aCarbon nanotube 0aPhase change material 0aMicrocapsule 0aFlame retardant 0aThermal behavior1 aNiu, Shaoshuai1 aKang, Moyun1 aLiu, Yuqi1 aZhang, Feng1 aQu, Wenjuan1 aGuan, Yu1 aLi, Shaoxiang0 tEnergy.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 240 p.122821-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1228213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245007700204300001800281520148900299592002801788650001101816650001201827650001901839650001501858650000801873650001301881650001301894650001101907650001101918651001801929700002101947700002101968773012601989856008202115852000902197655001202206IND60592874120221119210931.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059287412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-017-3849-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLique, Camille1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8357-492810aEmergence of deep convection in the Arctic Ocean under a warming climate  ap. 3833-3847.  aThe appearance of winter deep mixed layers in the Arctic Ocean under a warming climate is investigated with the HiGEM coupled global climate model. In response to a four times increase of atmospheric [Formula: see text] levels with respect to present day conditions, the Arctic Basin becomes seasonally ice-free. Its surface becomes consequently warmer and, on average, slightly fresher. Locally, changes in surface salinity can be far larger (up to 4 psu) than the basin-scale average, and of a different sign. The Canadian Basin undergoes a strong freshening, while the Eurasian Basin undergoes strong salinification. These changes are driven by the spin up of the surface circulation, likely resulting from the increased transfer of momentum to the ocean as sea ice cover is reduced. Changes in the surface salinity field also result in a change in stratification, which is strongly enhanced in the Canadian Basin and reduced in the Eurasian Basin. Reduction, or even suppression, of the stratification in the Eurasian Basin produces an environment that is favourable for, and promotes the appearance of, deep convection near the sea ice edge, leading to a significant deepening of winter mixed layers in this region (down to 1000 m). As the Arctic Ocean is transitioning toward a summer ice-free regime, new dynamical ocean processes will appear in the region, with potentially important consequences for the Arctic Ocean itself and for climate, both locally and on larger scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3aconvection 3aice 3amomentum 3asalinity 3asummer 3awinter 3aArctic region1 aJohnson, HelenL.1 aPlancherel, Yves0 tClimate dynamics.g2018 May, v. 50, no. 9-10 p.3833-3847dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-3849-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00906naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245005900166300001400225520007800239592002800317653001400345653001200359653001200371653001400383653001500397700001900412773009500431856008100526852000900607655001200616IND60698834920221120084801.0210116e20140919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069883492DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.441.77432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuldén, Larry,10aChecklist of the family Culicidae (Diptera) in Finland  ap. 47-51.  aA checklist of the Culicidae (Diptera) recorded from Finland is provided.  aPublisher supplied data 0aChecklist 0aFinland 0aDiptera 0aCulicidae 0amosquitoes1 aHuldén, Lena,0 tZooKeys.g2014 Sept. 19, v. 441 p.47-51dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.441.77433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008600166300001400252520097000266592002801236650001501264650002101279650000901300650002501309650002001334650002001354650001101374650002001385650001501405650001801420650001901438650001601457650002301473650001201496653001601508653002301524653000901547653001501556700002001571700002101591700002201612700001701634700002301651700002001674773012001694856008201814852000901896655001201905IND60089796720221118022657.0160728e20130913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008979672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYokoo, Masako10aMos1 transposon-based transformation of fish cell lines using baculoviral vectors  ap. 18-22.  aDrosophila Mos1 belongs to the mariner family of transposons, which are one of the most ubiquitous transposons among eukaryotes. We first determined nuclear transportation of the Drosophila Mos1-EGFP fusion protein in fish cell lines because it is required for a function of transposons. We next constructed recombinant baculoviral vectors harboring the Drosophila Mos1 transposon or marker genes located between Mos1 inverted repeats. The infectivity of the recombinant virus to fish cells was assessed by monitoring the expression of a fluorescent protein encoded in the viral genome. We detected transgene expression in CHSE-214, HINAE, and EPC cells, but not in GF or RTG-2 cells. In the co-infection assay of the Mos1-expressing virus and reporter gene-expressing virus, we successfully transformed CHSE-214 and HINAE cells. These results suggest that the combination of a baculovirus and Mos1 transposable element may be a tool for transgenesis in fish cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aeukaryotic cells 3afish 3afluorescent proteins 3agene expression 3agenetic markers 3agenome 3amixed infection 3amonitoring 3apathogenicity 3atransportation 3atransposons 3avertebrate viruses 3aviruses 0aBaculovirus 0aMariner transposon 0aMos1 0aFish cells1 aFujita, Ryosuke1 aNakajima, Yumiko1 aYoshimizu, Mamoru1 aKasai, Hisae1 aAsano, Shin-ichiro1 aBando, Hisanori0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Sept. 13, v. 439 p.18-22dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01744naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245013500162300001600297520064400313592002800957650002200985650002201007650003601029650000801065650002101073650000701094650001301101650001401114650001901128700002001147773015201167856007801319852000901397655001201406IND60522873520221117164034.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052287352DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1993-5-6082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, Thomas10aPartial Purification and Characterization of Membrane-Associated 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A Lyase from Radish Seedlings  ap. 444-450.  aWe solubilized from radish membranes and purified by 154-fold 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA lyase (HMGL, EC 4.1.3.4) catalyzing the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-(HMG -)CoA into acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate.

A relatively new method has been employed to separate out internal variability and climate change signal from precipitation time series before quantifying the uncertainties. In our method, signal has been defined as dynamic trend instead of considering a fixed trend line. Three different types of weighting namely equal weighting, independence based weighting and performance based weighting have been employed to assess the uncertainties of GCM projection over different zones. It has been found that ensemble with performance based weighting has produced smaller inter-model uncertainty but the patterns of temporal evolution of uncertainties have been quite irregular compared to other two ensembles. On the other hand, it has been noticed that bias correction using quantile mapping can effectively reduce the range of uncertainty in a systematic way. It has been observed that inter-model uncertainties over NEI has been relatively lower compared to other zones indicating more robust projection over this zone. A dynamic threshold on signal-to-internal variability ratio (S/I) has been used for estimating time of emergence (TOE) at 95% confidence level over each zone. TOE would be earlier in case of NEI and late in NMI. However no zone may experience TOE in first half of the present century.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3amethodology 3amountains 3arain 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3aIndia1 aDas, Lalu1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1523-92951 aMeher, JitendraKumar1 aDeb, Argha0 tClimate dynamics.g2018 May, v. 50, no. 9-10 p.3813-3831dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-3847-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245005100166300001400217520138400231592002801615650002301643650002701666650002801693650002301721650001701744650000701761650001901768650001401787650002201801650001701823653000901840653001801849653002301867653000801890653001601898700001701914773012001931856008202051852000902133655001202142IND60089796820221118022854.0160728e20130913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008979682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoley, Sandip12aA voltage-gated pore for translocation of tRNA  ap. 23-29.  aVery little is known about how nucleic acids are translocated across membranes. The multi-subunit RNA Import Complex (RIC) from mitochondria of the kinetoplastid protozoon Leishmania tropica induces translocation of tRNAs across artificial or natural membranes, but the nature of the translocation pore remains unknown. We show that subunits RIC6 and RIC9 assemble on the membrane in presence of subunit RIC4A to form complex R3. Atomic Force Microscopy of R3 revealed particles with an asymmetric surface groove of ∼20nm rim diameter and ∼1nm depth. R3 induced translocation of tRNA into liposomes when the pH of the medium was lowered to ∼6 in the absence of ATP. R3-mediated tRNA translocation could also be induced at neutral pH by a K+ diffusion potential with an optimum of 60–70mV. Point mutations in the Cys2–His2 Fe-binding motif of RIC6, which is homologous to the respiratory Complex III Fe–S protein, abrogated import induced by low pH but not by K+ diffusion potential. These results indicate that the R3 complex forms a pore that is gated by a proton-generated membrane potential and that the Fe–S binding region of RIC6 has a role in proton translocation. The tRNA import complex of L. tropica thus contains a novel macromolecular channel distinct from the mitochondrial protein import pore that is apparently involved in tRNA import in some species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania tropica 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aatomic force microscopy 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3apH 3apoint mutation 3apotassium 3aprotein transport 3atransfer RNA 0atRNA 0aTranslocation 0aMembrane potential 0aAFM 0aMutagenesis1 aAdhya, Samit0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Sept. 13, v. 439 p.23-29dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.08.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03766naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013200168300001600300520192000316592002802236650001802264650001002282650001902292650001502311650002602326650002702352650001102379650002402390650002402414650001502438650002002453650001702473650001802490650002902508650001202537650002602549650003202575650001302607650002602620650001902646650001502665650000902680650001802689653002402707653002402731653001802755653001202773653002602785653001302811700003002824700002502854700001702879700001802896700002202914773010902936856008603045852000903131655001203140IND60581465020221118065546.0190318e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058146502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yu-Rong10aIdentity of biocrust species and microbial communities drive the response of soil multifunctionality to simulated global change  ap. 208-217.  aIncreasing N inputs and changing rainfall regimes will lead to drastic changes in multiple ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition and gas exchange in dryland ecosystems. As fundamental components of drylands, biological soil crusts (biocrusts) play important roles in the regulation of responses of multiple ecosystem functions to global environmental changes. Biocrusts are home to highly functional microbial communities; however little is known on the role of microbial communities associated with different biocrust species in regulating the response of multiple ecosystem functions to global change. Here, we conducted a microcosm experiment to evaluate the roles of biocrust-forming lichens (Diploschistes thunbergianus, Psora crystallifera and Xanthoparmelia reptans) in mediating the effects of simulated changes in rainfall frequency and nitrogen (N) addition on soil multifunctionality involving nutrient availability, greenhouse gas flux and enzyme activities. The three biocrust species supported different levels of soil bacterial diversity, and specific community composition as revealed by MiSeq sequencing. Biocrust species always promoted multiple functions related to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling compared to bare ground, with X. reptans having the highest effect on multifunctionality. Most importantly, the relative abundance of specific microbial communities associated with different lichen species modulates the response of multifunctionality to impacts of water frequency (negative) and N addition (positive). Our results suggest that biocrust species could regulate global change impacts on soil multifunctionality in drylands, although the strength and direction vary among the biocrust species. These findings highlight the importance of preserving biocrusts as hotspots of microbial genetic resources and ecosystem functioning in drylands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiploschistes 3aPsora 3aXanthoparmelia 3aarid lands 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiological soil crusts 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3agas exchange 3aglobal change 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alichens 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobial genetic resources 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3arain 3asoil bacteria 0aMicrobial diversity 0aBacterial community 0aGlobal change 0aLichens 0aEcosystem functioning 0aDrylands1 aDelgado-Baquerizo, Manuel1 aTrivedī, Paṅkaja,1 aHe, Ji-Zheng1 aWang, Jun-Tao1 aSingh, Brajesh K.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2017 Apr., v. 107 p.208-217dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245019200165520140700357592002801764650002201792650002301814650000901837650001001846650001801856650001901874650001301893650001601906650005201922653001001974653002501984653001002009653000902019653000902028653000902037653001002046653000902056653000902065653001302074653000802087653000902095653000902104653001002113653000902123653000902132653000902141653000902150653001302159653000702172653000602179653000902185653000902194653000902203653000902212653000902221700001902230700001802249773008802267856008302355852000902438655001202447IND60741855920221119192128.0210708e20210830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074185592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2021.1457792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Hwa Jin10aMolecular characterization of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) gene transcript variant mRNA of chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta in response to salinity or temperature changes  aTransient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is an osmosensory cation channel that respond to an increase in cell volume and participates in various physiological functions. Among organisms in aquatic environments, euryhaline teleost is are suitable experimental models to study ion channel proteins related to physiological functions involving osmosensing. Among the studies of various regulatory molecules that mediate osmotic regulation in fish, however, information is lacking, particularly on the TRP family. This study investigated the structural characteristics of theTRPV4 gene of chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) and their responses to changes in salinity and temperature. Interestingly, TRPV4 generates transcript variants of the intron-retention form through alternative splicing, resulting in a frameshift leading to the generation of transcripts of different structures. In particular, TRPV4 x1 and TRPV x2 mRNAs were predominant in the gill and skin including at the lateral line. The expression levels of chum salmon TRPV4 x1 were significantly increased with increase in salinity and temperature, whereas TRPV4 x2 mainly responded to temperature decrease. Overall, these results demonstrate for the first time the effects of salinity and temperature on the expression of two salmonid TRPV4 transcript variants, suggesting their contribution to the regulation of hydromineral balance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus keta 3aeuryhaline species 3afish 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3aosmoregulation 3asalinity 3atemperature 3atransient receptor potential vanilloid channels 0aTRPV4 0aAlternative splicing 0aTRPV4 0aTRPC 0aTRPM 0aTRPP 0aTRPML 0aTRPA 0aTRPN 0aRLM-RACE 0aSRA 0aACTB 0aEF1A 0aGAPDH 0aRPL5 0aRPL7 0aTUBA 0aTUBB 0a18S rRNA 0abp 0aE 0aORFs 0aMEGA 0aVGCC 0aCFTR 0aAQP31 aLee, Sang Yoon1 aKim, Yi Kyung0 tGene.g2021 Aug. 30, v. 795 p.145779-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2021.1457793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245011400203506010400317506007600421520139400497592002801891506003701919650001801956650002001974650003301994650001902027650002002046650001202066650001202078651001302090653003302103653005202136653002202188773009402210856008202304852000902386655001202395IND60770303520221207061131.0220726e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077030352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2022.1079852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuchs, Kevin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3253-513310aSurvey dataset for the perceived consciousness towards environmental sustainability by undergraduate students  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe scope of the dataset allows to examine undergraduate hospitality and tourism students’ intentions towards environmental sustainability.

The objective of this study was to characterize recent broad-scale demographic patterns, including species abundance (i.e., numbers of individuals, tree density, size-class distributions, recruitment, growth rates, mortality rates, and causes of mortality, for the six species of five-needle pine that occur in the western US. We used the U.S. Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) dataset, spanning greater than 10 years, to quantify demographic status and trends for each species. FIA data were compiled from a probabilistic sample design and consistent analysis framework that included not only the dominant community types of five-needle pines, but also all other forest community types, which have previously been demonstrated to encompass abundant regeneration of five-needle pine species. Our analysis revealed similar trends for whitebark and limber pines: both species exhibited increased levels of mortality that are occurring faster than growth of surviving trees, as well as abundant regeneration in forest types that are not dominated by five-needle pines. Although limber pine has experienced lower mortality rates than whitebark pine, it nonetheless showed signs of decline that are comparable to broad-scale indicators exhibited by whitebark pine 10 years prior. In contrast to whitebark and limber pines, Great Basin bristlecone and foxtail pine mortality rates were relatively low, and their populations exhibited a flat diameter distribution except for restricted recruitment from seedling to sapling size-classes. Our findings suggest that five-needle white pine species would benefit not only from increased seedling recruitment, but also from enhanced recruitment among older and larger age and size classes. Thus, it may be important to apply a variety of management strategies – including artificial regeneration with disease-resistant seedlings, direct seeding, and early intervention to decrease competition that may allow natural regeneration to achieve recruitment inter large size-classes – and also apply silviculture techniques to forest types that may be dominated by other species. The consistent monitoring conducted by FIA can allow future assessment of the demographic trajectory of each five-needle pine species, and thus can help prioritize management and restoration priorities, both within communities dominated by five-needle pines and in other community types that may be important targets for silvicultural interventions or restoration treatments.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPinus albicaulis 3aPinus balfouriana 3aPinus flexilis 3aUSDA Forest Service 3aadministrative management 3aartificial regeneration 3abasins 3adata collection 3adirect seeding 3adisease resistance 3aecosystems 3aforest ecology 3aforest inventory 3ainsects 3amortality 3anatural regeneration 3aseedlings 3aspecies abundance 3aspecies recruitment 3atrees 3aWestern United States 0aWhitebark 0aLimber 0aSouthwestern white 0aPinus strobiformis 0aFoxtail 0aGreat Basin bristlecone 0aPinus longaeva 0aRocky Mountain bristlecone pine 0aPinus aristata1 aWindmuller-Campione, Marcella A.0 tForest ecology and management.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 496 p.119438-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1194383Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011300169300001600282520179000298592002802088650001502116650002002131650001902151650001602170650001102186650002502197650001302222650001902235650002002254650001102274650002302285650001502308650001402323650001802337653001302355653001902368653001302387653003802400653002502438653002002463700001902483773011902502856008502621852000902706655001202715IND60630163120221119131113.0190325e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063016312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2019.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantiago, Raul10aInteraction modes between nanosized graphene flakes and liposomes: Adsorption, insertion and membrane fusion  ap. 723-731.  aUnderstanding the effects of graphene-based nanomaterials on lipid membranes is critical to determine their environmental impact and their efficiency in the biomedical context. Graphene has been reported to favourably interact with biological and model lipid membranes.We report on a systematic coarse-grained molecular dynamics study of the interaction modes of graphene nanometric flakes with POPC/cholesterol liposome membranes. We have simulated graphene layers with a variety of sizes and oxidation degrees, and we have analyzed the trajectories, the interaction modes, and the energetics of the observed phenomena.Three interaction modes are reported. Graphene can be transiently adsorbed onto the liposome membrane and/or inserted in its hydrophobic region. Inserted nanosheets prefer a perpendicular orientation, and tilt in order to maximize the contact with phospholipid tails while avoiding the contact with cholesterol molecules. When placed between two liposomes, graphene facilitates their fusion in a single vesicle.Graphene can be temporary adsorbed on the liposome before insertion. Bilayer curvature has an influence on the orientation of inserted graphene particles. Cholesterol molecules are depleted from the surrounding of graphene particles. Graphene layers may catalyse membrane fusion by bypassing the energy barrier required in stalk formation.Nanometric graphene layers can be adsorbed/inserted in lipid-based membranes in different manners and affect the cholesterol distribution in the membrane, implying important consequences on the structure and functionality of biological cell membranes, and on the bioaccumulation of graphene in living organisms. The graphene-mediated mechanism opens new possibilities for vesicle fusion in the experimental context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abioaccumulation 3acell membranes 3acholesterol 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3agraphene 3ahydrophobicity 3amembrane fusion 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3aphospholipids 0aGraphene 0aGraphene oxide 0aLiposome 0aCoarse-grained molecular dynamics 0aComputer simulations 0aMembrane fusion1 aReigada, Ramon0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 Apr., v. 1863, no. 4 p.723-731dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2019.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008300174300001600257520163900273592002801912650002401940650003101964650002301995650001802018650001202036650002602048650001202074650001702086650001402103650001002117650002202127653001402149653001702163653001502180653001702195653001502212700002002227700002202247700001902269773013302288856008502421852000902506655001202515IND60647868520221122094320.0190623e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064786852DNAL7 a10.1080/01448765.2019.15848662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorgieva, Natalia10aEcological assessment of grass associations in the Balkan Mountains conditions  ap. 187-196.  aCreation of plant associations with maximum stability of yields in the regional ecological conditions for which they have been designed is key in modern agriculture. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of the environment on productivity and stability of six grass associations (red fescue, pure stand; red fescue and birdsfoot trefoil; red fescue, tall fescue and birdsfoot trefoil; red fescue and Kentucky bluegrass; red fescue, Kentucky bluegrass and alfalfa; red fescue, Kentucky bluegrass and birdsfoot trefoil) in four locations (mountain slope with eastern, western, northern and south-eastern facing direction). Methods of dispersion, regression and nonparametric analysis were used to evaluate the stability of the mixtures. According to the productivity during the 13-year study period and the calculated stability parameters, the triple mixture of red fescue, Kentucky bluegrass and alfalfa was the highest yielding mixture, but this mixture also manifested itself as unstable. The lower yielding mixed sward of red fescue and Kentucky bluegrass and the pure stand of red fescue were also distinguished by low adaptive ability. In the conditions of the Middle Balkan Mountains, the mixture of red fescue, tall fescue and birdsfoot trefoil was characterised to have the most favourable combination of productivity and ecological stability, and was considered suitable for growing in a wide range of environmental conditions. As a whole, the swards on the mountain slopes with eastern and south-eastern exposure were more productive but had low stability compared to those grown on western and northern exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aFestuca rubra subsp. rubra 3aLotus corniculatus 3aPoa pratensis 3aalfalfa 3aenvironmental factors 3agrasses 3ahorticulture 3amountains 3asward 3atopographic slope 0aStability 0aproductivity 0aevaluation 0agrass swards 0ared fescue1 aKosev, Valentin1 aNaydenova, Galina1 aMitev, Dimitar0 tBiological agriculture & horticulture.g2019 July 3, v. 35, no. 3 p.187-196dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl34654x2165-06167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01448765.2019.15848663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03356naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006900147245013400216506011700350506007600467520140900543592002801952506003701980650001802017650001202035650002602047650001402073650001402087650002102101650002602122650001602148650001802164650002202182650001602204650001102220650001302231651001002244653001702254653001802271653001302289653001302302653001802315653002402333700006502357700006902422700002402491700005802515700005602573773009402629856008202723852000902805655001202814IND60770303820221207061133.0220726e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077030382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2022.1079892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-Villegas, Patricia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0511-872410aMetabarcoding data of prokaryotes and eukaryotes inhabiting the phosphogypsum stockpiles on the salt marshes of Huelva (SW Spain)  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAround 100 Mt of phosphogypsum (PG) of extreme acidity and with high concentrations of heavy metals and radionuclides have been deposited on the salt marshes of the Tinto River estuary in Huelva (SW Spain) for more than forty years. The microbial community able to thrive in these adverse conditions remains totally unknown, despite the fact that it can highly influence the biogeochemical cycle of the phosphogypsum components and include new species with biotechnological interest. High throughput sequencing of 16S/18S rRNA encoding genes is a potent tool to uncover the microbial diversity of extreme environments. This data article describes for the first time the prokaryotic and eukaryotic diversity of two water samples collected in the Huelva phosphogypsum stacks. The raw amplicons of the 16S/18S rRNA maker genes for the two phosphogypsum samples and two reference samples (seawater and the Tinto River water) obtained after sequencing on MiSeq platform are provided.

However, studies that examined this relation have yielded mixed results. We aimed to examine the prospective association of plasma folate level with risk of cognitive impairment in a community-based prospective cohort of older adults in China. METHODS: This study included 615 participants (mean age: 76.3 years) without baseline cognitive impairment from the Rugao Longevity and Ageing Study (RuLAS). We used logistic regression to examine the prospective association between baseline plasma folate and risk of cognitive impairment in the next two years. Fasting blood samples were collected and assayed for plasma folate level at baseline. Cognitive impairment was defined as Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS) score ≤ 21.5 points. RESULTS: During two years’ follow-up, 20.7% of the participants developed cognitive impairment. After controlled for age, gender, and plasma homocysteine, a higher level of plasma folate was associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment. The corresponding odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval was 0.41 (0.19–0.89) comparing participants at extreme quintiles of plasma folate (median level 17.2 vs. 6.3 nmol/L). The associations were similar after further adjustment for major demographic and lifestyle factors (OR = 0.42, 0.18–0.98). Moreover, the inverse association was particularly stronger among males (OR = 0.12, 0.03–0.52) but was non-significant among females. CONCLUSION: Our findings support a potential beneficial role of higher plasma folate levels in cognitive function in older Chinese adults, particularly among males. Future studies with larger sample size and longer follow-up are warranted to confirm these findings and to identify the optimal plasma folate level for cognitive function.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFC2000400/2018YFC2000400-3cNational Key R&D Program of China  a2017SHZDZX01cShanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3aconfidence interval 3adementia 3afolic acid 3ahomocysteine 3alifestyle 3alongevity 3anutrition 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asample size 3aChina1 aYang, Jiaxi1 aZhang, Hui1 aHuang, Yuhui1 aCao, Yaying1 aYan, Shiyu1 aZong, Geng1 aZheng, Yan1 aWang, Xiaofeng1 aYuan, Changzheng0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2022 Aug., v. 61, no. 5 p.2837-2845dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-022-02825-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245014400164520188500308592002802193650001202221650003002233650001802263650001402281650002402295650001802319650001202337650001902349650001202368651001402380700002902394700002802423700002402451700002302475700002002498700002402518700001902542700002602561700002402587700002602611773012002637856007302757852000902830655001202839IND60707839820221120095539.0200821e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070783982DNAL7 a10.3390/f110808362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanagalage, Manjula 10aMulti-Decadal Forest-Cover Dynamics in the Tropical Realm: Past Trends and Policy Insights for Forest Conservation in Dry Zone of Sri Lanka  aForest-cover change has become an important topic in global biodiversity conservation in recent decades because of the high rates of forest loss in different parts of the world, especially in the tropical region. While human interventions are the major cause, natural disasters also contribute to forest cover changes. During the past decades, several studies have been conducted to address different aspects of forest cover changes (e.g., drivers of deforestation, degradation, interventions) in different parts of the world. In Sri Lanka, increasing rates of forest loss have been recorded during the last 100 years on a regional basis, especially in the dry zone. However, Sri Lanka needs detailed studies that employ contemporary data and robust analytical tools to understand the patterns of forest cover changes and their drivers. The dry zone of Sri Lanka encompasses 59% of the total land area of the country, ergo, the most extensive forest cover. Our study analyzed forest cover dynamics and its drivers between 1992 and 2019. Our specific objectives included (i) producing a forest cover map for 2019, (ii) analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns of forest cover changes from 1992 to 2019, and (iii) determining the main driving forces. Landsat 8 images were used to develop forest-cover maps for 2019, and the rest of the forest cover maps (1992, 1999, and 2010) were obtained from the Forest Department of Sri Lanka. In this study, we found that the dry zone had undergone rapid forest loss (246,958.4 ha) during the past 27 years, which accounts for 8.0% of the net forest cover changes. From 2010 to 2019, the rates of forest loss were high, and this can be associated with the rapid infrastructure development of the country. The findings of this study can be used as a proxy to reform current forest policies and enhance the forest sustainability of the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3abiodiversity conservation 3adeforestation 3adisasters 3aforest conservation 3aforest policy 3aforests 3ainfrastructure 3atropics 3aSri Lanka1 aGunarathna, M.

Seventeen years after introduction, which was originally aimed at improving the macroporosity and permeability of the heavy clay soil, we returned to the gradient of L. terrestris dispersal (well established, more recent and no settlement) and investigated the temporal development of the ecosystem engineering impacts on different faunal groups (earthworms, enchytraeids and nematodes) and soil porosity. The faunal responses were examined both at L. terrestris midden scale (individual living site) and field scale. We found that L. terrestris middens sustained elevated densities of all three faunal groups. In the case of earthworms, there was evidence for temporal development of the engineering impact as the difference between the midden and non-midden areas was more pronounced in the well-established areas than close to the leading edge of dispersal. The earthworm community composition was not altered at L. terrestris midden sites. The settlement of L. terrestris had no discernible effects on field-scale earthworm and nematode abundances, but enchytraeids were practically absent beyond the leading edge of the dispersal. This effect might, however, be partly explained by a gradient of increasing clay content. Soil macroporosity at L. terrestris midden sites did not increase with the age of L. terrestris settlement. Our results suggest that L. terrestris settlement in a clay soil can significantly increase the spatial patchiness of soil fauna, but may not, except in the case of enchytraeids, affect their field-scale abundances or the macroporosity of the soil in the vicinity of L. terrestris living sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnchytraeidae 3aLumbricus terrestris 3aNematoda 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3aclay soils 3acommunity structure 3aearthworms 3aecosystem engineering 3aengineering 3ahabitats 3alifestyle 3ano-tillage 3apermeability 3aporosity 3asoil ecology1 aButt, Kevin R.1 aHyväluoma, Jari1 aKetoja, Elise1 aMikola, Juha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4336-26480 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2017 Dec., v. 115 p.285-296dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245015200163520142200315592002801737650002601765650000801791650001801799650001001817650001101827650001601838650001101854650001601865650001301881650001601894650001701910650001301927650001401940653001001954653001601964653002101980700001302001700001802014700001602032773010702048856008502155852000902240655001202249IND60741856420221119191856.0210713e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074185642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.1091482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Wei10aEntry of bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 into MDBK cells occurs via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis in a acid-dependent manner  aBovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV3) is an important respiratory pathogen of both young and adult cattle. No specific therapies are available for BPIV3. Understanding the viral internalization pathway of BPIV3 will provide new strategies for the development of antiviral treatments. Here, the entry mechanism of BPIV3 into MDBK cells was analyzed using chemical inhibitors and RNA silencing. Our data demonstrated that treatment with an inhibitor targeting the clathrin-mediated pathway or clathrin heavy chain (CHC) knockdown suppressed the entry of BPIV3 into MDBK cells. In contrast, sequestration of cellular cholesterol by nystatin or silencing of caveolin-1 had no effect on viral entry. Moreover, inhibition of critical modulators of macropinocytosis significantly reduced BPIV3 uptake. In addition, fluid-phase uptake was significantly increased in cells infected with BPIV3, which is indicative of virus-induced facilitation of macropinocytosis. These results suggest that BPIV3 enters MDBK cells via macropinocytosis and clathrin- but not caveolar-dependent endocytosis. Furthermore, inhibition of endosomal acidification and activation of cathepsin blocked BPIV3 entry, demonstrating that BPIV3 entered MDBK cells in a acid-dependent manner and required cathepsin L. Finally, we demonstrated that macropinocytosis but not clathrin-mediated endocytosis is dependent on actin dynamics during BPIV3 infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBovine respirovirus 3 3aRNA 3aacidification 3aactin 3aadults 3acathepsin L 3acattle 3acholesterol 3aclathrin 3aendocytosis 3amicrobiology 3anystatin 3apathogens 0aBPIV3 0aVirus entry 0aMacropinocytosis1 aHui, Nie1 aWang, Hongmei1 aHe, Hongbin0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2021 Aug., v. 259 p.109148-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.1091483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009700168300001600265520186400281592002802145650002202173650001102195650001102206650001902217650001202236650001902248650001902267650001602286650001702302650001602319650001102335650001302346650001002359650001102369650000902380650001402389650001102403650002402414650001102438650002002449650001102469650002202480650001302502651001002515653001602525653000902541653001202550653001702562653001802579653001702597700002202614700002102636700002602657700001902683700002102702773011902723856008402842852000902926655001202935IND60544900420221117065109.0160901e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054490042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Ray K.L.10aFacies, geochemistry and diatoms of late Pleistocene Olorgesailie tufas, southern Kenya Rift  ap. 197-217.  aThis research reconstructs paleoenvironments of late Pleistocene tufas at Olorgesailie in the southern Kenya Rift and examines the relationship between climate, tectonism and tufa precipitation. The deposits crop out at three main sites, forming at 290kyr and at least twice between 220 and 12kyr ago. Ten carbonate facies comprise the bulk of the tufas, which accumulated at spring vents, in swamps and shallow lakes, along fissures, and along fluvial channels.The tufas contain diatoms dominated by shallow-water, swamp and fluvial taxa associated with fresh to mildly saline conditions. δ13C isotopes are relatively enriched (0.25 to 1.96‰) compared with other East African tufas, but uniform within each set of tufa deposits, suggesting similar sources of CO2 derived from similar plants and soil organic matter during each interval of deposition. δ18O ranges from −7.17‰ to +5.16‰ suggesting variable evaporation and rainfall/groundwater sources or changing water temperatures. Variable REE patterns suggest spatial and/or temporal contrasts in groundwater chemistry.The former springs may have developed in response to climate changes, but there are no clear correlations with known East African wet phases. The deposition of tufa probably also relates to basin breakup and faulting, which likely influenced groundwater movements. Increased permineralized silica in plants in tufas and non-carbonate sediments reflects the introduction of deeper groundwaters than those during earlier Olorgesailie Formation times. Whether climatically or tectonically controlled, the tufa spring sites would have provided a supply of potable water, at least intermittently, during the Pleistocene, and would have provided attractive places for wildlife and possibly for Middle Stone Age human inhabitants of the region, especially during relatively dry times.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3abasins 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrinking water 3aevaporation 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3aisotopes 3alakes 3aoxygen 3arain 3asediments 3asilica 3asoil organic matter 3aspring 3asprings (water) 3aswamps 3awater temperature 3awildlife 3aKenya 0aPleistocene 0aTufa 0aDiatoms 0aGeochemistry 0aSedimentology 0aOlorgesailie1 aOwen, R.

The realization of sustainability of eco-environments has long been a key issue. Consequently, we analysed the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) to identify solutions to the sustainable development of such regions. We first reviewed the eco-environmental changes in the CLP and discussed the impacts of human activities over the past 3000 years, and then summarized previous experiences on the protection and restoration of degraded eco-environments. Our study indicates that the increasing demand for cultivated land has led to the destruction of vegetation and subsequent worsening of soil erosion on the CLP, which in turn, has led to an increase in floods in the Yellow River basin. However, many positive measures, such as slope cropland abandonment and afforestation have been demonstrated to be effective in improving the eco-environment via reducing soil erosion, and decreasing sediment input and flood disasters in the Yellow River in recent decades. Nonetheless, emerging problems such as water shortage, food insecurity, rapid urban development, and over-exploitation of energy resources hinder the sustainable development of the eco-environment in the CLP. Given the historical and present eco-environmental situations of the CLP, we provide suggestions for the sustainable development of both the eco-environment and social economy, which could serve as guidelines for eco-environmental design and government policy-making in semi-arid regions globally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aafforestation 3aclimate change 3acropland 3aenergy 3afood security 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3asediments 3asoil erosion 3asustainable development 3aurban development 3avegetation 3awater shortages 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYellow River 0aEco-environmental change 0aHuman activities 0aChinese Loess Plateau 0aSemi-arid regions1 aDeng, Lei1 aShangguan, Zhouping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5815-63101 aChen, Yiping1 aLin, Xin0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2021 Nov., v. 125 p.126-134dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2021.08.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010000167506010400267506007600371520131400447592002801761506003701789650002001826650001101846650001001857653003101867653003101898653002601929653002901955653001801984700005502002700005702057773009402114856008202208852000902290655001202299IND60770304220221207061044.0220726e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077030422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2022.1079932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jia-Xuan10aData on point cloud scanning and ground radar of composite lining in jointly constructed tunnel  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present dataset pertains to field records of construction quality of composite lining in a jointly constructed tunnel. The dataset includes the original mining surface profile data collected by the terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and radar information on backfill quality outside the segmental lining which was obtained by the ground-penetration radar (GPR) detection. The point cloud data of the mining surface was further processed and compared with the design tunnel model to evaluate the level of over and under- excavation. The radargram provides details on the variation of the signal waveform by which the heterogeneity of backfill can be recognized. The dataset can be used to verify that the voids are prone to occur in the outside backfill of the composite lining. Furthermore, this dataset provides a method for detecting and preventing the defects of the composite lining and also facilitates the post-construction treatment. Additional foreseeable use of this dataset includes providing modeling material for researchers interested in knowing how voids in backfill influence the behavior of composite lining. As a supplement, this dataset supports the numerical analysis outlined in the article titled “Numerical evaluation of segmental tunnel lining with voids in outside backfill” [1].  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata collection 3amodels 3aradar 0aJointly constructed tunnel 0aTerrestrial laser scanning 0aOver-under-excavation 0aGround-penetrating radar 0aHeterogeneity1 aZhang, Ning1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5302-600X1 aXu, Ye-Shuang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1624-36590 tData in Brief.g2022 Apr., v. 41 p.107993-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.1079933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03685naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245012000180506011700300506007600417520192500493592002802418506003702446650001502483650001202498650001302510650001102523650000902534650001802543650002102561650002202582650001302604650001702617650001702634650002702651650001102678650003002689651001802719653002602737653001302763653002102776653002802797653002402825653002102849653001802870700001702888700002102905700002102926773010102947856008603048852000903134655001203143IND60750974820221207145055.0220921e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075097482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1081512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoyano, P.

However, there are not long-term growth data from demersal fish populations to test these interconections in a long-term analysis. For this reason, a first extensive growth chronology was reconstructed from the annual growth of sagittal otoliths as a proxy for somatic growth for the cardinalfish (Epigonus crassicaudus). Adult fish ranging from 35 to 40 cm in fork length and from 39 to 63 years in age were collected off Chilean waters. The master chronologies were estimated for the period from 1974 to 2014, using the regional curve standardization approach (RCS) and linear mixed models (LMMs). Growth indexes derived from both approaches followed a similar trend and were positively correlated with the Humboldt Current Index (HCI) and negatively with ENSO, Pacific Decadal Oscillation and sea surface temperature. LMMs showed that a 75% of growth variability was explained by the age of increment formation and HCI was the environmental index that most significantly affected the annual growth of cardinalfish followed by the sea surface temperature in spring. A reduced growth phase from 1974 to 1996 contrasted with a higher growth period from 1997, matching the 1997/1998 climatic regime shift, demonstrating that the enhanced growth for cardinalfish was associated with upwelling of nutrient rich water to the surface, triggering an increase of the primary and secondary productivity during the prevalence of a cold regime period in the Humboldt Current System. The consistence between RCS and LMM methods was indicative that both approaches are promising to evaluate the influence of environmental drivers on the growth condition of a demersal fish population in a highly productive marine ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aApogonidae 3aEl Nino 3aEpigonus 3aadults 3acold 3ademersal fish 3afish communities 3amarine ecosystems 3aotoliths 3apelagic fish 3areproduction 3asecondary productivity 3aspring 3asurface water temperature 3aPacific Ocean 0aEpigonus crassicaudus 0aOtoliths 0aSclerochronology 0aEnvironmental variables 0aMixed linear models 0aHumboldt Current 0aDemersal fish1 aPlaza, Guido1 aCerna, Francisco1 aMuñoz, Ariel A.0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Nov., v. 131 p.108151-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1081513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245007600165300001600241520176500257592002802022650002202050650001402072650001202086650002202098650001802120650001502138650001902153650001402172650001302186650001302199650001802212650001702230650001602247650002402263650002102287700001602308700002902324773009302353856008402446852000902530655001202539IND60098892720221117085904.0141105e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009889272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2013.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Lina10aTransesterification of canola oil catalyzed by nanopowder calcium oxide  ap. 154-162.  aTwo types of commercial nanopowder calcium oxides, a higher surface area (HSA nano-CaO) and moderate surface area (nano-CaO) were studied for the transesterification of canola oil. The effect of reaction temperature, catalyst/oil weight ratio, and methanol/oil molar ratio on the reaction performance was investigated. The results show that nanopowder CaOs possess high activity due to their larger BET surface areas. At 65°C, 99.85% biodiesel yield was obtained at 2h when 3wt.% of the nano-CaO catalyst was used with 9:1 methanol/oil molar ratio. The required catalyst/oil weight ratio to achieve the same yield under the same conditions was 10 times less for the HSA-nano-CaO catalyst. In contrast, only 88.59% and 16.23% yield were obtained for calcium methoxide (Ca(OCH₃)₂) and laboratory-grade CaO, respectively. A Langmuir–Hinshelwood model-based reaction mechanism was proposed for nano-CaO catalyzed transesterification reaction. The reaction was assumed to be first order with respect to triglyceride. The apparent reaction constants, apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factors have been calculated based on experimental data. Nanopowder CaOs were capable of being used without significant deactivation for 10cycles. A slight drop in activity was ascribed to a combination of surface area loss from particle aggregation, the formation of Ca(OCH₃)₂, CaCO₃, a Ca-glycerin complex, and adsorbed CO₂ on the catalyst surface. Particle size did not have any effect on the amount of Ca leaching but leaching did increase with longer reaction time especially at higher catalyst loadings. Increasing the methanol/oil molar ratio increased Ca leaching in the glycerol-rich phase and decreased Ca leaching in the biodiesel-rich phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3abiodiesel 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3acalcium oxide 3acanola oil 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3aleaching 3amethanol 3aparticle size 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atransesterification 3atriacylglycerols1 aQiu, Zheyan1 aStagg-Williams, Susan M.0 tFuel processing technology.g2013 Oct., v. 114 p.154-162dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2013.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015500172506010400327506007600431520103700507592002801544506003701572650002301609650001201632650002201644650002001666650001601686650001801702651001101720653002201731653002301753653002101776653001201797653001301809700002401822700002901846700001601875700002101891700005701912773009401969856008202063852000902145655001202154IND60770304520221207061146.0220726e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077030452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2022.1079962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamírez-Dolores, C.10aDataset on thermal comfort, perceived stress, and anxiety in university students under confinement due to COVID-19 in a hot and humid region of Mexico  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis dataset was compiled to estimate the levels of thermal comfort and mental health in a sample group of university students confined due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results showed that reclamation significantly increased SOC concentrations and SOC stocks. Specifically, 10 years of cotton production increased SOC concentrations by 45% in the 0–60 cm depth and SOC stocks by 35%. The SOC concentrations and stocks decreased as soil depth increased. Reclamation time, season and soil depth had significant interaction effects on SOC. The SOC concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with available soil nitrogen and available soil phosphorus. Compared with abandoned farmland, macro-aggregate-associated (>250 µm) SOC concentrations in the 0–60 cm depth increased by 47% after 5 years of cotton production and by 53% after 10 years of cotton production. The contribution of macro-aggregate-associated SOC to total SOC in the 0–60 cm depth increased by 87% after 5 years of cotton production and by 69% after 10 years of cotton production. The findings indicate that soil aggregates were more stable after abandoned, salinized farmland was reclaimed for cotton production. Furthermore, cotton production can increase SOC concentrations and sequester C in this arid area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aabandoned land 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural sciences 3acotton 3afield experimentation 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3asoil aggregation 3asoil depth 3asoil organic carbon 3awatersheds1 aYANG, H.

Surviving trees from an understory layer are recognized to play an important role in post-disturbance C dynamics. However, their influence on decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), an important ecosystem C pool, has yet to be rigorously investigated. Over four consecutive years, we investigated the effects of advance spruce regeneration on decomposition processes in a mountain soil after forest gap disturbance. Gap disturbance was accomplished by clear cut harvest and decomposition was assessed by combining measurements of soil CO2 efflux, heterotrophic respiration, soil enzymes activity, and mass loss from standardized litter bags. Soil CO2 efflux showed no response to gap formation, independent of whether regeneration was present or absent, indicating that reduced autotrophic respiration was offset by accelerated heterotrophic respiration from decomposing microbes. Incubation studies revealed no effects of gap disturbance on heterotrophic respiration and its temperature sensitivity under controlled lab conditions. Since potential enzyme activities, at a given temperature, did not respond to gap formation either, it appears that neither C nor other nutrient limitations of the decomposing microbes changed in this SOM-rich mountain forest soil after disturbance. Mass loss of standardized litter was ∼5% higher after gap formation in plots without regeneration, while under the regeneration it remained at control stand levels. Our findings indicate that canopy removal by gap disturbance lead to an increase in decomposition, primarily due to warmer soil conditions. However, an established regeneration retards decomposition due to its modulating effect on soil temperature. Our study therefore shows that facilitating regeneration pre-disturbance can reduce post-disturbance soil C losses from decomposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea 3abags 3acanopy gaps 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aenzyme activity 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest soils 3amicroorganisms 3amountain soils 3asoil enzymes 3asoil organic matter 3asoil temperature 3atrees 3aunderstory 0aForest disturbance 0aHeterotrophic soil respiration 0aSoil carbon loss 0aSoil CO2 efflux 0aSoil enzymes 0aSoil organic matter1 aMatthews, Bradley1 aRosinger, Christoph1 aSandén, Hans1 aGodbold, Douglas L.1 aKatzensteiner, Klaus1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0534-83910 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2017 Dec., v. 115 p.490-498dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245008800167520215100255592002802406650002002434650002002454650002602474650002102500650002002521650000902541650001502550650002602565650002502591650001002616651001002626653002202636653002302658653001902681653002602700700001802726700001702744700002302761700001702784773011702801856008402918852000903002655001203011IND60741856920221119192326.0210812e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074185692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1070102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yanqing10aWater-use patterns of Chinese wolfberry (Lycium barbarum L.) on the Tibetan Plateau  aChinese wolfberry (Lycium barbarum L.) can efficiently ameliorate land deterioration and increase farmers’ incomes on the Tibetan Plateau. Therefore, it has been widely grown in this region in the past decades. The aims of this study were to clarify the patterns of water sources and water use efficiency under 3 management practices to determine the optimal cultivation strategies. A 2-year field experiment was undertaken in a Chinese wolfberry plantation with 3 management practices, including the conventional flat planting plus surface drip irrigation (CK), flat planting with full-film mulching plus surface drip irrigation (MF) and ridge-furrow full-film mulching plus surface drip irrigation (MR). The soil moisture in shallow (0–20 cm), middle (20–60 cm) and deep (60–100 cm) soil layers were regarded as the trees’ potential water sources. The IsoSource model and two Bayesian mixing models of MixSIR and MixSIAR were employed to calculate the contribution of different water sources to xylem water. The MixSIR model exhibited relatively better performance in quantifying water source contribution for different layers compared with the IsoSource and MixSIAR models. Management practices significantly altered water use patterns of the wolfberry during the growing periods. Under CK the wolfberry preferentially extracted moisture from the middle and deep layers even during rainfall and irrigation. Under MF and MR they switched more flexibly their water source between the three layers; and they used more water from shallow and middle layers when soil moisture availability increased there, which was especially true under MR. Compared with CK, the average yield of MR and WUE were found to increase by 21.5% and 17%, respectively, over the 2-years period. This indicated that film mulching and ridge-furrow altered the water use strategy of Chinese wolfberry and WUE, which can inform the designing of the best management regimes. The response to tree water use in terms of soil nutrients and subsurface irrigation should be investigated to optimize field management practices, including irrigation schedules and modes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aLycium barbarum 3afield experimentation 3aland degradation 3amicroirrigation 3arain 3asoil water 3asubsurface irrigation 3awater use efficiency 3axylem 3aChina 0aChinese wolfberry 0aWater use strategy 0aStable isotope 0aBayesian mixing model1 aGao, Xiaodong1 aWang, Jiaxin1 aRobinson, Brett H.1 aZhao, Xining0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 255 p.107010-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1070103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014500172300001600317520185200333592002802185650001202213650001102225650001102236650001802247650001702265650001102282650001002293650001002303650001702313650001402330650001902344650001102363650000902374650001602383650002502399651001002424651001802434653001602452653002302468653002002491653001302511653001902524653001002543700001802553700001802571700001502589700001602604700001602620700001602636700001902652773011902671856008402790852000902874655001202883IND60544901020221117064736.0160901e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054490102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Chun Chang10aExtraordinary hydro-climatic events during the period AD 200−300 recorded by slackwater deposits in the upper Hanjiang River valley, China  ap. 274-283.  aThe Hanjiang River, a major tributary of the Yangtze River in China, is noted for the current national South-to-North Water Diversion project. Palaeo-hydrological investigations were carried out along the upper reach gorges of the Hanjiang River that drains the Qinling and the Dabashan Mountains. A set of palaeoflood slackwater deposit beds (SWDs) was identified in Holocene pedo-stratigraphy of the riverbanks along the valley. These SWDs are interbedded in the eolian loess-soil profiles in the cliffy riverbanks and they thin out toward the upper slopes. The palaeoflood SWDs were differentiated from eolian loess and soil by the sedimentary criteria and analytical results. The minimum flood peak discharges were estimated to be 65,400−65,830m3s−1 by using palaeo-hydrological methods. They are about twice of the largest gauged flood (34,300m3s−1) that has ever been measured. They represent the largest flood events in the upper reaches of the Hanjiang River over the Holocene. These extraordinary flood events were dated to 1810−1710 a (AD 200−300) with the optically stimulated luminescence method and checked by archaeological dating of the human remains retrieved from the profiles. This indicates that the extraordinary floods occurred during the dynasties of Eastern Han to Western Jin (AD 25−316) in Chinese history, during which severe droughts and floods were recorded in documents. In the reconstructed 2000-year temperature time series based on high-resolution climatic proxies from tree-rings, stalagmites, ice-cores and lake sediments from over the world, these extraordinary palaeoflood events are correlated with an increased climatic variability characterized by cooling and drying during the period AD 150−350. This result is important for understanding the effects of global change on river system dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3adrying 3afloods 3aglobal change 3agrowth rings 3ahumans 3alakes 3aloess 3aluminescence 3amountains 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3asoil 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aPalaeoflood 0aSlackwater deposit 0aClimatic change 0aHolocene 0aHanjiang River 0aChina1 aPang, Jiangli1 aZha, Xiaochun1 aZhou, Yali1 aYin, Shuyan1 aSu, Hongxia1 aZhou, Liang1 aYang, Jianchao0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 374 p.274-283dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011100169300001600280520094500296592002801241650001401269650002501283650003001308650002501338650001501363650002501378650001101403650001901414650004401433650001501477650001601492700001801508700001301526700002101539700001901560700002201579700001501601700001701616700001301633773015301646856008601799852000901885655001201894IND60549813020221116181707.0160909e20150424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054981302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b000572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xing-Wei10aPolycyclic Polyprenylated Acylphloroglucinol Congeners Possessing Diverse Structures from Hypericum henryi  ap. 885-895.  aPolycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAPs) are a class of hybrid natural products sharing the mevalonate/methylerythritol phosphate and polyketide biosynthetic pathways and showing considerable structural and bioactive diversity. In a systematic phytochemical investigation of Hypericum henryi, 40 PPAP-type derivatives, including the new compounds hyphenrones G–Q, were obtained. These compounds represent 12 different structural types, including four unusual skeletons exemplified by 5, 8, 10, and 17. The 12 different core structures found are explicable in terms of their biosynthetic origin. The structure of a known PPAP, perforatumone, was revised to hyphenrone A (5) by NMR spectroscopic and biomimetic synthesis methods.

Farmers are the ones who decide how and when to adapt to excess, scarcity, and even to extreme precipitation events in agriculture. To understand farmer’s views on the needs and means to manage future changes in precipitation, a farmer survey was organized in 2018 with 4401 respondents and a follow-up survey in 2020 with 2000 respondents. The aims were: (1) to understand farmers’ views on future changes in precipitation patterns, (2) to gain an insight into farmer views on prioritization of the potential key adaptation measures (irrigation, drainage and maintenance of soil conditions) to future floods and drought episodes and thereby, (3) to be better able to support farmers in their primary task of food production in a sustainable manner in a changing climate. This study highlighted that farmers need financial support, but also more information about the costs and benefits of the measures to cope with changing precipitation patterns—not least due to the many uncertainties in projecting future precipitation patterns. As fluctuating precipitation have many environmental impacts in addition to those on production per se, costs and investments of adaptation to climatic constraints should not be payable only by the farmers. Farmers prioritized the soil organic content (SOC) and well-functioning subsurface drainage as the main objects of their attention, and these were clearly ahead of future use of irrigation. Taking care of subsurface drainage, soil structure, SOC and functionality is the long-term means to maintain and improve sustainability and productivity, while the implementation of irrigation is a more flexible, one-off measure that requires short-term reactivity as an adaptation option.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3afarmers 3afood production 3afunding 3airrigation 3aprioritization 3arisk 3asoil structure 3asubsurface drainage 3asurveys 3awater management 3aEurope 0aAdaptation 0aDrainage 0aFlooding 0aSoil conditions1 aSorvali, Jaana1 aKaseva, Janne0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 255 p.107011-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1070113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008500176506011700261506007600378520134300454592002801797506003701825650001401862650001501876650001701891650001001908650002301918650001601941650001201957650001901969650001101988650001601999650001302015650001302028653002402041653003102065653002502096653002902121653002602150653002102176700002002197700002202217700001702239700002102256773010102277856008602378852000902464655001202473IND60750975220221207140326.0220921e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075097522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1082052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevandowski, Mary L.10aMulti-method biodiversity assessments from wetlands in Grand Teton National Park  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA cost-efficient approach to long-term monitoring is to focus on one species or group of organisms as indicators of ecological condition. Through the use of autonomous monitoring technologies, monitoring programs can efficiently expand the biological community surveyed and inferences made. Amphibians have been monitored in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks by the Greater Yellowstone Inventory and Monitoring Network (GRYN) since 2006, yet other taxa dependent on wetlands have not been systematically studied. Our main aim was to explore what additional insights we could gain about wetland biodiversity by combining GRYN’s amphibian surveys with multiple autonomous technologies. We deployed wildlife cameras and acoustic recorders (for audible and ultrasonic sounds) at 4 permanent wetlands in Grand Teton National Park, WY during early and late summer 2017 and used descriptive metrics to summarize our findings. During GRYN’s surveys, 3 of 4 native amphibians were detected. With autonomous monitoring tools, we also documented avian and mammalian communities and detected changes in the degree of activity over the summer. Combining multiple, complementary technologies with field-based surveys provides a more comprehensive picture of wetland biodiversity and enhances insights about ecological condition and change.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacoustics 3aamphibians 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3acost effectiveness 3ainventories 3amammals 3anational parks 3asummer 3aultrasonics 3awetlands 3awildlife 0aAcoustic Recordings 0aAutonomous Recording Units 0aLong-term Monitoring 0aMulti-species Monitoring 0aUltrasonic Recordings 0aWildlife Cameras1 aLitt, Andrea R.1 aMcKenna, Megan F.1 aBurson, Shan1 aLegg, Kristin L.0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Nov., v. 131 p.108205-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.1082053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245012900208506011700337506007600454520127800530592002801808506003701836650001301873650002001886650001701906653002101923653003201944653004401976653001902020653001702039653001402056653001302070700001902083700001502102700001802117700001902135773009402154856008202248852000902330655001202339IND60770304920221207061154.0220726e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077030492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2022.1080002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLentschat, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3218-869610aPartial n-Ary relation instances on food packaging composition and permeability extracted from scientific publication tables  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis dataset is dedicated to text mining and is composed of partial n-Ary relation instances concerning food packaging composition and gas permeability. It was created from 31 tables derived from 10 English-language scientific articles in html format from several international journals hosted on the ScienceDirect website. This dataset includes two sets of data: manual table annotation results and automatic data extraction results. The tables were first annotated by one annotator and cross-curated by three different annotators. The annotation task aimed to identify all table data dealing with packaging permeability measurements and compositions. An Ontological and Terminological Resource (OTR) was used for the annotation process. The annotation guidelines were drawn up through a collective iterative approach involving the annotators, and they may be accessed alongside the data. This dataset of n-Ary relations can be used in natural language processing (NLP) approaches implemented in experimental fields, especially for n-Ary relation extraction research. It can also be useful for training or evaluation of methods for the extraction of experimental data from tables and text in scientific documents, especially in experimental domains such as food packaging.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3adata collection 3apermeability 0aTable extraction 0aNatural language processing 0aOntological and terminological resource 0aFood packaging 0aPermeability 0aComponent 0aQuantity1 aBuche, Patrice1 aMenut, Luc1 aGuari, Romane1 aRoche, Mathieu0 tData in Brief.g2022 Apr., v. 41 p.108000-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.1080003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245012000204300001600324520162000340592002801960650001301988650001302001650002202014650001902036650002102055650001102076650002602087650001802113650001202131650001302143650001802156650001902174650001302193650001302206650001902219650001102238650000902249653003002258653002002288653002102308653001402329653002402343653001802367700001502385700001802400700002002418700002002438773010902458856008602567852000902653655001202662IND60581466320221118065627.0190318e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058146632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3989-070414aThe quality and quantity of exogenous organic carbon input control microbial NO3− immobilization: A meta-analysis  ap. 357-363.  aThe accumulation of NO3− in the soil has resulted in increased nitrogen (N) loss through runoff, leaching, and gaseous emissions. Microbial immobilization of NO3− as an important process in reducing soil NO3− accumulation has been for a long time neglected due to the predominant viewpoint that microbes preferentially immobilize NH4+-N. Microbial NO3− immobilization is generally carbon (C)-limited, and thus exogenous organic C input may enhance microbial NO3− immobilization. However, the effect of the quality and quantity of exogenous organic C input on soil microbial NO3− immobilization is poorly understood, and a synthetic assessment on such an effect is lacking. We thus assessed the impact of exogenous organic C type, the application rate of simple organic C (glucose and acetate), complex organic C type (animal manure, plant residue) and the C/N ratio of complex organic C on soil microbial NO3− immobilization rate using a meta-analysis. We found that the quality and quantity of exogenous C input affect soil microbial NO3− immobilization: microbial NO3− immobilization was enhanced with the addition of simple organic C at rates >500 mg C kg−1, or complex organic C with C/N ratios >18. Furthermore, a positive relationship between the natural log of response ratio of soil microbial NO3− and NH4+ immobilization indicates the simultaneous utilization of NH4+ and NO3− under elevated C availability. We conclude that specific exogenous organic C input at a high rate or with a high C/N ratio can enhance microbial NO3− immobilization and reduce soil NO3− accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanimal manures 3aapplication rate 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3agas emissions 3aglucose 3aleaching 3ameta-analysis 3amicroorganisms 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aplant residues 3arunoff 3asoil 0aExogenous organic C input 0aSimple C source 0aComplex C source 0aC/N ratio 0aNO3− accumulation 0aNitrogen loss1 aWang, Jing1 aWang, Jinyang1 aChang, Scott X.1 aWang, Shenqiang0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2017 Dec., v. 115 p.357-363dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100004500150245004900195300001400244520098200258592002801240650004401268650001201312650002201324650001301346650002501359650002001384650001601404650002101420650001501441651001101456700003501467700003201502700003501534773009101569856008401660852000901744655001201753IND60098893120221117090312.0141105e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009889312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2013.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Sá Araujo, Maria de Fátima Amazonas10aWeathering aging of modified asphalt binders  ap. 19-25.  aThe effect of solar radiation on aging of the asphalt binder can be considered relevant due to the high level of insulation in several countries including Brazil.

These modifiers represent the main compounds used to obtain improved performance from asphalt binder. The degradation of the samples was analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermal analysis. The styrene–butadiene–styrene, polyphosphoric acid, and hydrated lime asphalt binders showed a higher photo degradation resistance than the conventional asphalt binder for aging time up to 200h, considering the infrared spectroscopy results.

The results will provide insights into water consumption by trees occupying different social positions of the forests. In the present study, an experiment was conducted in the Qilian Mountains, northwest China, and 13 trees, i.e., 4–5 trees from each one of dominant (the relative tree height (HR) > 1.65), subdominant (1.25 < HR ≤ 1.65) and intermediate-suppressed (HR ≤ 1.25) layers) were chosen as sample trees in a pure Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia Kom.) forest stand. The sap flux density of sample trees, soil moisture of main root zone (0 to 60 cm) and meteorological conditions in open field were observed simultaneously from July to October of 2015 and 2016. The results showed that (1) The mean daily stand transpiration for the study period in 2015 and 2016 (July–October), was 0.408 and 0.313 mm·day⁻¹, and the cumulative stand transpiration was 54.84 and 40.97 mm, accounting for 24.14% (227.2 mm) and 16.39% (249.9 mm) of the total precipitation over the same periods, respectively. (2) The transpiration varied greatly among canopy layers, and the transpiration of the dominant and codominant layers was the main contributors to the stand transpiration, contributing 86.05% and 81.28% of the stand transpiration, respectively, in 2015 and 2016. (3) The stand transpiration was strongly affected by potential evapotranspiration (PET) and volumetric soil moisture (VSM). However, the transpiration of trees from the dominant and codominant layers was more sensitive to PET changes and that from the intermediate-suppressed layer was more susceptible to soil drought. This implied that in dry period, such as in drought events, the dominant and codominant trees would transpire more water, while the intermediate-suppressed trees almost stopped transpiration. These remind us that the canopy structure was the essential factor affecting single-tree and forest transpiration in the dryland areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea crassifolia 3aarid lands 3acanopy 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3aforest stands 3aforests 3ameteorological parameters 3amountains 3arhizosphere 3asap flow 3asoil water 3atranspiration 3atree height 3atrees 3aChina1 aYu, Pengtao 1 aWang, Yanhui 1 aWang, Bin 1 aYu, Yipeng 1 aWang, Xiao 1 aLiu, Zebin 1 aLiu, Xiande 1 aWang, Shunli 1 aXiong, Wei 0 tForests.g2020 Aug. 04, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110808453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012600206300001100332520160900343592002801952596005901980596007302039650000802112650001902120650001702139650001002156650001702166650002002183650001402203650001702217650002102234650002602255650001902281650001402300650001902314650001302333650002502346700001602371700001402387700001602401700005802417700005202475773010902527856008302636852000902719655001202728IND60782872520221122232653.0220728e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078287252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-022-03956-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Guanjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0230-041314aThe structural correlations and the physiological functions of stomatal morphology and leaf structures in C3 annual crops  ap. 39.  aMAIN CONCLUSION: This study suggests that stomatal and leaf structures are highly correlated, and mesophyll cell size is an important anatomical trait determining the coordination between stomatal size and mesophyll porosity. A comprehensive study of the correlations between the structural traits and on their relationships with gas exchange parameters may provide some useful information into leaf development and improvement in efficiencies of photosynthetic CO₂ fixation and transpirational water loss. In the present study, nine plant materials from eight crop species were pot grown in a growth chamber. Leaf structural traits, gas exchange, and leaf nitrogen content were measured. We found that stomatal size, mesophyll cell size (MCS), and mesophyll porosity were positively correlated and that the surface areas of mesophyll cells and chloroplasts facing intercellular air spaces were positively correlated with both stomatal density and stomatal area per leaf area (SA). These results suggested that the developments of stomata and mesophyll cells are highly correlated among different crop species. Additionally, MCS was positively correlated with leaf thickness and negatively correlated with leaf density and leaf mass per area, which indicated that MCS might play an important role in leaf structural investments and physiological functions among species. In summary, this study illustrates the correlations between stomatal and mesophyll structures, and it highlights the importance of considering the covariations among leaf traits with the intent of improving photosynthesis and iWUE.  aPublisher supplied data  a32172103cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2021ZKPY017cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3achloroplasts 3acrops 3agas exchange 3agrowth chambers 3aleaf area 3aleaf density 3aleaf development 3aleaf nitrogen content 3aleaf thickness 3amesophyll 3aphotosynthesis 3aporosity 3aspecific leaf weight1 aYang, Yuhan1 aZhu, Lele1 aRen, Xifeng1 aPeng, Shaobing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1696-94091 aLi, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3595-66730 tPlanta.g2022 Aug., v. 256, no. 2 p.39-39dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-022-03956-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04318naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245011100211500002200322520227800344592002802622650002102650650002502671650001002696650002702706650002102733650001402754650001902768650001602787650001102803650001502814650001402829650001802843650001702861650001702878650001102895650001402906650002002920650001502940650001402955650001902969650001502988650002003003650001803023650002003041650001803061650002503079650000903104653002903113653001403142653001903156653002003175653001003195700002703205700001903232700002803251700002203279700002003301700002203321700005703343700003203400773009303432856008603525852000903611655001203620IND60630164120221119130737.0190401e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063016412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurducea, Marian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6142-438X10aBiosolids application improves mineral composition and phenolic profile of basil cultivated on eroded soil  aPre-press version  aA possible solution for improving the fertility of the eroded soils could be the use of biosolids because of their high content of organic matter (OM), micro- and macronutrients. However, limited information is available concerning the mineral nutrition, physiology, and synthesis of secondary compounds in plants in response to eroded soils and biosolids amendments. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess how cultivation of basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) in different soil types (eroded soil, biosolids, and eroded soil 75% + biosolids 25% v/v) would affect mineral composition of soil and plant tissue, yield, physiology, and synthesis of phenolic compounds in basil plants. Elemental analysis revealed that application of biosolids to the eroded soil increased the content of macro and micronutrients (phosphorus, (P) by 327%, magnesium (Mg) by 17%, copper (Cu) by 83%, zinc (Zn) by 1062%, and molybdenum (Mo) by 64%) in the substrate compared to the unfertilized control (growth medium). Biosolids had positive effects on gas exchange parameters (CO2 assimilation rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, and intercellular CO2 concentration) as well as chlorophyll fluorescence and chlorophyll content, while the eroded soil decreased these parameters, suggesting a photoinhibition stress effect on the photosystem II. Fresh yield was increased by 206% in plants grown on eroded soil + biosolids and decreased by 43% in those grown on eroded soil in comparison with the control. The synthesis of total phenolics and the antioxidant activity was higher in plants grown on eroded soil. Phenolic profiling of basil leaves revealed 17 compounds. Rosmarinic acid was the main phenolic compound and was higher in plants grown on eroded soil compared with all other treatments. The Zn bioconcentration factor ranged from 1.4 (biosolids) to 14.3 (control), while the Zn translocation factor ranged from 0.43 (eroded soil) to 0.86 (eroded soil + biosolids). This suggests that the investigated basil cultivar is tolerant to Zn, and biosolids fertilization can be used in biofortification of basil crop and products. Application of biosolids to eroded soil improved the mineral content of the substrate and had positive effects on basil yield and physiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOcimum basilicum 3aantioxidant activity 3abasil 3abioaccumulation factor 3abiofortification 3abiosolids 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorophyll 3acopper 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3aculture media 3aeroded soils 3agas exchange 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amineral content 3amolybdenum 3anutrition 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3aphotoinhibition 3aplant tissues 3arosmarinic acid 3asoil minerals 3astomatal conductance 3azinc 0aTreated sludge amendment 0anutrients 0aphotosynthesis 0arosmarinic acid 0ayield1 aJeliazkov, Valtcho D.,1 aLobiuc, Andrei1 aPintilie, Cosmin Adrian1 aVirgolici, Marian1 aSilion, Mihaela1 aAsandulesa, Mihai1 aBurducea, Ion1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7764-34321 aZamfirache, Maria-Magdalena0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Feb. 01, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03969naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245010600181300001600287520266200303592002802965650001202993650001203005650001403017650001503031650001703046650001703063650002303080650001403103650001503117650001103132650003003143653002103173653003203194653002203226653001703248653002003265700002003285700001803305773011903323856008403442852000903526655001203535IND60544901420221117065024.0160901e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054490142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmorosi, A.q(Alessandro),10aStepwise post-glacial transgression in the Rhône Delta area as revealed by high-resolution core data  ap. 314-326.  aIntegrated sedimentological and micropalaeontological (benthic foraminifers and ostracods) analyses of two continuous cores (40m and 50m long, respectively) recovered in the lower delta plain of modern Petit Rhône Delta, along with data from the previously studied Core SF, enable detailed reconstruction of the late Pleistocene–Holocene palaeoenvironmental evolution of the Rhône Delta system. Through identification of nine microfossil assemblages and with the aid of 28 radiocarbon dates, a high-resolution picture of stratigraphic architecture is offered for the first time for the entire post-glacial succession. Above late Pleistocene fluvial-channel gravels, a retrograding pattern of swamp and estuarine/bay deposits (lower transgressive systems tract — TST) is overlain by vertically stacked, late transgressive nearshore deposits (upper TST). This succession reflects the progressive landward migration of the palaeoshoreline driven by the rapid post-glacial sea-level rise, which took place in the study area between ca. 12 and 7cal ky BP. The following deceleration in sea-level rise (highstand phase) induced the onset of deltaic sedimentation, as evidenced by superposition of middle–late Holocene prodelta, delta-front and delta-plain deposits within the cored succession. At distal location the occurrence, within prodelta deposits, of a distinctive microfossil assemblage dominated by opportunistic benthic foraminifer Valvulineria bradyana marks the onset of the Rhône Delta mud-belt around 4cal ky BP. Identification and lateral tracking of six separate flooding surfaces within the TST enable the characterization of five short-term (millennial to sub millennial-scale) depositional cycles with distinctive transgressive–regressive internal architecture (T–R 1–5). The lower, transgressive portions of cycles 1–3 (11.8–9.8cal ky BP) mark abrupt shifts from freshwater to increasingly mixed, brackish-marine environments under conditions of rapid sea-level rise. In contrast, the upper, ‘regressive’ portions represent the filling of newly formed accommodation space via extensive crevasse to bay-head delta processes. Cycles 4 and 5 (9.8–8.2cal ky BP) and the uppermost transgressive deposit below the maximum flooding surface document three distinct landward shifts of the shoreline that took place under conditions of rapidly increasing sea-level rise. The vertical stacking of these millennial-scale cycles is interpreted to reflect the stratigraphic response to stepwise sea-level rise during the early Holocene. The youngest flooding surface may represent the sea-level signature of the 8.2ka climate event.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRetaria 3aclimate 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3amicrofossils 3apaleoecology 3aradiocarbon dating 3asea level 3ashorelines 3aswamps 3atransgressive segregation 0aSea-level change 0aTransgressive systems tract 0aMillennial cycles 0aRhône Delta 0aLate Quaternary1 aRossi, Veronica1 aVella, Claude0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 374 p.314-326dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03965naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245012100172520246300293592002802756650001602784650001402800650002502814650002002839650001902859650001402878650002302892650001302915650000902928650002202937650001902959650002102978650002302999650002003022650002703042650001703069650002503086650001103111651001703122653002003139653001903159653001503178653002303193700001603216700001703232773011703249856008403366852000903450655001203459IND60741857220221119193750.0210812e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074185722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1070292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachakaire, A.T.B.10aAssessing evapotranspiration and crop coefficients of potato in a semi-arid climate using Eddy Covariance techniques  aA correct estimation of crop coefficients (KC) is essential to assess water requirements of crops from weather variables and thereby optimize irrigation management. KC depends on crop type and varies with crop growth stage, and to a limited extent, with climate. KC values are often assumed to be transferable between locations and climates. KC values have not been determined yet for modern potato cultivars grown under South African, semi-arid climatic conditions. The objectives of this study were (i) to quantify evapotranspiration and water use efficiency (WUE) of potato crops in a semi-arid climate under irrigation, (ii) to estimate KC values for these crops at different growth stages, and (iii) to assess the usefulness of the Penman-Monteith equation to estimate evapotranspiration and irrigation requirements. An eddy covariance (ECV) system was used in potato fields planted with the variety Mondial in two production regions of South Africa: Limpopo (crop growing in winter) and North West (spring-summer crop). Additional sensors were added to the system to measure relative humidity, near surface soil temperature, solar radiation, rainfall and irrigation. Decagon 10 HS capacitance sensors installed at varying soil depths were used to measure the change in soil moisture content of the potato rooted zone. Accuracy of the ECV measurements was evaluated by following the energy balance closure method. Seasonal mean crop evapotranspiration (ETC) was 3.2 mm d⁻¹ for the crop in Limpopo and 5.7 mm d⁻¹ in North West. The reference evapotranspiration (ETO) correlated well with the daily patterns in ETC for most of the season. ETO thus serves as a useful indicator of ETC and can be used for irrigation scheduling of potato. Seasonal mean KC value was 0.99 for the crop in Limpopo and 0.78 in North West. While the KC value in Limpopo likely represented that for a crop free of water-stress, the crop growth in North West was likely somewhat limited by water availability. The winter crop had the highest WUE of 3.55 kg dry potato tuber m⁻³ of water evapotranspired, whilst WUE for the spring-summer crop was 3.03 kg m⁻³. This difference could be explained by differences in mean vapour pressure deficit between the growing seasons. To optimize WUE of potato growing in semi-arid, water scarce regions such as South Africa, it is advisable to grow crops in the coolest available growing season, outside the frost-prone period.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acultivars 3adevelopmental stages 3aeddy covariance 3aenergy balance 3aequations 3aevapotranspiration 3apotatoes 3arain 3arelative humidity 3asemiarid zones 3asoil temperature 3asoil water content 3asolar radiation 3avapor pressure deficit 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 3awinter 3aSouth Africa 0aPenman-Monteith 0aEnergy closure 0aIrrigation 0aSoil water balance1 aSteyn, J.M.1 aFranke, A.C.0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 255 p.107029-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1070293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03631naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245010300176300001100279520189000290592002802180596007102208596007102279596007702350596005702427650000802484650003202492650002602524650001002550650002402560650002302584650000902607650001702616650002602633650002302659650001602682650001602698650002902714650001302743700002602756700002202782700001902804700002002823700002402843700005802867773010802925856008303033852000903116655001203125IND60734283120221120231915.0220130e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073428312DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-021-01543-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlanrewaju, Ayokunle O.10aPilot evaluation of an enzymatic assay for rapid measurement of antiretroviral drug concentrations  ap. 77.  aOBJECTIVE: Maintaining adequate drug adherence is crucial to ensure the HIV prevention benefits of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We developed an enzymatic assay for rapidly measuring tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations—a metabolite that indicates long-term PrEP adherence. SETTING: The study was conducted at the Madison HIV Clinic at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. METHODS: We enrolled adults receiving standard oral PrEP, and individuals not receiving any antiretrovirals. We measured TFV-DP concentrations in diluted whole blood using our novel REverSe TRanscrIptase Chain Termination (RESTRICT) assay, based on inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme. Blood samples were diluted in water, DNA templates, nucleotides, RT, and intercalating dye added, and results measured with a fluorescence reader—stronger fluorescence indicated higher RT activity. We compared RESTRICT assay results to TFV-DP concentrations from matched dried blood spot samples measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) using ≥ 700 fmol/punch TFV-DP as a threshold for adequate adherence (≥ 4 doses/week). RESULTS: Among 18 adults enrolled, 4 of 7 participants receiving PrEP had TFV-DP levels ≥ 700 fmol/punch by LC–MS/MS. RESTRICT fluorescence correlated with LC–MS/MS measurements (r = − 0.845, p < 0.0001). Median fluorescence was 93.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 90.9 to 114) for samples < 700 fmol/punch and 54.4 (CI 38.0 to 72.0) for samples ≥ 700 fmol/punch. When calibrated to an a priori defined threshold of 82.7, RESTRICT distinguished both groups with 100% sensitivity and 92.9% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: This novel enzymatic assay for measuring HIV reverse transcriptase activity may be suitable for distinguishing TFV-DP concentrations in blood that correspond to protective PrEP adherence.  aPublisher supplied data  aR01AI136648cNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  aR21AI127200cNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  aR01EB022630cNational Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering  aF2019-Drain-7983cCoMotion, University of Washington 3aDNA 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aantiretroviral agents 3ablood 3aconfidence interval 3adisease prevention 3adyes 3afluorescence 3aliquid chromatography 3amedical facilities 3ametabolites 3anucleotides 3atandem mass spectrometry 3avirology1 aSullivan, Benjamin P.1 aBardon, Ashley R.1 aLo, Tiffany J.1 aCressey, Tim R.1 aPosner, Jonathan D.1 aDrain, Paul K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9569-40970 tVirology journal.g2021 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.77-77dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-021-01543-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245015300164520154600317592002801863650002901891650002801920650001801948650001301966650001101979650001901990650001002009650001102019650001202030650001102042650001702053650001102070650001402081650001802095650001602113650001702129650002302146651001802169700002502187700002402212773012002236856007302356852000902429655001202438IND60707840920221121174001.0200821e20200805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070784092DNAL7 a10.3390/f110808462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRégnière, Jacques,10aModeling Climatic Influences on Three Parasitoids of Low-Density Spruce Budworm Populations. Part 1: Tranosema rostrale (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae)  aDespite their importance as mortality factors of many insects, the detailed biology and ecology of parasitoids often remain unknown. To gain insights into the spatiotemporal biology of insect parasitoids in interaction with their hosts, modeling of temperature-dependent development, reproduction, and survival is a powerful tool. In this first article of a series of three, we modeled the biology of Tranosema rostrale at the seasonal level with a three-species individual-based model that took into account the temperature-dependent performance of the parasitoid and two of its hosts. The predicted activity of the first adult parasitoid generation closely matched the seasonal pattern of attack on the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). The model predicted 1–4 full generations of T. rostrale per year in eastern North America. The generations were generally well synchronized with the occurrence of larvae of a probable alternate host, the obliquebanded leafroller Choristoneura rosaceana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), which could be used as an overwintering host. Spatial differences in predicted performance were caused by complex interactions of life-history traits and synchrony with the overwintering host, which led to a better overall performance in environments at higher elevations or along the coasts. Under a climate warming scenario, regions of higher T. rostrale performance were predicted to generally move northward, making especially lower elevations in the southern range less suitable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChoristoneura fumiferana 3aChoristoneura rosaceana 3aIchneumonidae 3aaltitude 3acoasts 3aglobal warming 3ahosts 3aimagos 3ainsects 3alarvae 3alife history 3amodels 3amortality 3aoverwintering 3aparasitoids 3areproduction 3aseasonal variation 3aNorth America1 aSeehausen, M.

This communication presents a new mathematical model to calculate the saturation pressures of crude oils as a function of temperature, hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon reservoir fluid compositions, and characteristics of the heptane-plus fraction. The model was developed and tested using a total set of 130 experimentally measured compositions and saturation pressures of crude oil samples from different geographical locations covering wide ranges of crude oil properties and reservoir temperatures. In-depth comparative studies have been carried out between this new model and five well known predictive models for estimation of saturation pressure of crude oils. The results show that the developed model is more accurate and reliable with the average absolute relative deviation of 4.7% and correlation coefficient of 0.992. In addition, it is shown that the proposed model correctly captures the physical trend of changing the saturation pressure as a function of the input variables. Finally, the applicability domains of the proposed model and quality of the existing experimental data were examined by outlier diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeographical Locations 3acorrelation 3adiagnostic techniques 3amathematical models 3aoil fields 3apetroleum 3atemperature1 aShokrollahi, Amin1 aArabloo, Milad1 aGharagheizi, Farhad1 aMohammadi, Amir H.0 tFuel processing technology.g2013 Nov., v. 115 p.201-214dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2013.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04033naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015000170500002200320520197800342592002802320650002402348650002002372650001202392650001702404650002502421650000902446650001202455650001002467650002102477650001002498650002402508650002602532650001802558650001102576650001702587650001802604650001902622650001102641650001402652650001402666650001902680650002002699650002002719650001002739650001302749650001702762650001402779650001802793653001602811653002302827653002502850653001302875653002302888653001902911700001802930700003102948700003002979700002003009700002203029700002803051700002503079700001903104773009303123856008603216852000903302655001203311IND60630164220221119130753.0190401e20190202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063016422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoussaa, Faten10aCombined effects of cropping system and harvest date determine quality and nutritional value of pomegranate fruits (Punica granatum L. cv. Gabsi)  aPre-press version  aThe oasis environment, where Tunisian pomegranates are cultivated simultaneously with several crops, was shown to fulfill ecological functions. Few studies related to the effects of environmental factors on pomegranate pre-harvest quality have been carried out, and even less have focused on the interaction between oasis environment and harvest date. This study aims to evaluate the physico-chemical and nutritional properties of pomegranate fruits cultivated under and outside oasis in order to determine the most accurate harvest indices and harvesting date in relation with cropping system. Results revealed that oasis environment was more favorable to produce large sized-fruits with high aril yield and high juice content compared to full sun conditions. Oasis pomegranates exhibited high total anthocyanin content, high hydrophilic antioxidant activity, high level of magnesium, potassium and manganese content. The visual colour of fruits and arils as well as TSS/TA ratio were found the most reliable maturity indices for taking harvest decision of pomegranate fruits. A better red coloration of fruit and arils associated with a balance between sugar content and acidity as well as high nutritional value (high mineral contents particularly Mg, K, Mn, high flavonoid and anthocyanin contents) of pomegranates harvested from different orchards at mid-october (D3) indicated their optimal use at this stage. Nevertheless, the full sun exposed fruits harvested at beginning of October (D2), characterized by pink/pink reddish colour, high TSS content and (TSS/TA) ratio and high calcium content, were considered as matured (commercial maturity) and would be ready for harvesting. Final fruit quality depends on both environmental factors and maturity stage. Based on the identified indices, Gabsi pomegranate harvesting could be started in regular full sun exposed plantations, then in orchards under date palm trees and at least one week later in traditional oases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aPunica granatum 3aacidity 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aaril 3acalcium 3acolor 3acropping systems 3acrops 3aecological function 3aenvironmental factors 3afruit quality 3afruits 3aharvest date 3aharvest index 3ahydrophilicity 3ajuices 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amaturity stage 3amineral content 3anutritive value 3aoases 3aorchards 3apomegranates 3apotassium 3asugar content 0aPomegranate 0acultivation system 0aantioxidant activity 0aminerals 0aphenolic compounds 0afruit maturity1 aZaouay, Faten1 aBurlo-Carbonell, Francisco1 aNuncio-Jáuregui, Nallely1 aGmati, Mahassen1 aArbi, Boubaker El1 aMelgarejo, P.q(Pablo),1 aHernandez, Francisca1 aMars, Messaoud0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Feb. 02, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245017200165500001400337520144400351592002801795650002301823650002801846650001301874650000801887650001501895650001701910650001601927650001201943650001201955650001001967650001001977650001401987650000902001650001002010650001102020650001302031650001902044650001302063650001502076650001502091650002102106700002502127700002902152700002402181700002902205700003002234700005502264773012602319856007702445852000902522655001202531IND60721584020221121043239.0201224e20201207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072158402DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox91212392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelyi, Alexei  A.14aThe Resistance of Drosophila melanogaster to Oxidative, Genotoxic, Proteotoxic, Osmotic Stress, Infection, and Starvation Depends on Age According to the Stress Factor  aNAL-light  aWe studied how aging affects the ability of Drosophila melanogaster to tolerate various types of stress factors. Data were obtained on the resistance of D. melanogaster to oxidative and genotoxic (separately paraquat, Fe³⁺, Cu²⁺, and Zn²⁺ ions), proteotoxic (hyperthermia, Cd²⁺ ions), and osmotic (NaCl) stresses, starvation, and infection with the pathological Beauveria bassiana fungus at different ages. In all cases, we observed a strong negative correlation between age and stress tolerance. The largest change in the age-dependent decline in survival occurred under oxidative and osmotic stress. In most experiments, we observed that young Drosophila females have higher stress resistance than males. We checked whether it is possible to accurately assess the biological age of D. melanogaster based on an assessment of stress tolerance. We have proposed a new approach for assessing a biological age of D. melanogaster using a two-parameter survival curve model. For the model, we used an algorithm that evaluated the quality of age prediction for different age and gender groups. The best predictions were obtained for females who were exposed to CdCl₂ and ZnCl₂ with an average error of 0.32 days and 0.36 days, respectively. For males, the best results were observed for paraquat and NaCl with an average error of 0.61 and 0.68 days, respectively. The average accuracy for all stresses in our model was 1.73 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aaccuracy 3aage 3aalgorithms 3aantioxidants 3acorrelation 3adecline 3afemales 3afever 3afungi 3ainfection 3aions 3amales 3amodels 3amutagens 3aosmotic stress 3aparaquat 3aprediction 3astarvation 3astress tolerance1 aAlekseev, Alexey  A.1 aFedintsev, Alexander  Y.1 aBalybin, Stepan  N.1 aProshkina, Ekaterina  N.1 aShaposhnikov, Mikhail  V.1 aMoskalev, A.

The as-synthesized C-QDs with a quantum yield (QY) as high as 52% were characterized by UV, FT-IR, TEM, XPS and fluorescence spectroscope. TEM results show that C-QDs are mono-dispersed spherical particles and the diameter distribution of C-QDs is 2.8±1.1nm. The extraordinary photoluminescent properties and low cytotoxicity of C-QDs were obtained through optical property characterization and cytotoxicity assay. In addition, we found that the as-prepared C-QDs had a high affinity for Fe3+ ions and the response toward Fe3+ ions was highly linear (R2=0.997) over the concentration range from 2 to 50μM, which could provide an effective platform for portable detection of Fe3+ ions. Also, it is demonstrated that the photoluminescent C-QDs display hypotoxicity and are biocompatible for use as biosensors in living cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abiosensors 3acarbon quantum dots 3acitric acid 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence 3aions 3airon 3aphotoluminescence 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aCarbon quantum dots 0aHydrothermal 0aHigh quantum yield 0aFe3+ ions detection 0aBioimaging1 aZhou, Zhulong1 aGong, Aihua1 aZhang, Yan1 aLi, Qijun0 tTalanta.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 143 p.107-113dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245008500176300001600261520183400277592002802111650002502139650001102164650002302175650001002198650001902208650002302227650001002250650002502260650001402285650002702299650001702326653002702343653001602370653002402386653002202410653001402432700002602446700002702472773014302499856008402642852000902726655001202735IND60623870920221117220201.0190426e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062387092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anres.2018.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiriyawattana, Porntip10aEffects of drum drying on physical and antioxidant properties of riceberry flour  ap. 445-450.  aThe effects of drum drying on the physical and antioxidant properties of pregelatinzed riceberry flour were investigated. The drum drying temperature was varied (110 °C, 120 °C and 130 °C) and unheated riceberry flour was used as the control. The results showed that all pregelatinized riceberry flour samples had lower (p ≤ 0.05) L* value, but higher (p ≤ 0.05) a* and b* values than the control. The water absorption index and swelling power of all pregelatinized riceberry flour samples were also significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher than those of the control. The results from rapid visco analysis indicated that the pasting time, pasting temperature, peak viscosity, trough viscosity, final viscosity and set back of riceberry flour decreased (p ≤ 0.05) after drum drying. Moreover, the total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity, as measured using 2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl and 2,2′azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiozoline-6-sulfonic acid) disodium salt radical assays, respectively, also decreased (p ≤ 0.05) after drum drying. Such changes were more evident with increased drum drying temperature in the range 110–130 °C. In addition, increasing the drum drying temperature led to poorer stability to withstand the thermal treatment and stress than in pregelatinized riceberry flour. The results suggested that special attention should be given to the drum drying temperature as it affects not only the physical but also the antioxidant properties of the pregelatinized riceberry flour. Pregelatinized riceberry flour produced using drum drying at 110 °C could be applied to formulate an instant soup product because it had high values for water absorption capacity, total phenolic content and antioxidant activity and was completely gelatinized and stable against thermal treatment and stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3adrying 3adrying temperature 3aflour 3aheat treatment 3apasting properties 3asoups 3aswelling (materials) 3aviscosity 3awater binding capacity 3awater uptake 0aAntioxidant properties 0aDrum drying 0aPhysical properties 0aPregelatinization 0aRiceberry1 aSuwonsichon, Suntaree1 aSuwonsichon, Thongchai0 tAgriculture and natural resources.g2018 Oct., v. 52, no. 5 p.445-450dElsevier B.V.aKasetsart UniversitywJournal:23308x2452-316X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anres.2018.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005800138245013200196300001800328500001900346500002000365520190200385592002802287650003202315650002902347650001102376650003502387650001802422650001102440650002302451651002002474773012302494856007202617852000902689655001202698IND60711247120221120065334.0200919e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071124712DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.33422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopov, Igorʹ,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2564-329414aThe impact of publication on freshwater pearl mussel conservation: To conceal or to reveal the location of threatened habitats?  ap. 1816-1820.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a1.The freshwater pearl mussel, Margaritifera margaritifera, is a threatened species. One of the threats faced by this species is direct extermination by poachers, and therefore some researchers conceal information on the locations of pearl mussel habitats. For example, some researchers do not publish the names of the rivers where pearl mussels occur, whereas other researchers do. 2.Concealing the names of rivers containing pearl mussels makes them unknown not only to potential offenders but also to administrators, nature conservation practitioners, and ordinary citizens. As a result, no protection measures are undertaken, which is all the more regrettable as damage to pearl mussel habitats can occur accidentally. 3.Concealing details of the location of pearl mussel habitats in publications has an adverse impact on the work of specialists, as they do not have access to enough information to study and analyse the biology and distribution of these molluscs. 4.One river with pearl mussels in the Gulf of Finland was initially described anonymously (as ‘River B’). Unfortunately, the river was subject to severe human impact, and the largest aggregation of pearl mussels was almost exterminated in the process of constructing a new electric supply line. 5.Concealing information on pearl mussel habitats in the Russian section of the Baltic Sea basin was also shown to have been a poor decision. Although the threat from potential poachers was insignificant because of the low commercial value of pearl mussels, the authorities remained uninformed about the existence of valuable habitats. 6.The question of whether the locations of pearl mussel habitats should be concealed or revealed in scientific publications does not have an unambiguous answer and should be considered on a case‐to‐case basis; however, the cases for which disclosure is reasonable seem to be more numerous.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMargaritifera margaritifera 3aanthropogenic activities 3abasins 3anatural resources conservation 3apearl mussels 3arivers 3athreatened species 3aGulf of Finland0 tAquatic conservation.g2020 Sept., v. 30, no. 9 p.1816-1820dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51367x1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.33423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245014800189300001800337520166400355592002802019650002202047650001402069650001402083650002602097650001102123650001602134650001802150650001202168650003002180650001402210650002602224650002602250650003802276650003302314650000902347650002302356650001602379650003002395650001802425651001102443700002102454700002002475700001902495700001902514700001902533700002202552700002002574773009102594856008402685852000902769655001202778IND60088238520221119013953.0141102e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008823852DNAL7 a220145622pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2011.09.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoulaud, Romain10aIn situ feeding assay with Gammarus fossarum (Crustacea): Modelling the influence of confounding factors to improve water quality biomonitoring  ap. 6417-6429.  aIn situ feeding assays implemented with transplanted crustacean gammarids have been claimed as promising tools for the diagnostic assessment of water quality. Nevertheless the implementation of such methodologies in biomonitoring programs is still limited. This is explained by the necessity to improve the reliability of these bioassays. The present study illustrates how modelling the influence of confounding factors could allow to improve the interpretation of in situ feeding assay with Gammarus fossarum. We proceeded in four steps: (i) we quantified the influence of body size, temperature and conductivity on feeding rate in laboratory conditions; (ii) based on these laboratory findings, we computed a feeding inhibition index, which proved to be robust to environmental conditions and allowed us to define a reference statistical distribution of feeding activity values through the data compilation of 24 in situ assays among diverse reference stations at different seasons; (iii) we tested the sensitivity of the feeding assay using this statistical framework by performing 41 in situ deployments in contaminated stations presenting a large range of contaminant profiles; and (iv) we illustrated in two site-specific studies how the proposed methodology improved the diagnosis of water quality by preventing false-positive and false-negative cases mainly induced by temperature confounding influence. Interestingly, the implementation of the developed protocol could permit to assess water quality without following an upstream/downstream procedure and to compare assays performed at different seasons as part of large-scale biomonitoring programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGammarus fossarum 3abioassays 3abody size 3aenvironmental factors 3amodels 3atemperature 3awater quality 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assayxmethods 2aBody Size 2aCrustaceaxphysiology 2aElectric Conductivity 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aTemperature 2aWater Pollutionxanalysis 2aWater Quality 0aFrance1 aGeffard, Olivier1 aXuereb, Benoît1 aLacaze, Emilie1 aQuéau, Hervé1 aGarric, Jeanne1 aCharles, Sandrine1 aChaumot, Arnaud0 tWater research.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 45, no. 19 p.6417-6429dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2011.09.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011400167300001600281520111700297592002801414650001401442650001701456650001301473650001101486650001201497650002001509650001301529650003701542700001701579700001801596700001701614700001401631700001701645700001901662773008601681856008401767852000901851655001201860IND60602976420221116230129.0180712e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060297642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, QingYun10aAtomic scale investigations of catalyst and catalytic graphitization in a silicon and titanium doped graphite  ap. 252-261.  aThe catalysts and catalytic graphitization mechanisms in the graphite blocks doped by silicon (Si) and titanium (Ti) have been systematically investigated at the atomic scale by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Few silicon carbide (SiC) crystallites would be residual and coexisted with titanium carbide (TiC) crystallites with two forms due to the low-energy interface between them, inhibiting the escape of the SiC. Three kinds of residual TiC coexisted with the graphite, which correspond to two distinct catalytic mechanisms. Besides the well-acknowledged dissolution–precipitation mechanism for TiC catalytic graphitization, the TiC formation–decomposition mechanism has been experimentally validated for the first time. Extensive investigations on the interfaces between TiC and graphite crystallites reveal that the orientation of the (111) planes of TiC relative to the interface essentially influence the growth modes and basal plane stacking sequence of graphite, and the related model has been proposed to decode the precipitation mechanism of hexagonal and rhombohedral graphite.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acrystallites 3agraphene 3amodels 3asilicon 3asilicon carbide 3atitanium 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aFeng, Zhihai1 aLiu, Zhanjun,1 aGuo, QuanGui1 aHu, ZiJun1 aHe, LianLong1 aYe, Hengqiang,0 tCarbon.g2015 July, v. 88 p.252-261dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01324naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009200165300001400257520048400271592002800755650002400783650001500807650001400822650001400836651001100850773009500861856008100956852000901037655001201046IND60480033920221120053943.0160125e20130122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048003392DNAL7 a10.2478/v10182-012-0030-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZook, Douglas10aDynamic "Symbionts" Linked over Two Centuries: A Tribute to Lynn Margulis (1938–2011)  ap. 9-127.  aOpening keynote presentation at the 7ᵗʰ InternationalSymbiosis Congress (Kraków, Poland, July 2012), whichwas dedicated to the memory of Lynn Margulis, outstandingscientist.

The results of batch adsorption experiment suggested that there is no substantial difference between As(III) and As(V) adsorption. Both of them are affected by the solution pH significantly, but insensitive to the ionic strength. The speciation analysis indicated that more than 95 % of the total As(III) in aqueous solution is oxidized into As(V) in the presence of AWR, while barely oxidized in the presence of HAWR. It proves that without pre-oxidation, AWR can oxidize and adsorb As(III), simultaneously. The properties of the biosorbent were characterized by various techniques including scanning electronic microscopy-energy dispersive spectrometer, Fourier transform infrared spectra analysis, inductive coupled plasma emission spectrometer and Zeta potential detection. The results suggested that typical metals including Mn, Fe and Al enrich in the morphology of metal (hydro) oxide over the surface of AWR, originally. Based on the nature of the biosorbent and arsenic besides the adsorption and oxidation performances, the metal (hydro) oxides are proved as the essential role to drive the adsorption and oxidation. The proof is that with the metal (hydro) oxides denuded, as the contrast of AWR, HAWR loses its capability of adsorption and oxidation for As(III), totally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlligator (Alligatoridae) 3aAlternanthera philoxeroides 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3aaqueous solutions 3aarsenic 3abiosorbents 3aionic strength 3airon 3amanganese 3aoxidation 3aoxides 3apH 3azeta potential1 aTao, Weihua1 aSun, Cheng0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2015 Oct., v. 226, no. 10 p.344-344dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-015-2618-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245020100168520103900369592002801408650001501436650001201451650003501463650001901498650001501517650001901532650001601551650001901567650001901586650002601605650001101631653002201642653001501664653000901679653004901688653002101737653003001758700001301788700001301801700001301814700001801827773009901845856008701944852000902031655001202040IND60759645320221122153955.0220110e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075964532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1318412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Manlu10aUltrasensitive determination and non-chromatographic speciation of inorganic arsenic in foods and water by photochemical vapor generation-ICPMS using CdS/MIL-100(Fe) as adsorbent and photocatalyst  aThe determination of inorganic arsenic species in real samples can be particularly challenging due to their trace levels and the interferences arising from sample matrix. Normally, the speciation analysis necessitates chromatographic separation. Herein, we report a novel method for the ultrasensitive detection and non-chromatographic speciation of inorganic arsenic by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), utilizing CdS/MIL-100(Fe) composites as an adsorbent and photocatalyst. The synthesized CdS/MIL-100(Fe) could completely adsorb As(V) and As(III) within 5 and 105 min, respectively. Following filtration and re-suspension in formic acid, the adsorbed As(III)/As(V) were reduced to arsine (AsH₃) under UV irradiation and swept to ICP-MS for detection. The limits of detection were found to be 1.7 ng L⁻¹ (without preconcentration) and 0.11 ng L⁻¹ (after 20-fold preconcentration). The method was successfully applied to the determination of trace inorganic arsenic in various food and water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3achromatography 3afiltration 3afood chemistry 3aformic acid 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotochemistry 3aultraviolet radiation 3avapors 0aInorganic arsenic 0aSpeciation 0aFood 0aInductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 0aPreconcentration 0aChemical vapor generation1 aHe, Juan1 aLuo, Jin1 aHu, Jing1 aHou, Xiandeng0 tFood chemistry.g2022 May 01, v. 375 p.131841-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1318413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245010300169300001600272520120500288592002801493650002201521650002501543650002201568650001501590650002001605650001901625650001301644653002401657653002001681653001801701653001601719653002901735773015201764856007801916852000901994655001202003IND60522870020221121055518.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052287002DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1993-3-4202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiardi, Maria Teresa10aSignificance of Photosystem II Core Phosphorylation Heterogeneity for the Herbicide-Binding Domain  ap. 241-245.  aIn recent papers the heterogeneous nature of photosystem (PS) II core phosphorylation has been revealed (Giardi et al., BBRC 176, 1298 -1305 (1991); Plant Physiol. 100, 1948 -1954 (1992)). In this paper the action of endogenous and exogenous phosphatases both on the distribution of phosphorylated PS II core populations and on herbicide-binding activity in photosystem II preparations from Spinacia oleracea L. has been investigated. The results indicate that these phosphatases modify the photosystem II core phosphorylation heterogeneity at a different level. Dark incubation causes a partial dephosphorylation of D₁ and D₂ proteins by endogenous phosphatase(s) and changes the relative distribution of phosphorylated photosystem II core populations, while the action of the alkaline phosphatase leads to extensive dephosphorylation and to the detachment of PsbH protein from the photosystem II core. Dephosphorylation by the two alternative methods results in a differential modification of herbicide-binding activity. It is suggested that photosystem II heterogeneity with respect to the herbicide action, observed in vivo, could be a consequence of PS II core phosphorylation heterogeneity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aalkaline phosphatase 3adephosphorylation 3aherbicides 3aphosphorylation 3aphotosystem II 3aproteins 0aPhotosystem II Core 0aPhosphorylation 0aHeterogeneity 0aPhosphatase 0aHerbicide-Binding Domain0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 48, no. 3-4 p.241-245dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1993-3-4203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245009200171300001600263500001400279520134800293592002801641650001301669650001201682650001401694650001701708650001601725650001001741650001101751653001701762653001701779653001601796653002701812653003301839653001301872700001601885773013101901856007802032852000902110655001202119IND60700686020221121100300.0200702e20200225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070068602DNAL7 a10.1093/jmammal/gyz2142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, Fabio Andrade10aMorphometric analysis of skull shape reveals unprecedented diversity of African Canidae  ap. 349-360.  aNAL-light  aWe conducted a geometric morphometric analysis to investigate the morphological variation of the golden wolf, Canis lupaster, and to clarify the morphological and taxonomic affinities of different taxa of the genera Canis and Lupulella. We suggest that the variation observed within the complex of Canis lupaster may be incompatible with what would be expected for a single species. We hypothesize that the nominal form C. l. soudanicus is a synonym of Lupulella adusta rather than being part of the golden wolf complex. The subspecies C. l. bea has a generalized jackal morphology (i.e., clusters together with L. mesomelas and C. aureus) and C. l. lupaster occupies an intermediate morphospace position, between jackal-like forms and wolf-like forms. These results contrast with previously published molecular analysis in which mitochondrial data failed to identify differences among golden wolf populations, and nuclear evidence points to the existence of groups that are incompatible with those recovered by morphological analysis. Regarding other jackals, our results depict the absence of morphological overlap between L. m. mesomelas and L. m. schmidti and no differences between putative subspecies of L. adusta. We call attention to the need for more integrative approaches to solve the taxonomic questions in various African Canidae.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3ajackals 3amammalogy 3amitochondria 3amorphometry 3askull 3awolves 0aCanis anthus 0aCanis aureus 0aCanis lupus 0ageometric morphometric 0alinear discriminant analysis 0ataxonomy1 aTeta, Pablo0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2020 Feb. 25, v. 101, no. 2 p.349-360dAmerican Society of MammalogistswJournal:11623x0022-23727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyz2143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009100165300001800256520165700274592002801931650001301959650001301972650001101985650001901996650001902015650002302034650001102057650001902068650000902087650001102096651001602107651001002123700001902133773012102152856008402273852000902357655001202366IND60123159320221118063834.0150325e20141117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012315932DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2014.9753792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabu, C.A.10aVariability and mechanisms of vertical distribution of aerosols over the Indian region  ap. 7691-7705.  aThe present study investigates the seasonal variability in the vertical distribution of aerosol over the Indian region and its surroundings, and the possible mechanisms in the atmosphere that give rise to vertical transport of the aerosols. During boreal summer months, the aerosols reach a higher altitude of above 5 km over the Indian region. In the winter season, especially during December, January, and February, the aerosols remain at low levels of the atmosphere, extending to about 3 km. The low-level atmospheric conditions are favourable for lifting of aerosols associated with the organized convection in the atmosphere during the months from May to September. The shifting of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) towards the northern hemisphere and the monsoon activity associated with it makes the atmosphere turbulent over the region during the period. The vorticity and convergence patterns are favourable for the vertical transport of aerosols during the period from May to November. High vertical wind shear, which leads to the generation of turbulence during the monsoon season, enhances the mixing of aerosols in the atmosphere and supports the lifting motion. Over the Arabian Sea, during the summer months, the aerosols reach a higher altitude of about 6 km. The production of marine aerosols is increased by the monsoon winds over the sea, and the turbulent atmosphere lifts the particles to high altitudes. The transportation of dust aerosols from west and northwest parts is found at high altitudes towards the destination regions in north and south India. This also dominates the total aerosol content over the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aaltitude 3amixing 3amonsoon season 3aremote sensing 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3aturbulent flow 3awind 3awinter 3aArabian Sea 3aIndia1 aSivaprasad, P.0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2014 Nov. 17, v. 35, no. 22 p.7691-7705dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2014.9753793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04301naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245015200170500002200322520254800344592002802892650002202920650001202942650001302954650001302967650001302980650001402993650000903007650001603016650002003032650001503052650001303067650003003080650002603110650001903136650002203155650001403177650002403191650001303215650001503228650001203243653001603255653001303271653001903284653002803303700002303331700002303354700002003377700003603397700002303433700001403456700005803470773009003528856008403618852000903702655001203711IND60666218220221122060909.0190913e20190831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066621822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2019.1035112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Roy, Nathalie10aGuinea fowl eggshell quantitative proteomics yield new findings related to its unique structural characteristics and superior mechanical properties  aPre-press version  aThe Guinea fowl eggshell is a bioceramic material with the remarkable mechanical property of being twice as strong as the chicken eggshell. Both eggshells are composed of 95% calcite and 3.5% organic matrix, which control its structural organization. Chicken eggshell is made of columnar calcite crystals arranged vertically. In the Guinea fowl, the same structure is observed in its inner half, followed by a dramatic change in crystal size and orientation in the outer region. Guinea fowl eggshell is thicker than chicken eggshell. Both structure and shell thickness confer a superior resistance to breakage compared to eggshells of other bird species. To understand the underlying mechanisms controlling the structural organization of this highly resistant material, we used quantitative proteomics to analyze the protein composition of the Guinea fowl eggshell organic matrix at key stages of the biomineralization process. We identified 149 proteins, which were compared to other bird eggshell proteomes and analyzed their potential functions. Among the 149 proteins, 9 are unique to Guinea fowl, some are involved in the control of the calcite precipitation (Lysozyme, Ovocleidin-17-like, Ovocleidin-116 and Ovalbumin), 61 are only found in the zone of microstructure shift and 17 are more abundant in this zone.The avian eggshell is a critical physical barrier to protect the contents of this autonomous reproductive enclosure from physical and microbial assault. The Guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) eggshell exhibits a unique microstructure (texture), which confers exceptional mechanical properties compared to eggshells of other species. In order to understand the mechanisms that regulate formation of this texture in the Guinea fowl eggshell, we performed comparative quantitative proteomics at key stages of shell mineralization and particularly during the dramatic shift in shell microstructure. We demonstrate that the Guinea fowl eggshell proteome comprises 149 proteins, of which 61 were specifically associated with the change in size and orientation of calcite crystals. Comparative proteomics analysis with eggshell of other bird species leads to new insights into the biomineralization process. Moreover, our data represents a list of organic compounds as potential additives to regulate material design for industrial fabrication of ceramics. This information also provides molecular markers for efficient genomic selection of chicken strains to lay eggs with improved shell mechanical properties for enhanced food safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomineralization 3acalcite 3aceramics 3achickens 3acrystals 3aegg shell 3aeggs 3afood safety 3agenetic markers 3aguineafowl 3alysozyme 3amarker-assisted selection 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3aorganic compounds 3aovalbumin 3aprotein composition 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3atexture 0aGuinea fowl 0aEggshell 0aOrganic matrix 0aQuantitative proteomics1 aCombes-Soia, Lucie1 aBrionne, Aurélien1 aLabas, Valérie1 aRodriguez-Navarro, Alejandro B.1 aHincke, Maxwell T.1 aNys, Yves1 aGautron, Joël1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7800-05780 tJournal of proteomics.g2019 Aug. 31, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2019.1035113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245012600167300001600293520135200309592002801661650003001689650002201719650001701741650002501758650001101783650001201794650001301806653002201819653001301841653002201854653002501876653001901901700001801920700001801938700002001956773015201976856007802128852000902206655001202215IND60522870320221121050901.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052287032DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1993-3-4232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrofts, Antony R .10aKinetics of Electron Transfer between QA and QB in Wild Type and Herbicide-Resistant Mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  ap. 259-266.  aWe have investigated the electron transfer kinetics for reduction of plastoquinone by photo­ system II in six mutant strains of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by following the decay of the high fluorescence state after flash activation, and compared the separate reactions of the two-electron gate with those of a wild type strain. By analysis of the electron transfer kinetics, and separate measurement of the equilibrium constant for stabilization of the bound semiquinone after one flash, we have been able to deconvolute the contributions of rate constants and equilibrium constants for plastoquinone binding and electron transfer to the overall process. Two mutations, S 264 A and A 251 V, led to a marked slowing of kinetics for reduction of plastoquinone to the bound semiquinone. In S 264 A , the second electron transfer was also slower, but was normal in A 251 V. In mutant G 256 D , the electron transfer kinetics were normal after the first flash, but slowed after the second. In mutants L 257 F , V 219 I, and F 255 Y , the electron transfer kinetics after both flashes were similar to those in wild type. We discuss the results in terms of a model which provides a description of the mechanism of the two-electron gate in terms of measured kinetic and equilibrium constants, and we give values for these parameters in all strains tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence 3aherbicide resistance 3amodels 3amutants 3amutation 0aElectron Transfer 0aKinetics 0aTwo-Electron Gate 0aHerbicide Resistance 0aPhotosystem II1 aBaroli, Irene1 aKramer, David1 aTaoka, Shinichi0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 48, no. 3-4 p.259-266dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:21135x0939-50757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1993-3-4233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010600168300001600274520101600290592002801306650002101334650001101355650001101366650002501377650001301402650001801415650001901433650001501452650001001467650002101477653002101498653002001519653002801539653002701567653003401594700001701628700001401645700001501659773010801674856008601782852000901868655001201877IND60540935420221120202023.0190318e20151210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054093542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chuchu12aA three-dimensionally chitin nanofiber/carbon nanotube hydrogel network for foldable conductive paper  ap. 309-313.  aWe reported a highly conductive nanocomposite made with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and chitin nanofibers (ChNFs). The MWCNTs were dispersed into ChNFs by the simple process of vacuum-filtration, forming a three-dimensional network structure. In this approach, MWCNT acted as a filler to introduce electron channel paths throughout the ChNF skeleton. And then, a hybrid hydrogel system (20wt.% NaOH, −18°C) was applied to prepare the ChNF/MWCNT gel-film followed with drying process. It is found that the resultant ChNF/MWCNT gel-film exposed much more MWCNT areas forming denser structure due to the shrinking of ChNFs after the gelation treatment. Compared with ChNF/MWCNT film, the one treated under hydrogel system (ChNF/MWCNT gel-film) exhibited almost twice higher conductivity (9.3S/cm for 50wt.% MWCNTs in gel-film; whereas 4.7S/cm for 50wt.% MWCNTs in film). Moreover, the facile and low-cost of this conductive paper may have great potential in development of foldable electronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3achitin 3adrying 3aelectronic equipment 3agelation 3ahydrocolloids 3ananocomposites 3ananofibers 3apaper 3asodium hydroxide 0aChitin nanofiber 0aCarbon nanotube 0aHighly conductive paper 0aHybrid hydrogel system 0aThree dimensional nanonetwork1 aYang, Chuang1 aLi, Suiyi1 aLi, Dagang0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 Dec. 10, v. 134 p.309-313dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013900172300001600311520141500327592002801742650002301770650002101793650001301814650001301827650001101840650001501851700002701866700002101893700001501914700001401929700002601943773008601969856008402055852000902139655001202148IND60602976920221116230544.0180712e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060297692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.02.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSonia, Farjana J.10aInsight into the mechanical integrity of few-layers graphene upon lithiation/delithiation via in situ monitoring of stress development  ap. 206-214.  aBy monitoring the stress developments in situ during lithiation/delithiation of few layers graphene films, we report here for the first time an interesting observation of stress release/reversal just within the potential ranges corresponding to the co-existences of pristine graphene, dilute stage I and stage IV Li-graphite intercalation compounds (Li-GICs). This, along with supporting observations related to the presence of cracks in the graphene films upon electrochemical cycling and enhanced ID/IG ratio in Raman spectra recorded upon cycling primarily within the potential regimes corresponding to the stress release/reversal, indicate possible occurrences of mechanical/structural degradation mainly during the initial stages of lithiation and later stages of delithiation. This observation is being supported by a geometric model which estimates the strains induced in the individual graphene layers at the interfaces between the different Li-GICs at the various stages of lithiation; and as a function of distance from the current collector. On a slightly different note, the experimentally recorded magnitude of net lithiation induced reversible in-plane stress development was ∼11GPa. This is in fair agreement with that expected based on the theoretical dilation of ∼1% along the graphene layers upon lithiation as per the classical Li-intercalation mechanism (i.e., up to formation of LiC6).  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3ageometry 3agraphene 3amodels 3amonitoring1 aAnanthoju, Balakrishna1 aJangid, Manoj K.1 aKali, Ravi1 aAslam, M.1 aMukhopadhyay, Amartya0 tCarbon.g2015 July, v. 88 p.206-214dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.02.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011300167300001800280500001100298520159100309592002801900650002501928650001201953650002601965650001301991650002502004650001102029650002402040650001502064650001702079650002702096650001502123650001302138650003002151650001002181650001302191700002202204700002202226700002202248700002702270773010402297856008102401852000902482655001202491IND60586563020221117233920.0171213e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058656302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11101-017-9536-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaszek, Paweł12aL-Canavanine: How does a simple non-protein amino acid inhibit cellular function in a diverse living system?  ap. 1269-1282.  aReview  aL-Canavanine (CAN) is a non-protein amino acid (NPAA) possessing toxic properties in both animal and plant systems. Upon treatment, this arginine structural analogue is typically incorporated into proteins by arginyl-tRNA synthetase, leading to rapid functional disruption of such “canavanyl proteins”. CAN is produced in many legumes including jack bean and lucerne (alfalfa) and is accumulated mainly in seeds and their newly germinating sprouts. It has been described as a potent allelochemical and its toxicity has been associated with autoimmunological diseases in humans or animals feeding on plants containing this NPAA. Application of CAN even at low concentration resulted in an inhibition of plant growth. When CAN was used as an anticancer agent, its mode of action appears to be associated with the synthesis of non-functional proteins in sensitive organisms, a similar mode of action to that of other simple NPAAs as meta-tyrosine. CAN toxicity in plants is also likely associated with the formation of non-functional proteins and its application has been shown to cause disruption of polyamine metabolism and formation of reactive nitrogen species including nitric oxide (NO). In higher plants, CAN has recently been used as a tool to study the regulation or modulation of polyamine–NO cross-talk.

In the present study, upscaling of LAI was carried out by applying a transfer function from field LAI measurements to fine-resolution LISS III images and subsequently to coarse resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data using a photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)/LAI ceptometer (AccuPAR model LP-80). Field data were collected from differently aged forest plantation types in the Terai Central Forest Division of Nainital district in Uttarakhand, India. The upscaling was done by establishing an empirical exponential relationship between normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and LAI. Results reveal a significant relationship (p < 0.01) between NDVI and LAI for each of the studied plantation types, i.e. teak, poplar, eucalyptus, and mixed plantation. The LAI was mapped at 23.5 m resolution by applying a plantation-specific LAI versus NDVI relationship derived from IRS Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensor images. The LAI maps were upscaled by using a simple linear averaging within nonoverlapping windows to match with Terra–MODIS 250 m resolution NDVI images. The upscaled time series of LAI was compared with representative field-measured LAI measurements and also with MODIS LAI at a resolution of 1000 m. Upscaled LAI was found to be significantly related to the field-measured LAI with a value of 0.69 for coefficient of determination and with a root mean square error of 0.77. On the other hand, upscaled LAI has less agreement with the MODIS LAI product (R ² = 0.5 and root mean square error = 0.70).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aTectona grandis 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aecophysiology 3aecosystems 3aevapotranspiration 3aforest plantations 3aforests 3aimage analysis 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aprimary productivity 3aremote sensing 3atime series analysis 3aIndia1 aPatel, N.R.1 aKushwaha, S.P.S.1 aDadhwal, V.K.0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2014 Nov. 17, v. 35, no. 22 p.7749-7762dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2014.9768863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245013700160300001600297500001900313520101200332592002801344650002501372650001801397650001601415650001601431650001401447650001401461650002401475650002101499650002301520650001901543650001901562650001901581653003501600653001501635653002001650700001501670700001701685700002201702700001901724700001701743700001801760700001901778773012801797856007801925852000902003655001202012IND60700686420221121100225.0200820e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070068642DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2019.45522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Dakyung12aA Mixture Containing Fermented Achyranthes japonica Nakai Ameliorates Osteoarthritis in Knee Joints of Monoiodoacetate-Injected Rats  ap. 811-817.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe demonstrated the effect of a mixture containing fermented Achyranthes japonica Nakai (FS) in the context of a monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis animal model. The mineralization, anabolic and catabolic factors, and the amount of cytokines within the articular cartilage of rats were measured after administration of MIA. We found that dietary supplementation with methylsulfonylmethane (positive control) and FS (FS 100 mg/kg body weight [b.w.] and FS 300 mg/kg b.w.) effectively suppressed pathological changes in the knee joint and inhibited changes in the architectural and mineralization parameters. In addition, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and proinflammatory cytokines in the serum and catabolic factors, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and MMP-7 in articular cartilage, were decreased by dietary supplementation with FS in MIA-induced osteoarthritis. Based on these findings, we suggest that FS can be used for the development of potential therapies for osteoarthritis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchyranthes japonica 3aanimal models 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acartilage 3acytokines 3adietary supplements 3afunctional foods 3ametalloproteinases 3amineralization 3aosteoarthritis 3aprostaglandins 0a• Achyranthes japonica Nakai 0aknee joint 0amonoiodoacetate1 aLee, Dasom1 aOh, Donghwan1 aJeong, Hyun Cheol1 aLee, Sung-jin,1 aSohn, Johann1 aKim, Ok-Kyung1 aYi, Chong-min,0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 23, no. 8 p.811-817dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl57082x1557-76007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jmf.2019.45523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01344naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245003700168300001600205520033800221592002800559650001300587650002100600650001100621650001200632650002000644650001100664650001300675650002000688650001200708651001400720700001400734700001600748773010600764856008200870961000900952852000900961655001200970IND60615468320221117160213.0181010e198211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061546832DNAL7 a10.1177/0300985882019006062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchamber, G.

The material was characterized by FTIR, XRD and SEM combined with energy dispersive spectrum technique. The hybrid material was tested for removal of fluoride with variation of solution parameters. The extent of fluoride removal was more than 99% and fluoride adsorption equilibrium was attained in a 14min time period. The adsorption follows a pseudo second order kinetics with theoretical adsorption capacity (qₑ,cₐₗ) and experimental adsorption capacity (qₑ,ₑₓₚ) close to each other. The value of thermodynamic parameter ΔH indicated an endothermic adsorption process. A negative value of ΔG shows the feasibility and spontaneity of material-anion interaction. The adsorbed fluoride could easily be desorbed from the material by using 0.1M NaOH solution. Further, the regenerated material was tested up to 10th consecutive cycles of operation without significance loss of adsorption efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achemical engineering 3aenergy 3amixing 3azirconium1 aMishra, Sulagna1 aPatnaik, Tanushree1 aPatel, R.K.1 aJha, Usha1 aDey, R.K.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 184 p.72-81dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.12.0913Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012900166300001600295520118700311592002801498650001901526650002001545650002401565650001301589650001901602650001301621650002201634650001601656650002301672650001701695650001601712650001501728700001201743700001701755700001601772700001401788700001801802700001801820700001801838700001801856773008601874856008401960852000902044655001202053IND60602977120221116230351.0180712e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060297712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Huihui10aGraphene quantum dots directly generated from graphite via magnetron sputtering and the application in thin-film transistors  ap. 225-232.  aThis work presents a novel method to prepare graphene quantum dots (GQDs) directly from graphite. A composite film of GQDs and ZnO was first prepared using the composite target of graphite and ZnO via magnetron sputtering, followed with hydrochloric acid treatment and dialysis. Morphology and optical properties of the GQDs were investigated using a number of techniques. The as-prepared GQDs are 4–12nm in size and 1–2nm in thickness. They also exhibited typical excitation-dependent properties as expected in carbon-based quantum dots. To demonstrate the potential applications of GQDs in electronic devices, pure ZnO and GQD–ZnO thin-film transistors (TFTs) using ZrOx dielectric were fabricated and examined. The ZnO TFT incorporating the GQDs exhibited enhanced performance: an on/off current ratio of 1.7×10⁷, a field-effect mobility of 17.7cm²/Vs, a subthreshold swing voltage of 90mV/decade. This paper provides an efficient, reproducible and eco-friendly approach for the preparation of monodisperse GQDs directly from graphite. Our results suggest that GQDs fabricated using magnetron sputtering method may envision promising applications in electronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid treatment 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3adialysis 3aelectric power 3agraphene 3ahydrochloric acid 3amethodology 3aoptical properties 3aquantum dots 3atransistors 3azinc oxide1 aLiu, Ao1 aXu, Yuanhong1 aShan, Fukai1 aLi, Aihua1 aWang, Jianmei1 aYang, Wenrong1 aBarrow, Colin1 aLiu, Jingquan0 tCarbon.g2015 July, v. 88 p.225-232dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04292naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012300172520270500295592002803000650002303028650001903051650001403070650002603084650001103110650002103121650001803142650002603160650001403186650001503200650001903215650001803234650002003252650001403272650003003286650001303316650001103329650001303340650001403353650001603367650001103383651001203394651001403406653001803420653001803438653001603456653002303472700001603495700001803511773011803529856008203647852000903729655001203738IND60700057020221122045351.0200726e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070005702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2020.1074252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbuixech-Martí, S.10aBiotic and abiotic factors influencing haplosporidian species distribution in the cockle Cerastoderma edule in Ireland  aThe Phylum Haplosporidia consists of four genera (Minchinia, Haplosporidium, Urosporidium and Bonamia) that are endoparasitic protists of a wide range of marine invertebrates including commercial bivalve species. Characterization of haplosporidian species remains a challenge due to their patchy spatial and temporal distributions, host-restricted occurrence, and poorly known life cycles. However, they are commonly associated with significant mortality events in bivalves. Due to the recent sporadic mortality events that have occurred in cockles in Europe, the objectives of this study were to determine the diversity, distribution and seasonality of haplosporidian species in Cerastoderma edule populations at several Irish sites. The role of abiotic (temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen in water) and biotic (cockle size and age) factors as drivers or inhibitors of haplosporidian infection were also assessed. Cockles (n = 998) from the intertidal were sampled from April/July 2018 to April 2019 at three sites with no commercial fishing activity on the south coast (Celtic Sea) and one site on the northeast coast (Irish Sea) with an active commercial fishery. Screening of the cockles by molecular techniques (PCR, Sanger sequencing) and by histopathology was carried out. Two species were identified and confirmed in Irish C. edule for the first time, Minchinia mercenariae -like (14.8%) and Minchinia tapetis (29.6%). Similar to other haplosporidian parasites, the Minchinia spp. detected in our study were present year-round at all sites, except for M. tapetis in Youghal Bay (Celtic Sea). Coinfection of both Minchinia species was only observed in Cork Harbour (Celtic Sea) and Dundalk Bay (Irish Sea), where Minchinia spp. showed a higher presence compared to Youghal Bay and Dungarvan Harbour (Celtic Sea). Moreover, haplosporidians detected with generic primers, were present at all of the sample sites throughout the year but had a higher occurrence during the winter months and were positively correlated with dissolved oxygen. Likewise, smaller and older C.edule seemed to be more vulnerable to the haplosporidian infection. Furthermore, haplosporidian distribution displayed spatial variability between and within sample sites, with the highest presence being observed in cockles at one of the commercially fished Dundalk beds, while the lowest presence was observed in cockles at the second Dundalk bed that was more influenced by freshwater runoff when the tide was out. Findings from this study provide additional information on the distribution and seasonal presence of novel haplosporidian species and their potential abiotic and biotic drivers/inhibitors of infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCerastoderma edule 3aHaplosporidium 3aMinchinia 3aaquatic invertebrates 3acoasts 3adissolved oxygen 3aendoparasites 3aenvironmental factors 3afisheries 3afreshwater 3ahistopathology 3alittoral zone 3amixed infection 3amortality 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotists 3arunoff 3asalinity 3ascreening 3atemperature 3awinter 3aIreland 3aIrish Sea 0aCockle health 0aHaplosporidia 0aCoinfection 0aEcological drivers1 aLynch, S.A.1 aCulloty, S.C.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2020 July, v. 174 p.107425-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2020.1074253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015000168300001200318520170500330592002802035650002502063650001102088650001902099650002002118650002202138650001002160650002102170650001202191650001002203650000902213650000902222650002002231650001602251650002502267650001902292650001502311651002002326700002102346700002102367773012502388856008102513852000902594655001202603IND60440076820221117224700.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044007682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-015-2597-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTait, Douglas R.10aSeasonal and Diurnal Dynamics of Atmospheric Radon, Carbon Dioxide, Methane, δ13C-CO2 and δ13C-CH4 in a Proposed Australian Coal Seam Gas Field  ap. 350.  aThe expected growth of the coal seam gas industry in Australia requires baseline information for determining any potential long-term impacts of the industry. As such, a 1-year atmospheric time series measuring radon (²²²Rn), methane (CH₄), carbon dioxide (CO₂), δ¹³C-CO₂ and δ¹³C-CH₄ was conducted in an area where coal seam gas (CSG; also referred to as coal bed methane) extraction is proposed (Casino, New South Wales, Australia). We hypothesise that ²²²Rn can be used as a tracer of soil-atmosphere CH₄ and CO₂ exchange, and that carbon stable isotope values of atmospheric CH₄ and CO₂ can be used to identify the source of greenhouse gases. Radon, CO₂ and CH₄ followed a diurnal pattern related to increased concentrations during the formation of a nighttime inversion layer. The study found a significant inverse linear relationship between ²²²Rn concentrations and both rainfall (r ² = 0.43, p < 0.01) and temperature (r ² = 0.13, p < 0.01), while atmospheric pressure, wind speed and wind direction affected concentrations to a lesser degree over seasonal time scales. ²²²Rn had a significant, but weak positive correlation with both seasonal CO₂ (r ² = 0.15, p < 0.01) and CH₄ (r ² = 0.11, p < 0.01) concentrations. The uncoupling between ²²²Rn and CO₂ and CH₄ was likely due to biogenic sources and sinks of CO₂ and CH₄. δ¹³C values of CO₂ and CH₄ indicated variability in the source and sinks of the gases that seems to be linked to different seasonal, soil and spatial sources. This study provides baseline data from a proposed coal seam gas field from which future comparisons can be made.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acoalbed methane 3adiurnal variation 3agases 3agreenhouse gases 3amethane 3aradon 3arain 3asoil 3astable isotopes 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3awind direction 3awind speed 3aNew South Wales1 aMaher, Damien T.1 aSantos, Isaac R.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2015 Oct., v. 226, no. 10 p.350-350dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-015-2597-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001100148245012700159300001600286520133900302592002801641650001301669650001501682650002801697650002101725650001701746650001901763650001801782650001601800650002501816650002401841650001401865650001701879653002801896653001801924653001301942653001501955653002201970700001801992700001302010700001802023700001702041700001902058773012202077856008202199852000902281655001202290IND60089794420221118022849.0160728e20130906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008979442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.07.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mi10aImaging and measuring the biophysical properties of Fc gamma receptors on single macrophages using atomic force microscopy  ap. 709-714.  aFc gamma receptors (FcγR), widely expressed on effector cells (e.g., NK cells, macrophages), play an important role in clinical cancer immunotherapy. The binding of FcγRs to the Fc portions of antibodies that are attached to the target cells can activate the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) killing mechanism which leads to the lysis of target cells. In this work, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to observe the cellular ultra-structures and measure the biophysical properties (affinity and distribution) of FcγRs on single macrophages in aqueous environments. AFM imaging was used to obtain the topographies of macrophages, revealing the nanoscale cellular fine structures. For molecular interaction recognition, antibody molecules were attached onto AFM tips via a heterobifunctional polyethylene glycol (PEG) crosslinker. With AFM single-molecule force spectroscopy, the binding affinities of FcγRs were quantitatively measured on single macrophages. Adhesion force mapping method was used to localize the FcγRs, revealing the nanoscale distribution of FcγRs on local areas of macrophages. The experimental results can improve our understanding of FcγRs on macrophages; the established approach will facilitate further research on physiological activities involved in antibody-based immunotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aantibodies 3aatomic force microscopy 3abinding capacity 3acytotoxicity 3aimage analysis 3aimmunotherapy 3amacrophages 3anatural killer cells 3apolyethylene glycol 3areceptors 3aspectroscopy 0aAtomic force microscopy 0aImmunotherapy 0aAntibody 0aMacrophage 0aFc gamma receptor1 aLiu, Lianqing1 aXi, Ning1 aWang, Yuechao1 aXiao, Xiubin1 aZhang, Weijing0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Sept. 06, v. 438 p.709-714dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.07.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012100170300001800291520135900309592002801668650003001696650001201726650001601738650001401754650001401768650000901782650001101791700006001802773012601862856008201988852000902070655001202079IND60592871220221119211058.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059287122DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-017-3807-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKacimi, Abderrahim14aThe transient response to an equatorial heat source and its convergence to steady state: implications for MJO theory  ap. 3315-3330.  aThe Matsuno–Gill model for the atmospheric steady-state response to an imposed equatorial heat source is perhaps the most successful set of reduced equations in the theory of tropical dynamics. While it was originally designed to explain some key features of the tropical climatology such as the Walker and Hadley circulations, it is increasingly used for other transient tropical disturbances such as the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO). Here, we provide a semi-analytic solution to the time dependent Matsuno–Gill equations, with periodic boundary conditions and without the long-wave approximation, based on a meridional expansion using the parabolic cylinder functions combined with the method of characteristics and Fourier series in the zonal direction. Our method of solution leads to an ODE system which is solved numerically. We use this transient solution to investigate the conditions under which the transient response convergences to the steady state and study the effect of a moving heat source on the structure of the response and speculate about its resemblance or not to the MJO structure. In particular, we look at the sensitivity of the long time behavior of the solution with respect to the model parameters, namely, the imposed dissipation rate and the speed of the moving heat source as well as the form of the heating itself.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMadden-Julian Oscillation 3aclimate 3aclimatology 3acylinders 3aequations 3aheat 3amodels1 aKhouider, Boualem1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6899-52570 tClimate dynamics.g2018 May, v. 50, no. 9-10 p.3315-3330dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-3807-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009800171300001200269520099600281592002801277650002701305650001501332650002601347650002701373650002101400650001201421650001701433650000901450650002601459650001501485650002001500650002101520650001801541650001401559650001001573650001101583650000901594650001501603700002301618773012501641856008101766852000901847655001201856IND60440076920221117224636.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044007692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-015-2547-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanumanth Kumar, G.10aHeavy Metal Lead Influative Toxicity and Its Assessment in Phytoremediating Plants—A Review  ap. 324.  aThe purpose of this review is to describe how plants take up lead and its distribution to plant parts, morphological, physiological, and biological effects of lead on plants, sequestration strategies, and tolerance mechanisms including detoxification. How lead despite its lack of essential function in plants, causes phytotoxicity by changing cell membrane permeability, by reacting with active groups of different enzymes involved in plant metabolism by reacting with the phosphate groups of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP). Moreover, we also address role of hyperaccumulating plants in lead absorption. How synthetic chelators such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) enhances the availability of heavy metal lead in soils and increase phytoextraction efficiency in aboveground harvestable plant parts through enhancing the metal solubility and translocation from roots to shoots, metal tolerance, and future prospectives to decrease lead pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aabsorption 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3achelating agents 3aenzymes 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amembrane permeability 3ametabolism 3ametal tolerance 3aphytoremediation 3aphytotoxicity 3apollution 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil 3asolubility1 aPramoda Kumari, J.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2015 Oct., v. 226, no. 10 p.324-324dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-015-2547-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245011100164300001600275500001900291520090100310592002801211650002701239650002801266650001101294650001201305650001801317650000901335651001801344653001901362653001901381653001701400700002101417700002101438700002301459700002201482700001601504700001801520773014001538856007801678852000901756655001201765IND60700686620221122010531.0201201e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070068662DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2020.26332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammoudi, Nassim10aMolecular Detection of Pathogenic Leptospira in Grasscutters (Thryonomys swinderianus) from Côte d'Ivoire  ap. 924-926.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe geographical and climatic conditions, hot and humid in Côte d'Ivoire, are favorable to the prolonged survival of leptospira in the environment. In this country, cases of human leptospirosis are underestimated and the wild reservoirs unknown. In this study, 16S rDNA PCR-sequencing and variable number of tandem repeats typing investigations were performed in kidneys collected from 60 grasscutters (Thryonomys swinderianus) around the city of Yamoussoukro, including 10 bred grasscutters and 50 bush meat grasscutters. One sample was positive for Leptospira borgptersenii and another one for Leptospira interrogans; both collected from wild animals. Our study suggests that grasscutters, which are abundant wild rodents hunted and bred for culinary preparations in this region, can be healthy carriers of leptospira. Thus, hygiene measures should be taken, particularly by hunters and cooks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptospira interrogans 3aThryonomys swinderianus 3ahumans 3ahygiene 3aleptospirosis 3ameat 3aCote d'Ivoire 0aCôte d'Ivoire 0aLeptospira spp 0agrasscutters1 aDavoust, Bernard1 aDizoe, Sylvestre1 aLe Guyader, Marine1 aDrancourt, Michel1 aBouam, Amar1 aKodjo, Angeli0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 20, no. 12 p.924-926dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2020.26333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011200168300001600280520123900296592002801535650003401563650001801597650002501615650001801640650002701658650002101685650002001706650001601726650002801742650002101770650001401791650001001805650001901815650002101834650000901855650001301864650002901877650002701906653002101933653001901954653002301973653002801996700001202024700001702036700001902053700001402072700001302086700001602099700002002115700001602135700001902151773012302170856008502293852000902378655001202387IND60666218820221122113441.0190913e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066621882DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(19)30073-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWANG, Yu-Xin12aA hepatoprotection study of Radix Bupleuri on acetaminophen-induced liver injury based on CYP450 inhibition  ap. 517-524.  aWe investigated the potential hepatoprotective effect of Radix Bupleuri (RB) by inducing acute liver injury (ALI) in an animal model using acetaminophen (APAP) after pretreatment with RB aqueous extract for three consecutive days. Compared to those of the APAP group, the biochemical and histological results of the RB pretreatment group showed lower serumaspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels as well as less liver damage. Pharmacokinetic study of the toxicity related marker acetaminophen-cysteine (APC) revealed a lower exposure level in rats, suggesting that RB alleviated APAP-induced liver damage by preventing glutathione (GSH) depletion. The results of cocktail approach showed significant inhibition of CYP2E1 and CYP3A activity. Further investigation revealed the increasing of CYP2E1 and CYP3A protein was significantly inhibited in pretreatment group, while no obvious effect on gene expression was found. Therefore, this study clearly demonstrates that RB exhibited significant protective action against APAP-induced acute live injury via pretreatment, and which is partly through inhibiting the increase of activity and translation of cytochrome P450 enzymes, rather than gene transcription.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aacetaminophen 3aalanine transaminase 3aanimal models 3aaspartate transaminase 3acytochrome P-450 3agene expression 3aglutathione 3ahepatoprotective effect 3aherbal medicines 3ahistology 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics) 0aHepatoprotection 0aRadix Bupleuri 0aAcute liver injury 0aCytochrome P450 enzymes1 aDu, Yi,1 aLIU, Xia-Fei1 aYANG, Fang-Xiu1 aWu, Xiao,1 aTan, Li,1 aLU, Yi-Hong1 aZHANG, Jing-Wei1 aZhou, Fang,1 aWANG, Guang-Ji0 tChinese journal of natural medicines.g2019 July, v. 17, no. 7 p.517-524dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6169x1875-53647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(19)30073-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03559naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001900169245012100188300001800309520174700327592002802074650001602102650001302118650002002131650001402151650001102165650001802176650000702194650001102201650001102212650001402223650001502237650002502252650003402277650002702311650001702338650003102355650002002386650002302406650002102429650004602450650003402496650001402530650002302544650001702567650002602584650003202610650001802642650002202660700001802682700002002700700002002720700002102740773009102761856008402852852000902936655001202945IND60088239220221119014437.0141102e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008823922DNAL7 a219966082pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2011.08.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Terng-Jou10aUsing magnetic seeds to improve the aggregation and precipitation of nanoparticles from backside grinding wastewater  ap. 6301-6307.  aBackside grinding (BG) wastewater treatment typically requires large quantities of chemicals, i.e. polyaluminum chloride (PAC) coagulant and produces considerable amounts of sludge, increasing the loading and cost of subsequent sludge treatment and disposal processes. This study investigated the effects of the addition of magnetic seeds (FeO*Fe₂O₃) of selected particle sizes and of optimized combinations of magnetic seeds and PAC on the aggregation of silica nanoparticles from BG wastewater and on the sedimentation time at various pH values (5–9). The results show that the turbidity of BG wastewater was significantly reduced by the magnetic aggregation treatment. The dosage of PAC combined with 2.49gL⁻¹ or 1.24gL⁻¹ of magnetic seeds was reduced by 83% (from 60 to 10mgL⁻¹) compared to the conventional process of using only PAC as a coagulant. The turbidity of the BG wastewater, initially 1900–2500NTU, could also be successfully decreased about to 23NTU by the addition of 3.74gL⁻¹ magnetite (FeO*Fe₂O₃) only at pH 5 with an applied magnetic field of 1000G. Different coagulation conditions using magnetic seeds combined with coagulant resulted in different aggregation performances. The treatment performance was more effective by using two-stage dosing, in which magnetic seeds and PAC were added separately, than that with one-stage dosing, where the magnetic seeds and PAC were added simultaneously during rapid mixing. The two-stage dosing allowed for a reduction in the optimum dosage of magnetic seeds from 3.74gL⁻¹ to 2.49gL⁻¹ or 1.24gL⁻¹ without affecting performance when coupled with 0.01gL⁻¹ of PAC coagulant. The developed method effectively reduced the production of waste sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoagulation 3agrinding 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetite 3amixing 3ananoparticles 3apH 3asilica 3asludge 3aturbidity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 2aAluminum Hydroxidexchemistry 2aChemical Precipitation 2aFlocculation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMagnetic Fields 2aMagneticsxmethods 2aMetalsxanalysis 2aNanoparticlesxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aNephelometry and Turbidimetry 2aRecycling 2aStatic Electricity 2aTime Factors 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Purificationxmethods 2aWater Quality 2aX-Ray Diffraction1 aShen, Shumin,1 aSiao, Sheng-Han1 aHuang, Chong-Fu1 aCheng, Chiung-Yi0 tWater research.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 45, no. 19 p.6301-6307dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2011.08.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245011400171300001600285520166800301592002801969650001301997650001402010650003702024650001902061650001202080650001802092650002702110650002902137650001302166650001302179651002202192653002202214653002602236653002402262653002902286653001802315653001402333653002702347700001902374700001802393773009802411856008002509852000902589655001202598IND60480034720221120181617.0160125e20130906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048003472DNAL7 a10.2478/abcsb-2013-000152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutkowska, Agnieszka10aNatural Hybrid Zone of Aconitum Species in the Western Carpathians: Linnaean Taxonomy and ISSR Fingerprinting  ap. 114-126.  aAconitum lasiocarpum (Carpathian endemic) and A. variegatum (European endemic) occur sympatrically in the Polish Western Carpathians. Here their taxonomic hybrid A. ×pawlowskii occurs. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the taxonomic (Linnaean approach) and genetic structure (PCR-ISSR analysis) of the populations and individuals in two allopatric and four sympatric populations. We determined 309 individuals (OTUs) to species, subspecies and nothospecies using the Linnaean system of classification, and then genetically fingerprinted 39 randomly chosen OTUs. Comparison of the Nei and Li distances obtained from ISSR and morphological matrices using the Mantel test indicated a significant correlation (n = 39, r = 0.53, P = 0.001). Genetic analysis (NEWHYBRIDS) pointed to 7 OTUs as being later-generation hybrids (B1 introgessants) in the sympatric area. Five of them belong to A. variegatum, indicating cryptic introgression, and two belong to A. ×pawlowskii. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NDMS) showed gene flow between A. lasiocarpum and A. ×pawlowskii. Allopatric, morphologically pure A. lasiocarpum and A. variegatum populations differed significantly in their ISSR profiles (Fischer's R×C test, P < 0.0001). Expected heterozygosity (Hj) was significantly (p=0.05) lower in allopatric (0.1261-0.1268) than in sympatric populations (0.1348-0.1509), indicating a genetic melting pot in sympatry. The results support the existence of a natural interspecific hybrid swarm zone in the sympatric area of occurrence of Aconitum, and the taxonomic circumscription of the nothospecies within the Linnaean taxonomic system  aPublisher supplied data 3aAconitum 3agene flow 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aheterozygosity 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amultidimensional scaling 3asympatry 3ataxonomy 3aCarpathian region 0aBeskid Niski Mts. 0acryptic introgression 0agenetic melting pot 0ageographical range limit 0ahybridization 0anothotaxa 0apostglacial migrations1 aBoroń, Piotr,1 aMitka, Józef0 tActa biologica Cracoviensia.g2013 Sept. 06, v. 55, no. 1 p.114-126dVersitax1898-02957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/abcsb-2013-000153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245011900160520147700279592002801756650001201784650001201796650001001808650001401818650001601832650001701848650001201865650001301877650000901890650000801899650001101907651001201918651001101930653001301941653003701954653002201991653001002013653002102023700002602044700002402070773012402094856007702218852000902295655001202304IND60700686820221122025620.0200703e20200514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070068682DNAL7 a10.4081/ija.2020.15032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPłaza, Anna10aPost-harvest residues of narrow-leafed lupin/oat mixtures as a source of biological nitrogen for hybrid winter rye  aPost-harvest residues of narrow-leafed lupin/oat mixtures are a valuable source of biological nitrogen for the following crop plants, including winter cereals. Hybrid winter rye, which is increasingly popular in Germany and Poland, positively responds to cultivation at good sites. The objective of the research was to determine the effect of the biomass of the post-harvest residues of narrow-leafed lupin, oat and their mixtures on yield performance and amount of nitrogen accumulated in hybrid winter rye grain. The following two factors were examined in an experiment: factor I - forecrop mixtures: narrow-leafed lupin - pure stand 100%, oat - pure stand 100%, narrow-leafed lupin 75% + oat 25%, narrowleafed lupin 50% + oat 50%, narrow-leafed lupin 25% + oat 75%; factor II - forecrop harvest date: the stage of narrow-leafed lupin flowering, the stage of narrow-leafed lupin flat green pod. The results demonstrated that oat and narrow-leafed lupin/oat mixtures containing 25 + 75% and 50 + 50% of the respective components and harvested at the stage of narrow-leafed lupin flat green pod supplied the greatest amount of post-harvest residue biomass, and narrow-leafed lupin harvested at the aforementioned stage accumulated the most nitrogen. Hybrid winter rye following the forecrop of narrow-leafed lupin/oat mixture containing 50 + 50% of the respective components and harvested at the stage of narrowleafed lupin flat green pod produced the highest grain yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLupinus 3abiomass 3acrops 3aflowering 3agrain yield 3aharvest date 3ahybrids 3anitrogen 3aoats 3arye 3awinter 3aGermany 3aPoland 0aForecrop 0anarrow-leafed lupin/oat mixtures 0ahybrid winter rye 0ayield 0anitrogen content1 aGąsiorowska, Barbara1 aRzążewska, Emilia0 tItalian journal of agronomy.g2020 May 14, v. 15, no. 2 p.1503-dPAGEPress PublicationswJournal:11633x1125-47187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/ija.2020.15033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008800167300001600255520107200271592002801343650001401371650001501385650001101400650002101411650001901432650001501451650001301466700001901479700001801498700002401516700002101540773008601561856008401647852000901731655001201740IND60602977520221116225748.0180712e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060297752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCakmak, Enes10aCarbon nanotube sheet electrodes for anisotropic actuation of dielectric elastomers  ap. 113-120.  aThe performance of dielectric electroactive polymer (D-EAP) based actuators depends critically on the electrode characteristics. Among the most challenging issues in the application of D-EAPs is the device-level complexity in producing sufficient directional actuation at acceptably low electric fields. In this work, a simple carbon nanotube (CNT) based electrode for D-EAP actuators is demonstrated that vastly improves directional strain response originating from the mechanical anisotropy of the electrode material. In this novel approach, highly aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) sheet electrodes are applied on acrylate adhesive films show high directed linear actuation strain of greater than 40% at a relatively low electric field (100Vμm⁻¹). The fiber-oriented CNT sheet applied around the D-EAP film, exhibits strong interaction between CNT fibers in the electrode and the D-EAP film to produce a robust conductive-nanolayer at the interface, on actuation cycling. The design paradigm provides a great potential for the fabrication of soft linear actuators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactuators 3aanisotropy 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectric field 3aelectrodes 3apolymers1 aFang, Xiaomeng1 aYildiz, Ozkan1 aBradford, Philip D.1 aGhosh, Tushar K.0 tCarbon.g2015 Aug., v. 89 p.113-120dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012200166300001600288520121500304592002801519650001601547650001501563650001301578650002101591650002401612650001001636650002401646650002201670650001201692650001001704650001401714650002301728700001701751700002001768700001801788700001201806700001501818700002101833700001401854773011201868856008101980852000902061655001202070IND60586563520221117233953.0171213e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058656352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11248-017-0045-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Chunying10aEffects of transgenic overexpression of diapause hormone and diapause hormone receptor genes on non-diapause silkworm  ap. 807-815.  aDiapause is a state of developmental arrest that is most often observed in arthropods, especially insects. The domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori, is a typical insect that enters diapause at an early embryonic stage. Previous studies have revealed that the diapause hormone (DH) signaling molecules, especially the core members DH and DH receptor 1 (DHR1), are crucial for the determination of embryonic diapause in diapause silkworm strains. However, whether they function in non-diapause silkworm strains remains largely unknown. Here, we generated two transgenic lines overexpressing DH or DHR1 genes in a non-diapause silkworm strain, Nistari. Our results showed that developmental expression patterns of DH and DHR1 are quite similar in transgenic silkworms: both genes are highly expressed in the mid to late stages of pupae and are most highly expressed in day-6 pupae but are expressed at very low levels in other developmental stages. Moreover, the overexpression of DH or DHR1 can affect the expression of diapause-related genes but is not sufficient to induce embryonic diapause in their offspring. This study provides new insights into the function of DH and DHR1 in a non-diapause silkworm strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aarthropods 3adiapause 3adiapause hormone 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3ahormone receptors 3aprogeny 3apupae 3asilkworms 3atransgenic insects1 aZeng, Wenhui1 aZhang, Tianyang1 aLiu, Rongpeng1 aOu, Yao1 aAi, Junwen1 aXiang, Zhonghuai1 aXu, Hanfu0 tTransgenic research.g2017 Dec., v. 26, no. 6 p.807-815dSpringer International Publishingx0962-88197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-017-0045-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009900166520125700265592002801522650003001550650002801580650002301608650003201631650001801663650001601681650000901697653002601706653002501732653001101757653002301768700001601791700001701807700001501824700001801839700002001857773012301877856008102000852000902081655001202090IND60700057420221122045355.0211030e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070005742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1095772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yan-yan10aPreparation of yogurt-flavored bases by mixed lactic acid bacteria with the addition of lipase  aYogurt-flavored bases are widely used in food industry for enhancing flavors. In this study, yogurt-flavored bases by mixed lactic acid bacteria with or without lipase were investigated, which included Streptococcus lactis ACCC 11093 (SL) and Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 6013 (LCR), SL and Lactobacillus acidophilus 1.1878 (LAP), and SL and Lactobacillus plantarum DMDL 9010 (LP), respectively. Compared with the combination of SL and LCR and the combination of SL and LAP, the combination of SL and LP had higher production of total amino acids, volatile acids and esters, suggesting that the combination of SL and LP was more efficient to produce yogurt-flavored bases. In addition, lipase significantly increased the production of amino acids associated with sweet and bitter flavors, and resulted in rougher milk globule surface and tighter network structure compared with fermentations without the addition of lipase. Furthermore, a total of 54 volatile compounds were detected in yogurt-flavored bases. The production of volatile compounds in fermentations with and without the addition of lipase, was mainly affected by acids and esters, respectively. Therefore, the lipase is a favorable supplement for producing yogurt-flavored bases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aLactococcus lactis 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3afood industry 3alactic acid 3amilk 0aYogurt-flavored bases 0aLactic acid bacteria 0aLipase 0aVolatile compounds1 aYu, Jia-jia1 aZhou, Qin-yu1 aSun, Li-na1 aLiu, Dong-mei1 aLiang, Ming-hua0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Sept., v. 131 p.109577-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1095773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245007200177300001600249520120700265592002801472650002201500650001501522650001401537650002501551650001101576650002101587650001601608650001801624650001401642650001601656650002101672650003701693700001901730773009701749856008101846990002301927852000901950655001201959IND60093096920221118013455.0141103e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009309692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiabani-Ravandi, Abolfazl10aLow temperature CO oxidation over Fe–Co mixed oxide nanocatalysts  ap. 141-146.  aIn this paper, low temperature CO oxidation over iron–cobalt mixed oxide nanocatalysts with different Co/Fe molar ratios was investigated. The nanocatalysts were prepared with a facile co-precipitation method. The prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N₂ adsorption (BET), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), Thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TGA/DTA) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The BET results revealed that the samples have a mesoporous structure and decreasing in Co/Fe molar ratio shifted the pore size distributions to smaller values. The TEM analysis showed a nanostructure for all samples with crystallite sizes smaller than 20nm. The pure cobalt nanocatalyst showed uniform hexagonal closed packed structure. The catalytic results showed that the addition of Co to iron oxide even in small amount has a dramatic effect on increasing CO conversion at lower temperatures. The results indicated that the stability of catalysts was affected by reaction temperature, O₂/CO ratio and CO concentration in feed composition. The results showed that increase in reaction temperature increased the stability of catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3achemical engineering 3acobalt 3afeed composition 3airon oxides 3ananomaterials 3aoxidation 3atemperature 3athermal analysis 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aRezaei, Mehran0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 184 p.141-146dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.01.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009200168300001600260520111400276592002801390650002201418650002201440650002301462650001801485650001501503650002001518650001301538650002301551650001701574650001001591650002401601650001901625650001701644650001401661650002501675650002501700650001001725650001201735650002201747650001901769700001601788700001801804700002101822700002001843700001801863700002101881700002001902700001801922700001801940700002201958773011201980856008102092852000902173655001202182IND60586563620221117233845.0171213e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058656362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11248-017-0047-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCeballo, Yanaysi10aHigh accumulation in tobacco seeds of hemagglutinin antigen from avian (H5N1) influenza  ap. 775-789.  aTobacco seeds can be used as a cost effective system for production of recombinant vaccines. Avian influenza is an important respiratory pathogen that causes a high degree of mortality and becomes a serious threat for the poultry industry. A safe vaccine against avian flu produced at low cost could help to prevent future outbreaks. We have genetically engineered tobacco plants to express extracellular domain of hemagglutinin protein from H5N1 avian influenza virus as an inexpensive alternative for production purposes. Two regulatory sequences of seed storage protein genes from Phaseolus vulgaris L. were used to direct the expression, yielding 3.0 mg of the viral antigen per g of seeds. The production and stability of seed-produced recombinant HA protein was characterized by different molecular techniques. The aqueous extract of tobacco seed proteins was used for subcutaneous immunization of chickens, which developed antibodies that inhibited the agglutination of erythrocytes after the second application of the antigen. The feasibility of using tobacco seeds as a vaccine carrier is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aagglutination 3aantibodies 3aavian influenza 3achickens 3acost effectiveness 3aerythrocytes 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3ahemagglutinins 3aimmunization 3apathogens 3arecombinant vaccines 3aregulatory sequences 3aseeds 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants 3aviral antigens1 aTiel, Kenia1 aLópez, Alina1 aCabrera, Gleysin1 aPerez, Marlene,1 aRamos, Osmany1 aRosabal, Yamilka1 aMontero, Carlos1 aMenassa, Rima1 aDepicker, Ann1 aHernández, Abel,0 tTransgenic research.g2017 Dec., v. 26, no. 6 p.775-789dSpringer International Publishingx0962-88197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-017-0047-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245008600203300001800289520233000307592002802637650001502665650001302680650001902693650001902712650003002731650001102761650001102772650001902783650002002802650001702822650001302839650001202852651002102864651001802885700002202903700002102925773012602946856008203072852000903154655001203163IND60592871820221119211236.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059287182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-017-3810-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNalam, Aditya1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1654-657X10aEffects of Arctic geoengineering on precipitation in the tropical monsoon regions  ap. 3375-3395.  aArctic geoengineering wherein sunlight absorption is reduced only in the Arctic has been suggested as a remedial measure to counteract the on-going rapid climate change in the Arctic. Several modeling studies have shown that Arctic geoengineering can minimize Arctic warming but will shift the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) southward, unless offset by comparable geoengineering in the Southern Hemisphere. In this study, we investigate and quantify the implications of this ITCZ shift due to Arctic geoengineering for the global monsoon regions using the Community Atmosphere Model version 4 coupled to a slab ocean model. A doubling of CO₂ from pre-industrial levels leads to a warming of ~6 K in the Arctic region and precipitation in the monsoon regions increases by up to ~15%. In our Arctic geoengineering simulation which illustrates a plausible latitudinal distribution of the reduction in sunlight, an addition of sulfate aerosols (11 Mt) in the Arctic stratosphere nearly offsets the Arctic warming due to CO₂ doubling but this shifts the ITCZ southward by ~1.5° relative to the pre-industrial climate. The combined effect from this shift and the residual CO₂-induced climate change in the tropics is a decrease/increase in annual mean precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere/Southern Hemisphere monsoon regions by up to −12/+17%. Polar geoengineering where sulfate aerosols are prescribed in both the Arctic (10 Mt) and Antarctic (8 Mt) nearly offsets the ITCZ shift due to Arctic geoengineering, but there is still a residual precipitation increase (up to 7%) in most monsoon regions associated with the residual CO₂ induced warming in the tropics. The ITCZ shift due to our Global geoengineering simulation, where aerosols (20 Mt) are prescribed uniformly around the globe, is much smaller and the precipitation changes in most monsoon regions are within ±2% as the residual CO₂-induced warming in the tropics is also much less than in Arctic and Polar geoengineering. Further, global geoengineering nearly offsets the Arctic warming. Based on our results we infer that Arctic geoengineering leads to ITCZ shift and leaves residual CO₂ induced warming in the tropics resulting in substantial precipitation decreases (increases) in the Northern (Southern) hemisphere monsoon regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaerosols 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental engineering 3aleaves 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3asolar radiation 3astratosphere 3asulfates 3atropics 3aAntarctic region 3aArctic region1 aBala, Govindasamy1 aModak, Angshuman0 tClimate dynamics.g2018 May, v. 50, no. 9-10 p.3375-3395dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-3810-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009000169300001600259520125100275592002801526650004401554650001601598650001501614650002101629650002101650650001801671650001701689650001801706650001801724650001301742650001401755650001801769650000701787650002201794653002001816653002701836653001901863653001901882653001801901700001201919700001401931700001601945700001601961700002301977700002102000700001802021700001502039773010802054856008602162852000902248655001202257IND60540936320221123002518.0190318e20151210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054093632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLubambo, A.F.10aTuning Fe3O4 nanoparticle dispersion through pH in PVA/guar gum/electrospun membranes  ap. 775-783.  aPolyvinyl Alcohol (PVA)/guar gum (GG) membranes with different loads of paramagnetic iron oxide Fe3O4 nanoparticles were successfully electrospun using both non-alkaline and alkaline stock solutions. The nanoparticle homogeneity distribution was clearly enhanced in fibers obtained from alkaline stock solutions. This is mainly due to the interaction between GG and the metallic ion, which also leads to further dispersion of remained uncoated nanoparticles in the mixture. It was also noticed that GG favors nanoparticle stability in the mixture and contributes to nanoparticle encapsulation. X-ray results showed that all membranes were semi-crystalline. FTIR-ATR spectra showed that FeO absorption band intensity improved with increasing nanoparticle load, reaching saturation at 3.5mg/ml Fe3O4 concentration under alkaline conditions. VSM analyses showed that the nanoparticles are paramagnetic and were successfully incorporated by the fibers. In vitro biocompatibility tests using L929 cells indicates adequate levels of cytotoxicity and cell adhesion/proliferation assays for both membranes obtained from non-alkaline and alkaline stock solutions. Therefore, they have potential for biomedical applications as biodegradable wound dressing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aabsorption 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acell adhesion 3acytotoxicity 3aencapsulation 3aferrous oxide 3aguar gum 3amagnetite 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apolyvinyl alcohol 0aElectrospinning 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aPolysaccharide 0aCell viability 0aCell adhesion1 aOno, L.1 aDrago, V.1 aMattoso, N.1 aVaralda, J.1 aSierakowski, M.-R.1 aSakakibara, C.N.1 aFreitas, R.A.1 aSaul, C.K.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2015 Dec. 10, v. 134 p.775-783dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012300169300001600292520085500308592002801163650002501191650001501216650001101231650002101242650001901263650002101282650002601303700001901329700002101348700002601369700003601395700002101431773008601452856008401538852000901622655001201631IND60602977920221116230521.0180712e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060297792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbuzairi, Tomy10aMaskless functionalization of a carbon nanotube dot array biosensor using an ultrafine atmospheric pressure plasma jet  ap. 208-216.  aTo realize maskless functionalization of a carbon nanotubes (CNTs) dot array, a localized surface functionalization technology using an ultrafine atmospheric pressure plasma jet was developed. The plasma surface functionalization onto vertically aligned CNTs was carried out in two stages: pretreatment for activation of the CNT surface and posttreatment for surface functionalization. The experimental results of chemical derivatization with the fluorescent dye show that the CNT dot array was not only successfully functionalized with amino (–NH2) and carboxyl (–COOH) groups but also functionalized without any interference between functional groups. The success of maskless functionalization in the line pattern provides a means of a multifunctionalized CNT dot array with direct implications for future application of a microarray biosensor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3abiosensors 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aderivatization 3afluorescent dyes 3amicroarray technology1 aOkada, Mitsuru1 aMochizuki, Yohei1 aPoespawati, Nji Raden1 aPurnamaningsih, Retno Wigajatri1 aNagatsu, Masaaki0 tCarbon.g2015 Aug., v. 89 p.208-216dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245013600172300001800308520104100326650003201367650001001399650002701409650001201436650002101448650002201469650002001491650001201511650002101523650001501544650001301559650002401572700001901596700001901615700002101634700002201655773015001677852000901827856009201836930003301928946001101961655001201972IND4442773120221120223705.0100924e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444277312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2010.02349.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaseri, Mahmood10aEffect of different precooking methods on chemical composition and lipid damage of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) muscle  ap. 1973-1979.  aThe influence of three precooking methods (steaming, oven-baking and microwave-cooking) on the chemical composition and lipid quality of silver carp fillets was evaluated. The changes in protein, fat and moisture were found to be significant for all the treatments (P [less-than or equal to] 0.05). The iron content in the samples subjected to steam-cooking increased; however, the other precooking methods did not change the mineral contents (P ≥ 0.05). The free fatty acid content of the fillets did not change by the different precooking methods, while thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values increased for oven- and microwave-cooked fillets and remained constant in the steam-cooked samples. Conjugated diene and browning colour formation levels significantly increased in the oven-baked fillets. Oven-baking and microwave-cooking marginally affected the fatty acid composition of the silver carp. On comparing the raw and precooked fillets, steam-cooking was found to be the best precooking method on retaining nutritional constituents. 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3acolor 3afatty acid composition 3afillets 3afree fatty acids 3amicrowave cooking 3amineral content 3amuscles 3anutrient content 3aprecooking 3asteaming 3athiobarbituric acid1 aRezaei, Masoud1 aMoieni, Sohrab1 aHosseni, Hedayat1 aEskandari, Soheil0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2010 Oct., v. 45, no. 10 p.1973-1979dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2010.02349.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100924b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02850naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245006800189300001600257520120700273650002301480650001001503650001501513650003501528650002801563650001101591650001301602650001101615650002501626650000901651650002901660650002601689650003001715650002301745650003401768650004001802650002401842650003301866650001601899653001401915653002201929653001201951653001201963700001901975700002001994700002102014773012302035852000902158856008502167930003302252946001102285655001202296IND4440990920221120223814.0100806e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444099092DNAL7 a206449202pmid7 a10.1007/s00221-010-2351-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCohen, Nichola Rice 10aSex differences in the acquisition of complex skilled movements  ap. 183-193.  aThe praxis system comprises a network of brain regions dedicated to complex skilled movements. Following suggestions of a female advantage on learned movements (Chipman and Hampson in Neuropsychologia 44(12):2315-2329, 2006), we investigated how males and females acquire skilled movements. Subjects viewed and imitated sequences of hand movements, which were repeated ten times. Subjects' imitations were captured by a data glove, and the temporal and spatial characteristics of the imitations were compared to the model sequence. We propose an account of the computations required for imitating hand movement sequences and define the errors that may arise from failures at these computations. Our results demonstrate a female advantage in the acquisition of hand movement sequences and show that this sex difference is accounted for by a female advantage in planning, rather than an advantage in execution or online control. Further, the female advantage is specific to the production of items within a sequence and does not affect the proper ordering of items. Our findings have important implications for sex-sensitive instructional strategies, as well as for understanding the human praxis system. 3agender differences 2aAdult 2aAlgorithms 2aExecutive Functionxphysiology 2aFeedback, Psychological 2aFemale 2aGestures 2aHumans 2aLearningxphysiology 2aMale 2aMotor Skillsxphysiology 2aNerve Netxphysiology 2aParietal Lobexphysiology 2aPhotic Stimulation 2aPrefrontal Cortexxphysiology 2aPsychomotor Performancexphysiology 2aSex Characteristics 2aSpace Perceptionxphysiology 2aYoung Adult 0aImitation 0aSequence learning 0aApraxia 0aGesture1 aPomplun, Marc 1 aGold, Brian J. 1 aSekuler, Robert 0 tExperimental brain research.g2010 Aug., v. 205, no. 2 p.183-193dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0014-48197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00221-010-2351-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03577naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245013400188300001400322520143100336650001601767650001201783650001601795650002401811650002801835650002901863650002101892650001001913650001001923650001001933650005301943650001501996650000702011650004502018650001802063650001602081650002302097650001202120650001002132650002102142650001902163650004202182650003102224650001602255650002102271650001402292650004602306650005002352650001702402650002302419651001002442651001002452653002502462653002202487653002402509700001802533700001502551700001602566700002002582773012002602852000902722856009202731930003302823946001102856655001202867IND4442199420221120213516.0100910e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444219942DNAL7 a205979842pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6941.2010.00923.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Meijun10aMicrobial eukaryotic community in response to Microcystis spp. bloom, as assessed by an enclosure experiment in Lake Taihu, China  ap. 19-31.  aMesocosm experiments were carried out to examine the potential impacts of Microcystis blooms on microbial eukaryotic community composition (MECC). Four treatment additions of differing Microcystis spp. biomass were performed in enclosures, as indicated by chlorophyll a concentrations from 15 to 3217 μg L⁻¹ in the water column. Dialysis bags were used in enclosures to measure MECC dynamics without influence from predation and irradiance. Samples were taken on days 0, 1 and 4 for MECC analysis, based on changes in the chemical parameters during simultaneous monitoring. The MECC were determined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), followed by cloning and sequencing of 18S rRNA genes of selected samples. T-RFLP and clone library analysis revealed that MECC in enclosures and dialysis bags shifted strongly during Microcystis spp. decomposition. Members belonging to fungi became the dominant organisms in enclosures with a high biomass of Microcystis spp. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that temporal changes in MECC were mostly related to changes in the pH and concentrations of dissolved oxygen and dissolved organic carbon, which were induced by the addition of Microcystis spp. The experiment suggests that accumulation of Microcystis biomass can strongly impact MECC, and there might be a saprophytic association between fungi and the decomposition of Microcystis biomass. 3aMicrocystis 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3acommunity structure 3acorrespondence analysis 3adissolved organic carbon 3adissolved oxygen 3afungi 3agenes 3alakes 3amicellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography 3amonitoring 3apH 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal RNA 3asaprophytes 3atemporal variation 2aBiomass 2aBiota 2aCarbonxanalysis 2aEutrophication 2aFresh Waterxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMicrocystis 2aOxygenxanalysis 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxisolation & purification 2aTime Factors 2aWater Microbiology 3aChina 0aChina 0amicrobial eukaryotes 0aMicrocystis bloom 0amesocosm experiment1 aChen, Feizhou1 aXing, Peng1 aLi, Huabing1 aWu, Qinglong L.0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2010 Oct., v. 74, no. 1 p.19-31dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0168-64967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2010.00923.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100910b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01525naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245012800132300001400260300002200274500001500296520049700311650002200808650002500830650002400855650001800879653000900897700001700906700001800923700002100941700001700962700002200979773010101001852000901102939003301111945000801144946001101152655001201163991620407180742620221120182852.0880531e198705  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880009662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenter, C.S.14aThe effects of the dietary fibre component konjac-glucomannan on serum cholesterol levels of hypercholesterolaemic subjects  ap. 55-61.  ap. 55-61. charts.  a2019-12-05  aA gel-forming fiber (konjac-glucomannan), prepared from Amorphophallus konjac tubers, was evaluated for its hypocholesterolemic properties and potential in a supplementation study with 18 free-living hypercholesterolemic subjects in a placebo-controlled (cornstarch), double-blind, cross-over design.

However, their adaptability to other areas with different climatic conditions is unknown. In this work, the reproductive behaviour of a group of new South African cultivars of Japanese plum is analysed in order to determine their pollination requirements and evaluate their potential for adaptation to the main plum producing areas in Spain. Pollen viability was evaluated through the observation of in vitro pollen germination. Self-(in)compatibility was determined by the observation of pollen tube growth in self-pollinated flowers under the microscope. The identification of the S-alleles of incompatibility was determined by PCR amplification of the S-RNase gene. These results combined with the dates of flowering have allowed the compatibility relationships among the cultivars analysed and the main cultivars grown in Spain to be established. 3aPrunus salicina 3aalleles 3abreeding programs 3aclimatic factors 3acultivars 3aflowers 3anew variety 3aplums 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areproductive behavior 3aribonucleases 3aself-pollination 3aviability 3aSouth Africa 3aSpain1 aCasadomet, C.1 aRodrigo, J.0 tActa horticulturae.g2019 Jan. 31, , no. 1231 p.55-58dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1231.10  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245014400161300001600305520098200321650004101303650001701344650001201361650001501373650001901388650001101407650001101418650001501429651001001444700001901454700001901473773020801492856004401700852000901744655001201753IND60638554720221120123428.0190430e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063855472DNAL7 a10.1623/hysj.54.5.8992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGithui, Faith10aEstimating the impacts of land-cover change on runoff using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT): case study of Nzoia catchment, Kenya  ap. 899-908.  aThe SWAT model was used to investigate the impact of land-cover changes on the runoff of the River Nzoia catchment, Kenya. The model was calibrated against measured daily discharge, and land-cover changes were examined through classification of satellite images. Land-cover change scenarios were generated, namely the worst- and best-case scenarios. Historical land-cover change results showed that agricultural area increased from 39.6 to 64.3% between 1973 and 2001, while forest cover decreased from 12.3 to 7.0%. A comparison between 1970–1975 and 1980–1985 showed that land-cover changes accounted for a difference in surface runoff ranging from 55 to 68% between the two time periods. The land-cover scenarios used showed the magnitude of changes in runoff due to changes in the land covers considered. Compared to the 1980–1985 runoff, the land-cover scenarios generated changes in runoff of about −16% and 30% for the best and worst case scenarios respectively. 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3acase studies 3aforests 3aland cover 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3arunoff 3awatersheds 3aKenya1 aMutua, Francis1 aBauwens, Willy0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2009 Oct., v. 54, no. 5 p.899-908dPublished for the International Association of Hydrological Sciences by Blackwell Scientific PublicationswJournal:2013x0262-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.54.5.899  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245014500160300001600305520162000321650001701941653002501958653002001983653001802003653003002021700001202051700001602063700001702079700001602096700001602112700001602128773011002144852000902254856008502263930003302348946001102381655001202392IND4447493020221120050312.0110114e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444749302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00198-010-1240-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Y. 10aStudy of the mechanisms by which Sambucus williamsii HANCE extract exert protective effects against ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in vivo  ap. 703-709.  aSummary The purpose of this study is to investigate the dose-dependent effects of SWH on bone properties and the mechanism involved in mediating the osteoprotective actions of SWH. The results indicated that SWH could improve bone properties by inhibiting the process of bone resorption and stimulating the process of bone formation. Introduction Our previous study showed that Sambucus williamsii HANCE (SWH) improved trabecular bone mass and cortical bone strength in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. The purpose of this study is to investigate the dose-dependent effects of SWH on bone properties and the mechanism involved in mediating the osteoprotective actions of SWH. Methods Three-month-old C57BL/6J mice were fed a phytoestrogen-free diet and subjected to either ovariectomy or sham operation. OVX mice were treated with genistein (50 mg/kg), or a low (200 mg/kg), medium (500 mg/kg), or high (1,000 mg/kg) dose of SWH extract. Results SWH could dose-dependently decrease urinary Ca excretion and increase serum Ca level in OVX mice. It could increase tibial bone mineral density and exert beneficial effects on the microarchitecture of trabecular bone in the OVX mice. SWH suppressed the ovariectomy-induced expression of Cbfa1 mRNA and cathepsin K mRNA and enhanced the ratio of OPG/RANKL mRNA expression in the tibia. In vitro study showed that SWH dramatically reduced the number of TRAP-positive cells in RANKL-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Conclusions The present study indicated that SWH could improve bone properties by inhibiting the process of bone resorption and stimulating the process of bone formation. 3aosteoporosis 0aBone gene expression 0aBone properties 0aPhytoestrogen 0aSambucus williamsii HANCE1 aLi, Q. 1 aWan, H.-Y. 1 aXiao, H.-H. 1 aLai, W.-P. 1 aYao, X.-S. 1 aWong, M.

Some pathogenic bacteria decorate their surfaces with sialic acids which were often scavenged from host sialoglycoconjugates using their surface-localized enzymes. In this study, we constructed an in vitro trans-sialylation system by reconstructing the exogenous sialoglycoconjugate synthesis system of pathogens on the surfaces of yeast cells. The nanH gene encoding an extracellular sialidase of Corynebacterium diphtheriae was cloned into the yeast surface display vector pYD1 based on the Aga1p-Aga2p platform to immobilize the enzyme on the surface of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The surface-displayed recombinant NanH protein was expressed as a fully active sialidase and also transferred sialic acids from pNP-α-sialoside, a sialic acid donor substrate, to human-type asialo-N-glycans. Moreover, this system was capable of attaching sialic acids to the glycans of asialofetuin via α(2,3)- or α(2,6)-linkage. The cell surface-expressed C. diphtheriae sialidase showed its potential as a useful whole cell biocatalyst for the transfer of sialic acid as well as the hydrolysis of N-glycans containing α(2,3)- and α(2,6)-linked sialic acids for glycoprotein remodeling. 3aCorynebacterium diphtheriae 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abacteria 3abiocatalysts 3agenes 3aglycoproteins 3ahydrolysis 3apathogens 3apolysaccharides 3asialic acids 3asialidase 3ayeasts 2aAsialoglycoproteinsxmetabolism 2aCorynebacterium diphtheriaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aEnzymes, Immobilizedxmetabolism 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenetic Vectors 2aMembrane Proteinsxmetabolism 2aNeuraminidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexmetabolism 2aSialic Acidsxmetabolism 2aSialoglycoproteinsxmetabolism 2aSurface Properties 0aNanH 0aIn vitro trans-sialylation 0aCell surface display 0aSialoglycoconjugate1 aOh, Doo-Byoung 1 aKwon, Ohsuk 1 aKang, Hyun Ah 0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2010 Oct., v. 88, no. 4 p.893-903dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2812-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100924b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02336naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245009200162300001600254520122900270650002101499650001401520650001601534650002101550650001101571650001901582650001701601650001901618650002101637653000801658653001301666700002501679773012001704852000901824856008501833930003301918946001101951655001201962IND4445188520221120050358.0101113e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444518852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-010-9520-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Hoda 12aA fast algal bioassay for assessment of copper toxicity in water using Euglena gracilis  ap. 785-792.  aA rapid, sensitive algal bioassay was investigated to monitor copper toxicity using photosynthetic activity and motility parameters as end points in the photosynthetic flagellate Euglena gracilis. Effects on motility parameters were determined using the automatic bioassay ECOTOX. Photosynthetic efficiency was measured using chlorophyll fluorescence by means of a fast, noninvasive pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer. These parameters were assessed regarding their effectiveness as end points for short- (0-24 h) and long-term (1-5 days) toxicity tests. The model organism showed significant responses to the tested concentrations at both motility and photosynthesis examined levels. EC₅₀ values for movement parameters immediately after the cells were mixed with copper are 19.09 (300.4 μM), 20.4 (312 μM) and 23.09 (363.35 μM) mg L⁻¹ for motility, r-value and velocity, respectively. The current study proofs that Euglena is a convenient biotest organism where motility parameters show rapid sensitive responses to copper (direct exposure to copper). Also, the photosynthetic parameters appear to be appropriate for acute and chronic toxicity tests for higher and lower copper concentrations, respectively. 3aEuglena gracilis 3abioassays 3achlorophyll 3achronic toxicity 3acopper 3adirect contact 3afluorescence 3aphotosynthesis 3atoxicity testing 0aPAM 0aMotility1 aHäder, Donat-Peter.0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2010 Dec., v. 22, no. 6 p.785-792dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0921-89717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-010-9520-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101113b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02341naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245005700163300001800220500001500238520091500253650002201168650001601190650001301206650002801219650002501247650002101272650002301293650002001316650003501336653001901371653002701390653002501417653000901442653001001451653000801461700001401469700001801483700001301501700001401514700001301528700001901541700001801560773011901578852000901697856008501706930003301791946001101824655001201835IND4448833520221120050157.0110204e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444883352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-010-0300-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, Yongjun 10aSNPs discovery and CAPS marker conversion in soybean  ap. 1841-1846.  a2019-12-04  aTo discover new SNPs and develop an easy assay method in soybean, we compared the high-throughput pyrosequencing ESTs with whole genome sequences in different soybean varieties and identified 3899 SNPs. Transitions were found to be much more frequent than transversions in these SNPs. We found that SNPs were widely distributed in the soybean genome, targeting numerous genes involved in various physiological and biochemical processes influencing important agronomic traits. A set of 16 SNPs were validated in nine soybean varieties, and seven SNPs were converted into CAPS. From functional gene association analysis, the marker CAPS282 on the 3′-UTR of gene Glyma07g03490 was identified as associated with 100-seed weight in soybean. The SNP discovery and CAPS markers conversion system developed in this study is fast and cost effective, and holds great promise for molecular-assisted breeding of soybean. 3asequence analysis 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3aexpressed sequence tags 3abiochemical pathways 3aagronomic traits 3acost effectiveness 3agenetic markers 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aplant breeding 0aHigh-through sequences 0aAssociation analysis 0aCAPS 0agenes 0aSNP1 aLi, Yong 1 aZhu, Zhenlei 1 aBai, Xi 1 aCai, Hua 1 aJi, Wei 1 aGuo, Dianjing 1 aZhu, Yanming 0 tMolecular biology reports.g2011 Mar., v. 38, no. 3 p.1841-1846dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-0300-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20110205b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01729naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245013800164300001600302520062400318650002200942650001300964653001200977653003300989653000901022700001501031700001501046700001601061700001501077700001901092700001401111773010401125852000901229856008501238930003301323946001101356655001201367IND4442345120221120055724.0100910e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444234512DNAL7 a10.1007/s00604-010-0409-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Keying 12aA sensitive amperometric hydrogen peroxide sensor based on thionin/EDTA/carbon nanotubes—chitosan composite film modified electrode  ap. 139-144.  aA sensitive amperometric sensor has been constructed for the determination of hydrogen peroxide (HP).

In limb, oral and cranio-facial muscles of wild type mice, only a few motor endplates contained CGRP-immunoreactivity. However, many CGRP-immunoreactive motor endplates appeared in the triceps brachii muscle, the biceps brachii muscle, the brachialis muscle, and the gastrocnemius muscle of dmu mice. CGRP-immunoreactive density of motor endplates in the skeletal muscles was also elevated by the mutation. In these muscles, the atrophy of muscle fibers could be detected and the density of cell nuclei in the musculature increased. In the flexor digitorum profundus muscle, the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle, and the soleus muscle as well as in oral and cranio-facial muscles, however, the distribution of CGRP-immunoreactivity was barely affected by the mutation. The morphology of muscle fibers and the distribution of cell nuclei within them were also similar in wild type and dmu mice. In the lumbar spinal cord of dmu mice, CGRP-immunoreactive density of spinal motoneurons increased. These findings suggest that the atrophic degeneration in some fore and hind limb muscles of dmu mice may increase CGRP expression in their motoneurons. 3aspinal cord 3aimmunohistochemistry 0aCalcitonin gene-related peptide 0admu mouse 0aMotoneuron 0aScn8a1 aShimizu, Yoshinaka 1 aKano, Mitsuhiro 1 aSuzuki, Toshihiko 1 aKanetaka, Hiroyasu 1 aChu, Leona W.

The vapour phase transfer hydrogenation of acrolein into allyl alcohol with various primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols used as hydrogen donors in the presence of MgO as the catalyst has been studied. Despite differentiated reactivity exhibited by these alcohols, a high chemoselectivity (>80%) to allyl alcohol has been observed for all of them. On the basis of thermodynamic calculations it has been found that secondary alcohols as hydrogen donors are more reactive than primary ones. However, ethanol or butan-1-ol have shown the highest reactivity. In their presence yields of allyl alcohol higher than 60% have been noted, which greatly exceed those predicted by thermodynamic calculations based on the following equation: acrolein + ethanol (butan-1-ol) → allyl alcohol + acetaldehyde (butyraldehyde). Although similar yields have been reported in literature, no subsequent nor side reactions have been discussed even though the attained yield cannot be accounted for by this reaction alone. As a possible explanation of the discrepancy the occurrence of a disregarded reaction, for which ΔG < 0, has been considered. It has been shown that aldol condensation fulfills these thermodynamic requirements, however, the products of this reaction are noted only at the beginning of the process and the decrease of their amount does not influence the yield of allyl alcohol.

A number of studies have demonstrated that there are recognizable changes in the genetic composition of the spirochete after more than 60 passages. We have maintained B31 in the natural zoonotic cycle of transmission of infection between laboratory mice and laboratory-reared Ixodes ticks. To determine whether similar changes occur in the natural transmission cycle, we reisolated strain B31 from mouse skin at the fifth zoonotic cycle. This reisolated derivative had the same infectivity as the parent B31 strain, had lost the 8-kb supercoiled plasmid present in B31, and induced a gross serum antibody response indistinguishable from the B31 immune response. Analysis of antigen expression with monoclonal antibodies generated against B31, however, showed differential expression of a subset of antigens between B31 and the reisolated derivative. 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aIxodes 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3adisease transmission 3agene expression regulation 3aimmune response 3alaboratory rearing 3amice 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apathogenicity 3aplasmids 3aticks 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunology 2aBacterial Proteinsxanalysis 2aBorrelia burgdorferi Groupxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aCulture Media 2aIxodesxmicrobiology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Inbred ICR1 aDolan, M.C.0 tInfection and immunity.g1995 Dec., v. 63, no. 12 p.4795-4801x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19970401b19970408c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle02794naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245010100169300001600270520127700286650001501563650001901578650001101597650002101608650001401629650001301643650001501656650002601671650001201697650000701709650001301716650001501729650001401744650002201758650003001780651001001810653002901820653001101849653001101860700002401871700001401895700001901909700001701928700002301945700002401968773013401992852000902126856008502135930003302220946001102253655001202264IND4444329420221120131814.0101029e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444432942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-009-1292-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Nityananda 10aBiodiversity of brackish water amphipods (crustacean) in two estuaries, southeast coast of India  ap. 471-486.  aThe present study about the gammarid amphipods of Vellar and Uppanar estuaries was performed during two seasons (pre-monsoon and post-monsoon, 2005-2006), respectively, in nine habitats: five in the Vellar estuary and four in the Uppanar estuary. Amphipod samples were collected from sediments, oyster beds, seaweeds, sea grass, and mangroves. A total of 29 species of gammarid amphipods were collected in each area. The surface water temperature ranged from 16°C to 26°C, the salinity from 20 to 32 psu, and the pH between 7.5 and 8.3. Dissolved oxygen ranged from 5.3 to 7.8 ml/l. The maximum abundance of amphipods was observed during the pre-monsoon (July to September) in Vellar mangrove, and it was minimum during the pre-monsoon in Uppanar sea grass. It was found that several physicochemical factors, such as salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and the substrate have a marked effect on the distribution and the relative abundance of amphipods. The ranges of species diversity, richness, dominance, and evenness in the Vellar and Uppanar estuaries were 1.58-4.15, 1.82-5.29, 0-0.11, and 0.96-1, respectively. Using multivariate analyses, in each estuary, it was possible to identify different communities of amphipod species according to their habitats. 3aGammaridae 3abrackish water 3acoasts 3adissolved oxygen 3aestuaries 3ahabitats 3amacroalgae 3amultivariate analysis 3aoysters 3apH 3asalinity 3aseagrasses 3asediments 3aspecies diversity 3asurface water temperature 3aIndia 0aVellar/Uppanar estuaries 0aPRIMER 0aSIMPER1 aRajkumar, Mayalagu 1 aSun, Jun 1 aKundu, Sourav 1 aLyla, P.

Methods Immediate and long-term outcomes were evaluated in 311 patients who were 60 years old or younger at the time of EPBD. The stone recurrence rate was compared among four groups stratified according to gallbladder (GB) status before and after EPBD (cholecystectomy after EPBD, GB left in situ with stones, GB left in situ without stones, and cholecystectomy before EPBD). Results Bile duct stones were completely removed via EPBD alone in 304 patients (97.7%). Post-EPBD pancreatitis occurred in 24 patients (7.7%), and was mild in 18 patients, moderate in 5 patients, and severe in 1 patient. The rate of pancreatitis was significantly higher in these patients than in patients aged more than 60 years who underwent EPBD during the same study period (4.7%). Long-term outcomes were evaluated in 217 patients who were followed for at least 1 year after complete stone removal via EPBD. During a mean follow-up period of 5.6 years (range, 1.0-13.4 years), stone recurrence was observed in 13 patients (6.0%). The cumulative stone recurrence rates at 5 and 10 years after EPBD were 5.9 and 7.1%, respectively. Patients in the cholecystectomy after EPBD group had the lowest risk of stone recurrence among the four groups (2.0%). Conclusion EPBD removes bile duct stones in the majority of younger patients without increasing the risk of severe pancreatitis. Post-EPBD pancreatitis is more likely to occur in younger patients as compared to older patients. The long-term outcomes of EPBD appear favorable, especially in patients who have undergone cholecystectomy after EPBD. 3apancreatitis 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aCatheterizationxadverse effectsxmethods. 2aCholecystectomyxadverse effectsxmethods. 2aEndoscopy, Digestive Systemxadverse effectsxmethods. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aGallstonesxtherapy 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPancreatitisxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aRecurrence 2aRetrospective Studies 2aTime Factors 2aTreatment Outcome 2aYoung Adult 0aEndoscopic papillary balloon dilation 0aBile duct stone 0aYoung patients 0aStone recurrence1 aYoshida, Haruhiko 1 aIsayama, Hiroyuki 1 aItō, Yukiko.1 aYashima, Yoko 1 aYagioka, Hiroshi 1 aKogure, Hirofumi 1 aSasaki, Takashi 1 aArizumi, Toshihiko 1 aTogawa, Osamu 1 aMatsubara, Saburō.1 aNakai, Yousuke 1 aSasahira, Naoki 1 aHirano, Kenji 1 aTada, Minoru 1 aKawabe, Takao 1 aOmata, Masao 1 aKoike, Kazuhiko 0 tJournal of gastroenterology.g2010 Oct., v. 45, no. 10 p.1072-1079dJapan : Springer Japanx0944-11747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00535-010-0254-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02669naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245018700166300001600353520172800369653000902097653002402106653002702130700001902157773011502176852000902291856009202300946001102392655001202403IND4443470620221120121440.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444347062DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1748-1708.2010.02151.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aApró, W.10aInfluence of supplementation with branched-chain amino acids in combination with resistance exercise on p70S⁶ kinase phosphorylation in resting and exercising human skeletal muscle  ap. 237-248.  aSkeletal muscle growth is thought to be regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which can be activated by resistance exercise and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). The major aim of the present study was to distinguish between the influence of resistance exercise and BCAA on key enzymes considered to be involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, including p70S⁶ kinase (p70S⁶k). Nine healthy subjects (four men and five women) performed unilateral resistance exercise on two occasions separated by 1 month. Subjects were randomly supplied either a mixture of BCAA or flavoured water. Muscle biopsies were taken from both resting and exercising muscle before, after and 1 h after exercise. Phosphorylation of Akt was unaltered by either resistance exercise and/or BCAA supplementation whereas mTOR phosphorylation was enhanced (P < 0.05) to a similar extent in both exercising and resting muscle following exercise in the absence (70-90%) and presence of BCAA supplementation (80-130%). Phosphorylation of p70S⁶k was unaffected by resistance exercise alone; however, BCAA intake increased (P < 0.05) this phosphorylation in both legs following exercise. In resting muscle, a 5- and 16-fold increase in p70S⁶k was observed immediately after and 1 h after exercise, respectively, as compared to 11- and 30-fold increases in the exercising muscle. Phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 was attenuated 1 h after exercise (P < 0.05) in both resting (10-40%) and exercising muscle (30-50%) under both conditions. The present findings indicate that resistance exercise and BCAA exert both separate and combined effects on the p70S⁶k phosphorylation in an Akt-independent manner. 0amTOR 0aresistance exercise 0atranslation initiation1 aBlomstrand, E.0 tActa physiologica.g2010 Nov., v. 200, no. 3 p.237-248dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1748-17087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-1708.2010.02151.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02051naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245014700158300001600305520106500321653001801386653000801404653002301412653002501435700002001460700002001480700002001500700001501520773009701535852000901632856008501641946001101726655001201737IND4446857720221120223628.0101224e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444685772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11249-010-9699-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yu 12aA New AFM Nanotribology Method Using a T-Shape Cantilever with an Off-Axis Tip for Friction Coefficient Measurement with Minimized Abbé Error  ap. 313-318.  aA new AFM (atomic force microscopy) nanotribology method using a T-shape cantilever with an off-axis tip (Nat Nanotechnol 2:507-514, 2007) has been developed for measuring friction coefficient at nanometer scale. In this method, signals due to both bending and twisting of the T-shape AFM cantilever are detected simultaneously. For a T-shape AFM cantilever, the bending is caused by the normal load and the twisting is caused by both the normal and the lateral loads. The twisting generated by the normal load is calibrated in advance. Consequently, the twisting only due to the lateral load can be decoupled from the total lateral voltage signal. And the friction coefficient can be finally determined based on a conversion relationship between the normal and lateral voltage signals of the AFM photodetector. A practical procedure for minimizing Abbé error in friction coefficient measurement has also been introduced. The proposed new method is simple and accurate, and requires the least operation for friction coefficient measurement at nanometer scale. 0aNanotribology 0aAFM 0aT-shape cantilever 0aFriction coefficient1 aLeung, Kar Man 1 aNie, Heng-yong 1 aLau, Woon Ming 1 aYang, Jun 0 tTribology letters.g2011 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.313-318dBoston : Springer USx1023-88837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11249-010-9699-93Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02109naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011000128300001800238520108600256650002101342650002601363650002301389650001301412650002001425650001801445650002101463650001601484650002101500653001901521700001601540700001501556773010801571852000901679930003301688945001301721946001301734655001201747IND2041903620221120111248.0940909s1994    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204190362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, C.D.10aSelenium in thick spike wheatgrass and yellow sweet clover grown on sludge-amended alkaline mine backfill  ap. 2117-2132.  aPlant uptake of selenium (Se) on western United States mine lands is a concern in reclamation efforts due to the potential growth of vegetation that may be considered toxic to wildlife and domestic animals if consumed over time. A study was designed to determine if sewage sludge from Rock Springs and Kemmerer/Evanston, Wyoming, at rates of 25, 50, and 100 Mg/ha, would enhance or decrease Se uptake by yellow sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis) and thick spike wheatgrass (Agropyron dasystachyum) grown on mine backfill material (i.e., overburden material that has been displaced). Results indicated that increased sludge amendments significantly decreased plant Se levels. Changes in backfill chemical and physical characteristics were believed to have caused a reduction in Se bioavailability (as determined by AB-DTPA extraction), even though total Se concentrations of the sludge-amended backfill treatments were greater with increasing sewage sludge additions. Land application of sewage sludge is therefore recommended as a viable method for mine land reclamation efforts. 3aland restoration 3aMelilotus officinalis 3aElymus lanceolatus 3aselenium 3abioavailability 3asewage sludge 3aland application 3amined soils 3aapplication rate 0amineral uptake1 aVance, G.F.1 aLegg, D.E.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1994, v. 25, no. 11/12 p.2117-2132x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle01827naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014500127300001800272520075200290650002701042650001301069650001501082650001901097650001001116650001401126650003701140650001401177650000701191650001701198650002601215650001301241700001501254700002201269773008201291852000901373930003301382945001301415946001301428655001201441IND2058525320221122002922.0970719e199706  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205852532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOjcius, D.M.10aDistribution of endosomal, lysosomal, and major histocompatibility complex markers in a monocytic cell line infected with Chlamydia psittaci  ap. 2437-2442.  aThe intracellular fate of Chlamydia psittaci during infection of a monocytic cell line, THP1, was characterized.

Early Chlamydia-containing vacuoles expressed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, and most vacuoles fused with host cell lysosomes, since they expressed LAMP-1 and had acidic pHs.

The effect on subsequent challenge infections depended on the resistance and susceptibility phenotypes of the host: oocyst production was reduced in susceptible C57BL/6 and NIH mice but increased in resistant BALB/c and C3H mice. Despite this contrast, no fundamental differences were detected between the immune responses of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, either to vacinnation or alter superimposed infection, but the suppressing and enhancing effects of vaccination were transmissible to naive recipients via suspensions of mesenteric lymph node cells. The results obtained are compared with those previously reported for parenterally immunized BALB/c and CS7BL/6 mice. 3aEimeria vermiformis 3aadjuvants 3aantigens 3acholera toxin 3acoccidiosis 3aimmune response 3alymph nodes 3amice 3aoocysts 3aoral vaccination 3aparasites 3aphenotype 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAdoptive Transfer 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxanalysis 2aAntigens, Protozoanxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aB-Lymphocytesxcytology 2aCell Division 2aCholera Toxinximmunology 2aCoccidiosisximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aDisease Susceptibility 2aEimeriaximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aFemale 2aKinetics 2aLymph Nodesxcytologyximmunology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C3H 2aMice, Inbred Strains 2aVaccination1 aHesketh, P.1 aWakelin, D.0 tInfection and immunity.g1997 May, v. 65, no. 5 p.1808-1813x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle03706naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245011000167300001800277520176500295650002702060650001302087650001302100650002802113650001902141650001302160650001102173650002002184650001202204650002302216650001102239650000902250650001902259650002202278650001702300650001602317650001402333650001402347650001402361650003102375650003302406650002702439650001802466650002102484650004002505650003902545650004502584650004402629650003302673650003402706650002802740650002802768700003502796700001602831700001702847700001802864773008202882852000902964930003302973945001303006946001303019655001203032IND2058526820221122002720.0970719e199707  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205852682DNAL7 a91994502pmid7 aPMC1753922pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoulanges, V.10aUtilization of iron-catecholamine complexes involving ferric reductase activity in Listeria monocytogenes  ap. 2778-2785.  aListeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous potentially pathogenic organism requiring iron for growth and virulence. Although it does not produce siderophores, L. monocytogenes is able to obtain iron by using either exogenous siderophores produced by various microorganisms or natural catechol compounds widespread in the environment. In the presence of tropolone, an iron-chelating agent, growth of L. monocytogenes is completely inhibited. However, the growth inhibition can be relieved by the addition of dopamine or norepinephrine under their different isomeric forms, while the catecholamine derivatives 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylglycol and normetanephrine did not relieve the inhibitor effect of tropolone. Preincubation of L. monocytogenes with chlorpromazine and yohimbine did not antagonize the growth-promoting effect of catecholamines in iron-complexed medium. In addition, norepinephrine stimulated the growth-promoting effect induced by human transferrin in iron-limited medium. Furthermore, dopamine and norepinephrine allowed 55Fe uptake by iron-deprived bacterial cells. The uptake of iron was energy dependent, as indicated by inhibition of 55Fe uptake at 0 degrees C as well as by preincubating the bacteria with KCN. Inhibition of 55Fe uptake by L. monocytogenes was also observed in the presence of Pt(II). Moreover, when assessed by a whole-cell ferric reductase assay, reductase activity of L. monocytogenes was inhibited by Pt(II). These data demonstrate that dopamine and norepinephrine can function as siderophore-like compounds in L. monocytogenes owing to their ortho-diphenol function and that catecholamine-mediated iron acquisition does not involve specific catecholamine receptors but acts through a cell-bound ferrireductase activity. 3aListeria monocytogenes 3abacteria 3acatechol 3acatecholamine receptors 3achlorpromazine 3adopamine 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3agrowth retardation 3ahumans 3airon 3anorepinephrine 3apotassium cyanide 3asiderophores 3atransferrin 3atropolone 3avirulence 3ayohimbine 2aCatecholaminesxmetabolism 2aChlorpromazinexpharmacology 2aDopaminexpharmacology 2aFMN Reductase 2aIronxmetabolism 2aIron Chelating Agentsxpharmacology 2aListeria monocytogenesxenzymology 2aMethoxyhydroxyphenylglycolxpharmacology 2aNADH, NADPH Oxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aNorepinephrinexpharmacology 2aNormetanephrinexpharmacology 2aTropolonexpharmacology 2aYohimbinexpharmacology1 aAndré, Pierreq(Pierre Louis)1 aZiegler, O.1 aBuchheit, L.1 aVidon, D.J.M.0 tInfection and immunity.g1997 July, v. 65, no. 7 p.2778-2785x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle03742naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001300149245015700162300001800319520150100337650002701838650001801865650001901883650001601902650002101918650001301939650001001952650001301962650001701975650002301992650001602015650001002031650000902041650001302050650001102063650001302074650001202087650001202099650003402111650006002145650001802205650002802223650002602251650002902277650002302306650001102329650002102340650001102361650007202372650006502444650003702509650000902546650000902555650002402564650002802588650003802616650004102654650001702695650006102712650004202773700001402815700001802829773008102847852000902928930003302937945001302970946001302983655001202996IND2058232720221121231737.0970707e199605  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205823272DNAL7 a86133792pmid7 aPMC1739802pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, L.L.12aA recombinant minigene vaccine containing a nonameric cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte epitope confers limited protection against Listeria monocytogenes infection  ap. 1685-1693.  aWe have previously shown that vaccines expressing virus-derived cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes as short minigenes can confer effective protection against virus challenges, and here we extend these studies to the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Host defense against this important human pathogen appears largely T cell mediated, and a nonamer CTL epitope from the listeriolysin O (LLO) protein has been identified in BALB/c mice. We have synthesized this nonamer as a minigene, expressed it in a recombinant vaccinia virus (VV-list), and used this to immunize mice. Memory CTLs cultured from VV-list-immunized mice specifically lyse target cells pulsed with a nonamer peptide identified at LLO amino acid residues 91 to 99. Four weeks postimmunization, mice were challenged with L. monocytogenes. By day 6 following challenge with a sublethal dose of L. monocytogenes, mice immunized with VV- list showed a approx 2,000- to 6,000-fold reduction in bacterial CFU in the spleen and liver. At this time point, with control mice, bacteria were readily detectable by Gram stain of the liver but were undetectable in the VV-list- immunized animals. Additionally, when a normally lethal dose of bacteria was given, death was delayed in VV-list-immunized animals. This study has demonstrated that a single immunization with a recombinant vaccinia virus bearing only nine amino acids from a bacterial pathogen can induce specific CTLs able to confer partial protection against bacterial challenge. 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aT-lymphocytes 3aVaccinia virus 3aamino acids 3aanimal pathogens 3abacteria 3adeath 3aepitopes 3aimmunization 3aimmunologic memory 3alethal dose 3aliver 3amice 3apeptides 3aspleen 3avaccines 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Bacterialxgenetics 2aBacterial Vaccinesxgeneticsximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aBase Sequence 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEpitopesxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aHumans 2aListeria monocytogenesxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aListeriosisximmunologyxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aLiverximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSpleenximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aT-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxicximmunology 2aTime Factors 2aVaccines, Syntheticxgeneticsximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aVaccinia virusxgeneticsximmunology.1 aPamer, E.1 aWhitton, J.L.0 tInfection and immunity.g1996 May, v. 64, no. 5 p.1685-1693x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle03319naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245007600163300001800239520156100257650002801818650002501846650002501871650001701896650002101913650001601934650003901950650001301989650002402002650001202026650005302038650004802091650004002139650002702179650005102206650001102257650001902268650002402287650000902311650002802320650002102348650004802369650001202417700001702429700001702446700001502463700001602478700001702494700001702511700001402528700001402542773008102556852000902637930003302646945001302679946001302692655001202705IND2058232220221121231637.0970707e199605  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205823222DNAL7 a86133652pmid7 aPMC1739662pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInoue, K.10aMolecular composition of Clostridium botulinum type A progenitor toxins  ap. 1589-1594.  aThe molecular composition of progenitor toxins produced by a Clostridium botulinum type A strain (A-NIH) was analyzed. The strain produced three types of progenitor toxins (19 S, 16 S, and 12 S) as reported previously. Purified 19 S and 16 S toxins demonstrated the same banding profiles on sodium dodecyl sulfate- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), indicating that they consist of the same protein components. The nontoxic components of the 19 S and 16 S toxins are a nontoxic non-hemagglutinin (HA) (molecular mass, 120 kDa) and HA. HA could be fractionated into five subcomponents with molecular masses of 52, 35, 20, 19, and 15 kDa in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. The molar ratios of neurotoxins, nontoxic non-Has, and each HA subcomponent of the 19 S and 16 S toxins showed that only HA-35 of the 19 S toxin was approximately twice the size of that of the 16 S toxin, suggesting that the 19 S toxin is a dimer of the 16 S toxin cross-linked by the 35-kDa subcomponent. The nontoxic non-HA of the 12 S toxin, but not those of the 19 S and 16 S toxins, demonstrated two bands with molecular masses of 106 and 13 kDa on SDS-PAGE with or without 2-mercaptoethanol. It was concluded from the N-terminal amino acid sequences that 106- and 13-kDa proteins were generated by a cleavage of whole nontoxic non-HA. This may explain why the 12 S and 16 S (and 19 S) toxins exist in the same culture. We also found that the HA and its 35-kDa subcomponent exist in a free state in the culture fluid along with the three types of progenitor toxins. 3aClostridium botulinum A 3aamino acid sequences 3abeta-mercaptoethanol 3acrosslinking 3amolecular weight 3aneurotoxins 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBotulinum Toxinsxchemistryxgeneticsxtoxicity. 2aClostridium botulinumxchemistryxgenetics. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aHemagglutination Tests 2aHemagglutininsxchemistryxgeneticsxtoxicity. 2aHumans 2aImmunoblotting 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aNeurotoxinsxchemistryxgeneticsxtoxicity. 2aRabbits1 aFujinaga, Y.1 aWatanabe, T.1 aOhyama, T.1 aTakeshi, K.1 aMoriishi, K.1 aNakajima, H.1 aInoue, K.1 aOguma, K.0 tInfection and immunity.g1996 May, v. 64, no. 5 p.1589-1594x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle02212naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001400183245006900197300001600266500001500282520078800297650002201085650001701107650001601124650001801140650001201158650001701170650002301187650002001210650002301230650000901253651001801262651001301280653002701293653004001320653001401360653002901374653002101403653003201424700001701456773006601473852000901539856012301548930003301671945001301704946001301717655001201730IND2051928320221121225744.0960628e199605  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205192832DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1520-6297(199605/06)12:3<219::AID-AGR3>3.0.CO;2-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgden, A.10aHow red are the roses?

Three criteria--volume of imports, price effects, and health of the domestic industry--were the basis of the petitioners injury allegation. Preliminary findings indicated a loss of market share for US rose producers, declining production, employment, and underselling in the US market. While the Department of Commence's final determination concluded that Colombian roses were sold at less than fair value, the ITC ruled that the US rose industry was not materially injured by imports of roses from Colombia and Ecuador and the case was terminated. 3afair market value 3atrade policy 3acut flowers 3amarket prices 3aimports 3acase studies 3afederal government 3aeconomic impact 3amarket competition 3aRosa 3aUnited States 3aColombia 0au.s. trade act of 1974 0au.s. international trade commission 0amarketing 0agovernment organizations 0adomestic markets 0au.s. department of commerce1 aAmes, G.C.W.0 tAgribusiness.g1996 , v. 12, no. 3 p.219-230x0742-44777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6297(199605/06)12:3<219::AID-AGR3>3.0.CO;2-33Available from publisher's Web site  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle01783naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001700183245005500200300001600255520055200271650001600823650002500839650002600864650002400890650002400914650002400938650002500962650002300987650001101010650001701021651001501038653005701053700001801110773006601128852000901194856012301203930003301326945001301359946001301372655001201385IND2051927920221121225619.0960628e199605  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205192792DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1520-6297(199605/06)12:3<209::AID-AGR2>3.0.CO;2-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParker, D.D.14aThe use of information services: the case of CIMIS  ap. 209-218.  aThis article presents a conceptual model that predicts the characteristics of users of a public weather information system.

The objective of this paper is to investigate the non-linear adjustments of prices in the poultry marketing chain in Spain. The methodology used is based on the multivariate approach to specify and estimate a threshold autoregressive model. Price relationships at feed industry, producer, and retail levels are considered. Results indicate that, in the long run, price transmission is perfect and any supply or demand shocks are fully transmitted to all prices in the system. In the short run, price adjustments between the feed and the farmer levels are fairly symmetric and are representative of a cost-push transmission mechanism. On the other hand, retailers benefit from any shock, whether positive or negative, that affects supply or demand conditions when price spreads are increasing, while price behavior is closely related to competitive markets when faced with declining price spreads. 3afood marketing 3avertical integration 3afood prices 3amultivariate analysis 3afood availability 3acommodity prices 3aeconometric models 3apoultry products 3ahuman food chain 3amarket competition 3apoultry industry 3aSpain 0aprice adjustments 0ademand 0afood supply 0aprice transmission 0amarket efficiency 0anon-linear price adjustments1 aGil, J.M.1 aAmeur, M.0 tAgribusiness.g2005 Spring, v. 21, no. 2 p.253-271x0742-44777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agr.200463Available from publisher's Web site  a20070803b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/12/05  aOther US 7aarticle02510naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001500171245005700186300001600243500001500259520111300274650001201387650002701399650002001426650001201446650001601458650002501474650002601499650001801525650001801543650001601561650002301577650002101600650001601621651002101637653002101658653003201679653003301711653001601744700001501760773007201775852000901847856007701856930003301933945002501966946001301991655001202004IND4373132820221121225536.0050809e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437313282DNAL7 a10.1002/agr.200492doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

First, a least-cost food poverty line was determined. Then, some aggregate poverty measures, namely the Head-Count Ratio, the Poverty Gap Ratio, the Sen Index and the Foster, Greer and Thorbecke Index, were calculated and employed for assessment of poverty levels in Turkey as a whole and in both urban and rural areas. These indices indicate that approximately 46.8% of the households are poor, and 7.0% of the households are extremely poor in Turkey. Moreover, the extent, depth, severity, and intensity of poverty in rural areas of Turkey seem to be fairly high compared to urban areas. In order to firmly combine food poverty and actual food consumption behavior, the Linearly Approximated Almost Ideal Demand System (LA/AIDS) was estimated. The results show that food demands of extremely poor households are more responsive to income and prices than are those of poor households in Turkey. 3apoverty 3ageographical variation 3afood purchasing 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3adeveloping countries 3alow income households 3afood security 3adata analysis 3arural areas 3aeconometric models 3afood consumption 3afood prices 3aTurkey (country) 0ahousehold income 0aalmost ideal demand systems 0aleast-cost food poverty line 0afood demand1 aTuncer, I.0 tAgribusiness.g2005 Summer, v. 21, no. 3 p.289-311x0742-44777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agr.200493Available from publisher's Web site  a20070125b20070202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/12/05  aOther US 7aarticle01920naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100002100171245010100192300001600293500007300309500001500382520064000397650001701037650001001054650001901064650002001083650001801103650002501121650002301146650001601169651001101185653002201196700001401218700002501232773007201257852000901329856007701338930003301415945002501448946001301473655001201486IND4371224020221121174115.0050613e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437122402DNAL7 a10.1002/agr.200392doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

It was thought that the large, more efficient chains would eliminate the traditional stores and the smaller supermarkets as well, based on price competition. However, the evolution of the food retail structure in Brazil shows growth in the number of traditional firms and independent supermarkets in the last nine years, with little evidence of loss of importance in food sales, especially as to the independent supermarkets whose share in food sales has grown. 3asupermarkets 3afoods 3afood retailing 3afood purchasing 3afood industry 3aconsumer preferences 3amarket competition 3afood prices 3aBrazil 0aconsumer behavior1 aNunes, R.1 aMonteiro, G.F. de A.0 tAgribusiness.g2005 Spring, v. 21, no. 2 p.133-147x0742-44777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agr.200393Available from publisher's Web site  a20070803b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/12/05  aOther US 7aarticle03102naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245020700162300001600369500001500385520173000400650001702130650001002147650001302157650001502170650000902185650001802194650001902212650001502231650002402246650001702270650001102287650001402298650002102312653002502333700001702358700002202375700001802397700001902415700001702434773015202451856004402603852000902647655001202656IND60394815620221121174035.0150825e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6039481562DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.75.7.6482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmitz, Silke10aDirect comparison of solid-phase gastric emptying times assessed by means of a carbon isotope–labeled sodium acetate breath test and technetium Tc 99m albumin colloid radioscintigraphy in healthy cats  ap. 648-652.  a2019-12-05  aObjective—To directly compare solid-phase gastric emptying times assessed by means of a [13C]sodium acetate breath test ([13C]-SABT) and technetium Tc 99m albumin colloid radioscintigraphy (99mTc-ACR) in healthy cats. Animals—12 healthy cats. Procedure—After ingestion of a test meal containing 50 mg of [13C]sodium acetate and 250 MBq of 99mTc-albumin colloid, each cat underwent simultaneous [13C]-SABT and 99mTc-ACR on 2 consecutive days. Breath samples and scintigrams were acquired at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 300, 360, 480, and 600 minutes after meal ingestion. Quartiles of gastric emptying (25%, 50%, and 75%) were calculated for breath test analysis by use of the area under the curve of the 13C:12C ratio. Quartiles of gastric emptying times were extrapolated from the scintigraphic findings by beans of nonlinear curve regression analysis. Results—Mean ± SD gastric half-emptying (50%) times obtained with [13C]-SABT and 99mTc-ACR, were 239 ± 28 minutes and 276 ± 59 minutes, respectively. A 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that mean gastric emptying times determined with [13C]-SABT and 99mTc-ACR differed significantly. For the stages of gastric emptying, Pearson correlation between the 2 methods was good at 25% (r = 0.655) and weak at 50% (r = 0.588) and 75% (r = 0.566)of gastric emptying. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Results indicated that the [13C]-SABT can be a valid alternative to 99mTc-ACR in healthy cats; it was easy to perform, was tolerated well by the cats, and had acceptable correlation to scintigraphic findings at gastric emptying of 25%, 50% and 75%. Studies in cats with delayed gastric emptying will be needed to verify the validity of the [13C]-SABT. 3abreath tests 3abeans 3aalbumins 3atest meals 3acats 3aradiolabeling 3asodium acetate 3atechnetium 3aregression analysis 3ascintigraphy 3acarbon 3aingestion 3agastric emptying 0aanalysis of variance1 aGotte, Birte1 aBorsch, Christian1 aKunz, Clemens1 aFailing, Klaus1 aNeiger, Reto0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2014 July, v. 75, no. 7 p.648-652dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.75.7.648  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001500171245005800186300001600244500007300260500001500333520082100348650001001169650002501179650001701204650002601221650002401247650002501271650002001296650001701316650001701333650002301350650002001373650002301393650001901416651001201435653001801447653002601465700001301491773007201504852000901576856007701585930003301662945002501695946001301720655001201733IND4371225420221121174051.0050613e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437122542DNAL7 a10.1002/agr.200422doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In this article, the authors will analyze questions addressing brand management, especially the activities of retailers who are developing their own brands. As evidenced by the steady increase in market share for retail brands, nowadays consumers see little significant difference between retail brands and processor brands. Being the trustee of credence characteristics of food items, brands have to guarantee the correctness of their products throughout the whole food supply chain. In order to ensure this, vertical coordination mechanisms have to be installed. This is leading to competition among retail chains in the area of vertical coordination to ensure quality and to build brand equity. 3afoods 3avertical integration 3afood quality 3aagricultural industry 3abrand name products 3aconsumer preferences 3aconsumer demand 3amarket share 3aagribusiness 3amarket orientation 3aeconomic impact 3amarket competition 3afood retailing 3aGermany 0abrand quality 0aagricultural products1 aKuhl, R.0 tAgribusiness.g2005 Spring, v. 21, no. 2 p.177-189x0742-44777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agr.200423Available from publisher's Web site  a20070803b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/12/05  aOther US 7aarticle02766naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013600128300001800264500001500282520152500297650001501822650001701837650002401854650001401878650001401892650002001906650002101926650002101947650002601968650001201994651001002006653001702016653001902033653002002052700002202072700001602094700001602110700001802126773010802144852000902252930003302261945001302294946001302307655001202320IND2041901720221121040614.0940909s1994    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204190172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOyonarate, C.10aFacataors affecting soil organic matter turnover in a Mediterranean exosystems from Sierra de Gador (Spain): an analytical approach  ap. 1929-1945.  a2019-12-05  aHumus formations from forest and brushwood ecosystems on calcareous substrates in representative sites from Sierra de Gador in Southern Spain were analyzed. The humus composition, as determined by three independent fractionation procedures, suggests that soil organic matter turnover is not related to the vegetation biotypes, but to a series of local factors among which climatic and soil characteristics predominate. Of the parameters studied, the amount of fulvic acids, and to a lesser extent, the relative proportion of soil perylenequinonic pigments (P-type humic acids), reflected differences in altitude. The percentage of nitrogen (N) in humic acids was the parameter that was most informative of the characteristics of humus. This finding contrasts with the poorly differentiated patterns of the particulate organic matter fractions, whose evolution is probably independent of environmental factors because of physical protection by soil carbonates. The carbon dioxide (CO2) release curves reproduced under laboratory conditions showed that the intrinsic biodegradability of soil organic matter does not reflect the nature of the plant residues in the sites sampled 170-2240 m), but is weakly dependent on climatic factors. We postulate that the calcium saturation, together with the active participation of inorganic colloids, force the convergent evolution of soil humus by compensating most of the effects of the climatic and biotic factors, and the historic influence of human activity in the area studied. 3ashrublands 3ahumification 3asoil organic matter 3amountains 3ahighlands 3aedaphic factors 3acalcareous soils 3aclimatic factors 3aMediterranean climate 3aforests 3aSpain 0asite factors 0abiodegradation 0abiogeochemistry1 aPerez-Pujalte, A.1 aDelgado, G.1 aDelgado, R.1 aAlmendros, G.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1994, v. 25, no. 11/12 p.1929-1945x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02783naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245015100167300001600318520140300334650002501737650002101762650001701783650000901800650001201809650002501821650001501846650001401861650001901875650002101894650001101915650002101926650000701947650001101954650003901965650001302004650001002017650001802027650001002045700002202055700001902077773011002096852000902206856008502215946001302300655001202313IND4443238720221121025633.0101001e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444323872DNAL7 a10.1007/s12033-010-9299-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarppinen, Katja 10aOptimization of Protein Extraction from Hypericum perforatum Tissues and Immunoblotting Detection of Hyp-1 at Different Stages of Leaf Development  ap. 219-226.  aSample preparation is crucial for obtaining high-quality proteins for the purpose of electrophoretic separation and further analysis from tissues that contain high levels of interfering compounds. Hypericum perforatum is a medicinal plant that contains high amounts of phenolic compounds, of which hypericins, hyperforins, and flavonoids contribute to the antidepressant activities of the plant. This study focuses on obtaining optimized amounts of high-quality proteins from H. perforatum, which are suitable for electrophoretic analyses. From the tested protein extraction solutions, sodium borate buffers at pH 9 and 10 gave the best protein yields from mature H. perforatum leaves. With these buffers, relatively high protein yields could also be obtained from roots, stems, and flower buds. The protein extracts of all organs were well resolved in SDS-PAGE after an efficient removal of non-protein contaminants with PVPP, phenol extraction, and methanolic ammonium acetate precipitation. The method was suitable for high-quality protein extraction also from other tested species of genus Hypericum. The applicability of the protocol for immunoblotting was demonstrated by detecting Hyp-1 in H. perforatum leaves at different stages of development. Hyp-1, which has been suggested to attend to the biosynthesis of hypericin, accumulated in high amounts in H. perforatum leaves at mature stage. 3aHypericum perforatum 3aammonium acetate 3abiosynthesis 3abuds 3abuffers 3adevelopmental stages 3aflavonoids 3ahypericin 3aimmunoblotting 3aleaf development 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3apH 3aphenol 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins 3aroots 3asodium borate 3astems1 aTaulavuori, Erja 1 aHohtola, Anja 0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2010 Nov., v. 46, no. 3 p.219-226dNew York : Humana Press Incx1073-60857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-010-9299-93Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle01497naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010700166300001600273520038900289650000900678650001500687650001000702650002200712650001800734650001700752651001800769653001500787653001500802653002600817700002500843773012700868852000900995856008501004930003301089946001301122655001201135IND4443237720221121025748.0101001e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444323772DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136100500852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogdanov, V.

The mean CEC was 22.1 cmolc/kg for the A horizons and 15.2 cmolc/kg for the B horizons. Multiple regressions were carried out for CEC against organic carbon (C), clay content, and the content of seven groups of clay minerals. The results, significant at p <0.001, were consistent with most of the CEC arising from soil organic matter. For the samples of A horizon, the calculated CEC was 221 cmolc/kg per unit C and for the B horizons was 330 cmolc/kg C. There was also a contribution from sites on clay minerals. Multiple regression indicated that smectite had a higher CEC (70 cmolc/kg) than other minerals but it was not as high as that of type smectites; kaolin minerals had the lowest CEC. There was a significant effect of interaction between organic matter and some clay minerals on the CEC. Samples from B horizons containing allophane had lower CEC than those not containing allophane which is consistent with allophane reacting with carboxyl groups on organic matter. For the samples from the A horizons, however the CEC was higher when allophane was present. 3aA horizons 3aB horizons 3acation exchange capacity 3asoil organic matter 3acarbon 3aclay minerals 3amineral content 3aclay 3acorrelation 0ainteractions 0asoil organic matter-clay interactions1 aGiltrap, D.J.1 aWhitton, J.S.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1995, v. 26, no. 9/10 p.1343-1355x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle06311naa a2201009 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245012600207300001600333500001500349506007600364520338600440506003703826650001803863650001203881650001603893650001503909650002003924650002703944650001103971650002303982650001504005650001404020650001404034650002204048650004204070650001904112650003504131650001904166650003704185650001304222650002804235650001904263650001804282650001304300650002904313650002204342651001804364651001004382653001004392653003104402653001804433653002104451653001904472653002204491700002104513700001504534700001904549700001904568700001504587700001904602700001504621700002904636700001904665700001504684700001904699700001304718700001804731700001804749700001804767700002004785700001404805700002304819700001604842700002204858700002204880700001704902700002104919700001204940700001604952700001804968700002004986700001805006700001705024773011005041852000905151856008505160930003305245946001105278655001205289IND4443241120221207130101.0101001e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444324112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-009-9327-22doi7 aPMC29481552pmcid7 a209762842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarshney, R.

The relatively low crop yields may be attributed to non-availability of improved cultivars, poor crop husbandry and exposure to a number of biotic and abiotic stresses in pigeonpea growing regions. Narrow genetic diversity in cultivated germplasm has further hampered the effective utilization of conventional breeding as well as development and utilization of genomic tools, resulting in pigeonpea being often referred to as an ‘orphan crop legume'. To enable genomics-assisted breeding in this crop, the pigeonpea genomics initiative (PGI) was initiated in late 2006 with funding from Indian Council of Agricultural Research under the umbrella of Indo-US agricultural knowledge initiative, which was further expanded with financial support from the US National Science Foundation's Plant Genome Research Program and the Generation Challenge Program. As a result of the PGI, the last 3 years have witnessed significant progress in development of both genetic as well as genomic resources in this crop through effective collaborations and coordination of genomics activities across several institutes and countries. For instance, 25 mapping populations segregating for a number of biotic and abiotic stresses have been developed or are under development. An 11X-genome coverage bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library comprising of 69,120 clones have been developed of which 50,000 clones were end sequenced to generate 87,590 BAC-end sequences (BESs). About 10,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from Sanger sequencing and ca. 2 million short ESTs by 454/FLX sequencing have been generated. A variety of molecular markers have been developed from BESs, microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR)-enriched libraries and mining of ESTs and genomic amplicon sequencing. Of about 21,000 SSRs identified, 6,698 SSRs are under analysis along with 670 orthologous genes using a GoldenGate SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping platform, with large scale SNP discovery using Solexa, a next generation sequencing technology, is in progress. Similarly a diversity array technology array comprising of ca. 15,000 features has been developed. In addition, >600 unique nucleotide binding site (NBS) domain containing members of the NBS-leucine rich repeat disease resistance homologs were cloned in pigeonpea; 960 BACs containing these sequences were identified by filter hybridization, BES physical maps developed using high information content fingerprinting. To enrich the genomic resources further, sequenced soybean genome is being analyzed to establish the anchor points between pigeonpea and soybean genomes. In addition, Solexa sequencing is being used to explore the feasibility of generating whole genome sequence. In summary, the collaborative efforts of several research groups under the umbrella of PGI are making significant progress in improving molecular tools in pigeonpea and should significantly benefit pigeonpea genetics and breeding. As these efforts come to fruition, and expanded (depending on funding), pigeonpea would move from an ‘orphan legume crop' to one where genomics-assisted breeding approaches for a sustainable crop improvement are routine.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCajanus cajan 3afunding 3apigeon peas 3acrop yield 3agenetic markers 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aclones 3adisease resistance 3agenotyping 3agermplasm 3acultivars 3aresearch programs 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aabiotic stress 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aplant breeding 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3asoybeans 3aexpressed sequence tags 3asemiarid zones 3abinding sites 3agenomics 3aplant cultural practices 3agenetic variation 3aUnited States 3aIndia 0agenes 0aNext generation sequencing 0aTrait mapping 0aCrop improvement 0aGene discovery 0aMolecular markers1 aPenmetsa, R.

To test this hypothesis, perennial ryegrass was grown in soil culture treated with different rates of lime, gypsum, and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), in a factorial combination. The effects of these treatments on yield, N offtake, and shoot chemical composition were examined at two consecutive harvests. At both harvests, liming significantly increased plant yield and N offtake. There was no response to gypsum at cut 1; but at the second harvest, a negative interaction occurred between the two Ca treatments such that gypsum increased plant yield and N offtake in the absence of lime but not in its presence. The results suggest that liming affects N recovery by swards in at least two different ways, each associated with a different phase in the soil MIT (Mineralization Immobilization Turnover) cycle. During phases of net N mineralization, liming by raising soil pH stimulates biomass activity and increases the amount of organic N mineralized. In contrast, during phases of net N immobilization, liming by increasing Ca availability in the rhizosphere improves the ability of plants to absorb N, and thus helps them to compete more effectively with the biomass for mineral N. 3aLolium perenne 3ashoots 3aliming 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3agypsum 3adry matter accumulation 3anutrient content 3acalcium 3anutrient availability 3asoil pH 3amineralization 3aapplication rate 3achemical constituents of plants 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aammonium nitrate 0aimmobilization 0alime0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g1995, v. 26, no. 7/8 p.1233-1246x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03451naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002000181245007500201300001800276500002400294506007600318520172600394506003702120650002802157650001302185650001502198650001002213650001402223650001602237650002402253650001302277650001702290650001402307650003502321650002202356650002802378650002902406650001302435650002802448650002602476650001702502650002002519650003802539650003002577700001602607700002302623773011702646852000902763856008002772856004502852655001202897IND4389729220221207115457.0070325s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438972922DNAL7 a172831072pmid7 aPMC18656772pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01258-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacura, Nataša10aDependence of Macrophage Phagocytic Efficacy on Antibody Concentration  ap. 1904-1915.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMacrophages ingest the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans only in the presence of opsonins, and this provides a remarkably clean system for the detailed analysis of phagocytosis.

Mathematical modeling was used to analyze and explain the experimental data that the macrophage phagocytic index increased with increasing doses of antibody despite saturating concentrations and declined at high concentrations. A model was developed that explains the increase in phagocytic index with increasing antibody doses, differentiates among the contributions from Fc and complement receptors, and provides a tool for estimating antibody concentrations that optimize efficacy of phagocytosis. Experimental results and model calculations revealed that blocking of Fc receptors by excess antibody caused a reduction in phagocytic index but increased phagocytosis through complement receptors rapidly compensated for this effect. At high antibody concentrations, a further reduction in phagocytic index was caused by interference with complement receptor ingestion as a consequence of saturation of the fungal capsule. The ability of our model to predict the antibody dose dependence of the macrophage phagocytic efficacy for C. neoformans strongly suggest that the major variables that determine the efficacy of this process have been identified. The model predicts that the affinity constant of the opsonic antibody for the Fc receptor and the association-dissociation constant of antibody from the microbial antigen are critical parameters determining the efficacy of phagocytosis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCryptococcus neoformans 3aantigens 3acomplement 3afungi 3aingestion 3amacrophages 3amathematical models 3aopsonins 3aphagocytosis 3areceptors 2aAntibodies, Fungalximmunology 2aAntibody Affinity 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aCryptococcusximmunology 2aKinetics 2aMacrophagesximmunology 2aModels, Immunological 2aPhagocytosis 2aProtein Binding 2aReceptors, Complementximmunology 2aReceptors, Fcximmunology1 aZhang, Tong1 aCasadevall, Arturo0 tInfection and immunity.g2007 Apr., v. 75, no. 4 p.1904-1915dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01258-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://iai.asm.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle03269naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245014700182300001600329520133500345650002601680650001901706650001701725650002601742650001201768650002101780650001001801650001501811650001201826650001501838650001901853650001701872650001201889650002101901650001401922650002901936650001101965650004401976650002602020650003802046650002402084650003802108650002702146650002702173650001302200650003402213650002602247650002602273650002702299653001502326700001902341700001902360700001902379773009502398852000902493856008502502930003302587946001102620655001202631IND4443224720221120215352.0101001e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444322472DNAL7 a201865542pmid7 a10.1007/s00726-010-0505-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoshi, Vijay 10aInterdependence of threonine, methionine and isoleucine metabolism in plants: accumulation and transcriptional regulation under abiotic stress  ap. 933-947.  aPathways regulating threonine, methionine and isoleucine metabolism are very efficiently interconnected in plants. As both threonine and methionine serve as substrates for isoleucine synthesis, their synthesis and catabolism under different developmental and environmental conditions also influence isoleucine availability. Together, methionine gamma-lyase and threonine deaminase maintain the isoleucine equilibrium in plants under varied substrate availabilities. Isoleucine and the two other branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) (leucine and valine) share four common enzymes in their biosynthesis pathways and thus are coordinately regulated. Induction of free amino acids as osmolytes in response to abiotic stress is thought to play a role in plant stress tolerance. In particular, the accumulation of BCAAs is induced many-fold during osmotic stress. However, unlike in the case of proline, not much research has been focused on understanding the function of the response involving BCAAs. This review describes pathways influencing branched-chain amino acid metabolism and what is known about the biological significance of their accumulation under abiotic stress. A bioinformatics approach to understanding the transcriptional regulation of the genes involved in amino acid metabolism under abiotic stress is also presented. 3aamino acid metabolism 3abioinformatics 3abiosynthesis 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzymes 3afree amino acids 3agenes 3aisoleucine 3aleucine 3amethionine 3aosmotic stress 3aplant stress 3aproline 3astress tolerance 3athreonine 3atranscription (genetics) 3avaline 2aAmino Acids, Branched-Chainxmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBiosynthetic Pathwaysxphysiology 2aCrops, Agricultural 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aIsoleucinexmetabolism 2aMethioninexmetabolism 2aMutation 2aPlantsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aStress, Physiological 2aThreoninexmetabolism 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aRegulation1 aJoung, Je-Gun 1 aFei, Zhangjun 1 aJander, Georg 0 tAmino acids.g2010 Oct., v. 39, no. 4 p.933-947dVienna : Springer Viennax0939-44517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-010-0505-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20101001b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03261naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245015100179300001600330500024500346520160200591650002702193650002502220650002202245650001902267650001302286650002302299650001402322650001402336650001002350650002102360650001402381650001202395650002702407650001502434650003102449700001302480700001202493700001202505700001402517700001202531700001402543700001302557773014502570856005502715852000902770655001202779IND60563321920221120224017.0170215e20161125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056332192DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1127.242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Winnie Wing-man,10aIdentification of resistance to bacterial wilt and verticillium wilt in different eggplant rootstock germplasm using quantitative genetic analysis  ap. 149-156.  aPaper presented at the XXIX International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture: Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC2014): International Symposium on Plant Breeding in Horticulture held August 17-22, 2014, Brisbane, Australia  aFour eggplant rootstock germplasm lines, JA01, JA02, JB61 and JB62, with different levels of resistance to bacterial wilt (BW) and/or verticillium wilt (VW), along with the cultivated species 'Rf' were used to construct F1 hybrids. F2 and BC1 crosses were made by crossing BW-resistant JA01 and highly BW-susceptible 'Rf', and highly VW-resistant JA02 and highly VW-susceptible 'Rf'. Plants were infected with BW and VW by root dip inoculation with Ralstonia solanacearum and Verticillium dahliae. The results showed that BW resistance in eggplant rootstock germplasm JA01 was inherited in an incompletely dominant fashion and was controlled by more than two genes. JA02 resistance to VW was also of incomplete dominant inheritance, controlled by one or two genes, with one gene playing the leading role. Eight parental combinations displayed resistance to BW, four showed resistance to VW and eight were susceptible to the two diseases. Combining ability analysis showed that both the general and specific combining abilities of the resistances to these two diseases reached a significant level, indicating that the resistances were simultaneously affected by additive and non-additive effects. Hayman quantitative genetic analysis suggested that resistance to BW was affected by a dominant effect, not the epistatic effect; resistance to VW was affected by both dominant and epistatic effects. It is also supposed that the genetic expressions of resistances to the two diseases interact in eggplant rootstocks. This study provides evidence for breeding disease resistance in rootstock germplasm. 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3aVerticillium dahliae 3aVerticillium wilt 3abacterial wilt 3acrossing 3adisease resistance 3aeggplants 3aepistasis 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3agermplasm 3ahybrids 3ainheritance (genetics) 3arootstocks 3aspecific combining ability1 aYang, Y.1 aSun, N.1 aWei, H.1 aHuang, L.1 aMou, Y.1 aZhang, H.1 aZhao, Z.0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 Nov. 25, , no. 1127 p.149-156dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1127.24  aDNAL 7aarticle04348naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100001600181245008200197300001800279500002400297500001500321506007600336520177000412506003702182650002602219650001602245650001502261650001402276650001702290650002102307650002202328650001502350650001702365650000902382650001602391650002002407650002802427650001202455650001602467650001902483650002502502650001202527650003302539650002902572650009002601650001602691650002402707650002502731650003402756650003302790650000902823650002902832650001602861650006202877650003402939650002002973650001202993650008103005650004503086650004703131653001703178700001903195700001803214700002203232700002103254700002803275773011703303852000903420856008003429856004503509655001203554IND4389730420221207124648.0070325s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438973042DNAL7 a172420632pmid7 aPMC18657162pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01533-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Amit10aFalcipain-1, a Plasmodium falciparum Cysteine Protease with Vaccine Potential  ap. 2026-2034.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCysteine proteases (falcipains) of Plasmodium falciparum are potential targets for antimalarial chemotherapy, since they have been shown to be involved in important cellular functions such as hemoglobin degradation and invasion/rupture of red blood cells during parasite life cycle. The role of falcipain-1 at the asexual blood stages of the parasite still remains uncertain. This is mainly due to a lack of methods to prepare this protein in an active form. In order to obtain biologically active falcipain-1, a number of falcipain-1 constructs were designed and a systematic assessment of the refolding conditions was done. We describe here the expression, purification, and characterization of a falcipain-1 construct encoding mature falcipain-1 and 35 amino acids from the C-terminal of the pro domain. Recombinant falcipain-1 was overexpressed in the form of inclusion bodies, solubilized, and purified by Ni²⁺-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. A systemic approach was then followed to optimize refolding parameters. An optimum refolding condition was obtained, and the yield of the purified refolded falcipain-1 was ~1 mg/liter. Activity of the protein was analyzed by fluorometric and gelatin degradation assays. Immunolocalization studies using anti-falcipain-1 sera revealed a distinct staining at the apical end of the P. falciparum merozoites. Previous studies using falcipain-1-specific inhibitors have suggested a role of falcipain-1 in merozoite invasion. Based on its localization and its role in invasion, we analyzed the immunogenicity of falcipain-1 in mice, followed by heterologous challenge with Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites. Our results suggest a possible role of falcipain-1 in merozoite invasion.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3afluorometry 3amerozoites 3aparasites 3adrug therapy 3ainclusion bodies 3aPlasmodium yoelii 3ahemoglobin 3aerythrocytes 3amice 3aamino acids 3aimmune response 3aaffinity chromatography 3agelatin 3asporozoites 3asolubilization 3acysteine proteinases 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxblood 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxchemistryximmunologyxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aFluorometry 2aGelatinxmetabolism 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMalariaxprevention & control 2aMalaria Vaccinesximmunology 2aMice 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aParasitemia 2aPlasmodium falciparumxchemistryxenzymologyximmunology. 2aPlasmodium yoeliiximmunology 2aProtein Folding 2aRabbits 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aVaccines, Subunitxgeneticsximmunology. 2aVaccines, Syntheticxgeneticsximmunology. 0achemotherapy1 aKumar, Krishan1 aKorde, Reshma1 aPuri, Sunil Kumar1 aMalhotra, Pavan.1 aSingh Chauhan, Virander0 tInfection and immunity.g2007 Apr., v. 75, no. 4 p.2026-2034dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01533-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://iai.asm.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle02083naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245006800165300001800233520096800251650001801219650002201237650002701259650002801286650002801314650001001342650001201352650001501364650001401379650002501393650001301418700002001431700002101451773013001472852000901602856008501611946001301696655001201709IND4443231720221120224011.0101001e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444323172DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954100903092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYurlova, A.

Late-replicating sequences are often underreplicated in the Drosophila salivary-gland polytene chromosomes. The SuUR gene, whose mutation changes the replication time of late-replicating regions in salivary-gland cells, has been identified in Drosophila melanogaster. The SUUR protein lacks homologs by a BLAST search, and only moderate similarity is observed between its N-terminal part and chromatin-remodeling proteins of the SWI2/SNF2 family. The gene and the protein were analyzed in insects. Orthologs of the SuUR gene were found in all annotated Drosophila species. The number of amino acid substitutions in the SUUR protein proved to be extremely high, corresponding to that of fast-evolving genes. Orthologs with low homology were found in mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae, Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus.

During these phases a portion of the product is lost, mainly due to fungal diseases, which are often not only of economic concern but also a threat to human and animal health due to presence of mycotoxins. Indeed, some species, primarily belonging to Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium and Alternaria genera, produce secondary metabolites, mycotoxins, which pose a health risk to humans and animals. In fact, maximum permitted contents of mycotoxins in harvested commodities and derived products have been established by national and international organizations. Although in some instances mycotoxins have been shown to be toxic to competing microrganisms or plants, their biological-role has not yet been unequivocally established. Recent studies support their role as pathogenicity/virulence factors in host-pathogen interaction, so that a reduction in mycotoxin production might be relevant even from a plant disease perspective. Unfortunately, the use of traditional control measures, such as synthetic fungicides, is not always possible or effective in a postharvest setting because of restrictions on residue content and the appearance of resistant strains. Thus, the demand for alternative control means (as microbial antagonists, natural or generally regarded as safe compounds, and physical means), as well as for tools for the early detection of spoilage fungi, is increasing. In our research group, particular interest has been devoted to alternative means of control of blue mould caused by Penicillium expansum and consequent patulin accumulation in apples. To this purpose, the role of patulin in disease development was investigated. 3aAlternaria 3aAspergillus 3aFusarium 3aGRAS substances 3aPenicillium expansum 3aabiotic stress 3aanimal and human health 3aantagonists 3aapples 3acontrol methods 3afungi 3afungicides 3ahumans 3ainternational organizations 3amarkets 3apatulin 3arisk 3asecondary metabolites 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 3astorage time 3atoxicity 3avegetables 3avirulence1 aIppolito, A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 Oct. 20, , no. 1053 p.123-132dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1053/1053_11.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle01276naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245011300131300001600244500005500260520039000315650001600705650001100721650001400732650001700746650002000763700002200783773019600805852000901001655001201010IND60114293720221120163933.0150202s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011429372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClure, Scott10aIn Vivo Evaluation of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy for Collagenase Induced Suspensory Ligament Desmitis  ap. 378-380.  aMeeting held December 4-8, 2002, Orlando, Florida.  aExtracorporeal shock wave therapy improved the rate of healing of collagenase-induced suspensory ligament desmitis in horses, as measured by ultrasonographic imaging.

Instead, it has led to the expansion of farm labor contractor (FLC) usage. Using a survey of California growers, this study analyzes the patterns of increased FLC utilization across regions, commodities, and grower characteristics. The grower's perception about the relative costs and riskiness of FLC versus directly hired labor are found to be the most significant explanatory variables. It is argued that the use of FLCs is expanding beyond its traditional niche of supplying a reliable labor source to incorporate more administrative, regulatory compliance, and risk management activates. 3afarm labor 3amigrant workers 3alaws and regulations 3agrowers 3afarm surveys 3alabor market 3aCalifornia 0alabor contracts 0alabor costs 0afarm labor contractor 0aimmigration and control act of 19861 aBlank, S.C.0 tAgribusiness.g1996 , v. 12, no. 1 p.37-49x0742-44777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6297(199601/02)12:1<37::AID-AGR4>3.0.CO;2-Q3Available from publisher's Web site  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02046naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245007500191300001600266520072100282650001301003650001401016650001801030650001201048650001401060650002701074650002801101650001101129650002801140650003501168650004501203650005101248650003801299653001501337653001701352773011001369852000901479856009201488930003301580946001101613655001201624IND4404570720221120161939.0080418e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440457072DNAL7 a180347892pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00424.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyslobodsky, M.10aMolecular network of obesity: what does it promise for pharmacotherapy  ap. 236-245.  aThere is growing evidence that receptors that respond to orexigenic and anorexigenic signals of respective neuropeptides are also implicated in cognitive, emotional, sensory and motor functions. How do these signals trigger a particular appetitive function while also acting in so different contexts in controlling non-appetitive behaviours? This perspective seeks an answer in their peculiar modular organization when each module planted in complex networks controlling appetite is also engaged in different domains. Network analysis may be essential in considering pharmacotherapeutic interventions and, in particular, when anticipating untoward central effects of agents explored from a therapeutic point of view. 3aappetite 3acognition 3aneuropeptides 3aobesity 3areceptors 2aAppetitexdrug effects 2aCognitionxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aNerve Netxdrug effects 2aNeuropeptidesxtherapeutic use 2aNeurotransmitter Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aObesityxdrug therapyxmetabolismxpsychology. 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 0aModularity 0apolypharmacy0 tObesity reviews.g2008 May, v. 9, no. 3 p.236-245dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-78817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2007.00424.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080418b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02423naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245015100168300001600319500002800335520121700363650001701580650001801597650001401615650001001629700001601639700002001655700001501675700001301690700001501703700001501718700001501733700001701748700001601765773014401781852000901925856009201934946001102026655001202037IND4404567920221120162104.0080418s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440456792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02058.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMosha, F.W.10aExperimental hut evaluation of the pyrrole insecticide chlorfenapyr on bed nets for the control of Anopheles arabiensis and Culex quinquefasciatus  ap. 644-652.  aPublisher supplied data  aTo determine the efficacy of chlorfenapyr against Anopheles arabiensis and Culex quinquefasciatus in East Africa and to identify effective dosages for net treatment in comparison with the commonly used pyrethroid deltamethrin. Chlorfenapyr was evaluated on bed nets in experimental huts against A. arabiensis and C. quinquefasciatus in Northern Tanzania, at application rates of 100-500 mg/m². In experimental huts, mortality rates in A. arabiensis were high (46.0-63.9%) for all dosages of chlorfenapyr and were similar to that of deltamethrin-treated nets. Mortality rates in C. quinquefasciatus were higher for chlorfenapyr than for deltamethrin. Despite a reputation for being slow acting, >90% of insecticide-induced mortality in laboratory tunnel tests and experimental huts occurred within 24 h, and the speed of killing was no slower than for deltamethrin-treated nets. Chlorfenapyr induced low irritability and knockdown, which explains the relatively small reduction in blood-feeding rate. Combining chlorfenapyr with a more excito-repellent pyrethroid on bed nets for improved personal protection, control of pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes and pyrethroid resistance management would be advantageous. 3achlorfenapyr 3amosquito nets 3aAnopheles 3aCulex1 aLyimo, I.N.1 aOxborough, R.M.1 aMalima, R.1 aTenu, F.1 aMatowo, J.1 aFeston, E.1 aMndeme, R.1 aMagesa, S.M.1 aRowland, M.0 tTropical medicine & international health TM & IH.g2008 May, v. 13, no. 5 p.644-652dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1360-22767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02058.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03148naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133072001700151100001800168245011400186300001600300500001500316520151300331650001601844650001901860650003301879650000801912650001701920650001701937650002001954650002301974650003401997650001002031650000902041650001702050650001702067650001102084650001102095650002202106650001102128650001402139650003102153650003302184650003202217650002002249650003202269653000902301653001802310700001702328700001802345700001902363773008602382852000902468930003302477945002502510946001102535655001202546IND4404541120221120151806.0080418e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440454112DNAL7 a180054812pmid7 aPMC30910142pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCrozier, S.R.10aDietary patterns in pregnant women: a comparison of food-frequency questionnaires and 4 d prospective diaries  ap. 869-875.  a2019-12-04  aThere is growing interest in the use of dietary patterns as measures of exposure in studies of diet-disease relationships. However, relatively little is known about the impact of the type of dietary assessment method on the patterns observed. Using FFQ and food diary data collected from 585 women in early pregnancy we used principal component analysis to define dietary patterns. The first pattern was very similar in both datasets and was termed the 'prudent' diet. The second pattern, whilst comparable for the FFQ and food diaries, showed greater variation in coefficients than the prudent pattern; it was termed the 'Western' diet. Differences between the FFQ and diary scores were calculated for each woman for both the prudent and Western diet patterns. Of the differences in the prudent diet score, 95 % lay within ± 1·58 sd of the mean, and 95 % of the differences in the Western diet scores lay within ± 2·22 sd of the mean. Pearson's correlation coefficients were 0·67 (P < 0·001) for the prudent diet score and 0·35 (P < 0·001) for the Western diet score. The agreement between the FFQ and diary scores was lowest amongst respondents who were younger, had lower educational attainment and whose diaries were coded as 'poor, probably incomplete', although these effects were small. The first two dietary patterns identified in this cohort of pregnant women appear to be defined similarly by both FFQ and diary data, suggesting that FFQ data provide useful information on dietary patterns. 3afood intake 3apregnant women 3aprincipal component analysis 3aage 3afood choices 3afood records 3adietary surveys 3aeducational status 3afood frequency questionnaires 2aAdult 2aDiet 2aDiet Records 2aDiet Surveys 2aEating 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aPregnancy 2aPregnant Womenxpsychology 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSelf Disclosure 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0adiet 0aeating habits1 aInskip, H.M.1 aGodfrey, K.M.1 aRobinson, S.M.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2008 Apr., v. 99, no. 4 p.869-875x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20080618b20080704c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/06/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03768naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001700163245010200180300001600282500001500298520167600313650001601989650002602005650002202031650001402053650001002067650001402077650001102091650001802102650001402120650001702134650000902151650001002160650001902170650001202189650001002201650003202211650002502243650001102268650002302279650003702302650001302339650006102352650001102413650001102424650002402435650001802459650001602477650005802493650001702551650000902568650002402577650000802601650003102609653002802640653002702668653001802695700001502713700001902728700001502747700001402762700001602776700001502792700001502807773008602822852000902908930003302917945002502950946001102975655001202986IND4404541020221120151758.0080418e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440454102DNAL7 a179162732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJochmann, N.14aThe efficacy of black tea in ameliorating endothelial function is equivalent to that of green tea  ap. 863-868.  a2019-12-04  aConsumption of tea has been shown to improve endothelial function. It is assumed that catechins are the tea components responsible for these beneficial effects. In black tea, catechin concentrations are significantly lower than in green tea. The present study was designed to compare green and black tea with regard to amelioration of endothelial function. Endothelial function in response to both teas was assessed in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and rat aortic rings. To elucidate whether these findings are also applicable to humans, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and nitro-mediated dilation (NMD) were assessed by ultrasound in twenty-one healthy women before and 2 h after consumption of green and black tea (2 h of FMD and NMD), in comparison with water (control). In BAEC, green and black tea significantly increased endothelial NO synthase activity to the same extent. Similarly, both teas induced comparable endothelial-dependent vasodilation in rat aortic rings. In human subjects, ingestion of green and black tea led to significant increases in FMD: from 5·4 (sd 2·3) to 10·2 (sd 3) % (baseline-adjusted difference (BAD) for 2 h of FMD, green tea v. water: 5·0 (95 % CI 3·0, 7·0) %; P < 0·001) and from 5 (sd 2·6) to 9·1 (sd 3·6) % (BAD for 2 h of FMD, black tea v. water: 4·4 (95 % CI 2·3, 6·5) %; P < 0·001), respectively. The increase in FMD was not significantly different between the two tea preparations (BAD for 2 h of FMD, green tea v. black tea: 0·66 (95 % CI - 0·76, 2·09) %; P = 0·36). NMD did not vary between any of the groups. In conclusion, green and black tea are equally effective in improving endothelial function. 3aendothelium 3anitric oxide synthase 3aendothelial cells 3agreen tea 3awomen 3aflavanols 3acattle 3aanimal models 3ablack tea 3avasodilation 3arats 3aaorta 3atissue culture 2aAnimals 2aAorta 2aBrachial Arteryxphysiology 2aCatechinxmetabolism 2aCattle 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrinking 2aEndothelial Cellsxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aLinear Models 2aMiddle Aged 2aNitric Oxide Synthase Type IIIxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPhytotherapy 2aRats 2aRegional Blood Flow 2aTea 2aVasodilationxdrug effects 0anitro-mediated dilation 0aflow-mediated dilation 0ablood vessels1 aLorenz, M.1 aKosigk, A. von1 aMartus, P.1 aBöhm, V.1 aBaumann, G.1 aStangl, K.1 aStangl, V.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2008 Apr., v. 99, no. 4 p.863-868x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20080618b20080704c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/06/05  aNon-US 7aarticle01616naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100003200110245007800142300001400220500001500234520077300249650001601022650002701038650003101065650001301096653001301109653001001122700002101132773008301153852000901236930003301245945001301278946001101291655001201302IND2201746020221120151802.0991126e199803  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220174602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez-Golfin Seco, J.I.10aLong-term deformation of MDF panels under alternating humidity conditions  ap. 33-41.  a2019-12-05  aCreep tests were carried out on 19 mm thick commercial MDF panels, raw and overlaid with melamin resin-impregnated 80 g/m2 paper.

The relative creep of the MDP panels was considerably higher than that in particleboards with similar characteristics. Creep behaviour of the raw panels seems to be strongly influenced by melamin coating of the boards' surfaces but not by the edge coating, except when both were combined. This study debates the convenience of comparing the rheological behaviour of MDF and particleboards by means of the relative creep. 3adeformation 3arheological properties 3amedium density fiberboards 3ahumidity 0astresses 0acreep1 aDiez Barra, M.R.0 tWood science and technology.g1998 Mar., v. 32, no. 1 p.33-41x0043-77197nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02593naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245018500169300001600354500002800370500001500398520133300413650002501746650001301771650002101784650001601805650002001821653001601841653001801857653002501875700001801900700001601918700001701934700002301951773012101974852000902095856009202104946001102196655001202207IND4404545920221120142032.0080418s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440454592DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01361.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarina, J.M.10aGeographical variation in the use of intertidal rocky shores by the lizard Microlophus atacamensis in relation to changes in terrestrial productivity along the Atacama Desert coast  ap. 458-468.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019-12-04  a1. The movement of materials and organisms between ecosystems is a common process in nature. 2. In the present study we investigate the hypothesis that the movement of consumers between ecosystems depends not only on the differences in productivity between ecosystems and prey availability, but also on these animals' biological characteristics. 3. To address this hypothesis we investigated the changes in abundance, habitat utilization and diet of the lizard Microlophus atacamensis along its geographical range on the coast of the Atacama Desert. Within this range, intertidal rocky shore communities do not show important variations in their species composition and abundance, but terrestrial communities show a steep gradient of productivity associated with the increase in rainfall from north to south. 4. Our results show that the use of intertidal habitats and the consumption of intertidal prey by M. atacamensis change within its geographical range: in the North, the species uses intertidal areas and behaves as an herbivore consuming mostly algae, whereas in the South it expends most of the time in terrestrial habitats as a carnivore mainly of arthropods. 5. Our study gives new evidence for cross-ecosystem connections created by consumer movement between habitats of contrasting but variable productivity levels. 3aprimary productivity 3areptiles 3athermoregulation 3aChlorophyta 3astable isotopes 0ahabitat use 0aChlorophycota 0alinear mixing models1 aSepulveda, M.1 aReyna, M.V.1 aWallem, K.P.1 aOssa-Zazzali, P.G.0 tJournal of animal ecology.g2008 May, v. 77, no. 3 p.458-468dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-87907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01361.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle04006naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245010900195300001600304520218400320650001602504650002602520650001402546650003102560650003102591650001102622650001402633650001402647650003202661650001402693650001502707650002502722650001202747650001402759650001602773650001502789650002502804650002202829650002002851650002302871650002302894650002402917650002302941650001702964653003202981653002603013653002503039653002803064653002703092653001903119773012103138852000903259856009203268930003303360946001103393655001203404IND4404546620221120142055.0080418e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440454662DNAL7 a182844782pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01368.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudolf, Volker H.W.10aConsequences of size structure in the prey for predator-prey dynamics: the composite functional response  ap. 520-528.  a1. Current formulations of functional responses assume that the prey is homogeneous and independent of intraspecific processes. Most prey populations consist of different coexisting size classes that often engage in asymmetrical intraspecific interactions, including cannibalism, which can lead to nonlinear interaction effects. This may be important as the size structure with the prey could alter the overall density-dependent predation rates. 2. In a field experiment with damselfly and dragonfly larvae, 16 treatments manipulated the density of a small prey stage, the presence of large conspecific prey and the presence of heterospecific predators. 3. Size structure in the prey (i.e. when both prey stages were present) decreased the impact of the predator on overall prey mortality by 25-48% at mid and high prey densities, possibly due to density-dependent size-structured cannibalism in the prey. The predation rates on small prey stages were determined by the interaction of large prey and predators. Predation rates increased with prey density in the absence of large prey, but predation rates were constant across densities when large conspecifics were present. 4. The functional response for unstructured prey followed a Holling type III model, but the predation rate for size-structured prey was completely different and followed a complex pattern that could not be explained with any standard functional response. 5. Using additional laboratory experiments, a mortality model was developed and parameterized. It showed that the overall prey mortality of size-structured prey can be adequately predicted with a composite functional response model that modelled the individual functional responses of each prey stage separately and accounted for their cannibalistic interaction. 6. Thus, treating a prey population as a homogeneous entity will lead to erroneous predictions in most real-world food webs. However, if we account for the effects of size structure and the intraspecific interactions on functional responses by treating size classes as different functional groups, it is possible to reliably predict the dynamics of size-structured predator-prey systems. 3acannibalism 3afield experimentation 3afood webs 3afunctional response models 3alaboratory experimentation 3alarvae 3amortality 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 3aprediction 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBody Size 2aCannibalism 2aFood Chain 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aLogistic Models 2aModels, Biological 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aPredatory Behavior 2aTime Factors 0adensity-dependent predation 0aindirect interactions 0aintraguild predation 0aintraspecific predation 0apredator-prey dynamics 0astage structur0 tJournal of animal ecology.g2008 May, v. 77, no. 3 p.520-528dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-87907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01368.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080418b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01325naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008000127300001600207520059900223650001400822650002200836650002500858653002500883773008500908852000900993930003301002945001301035946001101048655001201059IND2201720920221120142213.0991123e199804  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220172092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHillis, W.E.10aDeposits in heartshakes in wood. 2.

  1 aFarajian, P.10aObesity indices in relation to cardiovascular disease risk factors among young adult female students  ap. 918-924.  a2019-12-04  aThe objective of the present study was to compare the percentage of body fat (%BF), BMI, and central fat distribution anthropometric measures as indices of obesity and to assess the respective associations with cardiovascular risk factors in young female students. Subjects were 220 healthy Greek female students. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to estimate %BF, anthropometric measurements were obtained and blood samples were analysed for CVD risk factors. Results showed that 48·6 % of students had increased adiposity, while a considerable proportion was characterised by central fat distribution irrespective of the anthropometric index used. The proportion of subjects with at least one metabolic risk factor present was 60·4 %. Although %BF was not associated with any of the CVD risk factors, waist circumference, waist:hip ratio and waist:height ratio were all associated with CVD risk factors. Higher levels of these anthropometric variables demonstrated higher prevalence of CVD risk factors. The lack of association between %BF and CVD risk factors could be attributed to the fact that females with undesirable adiposity had a tendency for the gynaecoid type of obesity. In contrast, the present results suggest that central body fat distribution in young women may reflect increased risk due to high visceral and particularly intra-abdominal fat levels. Recent epidemiological data from Greece show a high prevalence of overweight and obesity in young adults. Therefore, assessing the risk for the presence of CVD risk factors is of particular importance. Central obesity anthropometric indices seem to be valuable screening tools for young women. 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3avisceral fat 3acardiovascular diseases 3awomen 3arisk factors 3awaist circumference 3ayoung adults 3arisk assessment 3acollege students 3aheight 3aobesity 3aabdominal fat 3awaist-to-hip ratio 3abody mass index 2aAbsorptiometry, Photon 2aAdult 2aArea Under Curve 2aBody Composition 2aBody Fat Distribution 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxphysiopathology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIntra-Abdominal Fat 2aObesityxphysiopathology 2aRisk Factors 2aStudents 2aWaist-Hip Ratio 3aGreece 0aanthropometric measurements 0abody composition 0abody fat1 aRenti, E.1 aManios, Y.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2008 Apr., v. 99, no. 4 p.918-924x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20080619b20080704c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/06/05  aNon-US 7aarticle01618naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008400125300001300209520083800222650001601060650000901076650002001085650002001105650001601125650001501141650001201156773008201168852000901250930003301259945001301292946001101305655001201316IND2124014520221120142044.0980715e199311  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212401452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilitz, H.14aThe enzymatic decomposition of neural and acid polysaccharides from spruce wood  ap. 9-22.  aFinely ground spruce wood (Picea abies (L.)

In order to highlight the key parameters facilitating or hindering the thick slicing process, several factors affecting the cutting forces and the cut surface quality have been studied; the blade geometry, the effect of friction, the cutting speed, the boundary load constraints and the wood moisture content. The results indicate that a large proportion of the cutting force may be related to the wedging action of the blade in the wood. Therefore, significant reductions in the cutting energy can be achieved by optimising the blade shape. A simple homogeneous strain model has been developed which quantifies the cutting forces in terms of the blade angle and the blade surface friction. The results from this theoretical model are compared with the experimental findings and discussed in relation to methods for improving the cutting technique. 3awood 3agrain and figure 3aslicing 3aknives 3aPinus radiata1 aMcCallion, H.0 tWood science and technology.g1996 Nov., v. 30, no. 6 p.397-410x0043-77197nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle03175naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001500163245010000178300001600278500001500294520165300309650002301962650001001985650002701995650001202022650002002034650001602054650002802070650001102098650001502109650001002124650000902134650001602143650001902159650001102178650002202189650001102211650001602222650002302238650002502261650000902286650001602295651001802311651001802329653001602347653001902363700001702382700002202399773008602421852000902507930003302516945002502549946001102574655001202585IND4404542420221120142004.0080418e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440454242DNAL7 a180423062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A total of 699 lifetime members of Weight Watchers represented the national sample and 217 additional lifetime members served as an oversample. Lifetime members were asked to self-report their current weight 1, 2, and 5 years after they had successfully completed the programme. Additional lifetime members served as an oversample whose weights were measured. The discrepancy between reported and measured weight in the oversample was used to adjust the self-reported weights of the national sample. Seventy-one percent of participants were middle-aged or older and 95·3 % were female; their mean starting BMI was 27·6 (sd 3·6) kg/m2. The percentage of Weight Watchers lifetime members who maintained at least 5 % of their weight loss 1, 2 and 5 years after successful completion of the programme was 79·8, 71·0, and 50·0, respectively. The percentage of participants who remained below their goal weight 1, 2 and 5 years after completion of the programme was 26·5, 20·5, and 16·2, respectively. Results obtained with this group of successful Weight Watchers members are not directly comparable to those obtained with clinical samples of obese dieters because the current sample comprises only the most successful Weight Watchers participants. However, these results provide further evidence that maintenance of weight loss in those who successfully lose weight in one commercial weight-loss programme is more feasible than data from clinical populations have suggested. 3atemporal variation 3awomen 3ageographical variation 3aobesity 3abody mass index 3aweight loss 3aweight control programs 3aadults 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBody Weight 2aDiet, Reducing 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutritional Status 2aPsychotherapy, Group 2aTime 2aWeight Loss 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0abody weight 0aweight control1 aKral, T.V.E.1 aMiller-Kovach, K.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2008 Apr., v. 99, no. 4 p.925-930x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20080618b20080704c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/06/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02296naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245014300168300001600311520123500327653001801562653003101580653002001611653003001631700001701661700001801678700001701696773012201713852000901835856009201844930003301936946001301969655001201982IND4404551120221120141928.0080418e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440455112DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05215.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSnook, L.A.10aCo-expression of mu and delta opioid receptors as receptor-G protein fusions enhances both mu and delta signalling via distinct mechanisms  ap. 865-873.  aMu and delta opioid receptors (MORs and DORs) were co-expressed as fusion proteins between a receptor and a pertussis insensitive mutant Gαi/o protein in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Signalling efficiency was then monitored following inactivation of endogenous Gαi/o proteins by pertussis toxin. Co-expression resulted in increased delta opioid signalling which was insensitive to the mu specific antagonist d-Phe-Cys-Tyr- d-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH₂. Under these conditions, mu opioid signalling was also increased and insensitive to the delta specific antagonist Tic-deltorphin. In this latter case, however, no G protein activation was observed in the presence of the delta specific inverse agonist N,N(CH3)₂-Dmt-Tic-NH₂. When a MOR fused to a non-functional Gα subunit was co-expressed with the DOR-Gα protein fusion, delta opioid signalling was not affected whereas mu opioid signalling was restored. Altogether our results suggest that increased delta opioid signalling is due to enhanced DOR coupling to its tethered Gα subunit. On the other hand, our data indicate that increased mu opioid signalling requires an active conformation of the DOR and also results in activation of the Gα subunit fused the DOR. 0aco-expression 0aG protein-coupled receptor 0aopioid receptor 0areceptor-G protein fusion1 aMilligan, G.1 aKieffer, B.L.1 aMassotte, D.0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2008 May, v. 105, no. 3 p.865-873dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05215.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080418b20080502c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02623naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245015600172300001600328520150900344653001001853653001001863653000901873653002901882653000801911653001101919700001901930700002001949700001501969700002001984773012202004852000902126856009202135930003302227946001302260655001202273IND4404550720221120141941.0080418e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440455072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05186.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTyan, Shiaw-Wei10aSerum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 enhances zif268 expression through the mediation of SRF and CREB1 associated with spatial memory formation  ap. 820-832.  aSerum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) has been shown to play an important role in spatial memory formation, but the molecular mechanism underlying this effect of SGK1 was not known. zif268 is an immediate early gene that is induced by water maze learning. To investigate the role of SGK1 in the regulation of zif268 expression, the dominant negative mutant of SGK1, SGK1 S422A, was infused to the hippocampal CA1 area of rats, and was found to decrease significantly the mRNA level of zif268 in both naïve animals and trained animals. SGK1 was also found to phosphorylate serum response factor (SRF) at Ser73, Ser75, and Ser99, and phosphorylate CREB1 at Ser133. Inhibition of SGK1 phosphorylation sites on SRF and CREB1 with alanine substitution significantly diminished SGK1-enhanced zif268 expression in the promoter-luciferase assay. SGK1 also phosphorylates Elk-1 and SGK1 phosphorylation of Elk-1 decreased the transcriptional activity of Elk-1. But SGK1 phosphorylation of Elk-1 did not affect SGK1-enhanced zif268 expression. Moreover, the phosphorylation of SGK1 was increased in rat CA1 area after water maze learning, accompanied by increased phosphorylation of SRF at Ser99 and increased phosphorylation of CREB1 at Ser133. All these effects were antagonized by SGK1 S422A transfection. These results together suggest that SGK1 enhances zif268 expression through the mediation of SRF and CREB1, and these signaling pathways are associated with spatial memory formation in rats. 0aCREB1 0aElk-1 0aSGK1 0aspatial memory formation 0aSRF 0azif2681 aTsai, Ming-Chi1 aLin, Chien-Ling1 aMa, Yun-Li1 aLee, Eminy H.Y.0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2008 May, v. 105, no. 3 p.820-832dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05186.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080418b20080502c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03961naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245017300188300001600361520138900377650001501766650001201781650007201793650003301865650002201898650002301920650004801943650005801991650002502049650002902074650003002103650005602133650005602189650000902245650004902254650004902303650000902352650002102361650003402382650002402416650005202440650005902492650002002551650003302571650002702604650004902631653001502680653002402695653001702719653002102736700002102757700002002778700002402798700002302822700002102845700002002866700002002886700001802906700002502924700002102949773012202970852000903092856009203101930003303193946001303226655001203239IND4404551720221120142035.0080418e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440455172DNAL7 a181820442pmid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05207.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbi, Daisuke10aSocial isolation rearing-induced impairment of the hippocampal neurogenesis is associated with deficits in spatial memory and emotion-related behaviors in juvenile mice  ap. 921-932.  aExperiences during brain development may influence the pathogenesis of developmental disorders. Thus, social isolation (SI) rearing after weaning is a useful animal model for studying the pathological mechanisms of such psychiatric diseases. In this study, we examined the effect of SI on neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) relating to memory and emotion-related behaviors. When newly divided cells were labeled with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) before SI, the number of BrdU-positive cells and the rate of differentiation into neurons were significantly decreased after 4-week SI compared with those in group-housed mice. Repeated treatment of fluoxetine prevented the SI-induced impairment of survival of newly divided cells and ameliorated spatial memory impairment and part of aggression in SI mice. Furthermore, we investigated the changes in gene expression in the DG of SI mice by using DNA microarray and real-time PCR. We finally found that SI reduced the expression of development-related genes Nurr1 and Npas4. These findings suggest that communication in juvenile is important in the survival and differentiation of newly divided cells, which may be associated with memory and aggression, and raise the possibility that the reduced expression of Nurr1 and/or Npas4 may contribute to the impairment of neurogenesis and memory and aggression induced by SI. 3aaggression 2aAnimals 2aBasic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 2aBromodeoxyuridine 2aCell Proliferation 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDentate Gyrusxgrowth & developmentxphysiopathology. 2aEmotionsxphysiology 2aFluoxetinexpharmacology 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxgenetics 2aHippocampusxgrowth & developmentxphysiopathology. 2aMale 2aMemory Disordersxgeneticsxphysiopathology. 2aMental Disordersxgeneticsxphysiopathology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred ICR 2aNeuronal Plasticityxgenetics 2aNeuronsxphysiology 2aNuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 2 2aSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitorsxpharmacology. 2aSocial Behavior 2aSocial Isolationxpsychology 2aStem Cellsxphysiology 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0afluoxetine 0alearning and memory 0aneurogenesis 0asocial isolation1 aTakuma, Kazuhiro1 aKoike, Hiroyuki1 aMizoguchi, Hiroyuki1 aTsuritani, Katsuki1 aKuwahara, Yusuke1 aKamei, Hiroyuki1 aNagai, Takashi.1 aYoneda, Yukio1 aNabeshima, Toshitaka1 aYamada, Kiyofumi0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2008 May, v. 105, no. 3 p.921-932dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05207.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080418b20080502c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02637naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245012400173300001600297520153600313650001201849650001701861653003701878653002501915653001401940653001401954700002101968700002201989700001902011773012202030852000902152856009202161930003302253946001302286655001202299IND4404550620221120141918.0080418e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440455062DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05176.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalbot, Janet D.10aRapid, stimulation-induced reduction of C₁₂-resorufin in motor nerve terminals: linkage to mitochondrial metabolism  ap. 807-819.  aThe Alamar blue (resazurin) assay of cell viability monitors the irreversible reduction of non-fluorescent resazurin to fluorescent resorufin. This study focused on the reversible reduction of C₁₂-resorufin to non-fluorescent C₁₂-dihydroresorufin in motor nerve terminals innervating lizard intercostal muscles. Resting C₁₂-resorufin fluorescence decreased when the activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) was accelerated with carbonyl cyanide m-chloro phenyl hydrazone, and increased when ETC activity was inhibited with cyanide. Trains of action potentials (50 Hz for 20-50 s), which reversibly decreased NADH fluorescence and partially depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential, produced a reversible decrease in C₁₂-resorufin fluorescence which had a similar time course. The stimulation-induced decrease in C₁₂-resorufin fluorescence was blocked by inhibitors of ETC complexes I, III, and IV and by carbonyl cyanide m-chloro phenyl hydrazone, but not by inhibiting mitochondrial ATP synthesis with oligomycin. Mitochondrial depolarization and the decreases in C₁₂-resorufin and NADH fluorescence depended on Ca²⁺ influx into the terminal, but not on vesicular transmitter release. These results suggest that the reversible reduction of C₁₂-resorufin in stimulated motor nerve terminals is linked, directly or indirectly, to the reversible oxidation of NADH and to Ca²⁺ influx into mitochondria, and provides an assay for rapid changes in motor terminal metabolism. 3acalcium 3amitochondria 0amitochondrial membrane potential 0amotor nerve terminal 0aresazurin 0aresorufin1 aBarrett, John N.1 aBarrett, Ellen F.1 aDavid, Gavriel0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2008 May, v. 105, no. 3 p.807-819dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05176.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080418b20080502c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03645naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245011700186300001600303520140600319650001901725650001201744650004201756650004401798650005501842650004601897650003701943650007401980650005802054650002702112650000902139650000902148650002402157650004102181650005402222650004802276650007002324650005802394650005102452650001702503650005802520653001002578653003102588653001702619653002002636653005502656700001902711700002402730700001702754773013702771852000902908856009202917930003303009946001303042655001203055IND4404550420221120142031.0080418e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440455042DNAL7 a180883752pmid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05180.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUeki, Yumi10aSTAT3 activation in photoreceptors by leukemia inhibitory factor is associated with protection from light damage  ap. 784-796.  aMembers of the interleukin-6 cytokine family, including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), signal through gp130. The neuroprotective role of gp130 activation has been widely demonstrated in both CNS and PNS, but the mechanism by which this is accomplished is not well established. We investigated temporal and cell-specific activation of signaling pathways induced by LIF in the mature mouse retina. Intravitreal injection of LIF preserved photoreceptor function and prevented photoreceptor cell death from light-induced oxidative damage in a dose-dependent manner (2 days post-injection). A therapeutic dose of LIF induced rapid and sustained activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3. Activated STAT3 was localized to all the retinal neurons and glial cells, including photoreceptors. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 was robust but transient in Müller glial cells, and undetectable at the time of light exposure. Akt was not activated by LIF. We also show that at the time of neuroprotection, STAT3 but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 or the Akt pathways was active in LIF-treated retinas, and activated STAT3 was clearly localized in transcriptionally active areas of photoreceptor nuclei. Our data suggest that photoreceptor protection in response to LIF can be directly mediated by activation of STAT3 in photoreceptors. 3aphotoreceptors 2aAnimals 2aCell Deathxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCell Nucleusxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCytokine Receptor gp130xdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCytoprotectionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aExtracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinasesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aLeukemia Inhibitory Factorxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aLightxadverse effects 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aNeurogliaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aNeuroprotective Agentsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPhotoreceptor Cellsxdrug effectsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aSTAT3 Transcription Factorxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTime Factors 2aTranscriptional Activationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0agp130 0aLeukemia inhibitory factor 0alight damage 0aneuroprotection 0asignal transducer and activator of transcription 31 aWang, Jiangang1 aChollangi, Srinivas1 aAsh, John D.0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2008 May, v. 105, no. 3 p.784-796dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:28254x1474-16447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05180.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080418b20080502c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02741naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110040001800130100001700148245010200165300002000267300002500287500001500312520112200327650001701449650001701466650001801483650001501501650002001516650001101536650001401547650001801561650002801579650002201607650006001629650002001689650004201709650004001751650001601791650001301807650002101820650005801841650002301899650003201922650002501954653001501979700001701994773014502011852000902156939003302165946001302198655001202211IND9203157620221120104244.0920519e19911215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920315762DNAL7 a16623872pmid7 aPMC530972pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarkla, B.J.10aIdentification of a 170-kDa protein associated with the vacuolar Na+/H+ antiport of Beta vulgaris  ap. 11177-11181.  ap. 11177-11181. ill.  a2019-12-05  aThe effect of the addition of amiloride to the growth medium was tested on the Na+/H+ antiport activity of tonoplast vesicles isolated from sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) cell suspensions. Cells grown in the presence of NaCl and amiloride displayed an increased antiport activity. Analysis of the kinetic data showed that while the affinity of the antiport for Na+ ions did not change, the maximal velocity of the Na+/H+ exchange increased markedly. These results suggest the addition of more antiport molecules to the tonoplast and/or an increase in the turnover rate of the Na+/H+ exchange. The increase in activity of the antiport by the presence of amiloride was correlated with the enhanced synthesis of a tonoplast 170-kDa polypeptide. The increased synthesis of this polypeptide was detected not only upon exposure of the cells to amiloride but also when the cells were exposed to high NaCl concentrations. Polyclonal antibodies against the 170-kDa polypeptide almost completely inhibited the antiport activity. These results suggest the association of the 170-kDa polypeptide with the vacuolar Na+/H+ antiport. 3apolypeptides 3abiosynthesis 3ahydrogen ions 3aantibodies 3acation exchange 3asodium 3atonoplast 3aBeta vulgaris 2aAmiloridexpharmacology 2aBlotting, Western 2aCarrier Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCells, Cultured 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aImmune Sera 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Weight 2aPlant Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aSodium-Hydrogen Exchangers. 2aVacuolesxmetabolism 0ainhibitors1 aBlumwald, E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1991 Dec. 15, v. 88, no. 24 p.11177-11181x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04005naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001900163245023200182300001600414500001500430520171600445650000902161650001802170650001002188650002302198650001902221650002202240650002002262650001502282650002602297650001202323650002102335650001002356650004702366650001902413650005802432650000902490650004302499650001102542650004002553650001102593650003702604650001602641650006202657650002402719650003202743650003402775650003802809650001702847651001102864651002602875653002602901653002202927653001402949653002002963700001602983700001902999700002003018700001703038700002603055773011003081852000903191930003303200945002503233946001303258655001203271IND4404594420221120104252.0080418e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440459442DNAL7 a184246052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHedelin, Maria10aDietary Phytoestrogens Are Not Associated with Risk of Overall Breast Cancer But Diets Rich in Coumestrol Are Inversely Associated with Risk of Estrogen Receptor and Progesterone Receptor Negative Breast Tumors in Swedish Women  ap. 938-945.  a2019-12-04  aResults from epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that phytoestrogens may protect against breast cancer. Because one of the biological effects of phytoestrogens is probably estrogenic, it's possible that the preventive effect on breast cancer differs by estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) status of the tumor. We evaluated the associations between dietary phytoestrogen (isoflavonoids, lignans, and coumestrol) intake and risk of breast cancer and whether the ER/PR statuses of the tumor influence this relationship. In 1991-2 a prospective population-based cohort study among Swedish pre- and postmenopausal women was performed, making questionnaire data available for 45,448 women. A total of 1014 invasive breast cancers were diagnosed until December 2004. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to estimate multivariate risk ratios, 95% CI for associations with risk of breast cancer. Intakes of lignan, isoflavonoid, or coumestrol were not associated with breast cancer risk overall or before or after 50 y of age. The effects of lignans or isoflavonoids were independent of receptor status. However, intake of coumestrol was associated with decreased risk of receptor negative tumors (ER-PR-) but not positive tumors. The risk of ER-PR- tumors was significantly lower (50%) in women with intermediate coumestrol intake compared with those who did not consume any. In conclusion, we found no association between intake of isoflavonoids or lignans and breast cancer risk. Our results of a decreased risk of ER-PR- tumors in women with intermediate intake of coumestrol could be due to chance because of the low intake. The results should be confirmed in other studies. 3adiet 3aisoflavonoids 3awomen 3adisease prevention 3acohort studies 3ahormone receptors 3arisk assessment 3acoumestrol 3aestrogenic properties 3alignans 3abreast neoplasms 2aAdult 2aBreast Neoplasmsxchemistryxepidemiology. 2aCohort Studies 2aCoumestrolxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aDiet 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aFlavonoidsxadministration & dosage 2aHumans 2aLignansxadministration & dosage 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhytoestrogensxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aProspective Studies 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aReceptors, Estrogenxanalysis 2aReceptors, Progesteronexanalysis 2aRisk Factors 3aSweden 0aSwedenxepidemiology. 0aprogesterone receptor 0aestrogen receptor 0areceptors 0aplant estrogens1 aLöf, Marie1 aOlsson, Marita1 aAdlercreutz, H.1 aSandin, Sven1 aWeiderpass, Elisabete0 tJournal of nutrition.g2008 May, v. 138, no. 5 p.938-945dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20080904b20081011c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/07/19  aOther US 7aarticle02584naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072002000110100001700130245014200147300001600289500002800305520156000333650001601893650001301909650001601922650002701938650001401965650001301979650001801992650000902010650001302019653002602032653001402058700001802072773011002090852000902200946001302209655001202222IND4404594220221120104246.0080418s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440459422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

   1 aMiller, Rita10aCarboxyl Ester Lipase from Either Mother's Milk or the Pancreas Is Required for Efficient Dietary Triglyceride Digestion in Suckling Mice  ap. 927-930.  aPublisher supplied data  aBecause dietary fats provide an important source of energy in the newborn, the efficient digestion of dietary fats is critical to their well-being. Despite the importance of dietary fat digestion, newborns have a deficiency of pancreatic triglyceride lipase, the predominant digestive lipase in adults. The efficient dietary fat digestion in newborns suggests that other lipases must compensate for the lack of pancreatic triglyceride lipase. In this study, we test the hypothesis that breast milk, pancreatic carboxyl ester lipase (CEL), or both contribute to dietary fat digestion in the newborn. To test this hypothesis, we determined the amount and composition of fecal fat in wild-type and CEL-deficient newborns nursed by either wild-type or CEL-deficient dams. We tested all genetic permutations of the nursing pairs. An interaction between the genotype of the dam and of the pup determined the amount of fecal fat (P < 0.001). Fecal fat was highest in CEL-deficient pups nursed by CEL-deficient dams. Furthermore, only the feces from the CEL-deficient pups nursed by CEL-deficient dams contained undigested lipids. Even with increased fecal fats, the CEL-deficient pups had normal weight gain. Our results demonstrate that CEL contributes significantly to dietary triglyceride digestion whether it originates from mother's milk or pancreatic secretions. However, only the absence of both mother's milk and pancreatic CEL produces fat maldigestion. The absence of a single CEL source makes no difference in the efficiency of dietary fat absorption. 3abreast milk 3apancreas 3adietary fat 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3adigestion 3aneonates 3aanimal models 3amice 3asuckling 0acarboxyl ester lipase 0afecal fat1 aLowe, Mark E.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2008 May, v. 138, no. 5 p.927-930dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle03373naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002200146245007600168300001600244520139600260650001301656650000901669650001201678650002301690650002301713650002701736650002101763650002601784650001201810650002001822650002001842650001201862650002801874650001401902650001901916650003001935650003101965650002401996650003702020650002002057650002902077650003102106650002002137650002002157650003102177650002402208650003202232650001302264650002502277650002502302650003702327650001002364653003102374700002702405700002102432700002402453700002002477773011002497852000902607930003302616945002502649946001302674655001202687IND4404593420221120101957.0080418e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440459342DNAL7 a184245952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHoppler, Matthias10aFerritin-Iron Is Released during Boiling and In Vitro Gastric Digestion  ap. 878-884.  aBiofortification of staple foods with iron in the form of ferritin-iron is a promising approach to fighting iron-deficiency anemia in developing countries. However, contradictory results regarding iron bioavailability to humans from ferritin are not yet fully clarified. Furthermore, the question has been raised whether ferritin can potentially survive gastric passage intact and be absorbed via a ferritin-specific uptake mechanism. We studied changes of ferritin-iron and protein during cooking and in vitro gastric digestion. Water soluble, native ferritin-iron, measured in different legumes, represented 18% (soybeans) up to maximally 42% (peas) of total seed iron. Ferritin-iron was no longer detectable after boiling the legumes for 50 min in excess water. When the same cooking treatment was applied to recombinant bean ferritin propagated in Escherichia coli, some ferritin-iron remained measurable. During in vitro gastric digestion of recombinant bean ferritin and red kidney bean extract, ferritin-iron was fully released from the protein and dissolved at pH 2. Stability tests at varying pH at 37°C showed that the release of ferritin-iron starts at pH 5 and is complete at pH 2. We concluded that ferritin-iron is efficiently released from the ferritin molecule during cooking and at gastric pH and that it should be absorbed as efficiently as all other nonheme iron in food. 3aferritin 3airon 3aboiling 3ain vitro digestion 3afood fortification 3airon deficiency anemia 3agastric emptying 3aintestinal absorption 3alegumes 3ahuman nutrition 3acooking quality 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aDigestion 2aDrug Stability 2aEdetic Acidxpharmacology 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aFabaceaexchemistry 2aFerritinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFood, Fortified 2aGastric Acidxmetabolism 2aGastric Mucosaxenzymology 2aGene Expression 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aIronxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aPepsin Axmetabolism 2aPhaseolusxchemistry 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSwine 0ain vitro gastric digestion1 aSchönbächler, Andrea1 aMeile, L.q(Leo)1 aHurrell, Richard F.1 aWalczyk, Thomas0 tJournal of nutrition.g2008 May, v. 138, no. 5 p.878-884dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20080806b20080905c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/07/19  aOther US 7aarticle03715naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001600158245004700174300001600221500002400237520199000261650002102251650001502272650000902287650001102296650002302307650001902330650000902349650001102358650001102369650002302380650001402403650001702417650000902434650001202443650001202455650001402467650001002481650001002491650001602501650001102517650001702528650001202545650003102557650002002588650001102608650003102619650000902650650002402659650001802683650002402701650002402725650002302749650002902772700002702801773009102828852000902919856007902928856005803007655001203065IND4389765620221120090934.0070325s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438976562DNAL7 a173796502pmid7 a10.1530/REP-06-02722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmann, R.P.10aCryptorchidism in common eutherian mammals  ap. 541-561.  aIncludes references  aCryptorchidism is failure of one or both testes to descend into the scrotum. Primary fault lies in the testis. We provide a unifying cross-species interpretation of testis descent and urge the use of precise terminology. After differentiation, a testis is relocated to the scrotum in three sequential phases: abdominal translocation, holding a testis near the internal inguinal ring as the abdominal cavity expands away, along with slight downward migration; transinguinal migration, moving a cauda epididymidis and testis through the abdominal wall; and inguinoscrotal migration, moving a s.c. cauda epididymidis and testis to the bottom of the scrotum. The gubernaculum enlarges under stimulation of insulin-like peptide 3, to anchor the testis in place during gradual abdominal translocation. Concurrently, testosterone masculinizes the genitofemoral nerve. Cylindrical downward growth of the peritoneal lining into the gubernaculum forms the vaginal process, cremaster muscle(s) develop within the gubernaculum, and the cranial suspensory ligament regresses (testosterone not obligatory for latter). Transinguinal migration of a testis is rapid, apparently mediated by intra-abdominal pressure. Testosterone is not obligatory for correct inguinoscrotal migration of testes. However, normally testosterone stimulates growth of the vaginal process, secretion of calcitonin gene-related peptide by the genitofemoral nerve to provide directional guidance to the gubernaculum, and then regression of the gubernaculum and constriction of the inguinal canal. Cryptorchidism is more common in companion animals, pigs, or humans (2-12%) than in cattle or sheep (<=1%). Laboratory animals rarely are cryptorchid. In respect to non-scrotal locations, abdominal testes predominate in cats, dogs, and horses. Inguinal testes predominate in rabbits, are common in horses, and occasionally are found in cats and dogs. S.c. testes are found in cattle, cats and dogs, but are most common in humans. 3aabdominal cavity 3acalcitonin 3acats 3acattle 3acauda epididymidis 3acryptorchidism 3adogs 3ahorses 3ahumans 3alaboratory animals 3aligaments 3anerve tissue 3apets 3arabbits 3ascrotum 3asecretion 3asheep 3aswine 3aterminology 3atestes 3atestosterone 2aAnimals 2aCryptorchidismxembryology 2aGestational Age 2aHumans 2aInguinal Canalxembryology 2aMale 2aMammalsxembryology 2aOrganogenesis 2aScrotumxembryology 2aSex Differentiation 2aTestisxembryology 2aTestosteronexphysiology1 aVeeramachaneni, D.N.R.0 tReproduction.g2007 Mar., v. 133, no. 3 p.541-561dBioScientifica Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/REP-06-02723Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.srf-reproduction.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle02155naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100001600181245011600197300001800313500002400331506007600355520035300431506003700784650002900821650001800850650001300868650000900881650001200890650001400902650001200916650004600928650004400974650002701018650001801045650000901063650005501072650002401127650004501151700002301196700002901219700002201248700002401270700002201294700002301316700002301339773011701362852000901479856008001488856004501568655001201613IND4389730920221207125730.0070325s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438973092DNAL7 a172831092pmid7 aPMC18656732pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01785-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Xiaoju14aThe rag Locus of Porphyromonas gingivalis Contributes to Virulence in a Murine Model of Soft Tissue Destruction  ap. 2071-2074.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe rag locus of Porphyromonas gingivalis encodes a putative TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor, RagA, and a 55-kDa immunodominant antigen, RagB.

Based on the results of comparative cytogenetic and molecular studies, the modern rodents can be conventionally classified into two groups with sharply differing directions and tempos of karyotypic evolution. One group (suborders Sciuromorpha, Castorimorpha, and Anomaluromorpha) preserved conserved genomes, which are probably close in structure to the genome of the ancestor of all mammals. The genomes of the other group (suborder Myomorpha) underwent “catastrophic evolution,” which resulted in numerous breaks and fusions of the ancient chromosomes. The current data do not allow unambiguously assigning the order Hystricomorpha to any of these groups. 3achromosomes 3aevolution 3agenome 3arodents1 aLemskaya, N. A. 1 aBeklemisheva, V.

L. 14aThe effect of diazepam on myocardial function and coronary vascular tone after endotoxemia in the isolated rat heart model  ap. 907-913.  aObjective and design Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction. Although initially described solely as a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophage product, evidence exists that cardiac myocytes themselves produce substantial amounts of TNF-α in response to ischemia as well as LPS. The use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors has been shown to decrease LPS-induced TNF-α elaboration. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of diazepam (Type IV phosphodiesterase inhibitor) on (1) myocardial function and (2) coronary vascular flow after LPS-induced endotoxic shock in an isolated rat heart model. Materials and methods Endotoxemia was induced by intraperitoneal LPS administration in adult male Wistar rats. Hearts were isolated after 6 h and perfused in a working mode with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer at 37°C. Diazepam was mixed with Krebs-Henseleit buffer and administered (3.0 μg/ml) for 20 min. Results LPS-treated hearts showed depressed cardiac function and reduced coronary flow. Myocardial functional parameters (LVDP, +dP/dt, −dP/dt, RPP) and coronary flow (ml/min) were significantly (p < 0.01) improved by diazepam administration. Conclusions These findings suggest that diazepam can salvage myocardial function and undo coronary vascular constriction in the endotoxemic rat heart. These findings are clinically relevant to the treatment of cardiovascular depression caused by endotoxic shock. 3aendotoxemia 3adiazepam 2aAnimals 2aCoronary Circulationxdrug effects 2aCoronary Vesselsxdrug effects 2aDiazepamxpharmacology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEndotoxemiaxchemically inducedxphysiopathology. 2aGABA Modulatorsxpharmacology 2aHeartxdrug effectsxphysiopathology. 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aMale 2aMyocardiumxmetabolism 2aPhosphodiesterase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aRegional Blood Flow 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxmetabolism 0aHeart rat model1 aHodge, Andrew J. 0 tInflammation research .g2010 Nov., v. 59, no. 11 p.907-913dBasel : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx1023-38307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00011-010-0239-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20101001b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02701naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245011900187300001600306520112500322650001601447650001701463650001701480650001201497650001101509650003401520650002401554650001101578650001101589650003701600650005301637650001601690650002101706650001301727650001801740650004301758653001901801653001701820700002401837700002301861700002701884700002801911773011801939852000902057856008502066930003302151946001102184655001202195IND4443233420221120050504.0101001e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444323342DNAL7 a204736302pmid7 a10.1007/s00011-010-0211-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBharadwaj, Satish 10aInflammatory responses improve with milk ribonuclease-enriched lactoferrin supplementation in postmenopausal women  ap. 971-978.  aObjective and design A 6-month, randomized clinical study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a ribonuclease-enriched lactoferrin (R-ELF) supplement on the circulating cytokine levels and bone health of postmenopausal women. Subjects Thirty-eight healthy postmenopausal women, aged 45-60 years, were randomized into placebo and R-ELF groups. Treatment The R-ELF group was supplemented with R-ELF (2 × 125 mg/day) and calcium (100% RDA), while the placebo group received only the calcium supplement. Methods Serum levels of receptor activator for NF-κB ligand (RANKL), C-reactive protein (CRP) and various pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were determined by ELISA. Results Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α decreased significantly (−44 and −10%, respectively) while anti-inflammatory IL-10 increased (140%) due to R-ELF supplementation at the end of study. RANKL and CRP were modestly reduced (−50%) relative to their placebo levels, although RANKL elevated initially. Conclusions R-ELF supplementation showed beneficial effects towards improvement of inflammatory status in postmenopausal women. 3alactoferrin 3aosteoporosis 3ainflammation 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCytokinesxbloodximmunology. 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInflammationxbloodximmunology. 2aLactoferrinxadministration & dosagexchemistry. 2aMiddle Aged 2aMilkxenzymology 2aPlacebos 2aPostmenopause 2aRibonucleasesxadministration & dosage 0aPostmenopausal 0aRibonuclease1 aNaidu, Tezus A.

The characteristics of HePC incorporation into the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 were investigated in order to understand its oral absorption mechanism. The results provide evidence for the involvement of a carrier-mediated mechanism, since the association of HePC at the apical pole of Caco-2 cells was (1) saturable as a function of time with a rapid initial incorporation over 5 min followed by a more gradual increase; (2) saturable as a function of concentration over the range studied (2-200 μM) with a saturable component which followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (apparent K m 15.7 μmol/L, V max 39.2 nmol/mg protein/h) and a nonspecific diffusion component; (3) partially inhibited by low temperature and ATP depletion, indicating the temperature and energy-dependence of the uptake process. Moreover, we demonstrated, by an albumin back-extraction method, that HePC is internalized via translocation from the outer to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and that HePC may preferentially diffuse through intact raft microdomains. In conclusion, our results suggest that incorporation of HePC at the apical membrane of Caco-2 cells may occur through a passive diffusion followed by a translocation in the inner membrane leaflet through an active carrier-mediated mechanism. 3aabsorption 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aalbumins 3aenzyme kinetics 3aepithelial cells 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aphospholipids 3aplasma membrane 3atemperature 3avisceral leishmaniasis1 aBuyse, Marion1 aFarinotti, Robert1 aBarratt, Gillian0 tLipids.g2007 Apr., v. 42, no. 3 p.229-240dSpringer-Verlagx0024-42017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-007-3026-83electronic resource 7aarticle02163naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245005700130300001600187520129200203650000901495650002801504650001301532650001901545650001501564650001101579650002401590650002501614700001501639700002001654773008501674852000901759930003301768945001301801946001101814655001201825IND2151386820221120050333.0980812e199606  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND215138682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCouturier, M.F.10aThermophysical properties of wood-polymer composites  ap. 179-196.  aTheoretical models are proposed for predicting the longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivities of wood-polymer composites. The predictions of the models are in good agreement with the measured thermal conductivities of red maple boards impregnated with either polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate or polyfurfuryl alcohol. The density, heat capacity, transverse thermal conductivity and longitudinal thermal conductivity of the red maple boards were 589 kg/m3, 1290 J/kg K, 0.155 W/mK and 0.358 W/mK, respectively. Polymer impregnation moderately altered the thermophysical properties of the boards. The increase in density of the boards ranged from 60% to 79%, the increase in transverse thermal conductivity ranged from 12% to 33%, the increase in longitudinal thermal conductivity ranged from 3% to 13% and the decrease in heat capacity ranged from 3% to 11%. Polystyrene provided the largest increase in density whereas polymethyl methacrylate yielded the greatest increase in thermal conductivity and the largest decrease in heat capacity. Treatment with polyfurfuryl alcohol caused the samples to swell and resulted in the lowest increases in thermal conductivity and density. On average the thermal diffusivity of the composites was 26% smaller than that of the parent wood. 3awood 3acomposite wood products 3apolymers 3apolymerization 3aprediction 3amodels 3athermal diffusivity 3athermal conductivity1 aGeorge, K.1 aSchneider, M.H.0 tWood science and technology.g1996 June, v. 30, no. 3 p.179-196x0043-77197nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle04022naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100001700181245013700198300001800335500002400353500001500377506007600392520166200468506003702130650002102167650001202188650001402200650001302214650000902227650002902236650003302265650001602298650001002314650003102324650001202355650003302367650004002400650004002440650002702480650002602507650002702533650002802560650004402588650002802632650000902660650002302669650001902692650001702711650006302728650003802791650006302829650004102892650003102933650003602964653001303000700001603013700001903029700002503048773011703073852000903190856008003199856004503279655001203324IND4389726020221207124559.0070325s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438972602DNAL7 a172203092pmid7 aPMC18656762pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01371-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Haijun10aPneumococcal Capsular Polysaccharide Vaccine-Mediated Protection against Serotype 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae in Immunodeficient Mice  ap. 1643-1650.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (PPS) vaccines are less immunogenic in immunocompromised than immunocompetent individuals. However, neither the efficacy of PPS vaccines in immunocompromised individuals nor the host cellular subsets required for vaccine efficacy against pneumococcal disease have been directly investigated. In this study, we vaccinated CD4-deficient (CD4⁻/⁻), CD8-deficient (CD8⁻/⁻), and secretory immunoglobulin M-deficient (sIgM⁻/⁻) mice and wild-type C57BL/6 (Wt) mice with a conjugate of PPS of serotype 3 and tetanus toxoid (PPS3-TT) and determined the antibody response and efficacy of vaccination against systemic and pulmonary challenge with serotype 3 pneumococcus in immunized and control mice. Our results showed that the isotype and predominant IgG subclass of the PPS3 response differed between immunodeficient mouse strains and between immunodeficient and Wt mice, with CD8⁻/⁻ mice having the most robust response. Vaccination protected Wt, CD4⁻/⁻, and sIgM⁻/⁻ mice from death resulting from both systemic and pulmonary challenge, whereas CD8⁻/⁻ mice were protected only from systemic and not from pulmonary challenge. Passive vaccination with PPS3-TT-induced sera from Wt, CD4⁻/⁻, CD8⁻/⁻, and sIgM⁻/⁻ mice protected naïve Wt mice from death due to pulmonary challenge; however, CD8⁻/⁻ mice were not protected by sera from Wt or CD8⁻/⁻ mice. Our findings suggest that PPS-based vaccines can be effective in the setting of CD4 T-cell deficiency but that CD8 T cells could be required for vaccine-mediated protection against pulmonary challenge with serotype 3 pneumococcus.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aimmunoglobulin G 3atetanus 3aserotypes 3avaccines 3amice 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aimmunocompromised population 3avaccination 3adeath 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aCD4 Antigensxgeneticsximmunology. 2aCD8 Antigensxgeneticsximmunology. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aImmunization, Passive 2aImmunocompromised Host 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aImmunoglobulin Mxgeneticsximmunology. 2aLymphocytesximmunology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aPhagocytosis 2aPneumococcal Infectionsximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aPneumococcal Vaccinesximmunology 2aPneumonia, Pneumococcalximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aStreptococcus pneumoniaeximmunology 2aTetanus Toxoidximmunology 2aVaccines, Conjugateximmunology 0aisotypes1 aGroner, Avi1 aBoes, Marianne1 aPirofski, Liise-anne0 tInfection and immunity.g2007 Apr., v. 75, no. 4 p.1643-1650dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01371-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://iai.asm.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle02220naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245006300206300001800269506007600287520096700363506003701330650001601367650001101383650001101394650001601405650002001421650001001441650001401451650003701465700002001502773017401522852000901696856008301705930003301788946001301821655001201834IND4391003620221207115502.0070506e20070417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439100362DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06091441042doi7 aPMC18718212pmcid7 a174204722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, Andrew D.12aA cationic host displaying positive cooperativity in water  ap. 6538-6543.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe affinity of guanidinium and Cu(II) containing hosts for polycarboxylate guests is studied in water by using UV-visible spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. By combining a Cu(II) coordination site and a diguanidinium moiety around a single scaffold it is found that the Gibbs free-energy release upon binding is greater than could be expected based on the sum of the free energy released by the binding functional groups when operating in isolation. This effect is known as positive cooperativity and has rarely been observed with synthetic hosts in water. The isothermal titration calorimetry data suggest that the source of this positive cooperativity is enthalpic in origin. We propose that covalently positioning the cationic binding moieties in close proximity destabilizes the unbound host, and thereby the stabilizing effect of binding the anionic carboxylates is exothermic and also, the source of positive cooperativity observed herein.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acalorimetry 3acopper 3aenergy 3aguanidinium 3aheat production 3ahosts 3atitration 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aAnslyn, Eric V.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Apr. 17, v. 104, no. 16 p.6538-6543dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06091441043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03921naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201100002500218245012000243300001800363500001500381506007600396520182700472506003702299650002502336650002602361650002002387650001702407650002402424650002102448650002902469650001002498650001802508650002802526650001902554653001402573653001502587653002002602653001502622653001402637700002202651700001702673700002002690700002202710700001802732700001902750700002002769700002102789700001402810700001702824700003002841700002102871700001802892773017402910852000903084856008303093930003303176945002503209946001303234655001203247IND4390463120221207115501.0070416e20070410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439046312DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06116291042doi7 aPMC18499622pmcid7 a174204802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The "omics" approach integrates transcriptome and metabolome data into a single data set and can lead to the identification of unknown genes and their regulatory networks involved in metabolic pathways of interest. One of the intriguing, although poorly described metabolic pathways in plants is the biosynthesis of glucosinolates (GSLs), a group of bioactive secondary products derived from amino acids that are found in the family Brassicaceae. Here we report the discovery of two R2R3-Myb transcription factors that positively control the biosynthesis of GSLs in Arabidopsis thaliana by an integrated omics approach. Combined transcriptome coexpression analysis of publicly available, condition-independent data and the condition-specific (i.e., sulfur-deficiency) data identified Myb28 and Myb29 as candidate transcription factor genes specifically involved in the regulation of aliphatic GSL production. Analysis of a knockout mutant and ectopic expression of the gene demonstrated that Myb28 is a positive regulator for basal-level production of aliphatic GSLs. Myb29 presumably plays an accessory function for methyl jasmonate-mediated induction of a set of aliphatic GSL biosynthetic genes. Overexpression of Myb28 in Arabidopsis-cultured suspension cells, which do not normally synthesize GSLs, resulted in the production of large amounts of GSLs, suggesting the possibility of efficient industrial production of GSLs by manipulation of these transcription factors. A working model for regulation of GSL production involving these genes, renamed Production of Methionine-Derived Glucosinolate (PMG) 1 and 2, are postulated.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 3abiosynthesis 3agene overexpression 3amethyl jasmonate 3atranscription (genetics) 3agenes 3atranscriptome 3acell suspension culture 3aglucosinolates 0aPMG2 gene 0aMyb28 gene 0agene expression 0aMyb29 gene 0aPMG1 gene1 aSugiyama, Kenjiro1 aSawada, Yuji1 aTohge, Takayuki1 aObayashi, Takeshi1 aSuzuki, Akane1 aAraki, Ryoichi1 aSakurai, Nozomu1 aSuzuki, Hideyuki1 aAoki, Koh1 aGoda, Hideki1 aNishizawa, Osamu Ishizaki1 aShibata, Daisuke1 aSaito, Kazuki0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Apr. 10, v. 104, no. 15 p.6478-6483dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06116291043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070828b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/28  aOther US 7aarticle02842naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001400161245009400175300001800269520164300287650002101930650001601951650001801967650001301985650001601998650001502014650001602029650002702045650001902072650002002091650001502111650002002126650001202146651001102158700001502169700001802184700001602202773008802218852000902306930003302315945002502348946001102373655001202384IND4376431920221120024446.0051202e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437643192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aStrom, L.10aOrganic acid behaviour in a calcareous soil implications for rhizosphere nutrient cycling  ap. 2046-2054.  aCalcareous soils are frequently characterized by the low bioavailability of plant nutrients. Consequently, many vascular plant species are unable to successfully colonize calcareous sites and the floristic composition of calcareous and acid silicate soils has been shown to differ markedly. The root exudation of oxalate and citrate has been suggested to play a pivotal role in same nutrient acquisition mechanisms operating in calcareous soils. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the nutrient extraction efficiency of three individual organic acids commonly identified in root exudates, i.e. citric, malic and oxalic acid. Our results clearly demonstrate the context dependent nature of nutrient release by organic acids. The degree of P extraction was highly dependent on which organic acid was added, their concentration and pH, and their contact time with the soil. P is generally more efficiently extracted by organic acids at a high pH and follows the series oxalate>citrate>malate. The opposite relationship between pH and extraction efficiency was apparent for most other cations examined (e.g. Zn, Fe), which are more efficiently extracted by organic acids at low pH. A serious constraint to the ecological importance of organic acid exudation in response to P deficiency is, however, their very low P mobilization efficiency. For every mol of soil P mobilized, 1000 mol of organic acid has to be added. It can, however, be speculated that in a calcareous soil with extremely low P concentrations it is still beneficial to the plants to exude organic acids in spite of the seemingly high costs in terms of carbon. 3acalcareous soils 3arhizosphere 3aroot exudates 3acitrates 3acitric acid 3amalic acid 3aoxalic acid 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3asoil nutrients 3aplant nutrition 3aphosphorus 3abioavailability 3asoil pH 3aSweden1 aOwen, A.G.1 aGodbold, D.L.1 aJones, D.L.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2005 Nov., v. 37, no. 11 p.2046-2054x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20060130b20060202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/12/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02322naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245010300206300001800309506007600327520095100403506003701354650001601391650001301407650001601420650001901436650001801455650003701473650001201510700001901522700002201541700001601563700002101579773017401600852000901774856008301783930003301866946001301899655001201912IND4391012320221207130452.0070506e20070417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439101232DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06089461042doi7 aPMC18718502pmcid7 a174128352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKida, Yasuyuki S.10aDaam1 regulates the endocytosis of EphB during the convergent extension of the zebrafish notochord  ap. 6708-6713.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConvergent extension (CE) movement of cells is one of the fundamental processes that control the organized morphogenesis of tissues and organs. The molecular events connecting the noncanonical Wnt pathway and CE movement, however, are not well understood. We show that subcellular localization of Daam1, an essential component of noncanonical Wnt signaling, changes dynamically during notochord formation. In the early phases, Daam1 complexes with EphB receptors and Disheveled 2. This complex is incorporated into endocytic vesicles in a dynamin-dependent manner, thereby resulting in the removal of EphB from the cell surface with subsequent switching of cell adhesiveness. In the next step, Daam1 colocalizes with the actin cytoskeleton to induce morphological extension of cells. We elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the CE movement of notochord cells with Daam1 as a dynamic coordinator of endocytosis and cytoskeletal remodeling.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aadhesion 3aendocytosis 3amicrofilaments 3amorphogenesis 3areceptor protein-tyrosine kinase 3atissues1 aSato, Takayuki1 aMiyasaka, Kota Y.1 aSuto, Asami1 aOgura, Toshihiko0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Apr. 17, v. 104, no. 16 p.6708-6713dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06089461043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02826naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001600161245008800177300001800265500001500283520164200298650001801940650002101958650002401979650002202003650002602025650001602051650002002067650001102087650002402098650003602122650002502158651001102183653001702194700001502211773008802226852000902314930003302323945002502356946001102381655001202392IND4376432020221120024643.0051202e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437643202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBenizri, E.10aRelationship between plants and soil microbial communities in fertilized grasslands  ap. 2055-2064.  a2019-12-05  aThe relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is of major scientific concern today. Few studies though have measured the interactions between soil microorganisms and plant diversity, the purpose of this study was to examine the link between plant diversity and microbial communities in fertilized versus unfertilized grasslands. Experiments were carried out on a permanent grassland in north-eastern France where agricultural practices had remained unchanged for the last 13 years. The experimental design included two plots of 300 m2 (fertilized at 120 kg N ha(-1) or non-fertilized). Plots were replicated into three equal sub-plots (100 m2). From each sub-plot, six samples of soil and vegetation were taken at three dates during floristic development. At sampling, ground cover of each species was estimated, and total amount of C and N was determined in aboveground and root biomass. Soil samples were analyzed in order to measure the metabolic fingerprints of microorganisms using Biolog GN2 microplates. Floristic composition and carbon substrate utilization patterns of rhizobacterial communities were more diversified in unfertilized than fertilized plots. In unfertilized plots, the development of Convolvulus arvensis and two legumes (Trifolium pratense and Trifolium repens) may help maintain observed floristic diversity. Moreover, an inversion of C and N distribution between aboveground and root biomass during the vegetation cycle probably induced a variation of rhizodeposition. This phenomenon could explain the differences of rhizobacterial metabolic fingerprints observed between experimental plots. 3asoil bacteria 3anitrogen content 3acommunity structure 3aplant communities 3abotanical composition 3aRhizobiales 3agrassland soils 3acarbon 3aecological function 3achemical constituents of plants 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aFrance 0abiodiversity1 aAmiaud, B.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2005 Nov., v. 37, no. 11 p.2055-2064x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20060130b20060202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/12/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02619naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245006900206300001800275506007600293520103900369506003701408650003201445650001901477650001101496650002901507650001101536650001001547650001601557650001101573700002201584700002801606700001601634700002001650700002701670700002301697700002501720700002101745700002201766700002501788773017401813852000901987856008301996930003302079946001302112655001202125IND4391005920221207103236.0070506e20070417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439100592DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07015741042doi7 aPMC18718292pmcid7 a174204672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHafenstein, Susan10aAsymmetric binding of transferrin receptor to parvovirus capsids  ap. 6585-6589.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough many viruses are icosahedral when they initially bind to one or more receptor molecules on the cell surface, such an interaction is asymmetric, probably causing a breakdown in the symmetry and conformation of the original infecting virion in preparation for membrane penetration and release of the viral genome. Cryoelectron microscopy and biochemical analyses show that transferrin receptor, the cellular receptor for canine parvovirus, can bind to only one or a few of the 60 icosahedrally equivalent sites on the virion, indicating that either canine parvovirus has inherent asymmetry or binding of receptor induces asymmetry. The asymmetry of receptor binding to canine parvovirus is reminiscent of the special portal in tailed bacteriophages and some large, icosahedral viruses. Asymmetric interactions of icosahedral viruses with their hosts might be a more common phenomenon than previously thought and may have been obscured by averaging in previous crystallographic and electron microscopic structure determinations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCarnivore protoparvovirus 1 3abacteriophages 3acapsid 3acryo-electron microscopy 3agenome 3ahosts 3atransferrin 3avirion1 aPalermo, Laura M.1 aKostyuchenko, Victor A.1 aXiao, Chuan1 aMorais, Marc C.1 aNelson, Christian D.S.1 aBowman, Valorie D.1 aBattisti, Anthony J.1 aChipman, Paul R.1 aParrish, Colin R.1 aRossmann, Michael G.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Apr. 17, v. 104, no. 16 p.6585-6589dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07015741043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03276naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245013600163300001800299520195800317650002002275650002302295650002402318650002402342650001702366650002402383650002002407650002102427650002402448650002102472650001402493650004502507650001102552650002102563700001802584700001802602700001502620700001702635773008802652852000902740930003302749945002502782946001102807655001202818IND4376431420221123041844.0051202e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437643142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVaisanen, R.K.10aPhysiological and molecular characterisation of microbial communities associated with different water-stable aggregate size classes  ap. 2007-2016.  aWe determined if the structure and function of microbial communities associated with different aggregate size classes was influenced when the aggregate formation occurred under either nitrogen (N) limitation (straw only incubation treatment) or carbon (C) limitation (straw+N incubation treatment). Using a combination of community-level physiological (BD Oxygen Biosensor assay) and molecular (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism; T-RFLP) profiling methods, we found differences in both microbial community composition and the physiological response of these communities between different aggregate size classes. The response of fungal and bacterial communities to 'straw only' and 'straw+N' treatments differed in that bacterial community composition was affected by the treatments, whereas fungal community composition was not. The magnitude of change in the bacterial community response increased with decreasing aggregate size. However, there were no significant differences in the mean bacterial community richness (number of different terminal restriction fragments; TRFs) between different aggregate size classes for the two treatments. In general, microbial communities associated with larger aggregate size fractions (large and small macroaggregates) were found to have a significantly faster respiratory response than the communities associated with microaggregates. Application of the fungal inhibitor cycloheximide resulted in a significant reduction in the utilization of cellulose, chitin, mannose, xylan, and xylose by the microbial communities associated with all aggregate size classes, indicating that fungi are significant contributors to the utilization of these compounds. Our results demonstrate that the BD Oxygen Biosensor assay offers a valuable new tool for community level physiological profiling. When used in combination with census-based methods such as T-RFLP, a greater level of resolution can be achieved. 3asilt loam soils 3aagricultural soils 3asoil microorganisms 3acommunity structure 3abiodiversity 3aecological function 3asoil aggregates 3asoil aggregation 3asoil organic matter 3asoil respiration 3abioassays 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3acarbon 3anitrogen content1 aRoberts, M.S.1 aGarland, J.L.1 aFrey, S.D.1 aDawson, L.A.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2005 Nov., v. 37, no. 11 p.2007-2016x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a20060130b20060202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/12/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03025naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245014900201300001800350506007600368520171300444506003702157650001802194650001302212650002302225650002002248650001302268700001802281700001702299700002302316773017402339852000902513856008302522930003302605946001302638655001202651IND4391008520221207103227.0070506e20070417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439100852DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06097711042doi7 aPMC18718382pmcid7 a174204792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogin, Yaron10aSLP-76 mediates and maintains activation of the Tec family kinase ITK via the T cell antigen receptor-induced association between SLP-76 and ITK  ap. 6638-6643.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aITK (IL-2-inducible T cell kinase), a Tec family protein tyrosine kinase (PTK), is one of three PTKs required for T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-induced activation of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1). Like Src and Abl family PTKs, ITK adopts an inactive, "closed" conformation, and its conversion to the active conformation is not well understood, nor have its direct substrates been identified. In a side-by-side comparison of ITK and ZAP-70 (ζ chain-associated protein kinase of 70 kDa), ITK efficiently phosphorylated Y⁷⁸³ and Y⁷⁷⁵ of PLC-γ1, two phosphorylation sites that are critical for its activation, whereas ZAP-70 did not. SLP-76 (SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa), an adaptor required for TCR-induced activation of PLC-γ1, was required for the phosphorylation of both PLC-γ1 sites in intact cells. Furthermore, this event depended on the N-terminal tyrosines of SLP-76. Likewise, SLP-76, particularly its N-terminal tyrosines, was required for TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of ITK but was not required for the phosphorylation or activation of ZAP-70. Both ZAP-70 and ITK phosphorylated SLP-76 in vitro; thus, both PTKs are potential regulators of SLP-76, but only ITK is regulated by SLP-76. Upon TCR stimulation, a small fraction of ITK bound to SLP-76. This fraction, however, encompassed most of the catalytically active ITK. Catalytic activity was lost upon mild elution of ITK from the SLP-76-nucleated complex but was restored upon reconstitution of the complex. We propose that SLP-76 is required for ITK activation; furthermore, an ongoing physical interaction between SLP-76 and ITK is required to maintain ITK in an active conformation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3acatalytic activity 3aphosphorylation 3atyrosine1 aAiney, Carmit1 aBeach, Dvora1 aYablonski, Deborah0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Apr. 17, v. 104, no. 16 p.6638-6643dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06097711043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01480naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245016700164300001600331520046900347653002500816653000900841653002700850653004200877700002700919700002000946773011900966852000901085856008501094946001101179655001201190IND4443249520221122203615.0101001e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444324952DNAL7 a10.1007/s12104-010-9230-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollins, Tony 10aBackbone and side chain ¹H, ¹⁵N and ¹³C assignments for a thiol-disulphide oxidoreductase from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125  ap. 151-154.  aEnzymes produced by psychrophilic organisms have successfully overcome the low temperature challenge and evolved to maintain high catalytic rates in their permanently cold environments.

The pretreated samples were simultaneously subjected to torsion and compression stresses at temperatures ranging from 20 to 90 degrees C. The load-deformation relationship was analyzed at each temperature. The failure zones were studied using the scanning electron microscope technique. The results showed that the maximum torque decreased with increasing temperature under the deformation conditions applied. Sulfonation of the samples gave a similar effect, although to a smaller extent. The elastoplasticity of the samples, as viewed in terms of the twist angle at failure, was also affected by the pretreatment. While axial compression had a major effect, sulfonation only caused a marginal change. Microscopic studies of the failure zone showed that when the temperature increased, the fracture plane traveled around fibers instead of through them, thus causing less fiber damage. Sulfonation improved fiber separation and decreased fiber damage. The separation of ray cells from the fiber tracheids was improved, particularly by sulfonation. Increasing temperature and sulfonation changed the fracture plane from the secondary wall of fibers towards the more lignin enriched primary wall and middle lamella. 3awood chips 3aPicea abies 3asodium sulfite 3apretreatment 3atemperature 3atorsional strength 0astress 0acompressive strength 0achemimechanical pulping1 aPeng, F.1 aSimonson, R.0 tWood science and technology.g1999 Feb., v. 33, no. 1 p.43-54x0043-77197nnas  aDNAL  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle01994naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245010800174300001600282520091300298650000901211650001801220650002101238650001101259650001601270650001201286700002201298700002201320700002101342700001901363773011701382852000901499856009201508930003301600946001101633655001201644IND4404553520221122165955.0080418e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440455352DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1529-8817.2008.00477.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuwano, Kazuyoshi10aDiurnal cell division regulated by gating the g₁/s transition in enteromorpha compressa (chlorophyta)  ap. 364-373.  aThe cell-cycle progression of Enteromorpha compressa (L.) Nees (=Ulva compressa L.) was diurnally regulated by gating the G₁/S transition. When the gate was open, the cells were able to divide if they had attained a sufficient size. However, the cells were not able to divide while the gate was closed, even if the cells had attained sufficient size. The diurnal rhythm of cell division immediately disappeared when the thalli were transferred to continuous light or darkness. When the thalli were transferred to a shifted photoperiod, the rhythm of cell division immediately and accurately synchronized with the shifted photoperiod. These data support a gating-system model regulated by light:dark (L:D) cycles rather than an endogenous circadian clock.

A total of 42 and 186 wildtype-colored conchocelis colonies were obtained from the former and latter experiments, respectively. Among those, 49 DNA samples (14% and 23% obtained from the former and latter crosses, respectively) showed biparental CAPS patterns in the two gene regions (EF-1α open reading frame [ORF] region and V-ATPase). This study represents the first report in which the cross-fertilized conchocelis of P. yezoensis has been directly confirmed by molecular marker. The combination of the simple DNA extraction and CAPS analysis may be applicable in genetic studies of other macroalgae that are monoecious and/or grow slowly in laboratory culture. 3aConchocelis 3aDNA 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aPyropia yezoensis 3achromosome mapping 3acrossing 3afemales 3agenes 3amacroalgae 3amales 3amutants 3aopen reading frames 3ascreening 0aCAPS 0across-fertilized conchocelis 0aintraspecific cross 0aPorphyra yezoensis1 aFukuda, Satoru1 aEndo, Hirotoshi1 aKitade, Yukihiro1 aSaga, Naotsune0 tJournal of phycology.g2008 Apr., v. 44, no. 2 p.331-334dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-36467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2008.00465.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080418b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02994naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245010900170300001600279500001500295520144400310650002601754650001501780650001701795650001401812650002501826650002001851650001601871650002001887650001301907650001601920650001001936650002501946650002401971650001901995650001402014650001702028650001702045650001402062653002102076653001502097653001902112700002202131700002402153700002502177773011702202852000902319856009202328930003302420946001102453655001202464IND4404554420221122170052.0080418e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440455442DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1529-8817.2008.00485.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, John D.10aPhylogeny of the conjugating green algae based on chloroplast and mitochondrial nucleotide sequence data  ap. 467-477.  a2019-12-04  aThe conjugating green algae represent a lineage of charophyte green algae known for their structural diversity and unusual mode of sexual reproduction, conjugation. These algae are ubiquitous in freshwater environments, where they are often important primary producers, but few studies have investigated evolutionary relationships in a molecular systematic context. A 109-taxon data set consisting of three gene fragments (two from the chloroplast and one from the mitochondrial genome) was used to estimate the phylogeny of the genera of the conjugating green algae. Maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP), and Bayesian inference (BI) were used to estimate relationships from the 4,047 alignable nucleotides. This study confirmed the polyphyly of the Zygnemataceae and Mesotaeniaceae with respect to one another. The Peniaceae were determined to be paraphyletic, and two genera traditionally classified among the Zygnematales appear to belong to the lineage that gave rise to the Desmidiales. Six genera, Euastrum, Cosmarium, Cylindrocystis, Mesotaenium, Spondylosium, and Staurodesmus, were polyphyletic in this analysis. These findings have important implications for the evolution of structural characteristics in the group and will require some taxonomic changes. More work will be required to delineate lineages of Zygnematales in particular and to identify structural synapomorphies for some of the newly identified clades. 3atrophic relationships 3afreshwater 3aStaurodesmus 3aCosmarium 3amitochondrial genome 3adata collection 3anucleotides 3aBayesian theory 3aEuastrum 3aMesotaenium 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3asexual reproduction 3aCylindrocystis 3aparaphyly 3aSpondylosium 3achloroplasts 3apolyphyly 0aZygnematophyceae 0aCharophyta 0aGonatozygaceae1 aKarol, Kenneth G.1 aMcCourt, Richard M.1 aDelwiche, Charles F.0 tJournal of phycology.g2008 Apr., v. 44, no. 2 p.467-477dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-36467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2008.00485.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080418b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01886naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245004700127300001600174500001500190520089100205650001701096650002601113650001801139650002301157650002201180650002001202650002001222650001401242653001901256653002001275653001601295700001701311700002101328773008501349852000901434930003301443945001301476946001101489655001201500IND2202730520221122202007.0000225e199808  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220273052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, K.K.12aA fluorescence spectroscopic study on wood  ap. 309-315.  a2019-12-05  aFluorescence spectroscopy has been suggested as an important tool for identification of timber (Krishna, Chowdhury 1935; Dyer 1988; Sum et al. 1991).

A special feature of prostate cancer is its high incidence and multifocality. To address the functionality of DNA damage checkpoints in the prostate, we analyzed the responses of human primary prostate epithelial cells (HPECs) and freshly isolated human prostate tissues to γ-irradiation. We find that γ-irradiation activates the ataxia telangiectasia mutated-associated DNA damage response pathway in the HPECs but that the clearance of phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX) foci is delayed. Surprisingly, γ-irradiated HPECs were unable to enforce cell cycle checkpoint arrest and had sustained cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2)-associated kinase activity because of a lack of inhibitory Cdk phosphorylation by Wee1A tyrosine kinase. We further show that HPECs express low levels of Wee1A and that ectopic Wee1A efficiently rescues the checkpoints. We recapitulate the absence of checkpoint responses in epithelium of ex vivo irradiated human prostate tissue despite robust induction of γH2AX. The findings show that prostate epithelium has a surprising inability to control checkpoint arrest, the lack of which may predispose to accrual of DNA lesions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aataxia (disorder) 3acarcinogenesis 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3agamma radiation 3ahistones 3ahumans 3aphosphorylation 3aprostatic neoplasms 3atyrosine1 aJäämaa, Sari1 aMönkkönen, Mia1 aPeltonen, Karita1 aAndersson, Leif C.1 aMedema, René H.1 aPeehl, Donna M.1 aLaiho, Marikki0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Apr. 24, v. 104, no. 17 p.7211-7216dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06092991043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02132naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001500137245006800152300001600220500001500236520096300251650002401214650001401238650001801252650000901270650001801279650002001297651001801317653002801335653001601363653003201379653001201411653001501423653001001438653002001448700001301468773007201481852000901553856007701562930003301639945001301672946001301685655001201698IND2328681420221122202807.0020826e200204  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232868142DNAL7 a10.1002/agr.100152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWard, C.E.10aImpacts from meatpacking firm mergers in an experimental market  ap. 247-260.  a2019-12-04  aThe Fed Cattle Market Simulator (FCMS), an experimental market, was used to estimate impacts from two meatpacking firm mergers. Data were collected from two FCMS workshops with large agribusiness firms. Experimental mergers involved the two smaller packers in the market in one case and the two larger packers in another. During the merger period, market prices were significantly higher than prior to the merger in both cases. Following the dissolution, results were mixed. Management of the merged firms appeared to significantly affect how effectively merged packers operated, thus affecting both behavior and performance. For both mergers, profits of the merged firm were higher relative to profits of rival firms. Merged firms appeared to have achieved some synergies in procurement or economies of scope (i.e., multi-plant economies). An increased Herfindahl index was associated with lower fed cattle prices in one case and higher prices in the other. 3amathematical models 3apackaging 3aprofitability 3ameat 3amarket prices 3aeconomic impact 3aUnited States 0atransaction price model 0acomparisons 0afed cattle market simulator 0amergers 0asimulation 0afirms 0amarket behavior1 aLee, Ji.0 tAgribusiness.g2002 Spring, v. 18, no. 2 p.247-260x0742-44777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agr.100153Available from publisher's Web site  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02926naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009700128300001600225500012100241500002400362500001500386520150000401650002301901650002501924650001301949650002301962650001401985650001401999650001102013650001802024650002302042650001802065650001302083650002602096650001602122650001602138650001602154650001102170653001902181700001802200700001502218773014002233852000902373856008602382655001202468IND4462687220221122202814.0120202s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446268722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoatshe, O.G.10aChemical thinning of morula (Sclerocarya birrea subspecies caffra) fruit using benzyladenine  ap. 395-408.  aPaper presented at the First All African Horticultural Congress, held August 31 - September 3, 2009, Nairobi, Kenya.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of benzyladenine (BA) on fruit set and quality of morula (Sclerocarya birrea subspecies caffra). Benzyladenine was applied when the fruitlets were 8-10 mm in diameter at concentrations of 0, 50, 100 or 150 mg L-1. Benzyladenine application significantly (P<0.001) reduced fruit set of morula trees by between 48-67%. Application of BA to morula fruit trees significantly (P<0.001) increased fruit size (length and diameter), density and weight. However, BA application had no significant effect on the fruit length-to-diameter (L:D) ratio. Benzyladenine significantly (P<0.01) increased the fruit endocarp but decreased mesocarp of morula fruit by the same margin (1.1-6.3%). Suggesting that BA-induced increase in fruit weight was attributed to increase in the endocarp. Application of BA to morula trees resulted in fruits with significantly (P<0.05) higher soluble solids content, titratable acidity and citric acid equivalent compared to control unsprayed trees. Morula trees sprayed with BA had significantly (P<0.001) higher leaf area, total leaf chlorophyll content, chlorophyll A and chlorophyll B, respectively than unsprayed trees. Benzyladenine also promoted morula fruit colour development. The results of this study showed that BA has the potential to be used as a chemical thinner of morula or chemical agent that improves fruit quality. However, further research on concentration and timing of application needs to be done. 3aapplication timing 3atotal soluble solids 3aendocarp 3aSclerocarya birrea 3aleaf area 3afruit set 3amorula 3afruit quality 3atitratable acidity 3abenzyladenine 3amesocarp 3afield experimentation 3acitric acid 3achlorophyll 3afruit trees 3aleaves 0asoluble solids1 aEmongor, V.E.1 aOagile, O.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Oct., , no. 911 p.395-408dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/911/911_46.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01898naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013000126300001600256520087400272650001801146650001301164650002401177650002701201650001701228650001701245650003701262650002701299650001001326651001801336653001101354653002001365773008501385852000901470930003301479945001301512946001101525655001201536IND2205350120221122170704.0000620e199806  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220535012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, S.Y.10aEffect of age on the variation, correlations and inheritance of selected wood characteristics in black spruce (Picea mariana)  ap. 197-204.  aThe variation, correlations and inheritance of various intraring wood characteristics in 15-year-old black spruce (Picea mariana) trees from 40 half-sib families grown in New Brunswick were examined. The emphasis was placed on the effect of age on these genetic parameters. With increasing (cambial) age, ring width and ring density tend to exhibit a constant tree-to-tree variation whereas most other characteristics exhibit a smaller tree-to-tree variation. The heritability for latewood characteristics does not seem to change appreciably. Other characteristics (except RDmi), however, tend to be less heritable when the tree grows older. Correlations between ring density and most intraring characteristics tend to be weaker with increasing age. This implies that fast-growth in this species will have less negative effect on wood density when the tree grows older. 3aPicea mariana 3atree age 3agenetic correlation 3aphenotypic correlation 3awood density 3agrowth rings 3agenotype-environment interaction 3ainheritance (genetics) 3awidth 3aNew Brunswick 0agrowth 0acharacteristics0 tWood science and technology.g1998 June, v. 32, no. 3 p.197-204x0043-77197nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02826naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245011900202300001800321506007600339520129900415506003701714650002201751650002001773650001001793650002001803650000901823650001401832650001401846650001201860700002001872700002101892700001801913700002801931700002301959700002801982700001702010700001702027773017402044852000902218856008302227930003302310946001302343655001202356IND4391017520221207130635.0070506e20070417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439101752DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07018491042doi7 aPMC18718662pmcid7 a174261432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrimm, Daniel10aReplication fitness determines high virulence of influenza A virus in mice carrying functional Mx1 resistance gene  ap. 6806-6811.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe IFN-induced resistance factor Mx1 is a critical component of innate immunity against influenza A viruses (FLUAV) in mice. Animals carrying a wild-type Mx1 gene (Mx1⁺/⁺) differ from regular laboratory mice (Mx1⁻/⁻) in that they are highly resistant to infection with standard FLUAV strains. We identified an extraordinary variant of the FLUAV strain, A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (designated hvPR8), which is unusually virulent in Mx1⁺/⁺ mice. hvPR8 was well controlled in Mx1⁺/⁺ but not Mx1⁻/⁻ mice provided that the animals were treated with IFN before infection, indicating that hvPR8 exhibits normal sensitivity to growth restriction by Mx1. hvPR8 multiplied much faster than standard PR8 early in infection because of highly efficient viral gene expression in infected cells. Studies with reassortant viruses containing defined genome segments of both hvPR8 and standard PR8 demonstrated that the HA, neuraminidase, and polymerase genes of hvPR8 all contributed to virulence, indicating that efficient host cell entry and early gene expression renders hvPR8 highly pathogenic. These results reveal a surprisingly simple concept of how influenza viruses may gain virulence and illustrate that high speed of virus growth can outcompete the antiviral response of the infected host.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfluenza A virus 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainnate immunity 3amice 3asialidase 3avirulence 3aviruses1 aStaeheli, Peter1 aHufbauer, Martin1 aKoerner, Iris1 aMartínez-Sobrido, Luis1 aSolórzano, Alicia1 aGarcía-Sastre, Adolfo.1 aHaller, Otto1 aKochs, Georg0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Apr. 17, v. 104, no. 16 p.6806-6811dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07018491043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03592naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245005300204300001800257506007600275520201700351506003702368650001502405650001002420650001902430650001002449650001502459650002702474650001502501650001402516650001502530650001302545650002502558650000902583650002802592700001902620700002102639700001802660700002402678700002002702700001702722700002302739773017402762852000902936856008302945930003303028946001303061655001203074IND4391018120221207130636.0070506e20070417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439101812DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06095091042doi7 aPMC18718682pmcid7 a174204782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGray, Marcus A.12aA cortical potential reflecting cardiac function  ap. 6818-6823.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEmotional trauma and psychological stress can precipitate cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death through arrhythmogenic effects of efferent sympathetic drive. Patients with preexisting heart disease are particularly at risk. Moreover, generation of proarrhythmic activity patterns within cerebral autonomic centers may be amplified by afferent feedback from a dysfunctional myocardium. An electrocortical potential reflecting afferent cardiac information has been described, reflecting individual differences in interoceptive sensitivity (awareness of one's own heartbeats). To inform our understanding of mechanisms underlying arrhythmogenesis, we extended this approach, identifying electrocortical potentials corresponding to the cortical expression of afferent information about the integrity of myocardial function during stress. We measured changes in cardiac response simultaneously with electroencephalography in patients with established ventricular dysfunction. Experimentally induced mental stress enhanced cardiovascular indices of sympathetic activity (systolic blood pressure, heart rate, ventricular ejection fraction, and skin conductance) across all patients. However, the functional response of the myocardium varied; some patients increased, whereas others decreased, cardiac output during stress. Across patients, heartbeat-evoked potential amplitude at left temporal and lateral frontal electrode locations correlated with stress-induced changes in cardiac output, consistent with an afferent cortical representation of myocardial function during stress. Moreover, the amplitude of the heartbeat-evoked potential in the left temporal region reflected the proarrhythmic status of the heart (inhomogeneity of left ventricular repolarization). These observations delineate a cortical representation of cardiac function predictive of proarrhythmic abnormalities in cardiac repolarization. Our findings highlight the dynamic interaction of heart and brain in stress-induced cardiovascular morbidity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarrhythmia 3abrain 3acardiac output 3adeath 3aelectrodes 3aelectroencephalography 3aheart rate 3amorbidity 3amyocardium 3apatients 3apsychological stress 3arisk 3asystolic blood pressure1 aTaggart, Peter1 aSutton, Peter M.1 aGroves, David1 aHoldright, Diana R.1 aBradbury, David1 aBrull, David1 aCritchley, Hugo D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Apr. 17, v. 104, no. 16 p.6818-6823dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06095091043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02854naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245007900201300001800280506007600298520126800374506003701642650000801679650001901687650001201706650001901718650002201737650001501759650001301774650002001787650001601807651001601823651001201839700002301851700002501874700002301899700002001922700001901942700002501961700002301986700002702009773017402036852000902210856008302219930003302302946001302335655001202348IND4391013220221207130640.0070506e20070417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439101322DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07013411042doi7 aPMC18718532pmcid7 a174204522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalén, Love10aAncient DNA reveals lack of postglacial habitat tracking in the arctic fox  ap. 6726-6729.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHow species respond to an increased availability of habitat, for example at the end of the last glaciation, has been well established. In contrast, little is known about the opposite process, when the amount of habitat decreases. The hypothesis of habitat tracking predicts that species should be able to track both increases and decreases in habitat availability. The alternative hypothesis is that populations outside refugia become extinct during periods of unsuitable climate. To test these hypotheses, we used ancient DNA techniques to examine genetic variation in the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) through an expansion/contraction cycle. The results show that the arctic fox in midlatitude Europe became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene and did not track the habitat when it shifted to the north. Instead, a high genetic similarity between the extant populations in Scandinavia and Siberia suggests an eastern origin for the Scandinavian population at the end of the last glaciation. These results provide new insights into how species respond to climate change, since they suggest that populations are unable to track decreases in habitat avaliability. This implies that arctic species may be particularly vulnerable to increases in global temperatures.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aVulpes lagopus 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3agenetic variation 3aglaciation 3alatitude 3arefuge habitats 3atemperature 3aScandinavia 3aSiberia1 aNyström, Veronica1 aValdiosera, Cristina1 aGermonpre, Mietje.1 aSablin, Mikhail1 aTurner, Elaine1 aAngerbjörn, Anders.1 aArsuaga, Juan Luis1 aGötherström, Anders.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Apr. 17, v. 104, no. 16 p.6726-6729dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07013411043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03202naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010100174300001600275520167000291592002801961650002301989650001302012650001902025650001902044650001002063650002302073650001902096650001502115650002802130650001202158650001602170650002402186650001502210650001502225650001302240650001802253650001302271653002202284653001402306653001602320653002202336653002302358653001202381700002102393700002102414700002302435773012002458856008502578852000902663655001202672IND60632905620221123023557.0190425e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063290562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBirolli, Willian G.14aThe pyrethroid (±)-lambda-cyhalothrin enantioselective biodegradation by a bacterial consortium  ap. 129-137.  aChiral pesticides have been used in agriculture, including (±)-lambda-cyhalothrin ((±)-LC), which is a pyrethroid insecticide widely employed on crops for protection against different types of insects. However, enantioselectivity is poorly studied in biodegradation processes. Therefore, the (±)-LC enantioselective biodegradation by bacteria from Brazilian savannah was reported in this study with a validated analytical method. All bacterial strains biodegraded (±)-LC with different efficiencies. Residual concentrations of LC (3.7–43.1% of biodegradation) and its enantiomeric excesses (0–27% ee) were determined. Additionally, the formation of the main biodegradation metabolite 3-phenoxybenzoic acid was also quantified. A Bacillus consortium composed of the three most efficient strains biodegraded more LC than any isolated strain solely employed in this work, showing that the use of a consortium is an interesting approach. In addition, 13 metabolites were identified and a biodegradation pathway with biochemical reactions of hydrolysis, reduction, esterification, amidation, elimination and group transfer were proposed, confirming the bioremediation potential of these strains. The LC stereoisomer with the highest insecticidal activity (1R,3R,αS-enantiomer, also known as gamma-cyhalothrin) was preferentially biodegraded by the studied bacteria. Therefore, crops protection with gamma-cyhalothrin, which can be applied in lower concentrations than (±)-LC because it is a more effective product against insects, may also be biodegraded faster than the racemic mixture in the environment, decreasing the toxic effects on non-target organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3acrops 3aenantioselectivity 3aesterification 3ahydrolysis 3ainsecticidal properties 3ainsects 3ametabolites 3anontarget organisms 3apesticides 3apyrethrins 3asavannas 3astereoisomers 3atoxicity 0aBrazilian savanna 0aPesticide 0aInsecticide 0aOrganic pollutant 0aEnantioselectivity 0aCerrado1 aArai, Marylyn S.1 aNitschke, Marcia1 aPorto, André L.M.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2019 May, v. 156 p.129-137dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245008800165500001900253520176800272592002802040650002602068650001902094650002502113650001902138650002502157650001302182650001302195650001602208650001102224650001502235650002002250650001302270650001602283650001502299650001102314653001802325653002202343653003002365653001102395653001002406700001602416700002102432700001302453700001702466700001902483773011902502856008802621852000902709655001202718IND60713229920221120181504.0210212e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071322992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1427012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, J.10aInfluence of two management practices in the Canadian Prairies on radiative forcing  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSurface albedo and soil carbon sequestration are influenced by agricultural management practices which impact the Earth's radiation budget and climate change. In this study we investigate the impact of reduced summer fallowing and reduced tillage in the Canadian Prairies on climate change by estimating the change in radiative forcing due to albedo and soil carbon sequestration. Seasonal variations of albedo, which are dependent on agricultural management practices and soil colour in three soil zones, were derived from 10-day composite 250-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Using this information, we found an overall increase of surface albedo due to the conversion from summer fallowing to continuous cropping and from conventional tillage (CT) to either no-tillage (NT) or reduced tillage (RT). The increase was dependent on soil brightness, type of vegetation and snow cover. Using data from the Census of Agriculture and taking into consideration both albedo and soil carbon changes, we estimated that from 1981 to 2016, the total radiative forcing for the cropland area in the Canadian Prairies was −405 μW m⁻² due to the conversion of CT to either NT or RT and about 70% was due to the change in albedo. During the same period, the total radiative forcing was −410 μW m⁻² due to a reduction in the area under summer fallow and about 62% was due to the change in albedo. The equivalent atmospheric CO₂ drawdown from these two management changes from albedo change was about 7.8 and 8.7 Tg CO₂ yr⁻¹, respectively. These results demonstrate that it is important to consider both the changes of soil carbon and surface albedo in evaluating climate change impacts due to agricultural management practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCensus of Agriculture 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aconventional tillage 3acropland 3adrawdown 3aenvironment 3afallow 3ano-tillage 3areduced tillage 3asnowpack 3asoil carbon 3asoil color 3asummer 0aSummer fallow 0aRadiative forcing 0aSoil carbon sequestration 0aAlbedo 0aMODIS1 aWorth, D.E.1 aDesjardins, R.L.1 aHaak, D.1 aMcConkey, B.1 aCerkowniak, D.0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 765 p.142701-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1427013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245011900153520127300272592002801545650002401573650001101597650001001608650001501618650002401633650002301657650002601680651001101706700001801717700001601735700003901751700001601790700002401806773012001830856007201950852000902022655001202031IND60648683020221121233007.0190701e20161031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064868302DNAL7 a10.3390/f71102592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Eunji10aEstimation of Voxel-Based Above-Ground Biomass Using Airborne LiDAR Data in an Intact Tropical Rain Forest, Brunei  aThe advancement of LiDAR technology has enabled more detailed evaluations of forest structures. The so-called “Volumetric pixel (voxel)” has emerged as a new comprehensive approach. The purpose of this study was to estimate plot-level above-ground biomass (AGB) in different plot sizes of 20 m × 20 m and 30 m × 30 m, and to develop a regression model for AGB prediction. Both point cloud-based (PCB) and voxel-based (VB) metrics were used to maximize the efficiency of low-density LiDAR data within a dense forest. Multiple regression model AGB prediction performance was found to be greatest in the 30 m × 30 m plots, with R2, adjusted R2, and standard deviation values of 0.92, 0.87, and 35.13 Mg∙ha−1, respectively. Five out of the eight selected independent variables were derived from VB metrics and the other three were derived from PCB metrics. Validation of accuracy yielded RMSE and NRMSE values of 27.8 Mg∙ha−1 and 9.2%, respectively, which is a reasonable estimate for this structurally complex intact forest that has shown high NRMSE values in previous studies. This voxel-based approach enables a greater understanding of complex forest structure and is expected to contribute to the advancement of forest carbon quantification techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3acarbon 3alidar 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3astandard deviation 3atropical rain forests 3aBrunei1 aLee, Woo-Kyun1 aYoon, Mihae1 aYi, Chong-yŏlc(Land use planner)1 aSon, Yowhan1 aAbu Salim, Kamariah0 tForests.g2016 Oct. 31, v. 7, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f71102593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01333naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245023200159300001600391520035800407592002800765650002300793650001100816650001000827650001600837651001100853773010700864856007500971852000901046655001201055IND60637638320221117232746.0190422e20150623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063763832DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.1977.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamorski, Cz.10aWystępowanie fuzariozy tulipanów (Fusarium oxysporum (Schlecht.)

Part of this change is due to concerns about the impact of climate change, but it is also recognized that global oil and fossil fuel supplies are finite. The production of first-generation ethanol as a biofuel to reduce oil inputs has been successful on a large scale using sugarcane juice and/or molasses (Brazil) and corn (USA). The advent of second-generation biofuels is impending as lignocellulosic processing technology improves and costs decrease. Sugarcane and related sugar crops such as sweet sorghum will be leading candidates to drive this growth in the future, as they possess considerable advantages over other broad acre cropping systems. Sugarcane biorefineries will be realized by extracting maximum value from sugarcane waste and cultivated energycane.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiorefining 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acropping systems 3aenergy 3aenergy cane 3aethanol 3afossil fuels 3alignocellulose 3amolasses 3aoils 3asugar crops 3asugarcane juice 3asweet sorghum 3awastes 3aBrazil 3aUnited States1 aO’Shea, Michael G0 tBiofuels.g2012 May 1, v. 3, no. 3 p.307-319dFuture Science LtdwJournal:2219x1759-72777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4155/bfs.12.133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014800163300001600311520137600327592002801703650002201731650002101753650001901774650002501793650002901818650001601847650002601863650001301889650001701902650002401919650001401943650004601957650002202003650001402025650002102039650002002060650002402080650003502104650001302139650004402152650002702196650001902223650003802242650001402280650001002294653001902304653003902323653002402362653003302386700001502419700001102434700001602445700001802461700001902479700001902498700002402517700001702541773012002558856008502678852000902763655001202772IND60632905720221123023712.0190425e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063290572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Wei10aDesign, synthesis, and antifungal activity of carboxamide derivatives possessing 1,2,3-triazole as potential succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors  ap. 160-169.  aSuccinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is demonstrably one of the most important molecular targets in development of new fungicide. In our continuous efforts to discover novel SDH inhibitors, forty-two carboxamide derivatives containing 1,2,3-triazole ring were designed and synthesized, which were precisely characterized by 1H NMR, ESI-MS, elemental analysis and X-ray single-crystal diffraction. The compounds were screened for antifungal activities against phytopathogenic fungi by mycelia growth inhibition assay in vitro. Compound A3-3 exhibited significant antifungal activity against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Botrytis cinerea, Rhizoctonia cerealis and Gaeumannomyces graminsis with EC50 values of 1.08, 8.75, 1.67 and 5.30 μg/mL, respectively, comparable to those of commercial SDHI boscalid. In vivo testing demonstrated that A3-3 was effective for suppressing rape sclerotinia rot, cucumber grey mould and wheat powdery mildew caused by S. sclerotiorum， B. cinerea and Blumeria graminis at a dosage of 200 μg/mL. Inhibition activities against SDH test proved the designed analogues were effective in the enzyme level. The molecular docking simulation revealed that A3-3 interacted with ARG43，TYR58 and TRP173 of the SDH through hydrogen bond and pi-pi interaction, which could explain the probable mechanism of action between the inhibitor and target protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlumeria graminis 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aGaeumannomyces 3aRhizoctonia cerealis 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aX-radiation 3aantifungal properties 3aboscalid 3acarboxamides 3acomputer simulation 3acucumbers 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aenzyme inhibitors 3agray mold 3ahydrogen bonding 3ain vivo studies 3amechanism of action 3amedian effective concentration 3amycelium 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apowdery mildew 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3atriazoles 3awheat 0a1,2,3-triazole 0aSuccinate dehydrogenase inhibitors 0aFungicidal activity 0aMolecular docking simulation1 aWang, Xing1 aLi, Ke1 aLi, Tian-Xi1 aWang, Jia-Jie1 aYao, Kai-Cheng1 aCao, Ling-Ling1 aZhao, Shuang-Shuang1 aYe, Yong-Hao0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2019 May, v. 156 p.160-169dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.02.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012700156300002000283520096800303592002801271650001201299650001101311650002301322650002401345650002401369650001001393650002401403650001401427650001901441700001801460700001401478700001501492700001501507700001401522773012401536856007401660852000901734655001201743IND60669107620221118014056.0190920e20150812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066910762DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra12052g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Peng14aThe structure and magnetic properties of Fe₃N as a photocatalyst applied in hydrogen generation induced by visible light  ap. 68758-68764.  aFe₃N can be efficiently synthesized from an iron-ethanediamine precursor, whose diameter can be controlled by the synergistic effect of acetone and ethanediamine.

We apply the two-stage optimization technique and the Nash game to examine the impacts of the retail services and the degree of customer loyalty to the retail channel on the pricing of players in a centralized and a decentralized dual-channel supply chain. Our results show that the retail services have a great impact on the manufacturer and the retailer’s pricing strategies.

However, under the constraint of German energy prices, significant savings in energy costs can only be achieved if combined heat and power generation systems are applied at the same time.  aThis work was supported by funds of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) based on a decision by the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany via the Agency for Renewable Resources (FNR) under grant number 22015612.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3achamomile 3adrying 3aenergy costs 3aessential oil crops 3aflowers 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3apower generation 3aprimary energy 3aweather 3aGermany 0aBatch-type drying 0amedicinal plants 0aweather conditions 0aheat pump 0aefficiency analysis0 tDrying technology.g2020 Mar. 11, v. 38, no. 4 p.434-447dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12238x1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2019.15802903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03527naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245010500182300001600287520197600303592002802279650001302307650002002320650001902340650001702359650000902376650002302385650002102408650003402429650001502463650001002478650003502488650001002523650002302533653002402556653002202580653001302602653001102615653001902626700001802645700001802663700001702681700001402698700002002712700001702732700001802749700001602767773011202783856008102895852000902976655001202985IND60652424420221121081219.0190712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065242442DNAL7 a275346822pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311160017502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiffani, S.13aAn alternative experimental case–control design for genetic association studies on bovine mastitis  ap. 574-579.  aThe possibility of using genetic control strategies to increase disease resistance to infectious diseases relies on the identification of markers to include in the breeding plans. Possible incomplete exposure of mastitis-free (control) animals, however, is a major issue to find relevant markers in genetic association studies for infectious diseases. Usually, designs based on elite dairy sires are used in association studies, but an epidemiological case–control strategy, based on cows repeatedly field-tested could be an alternative for disease traits. To test this hypothesis, genetic association results obtained in the present work from a cohort of Italian Holstein cows tested for mastitis over time were compared with those from a previous genome-wide scan on Italian Holstein sires genotyped with 50k single nucleotide polymorphisms for de-regressed estimated breeding values for somatic cell counts (SCCs) on Bos taurus autosome (BTA6) and BTA14. A total of 1121 cows were selected for the case–control approach (cases=550, controls=571), on a combination of herd level of SCC incidence and of within herd individual level of SCC. The association study was conducted on nine previously identified markers, six on BTA6 and four on BTA14, using the R statistical environment with the ‘qtscore’ function of the GenABEL package, on high/low adjusted linear score as a binomial trait. The results obtained in the cow cohort selected on epidemiological information were in agreement with those obtained from the previous sire genome-wide association study (GWAS). Six out of the nine markers showed significant association, four on BTA14 (rs109146371, rs109234250, rs109421300, rs109162116) and two on BTA6 (rs110527224 and rs42766480). Most importantly, using mastitis as a case study, the current work further validated the alternative use of historical field disease data in case–control designs for genetic analysis of infectious diseases in livestock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3abovine mastitis 3abreeding value 3acase studies 3acows 3adisease resistance 3agenetic analysis 3agenome-wide association study 3agenotyping 3aherds 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asires 3asomatic cell count 0aexperimental design 0aassociation study 0amastitis 0acattle 0agenetic marker1 aDel Corvo, M.1 aCapoferri, R.1 aPedretti, A.1 aLuini, M.1 aWilliams, J.

Here we asked how changing the timing and duration of the wet season would affect the germination of the soil seed bank of a 14-year-old seeder-dominated shrubland. Soil samples, subjected or not to a heat shock, simulating fire, were set to germinate in a chamber whose conditions (temperature and photoperiod) were successively changed to simulate autumn, winter, and spring. Irrigation was implemented to produce three wet season treatments, varying its timing and duration: long (14 weeks of irrigation, during autumn, winter, and spring), medium (8 weeks, late autumn to early spring) and short (4 weeks in winter). Wet season treatments significantly affected germination of shrubs and herbs, as well as species richness and diversity, whereby the later and shorter the season, the lower these variables. Dicots were more sensitive to the treatments than monocots. The timing of the wet season was also important, as similar significant differences were found when only the first 4 weeks of each simulated wet season treatment were considered; the later the season, the lower the germination and richness. Heating the soil generally increased germination but few significant effects were found. We document that a change in the timing and/or duration of the wet season can significantly affect soil seed bank germination. We discuss these results in a context of shifting rainfall patterns under climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLiliopsida 3aMagnoliopsida 3aautumn 3aburied seeds 3aclimate change 3agermination 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat treatment 3aherbs 3airrigation 3aphotoperiod 3arain 3asampling 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3asoil heating 3asoil sampling 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3atemperature 3awet season 3awinter1 aTorres, Ivan,1 aUrbieta, Itziar R.1 aMoreno, José M.0 tPlant ecology.g2012 June, v. 213, no. 6 p.919-931dSpringer-Verlagx1385-02377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-012-0053-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245018200164300002000346520149800366592002801864650002201892650003701914650001301951650001901964650002401983650001402007650002302021650003702044650001302081650004402094650001502138650001702153650003302170650002302203650002002226650001702246650003702263650000902300650001802309773012502327856007402452852000902526655001202535IND60669107920221118013936.0190920e20151029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066910792DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra12057h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbidli, Abdelnasser10aOne-pot direct synthesis route to self-assembled highly ordered Zn-decorated mesoporous aluminium oxide toward efficient and sustainable metathesis heterogeneous catalyst design  ap. 92743-92756.  aHexagonally well-organized ZnCl₂-OMA materials have been successfully synthesized by a one-pot approach using a sol–gel method at ambient temperature and pressure. These materials were prepared through simultaneous self-assembly process with F127 as directing agent combined with in situ impregnation of ZnCl₂. The new approach was found to be compatible with various common aluminium precursors and carboxylic acids used as self-assembly interfacial protectors. The obtained ZnCl₂-OMA materials were fully characterized using XRD, N₂ adsorption–desorption, TEM, SEM, EDX, XPS and ¹H and ²⁷Al MAS-NMR techniques. These materials were compared with the zinc chloride-doped organized mesoporous alumina (ZnCl₂-OMA) supports prepared through a conventional two steps process that includes OMA synthesis and then post-synthesis incorporation of ZnCl₂. Thus, the one-pot synthesized materials were found to exhibit improved properties compared to the conventional ones, particularly larger BET surface area. The synthesized ZnCl₂-OMA materials were then used as catalytic supports for methyltrioxorhenium (MTO), showing enhanced catalytic performance for methyl oleate self-metathesis, demonstrating better activity and selectivity towards desired metathesis products. These features are highly beneficial for large-scale materials synthesis through fast, simple, easy and low-cost introduction of functionalities on mesoporous materials surface without multi-step procedures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3aambient temperature 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoleic acid 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asol-gel processing 3astable isotopes 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc 3azinc chloride0 tRSC advances.g2015 Oct. 29, v. 5, no. 112 p.92743-92756dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra12057h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245014000168500001900308520149200327592002801819650001901847650002101866650001601887650001201903653000801915653001301923653002401936653002701960653002101987700001502008773011902023856008802142852000902230655001202239IND60713230320221119154705.0210212e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071323032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1427052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Weijun12aA comparative analysis of Chinese provincial carbon dioxide emissions allowances allocation schemes in 2030: An egalitarian perspective  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA fair and effective carbon dioxide emissions allowances (CEA) allocation scheme is critical to balance regional development and alleviate social poverty. From the perspective of egalitarianism, this study aims to investigate the Chinese provincial CEA allocation in 2030, as well as the equality of allocation results. For this purpose, a total of 11 allocation schemes based upon a composite indicator method are developed, which consider different combinations of four allocation criteria, namely, egalitarian, responsibility, capability and efficiency. Then, an environmental Gini coefficient derived from Lorenz curves of allocation results is proposed to examine the equality of the results. The main findings show that the egalitarian criterion plays a crucial role in constructing allocation schemes, and different schemes often give rise to diversified allocation results. Although all the 11 allocation schemes, with the environmental Gini coefficients ranging from 0.0642 to 0.4019, better ensure the equality of allocation results, the schemes considering egalitarian criterion present higher equality over the schemes without this criterion. Furthermore, the schemes are likely to present higher equality, when the efficiency criterion is measured by the reciprocal of emission intensity, rather than the indicator derived from a data envelopment analysis method. Emission intensity is a better proxy for efficiency criterion in improving the equality of allocation results.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aemissions factor 3aenvironment 3apoverty 0aCEA 0aEquality 0aInformation entropy 0aFractional programming 0aGini coefficient1 aZhang, Bin0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 765 p.142705-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1427053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024003900130040001800169100005800187245013100245300001600376520140500392592002801797596006601825650001101891650002601902650002601928650001701954650001601971650001601987650001202003650001902015650001002034650003002044650001102074650001802085650001602103650001902119650002602138700001902164700001702183700002702200700001902227700002102246773012502267856008202392852000902474655001202483IND60637633320221117232800.0190421e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063763332DNAL7 a10.1007/s11816-019-00529-02doi7 a10.1007/s11816-019-00529-02chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilliny, Nabil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3895-694310aCitrus tristeza virus-based induced gene silencing of phytoene desaturase is more efficient when antisense orientation is used  ap. 179-192.  aIn this study, phytoene desaturase (PDS) in citrus and green fluorescent protein (GFP) in Nicotiana benthamiana (line 16c) were silenced by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) with Citrus tristeza virus (CTV), using the sense and antisense orientations. The antisense orientation showed a stronger reduction of GFP expression in N. benthamiana compared with the sense orientation. Similarly, the antisense orientation of pds induced stronger leaf photobleaching than the sense orientation. The antisense orientation produced higher levels of pds- and gfp-specific short interfering RNAs (siRNAs; ∼ 21 nucleotides) than the sense orientation. In addition, the antisense orientation of pds resulted in lower expression of carotenoid biosynthetic genes and produced lower levels of carotenoids and chlorophylls compared to the sense orientation. Furthermore, the antisense insertion resulted in higher accumulation of the colorless carotenoid phytoene compared to the sense orientation. Our results indicate that the gene fragments inserted using the antisense orientation induced higher gene silencing than the sense orientation because more short interfering RNAs were produced. These siRNAs are complementary to the mRNAs of the target gene and consequently guide the degradation of target mRNA. Better understanding of gene silencing mechanisms in plants is necessary to enhance VIGS technology.  aPublisher supplied data  a201500955-04 fromcNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aCitrus 3aCitrus tristeza virus 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3abiosynthesis 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aenzymes 3agene silencing 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotides 3aphotobleaching 3asmall interfering RNA1 aNehela, Yasser1 aHijaz, Faraj1 aBen-Mahmoud, Sulley K.1 aHajeri, Subhas1 aGowda, Siddarame0 tPlant biotechnology reports.g2019 Apr., v. 13, no. 2 p.179-192dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl4237782x1863-54667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11816-019-00529-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005800155245011700213300001600330520154900346592002801895650001601923650002501939650002501964650002701989650002702016650001302043650000902056650001302065650001702078650001602095650002802111650001402139650001902153650001402172650001902186650001602205650002302221650002202244650001602266650001602282650001202298650002402310650001502334650001302349651001102362653001402373653001502387653001502402653001502417653001402432653001302446700001502459700002002474700001702494700006002511700001902571700001902590773009102609856009002700852000902790655001202799IND60632903020221120034224.0191214e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063290302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStara, Alzbeta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6951-629710aEffects of S-metolachlor and its degradation product metolachlor OA on marbled crayfish (Procambarus virginalis)  ap. 616-625.  aIncreasing production of energy crops in Europe, mainly maize and rapeseed, has altered patterns of pesticide use in recent decades. The long-term effects of S-metolachlor (S-M) and of its metabolite metolachlor OA (M-OA) at the environmentally relevant concentration of 4.2 μg L−1 and at 42 μg L−1 (ten-fold concentration) on marbled crayfish (Procambarus virginalis) were evaluated in a 28-day exposure and after a subsequent 28-day recovery period. Indicators assessed were behaviour; biochemical haemolymph profile; oxidative and antioxidant parameters of gill, hepatopancreas, and muscle; and histology of hepatopancreas and gill. Results showed biochemical haemolymph profile (lactate, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, inorganic phosphate), lipid peroxidation in hepatopancreas, and antioxidant parameters (catalase, reduced glutathione, glutathione S-transferase) of hepatopancreas and gill of crayfish exposed to S-M and M-OA to significantly differ from controls (P < 0.01). Antioxidant biomarker levels remained different from controls after a 28-day recovery period. Differences in behaviour including speed of movement and velocity, and histopathological damage to gill and hepatopancreas were associated with S-M and M-OA exposure and persisted after 28 days in S-M- and M-OA-free water. Results suggest harmful effects of low concentrations of S-M and its metabolite M-OA on non-target organisms and provide information for assessing their effects at environmentally relevant concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProcambarus 3aalanine transaminase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant biomarkers 3aaspartate transaminase 3acatalase 3acorn 3acrayfish 3aenergy crops 3aglutathione 3aglutathione transferase 3ahemolymph 3ahepatopancreas 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3alactic acid 3alipid peroxidation 3along term effects 3ametabolites 3ametolachlor 3amuscles 3anontarget organisms 3aphosphates 3arapeseed 3aEurope 0aHerbicide 0aMetabolite 0aCrustacean 0aBiomarkers 0aHistology 0aRecovery1 aKubec, Jan1 aZuskova, Eliska1 aBuric, Milos1 aFaggio, Caterina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0066-24211 aKouba, Antonin1 aVelisek, Josef0 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 224 p.616-625dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01210naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245014500209300001300354500002200367520014500389592002800534650001400562650002500576650002000601650000900621700001700630700001500647700001800662773012400680856008300804852000900887655001200896IND60646017920221120173030.0201028e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064601792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-019-04877-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Hoa Quynh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9157-164710aCorrection to: Characterization of polymorphic loci for two cicada species: Cryptotympana atrata and Hyalessa fuscata (Hemiptera: Cicadidae)  ap. 3615.  aPublished Erratum  aUnfortunately the title of the original publication contains a typo.

Applying grafting techniques helped produce quality planting materials with unique characters, as these techniques influenced union establishment and successful growth of the grafted plants. This study assessed effects of different grafting techniques on establishment and early growth of four African mahogany species (Khaya ivorensis, K. anthotheca, K. grandifoliola and K. senegalensis) using 2-year old seedling rootstocks and scions from mature trees with desirable stem form. We assessed effects of three grafting methods (top-cleft, side grafting, and whip and tongue), and scion type on growth performance of the African mahogany species at 6 months after grafting. K. grandifoliola scion grafted onto K. grandifoliola rootstock recorded highest mean graft success (81.67%), number of leaves formed (11.6) and shoot height growth (7.47 cm) in the top-cleft method. The whip and tongue method was least successful among the three methods. Homografted plants had greatest influence on the grafting parameters for highest mean successes in K. grandifoliola/K. grandifoliola (81.67%), K. anthotheca/K. anthotheca (73.33%) and K. senegalensis/K. senegalensis (63.33%) except K. ivorensis scion type which occurred in the heterograft K. grandifoliola/K. ivorensis (76.67%). Highest performance of the top-cleft method is attributed to good contact between cambia of the grafted species and thus their easy union and growth. Grafting of the four African mahogany species is most successful using top-cleft grafting technique for sustainable production of improved cultivars for restoration and conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKhaya anthotheca 3aKhaya grandifoliola 3aKhaya ivorensis 3aKhaya senegalensis 3acultivars 3agrafting (plants) 3agrowth performance 3aleaves 3aontogeny 3aplanting 3arooting 3arootstocks 3ascions 3aseedlings 3astem form 3atongue 3atrees 3avegetative propagation1 aOpuni-Frimpong, Emmanuel1 aDompreh, Daniel0 tNew forests.g2019 July, v. 50, no. 4 p.539-554dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl40921x0169-42867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-018-9677-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245008200155520120100237592002801438650001301466650001201479650001501491650002701506650001401533650002401547650002201571651001001593700001801603700001801621700001601639773012001655856007201775852000901847655001201856IND60648680220221122061242.0190701e20161012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064868022DNAL7 a10.3390/f71002322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiayue10aSpatial Heterogeneity in Chinese Forest Area Change in the Early 21st Century  aA comprehensive set of 30-m resolution land coverage data of 2000 and 2010 was used for an analysis of the spatial heterogeneity of forest area change in early 21st century China. Four regression models were built to determine the current situation of the ‘forest transition’ in China. The results show that forest area in China has grown rapidly over this period such that total forest area has increased by 102,500 km2 and forest cover has increased by 1.06%. Our results demonstrate the presence of a ‘U-shaped’ relationship, the so-called ‘forest transition’, between forest area change and per capita gross domestic product (GDP). We estimate that the inflection point in the Chinese ‘forest transition’ will be at a per capita GDP of 50,522 yuan. In the future, regions with lower elevations, or slope, should be the focus of attention because of dramatic recent forest changes. In particular, forest areas in the regions of the Xiaoxing’anling-Changbaishan Mountains and in South China have markedly decreased, and these are areas of concern. In the meantime, the government needs to strengthen the management of large-scale interconversions between forest and grassland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aforests 3agrasslands 3agross domestic product 3amountains 3aregression analysis 3aspatial variation 3aChina1 aXin, Liangjie1 aTan, Minghong1 aWang, Yahui0 tForests.g2016 Oct. 12, v. 7, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f71002323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006800155245011300223300001600336520169600352592002802048650002402076650002502100650001502125650001302140650002602153650002802179650001402207650002002221650003502241650002102276650001802297650002602315650001702341650000902358650001402367650001502381653001802396653001302414653001302427653002102440653001702461653002402478700002702502700002402529700006902553773009102622856009002713852000902803655001202812IND60632903220221120041631.0191214e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063290322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHackenberger, Davorka K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3315-760810aEffects of single and combined exposure to nano and bulk zinc-oxide and propiconazole on Enchytraeus albidus  ap. 572-579.  aOrganisms in soil are often exposed to different mixtures of contaminants. These contaminants may interact with each other and, consequently, may have a different effect on organisms than each of them alone. We wanted to investigate possible effects of ZnO mixtures in bulk and nano form and fungicide propiconazole (PCZ) on biochemical parameters and reproduction in Enchytreus albidus. These compounds were applied separately and in binary mixture. In the single exposure experiment the EC50 values for the number of juveniles were calculated: nano ZnO (641.21 ± 88.82 mg kg−1), bulk ZnO (445.78 ± 148.4 mg kg−1) and PCZ (3.63 ± 1.68 mg kg-1), respectively. These concentrations were subsequently used in the binary exposure experiment. Calculated combination indices (CI), that allow quantitative determination of chemical interactions at different concentration and effect level, indicated additive or antagonistic interactions (CI ≥ 1) of applied mixture ratios. The only ratio that showed synergistic interaction (CI < 1) was 75% EC50 nZnO/25% EC50 PCZ. Both ZnO forms caused acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity increase of up to 40% of control level, as well as increased catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) level. PCZ did not affect AChE and CAT activities, yet it increased GST activity and MDA level. Induced levels of measured biomarkers indicate an oxidative stress after binary exposure, as well. These effects were not enhanced after binary exposure but reflected the effects on biomarkers that corresponding concentrations of these compounds generated in a single exposure experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnchytraeus albidus 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abiomarkers 3acatalase 3achemical interactions 3aglutathione transferase 3ajuveniles 3amalondialdehyde 3amedian effective concentration 3aoxidative stress 3apropiconazole 3aquantitative analysis 3areproduction 3asoil 3asynergism 3azinc oxide 0aPropiconazole 0aBulk ZnO 0aNano ZnO 0aOxidative stress 0aReproduction 0aEnchytraeus albidus1 aStjepanović, Nikolina1 aLončarić, Željka1 aHackenberger, Branimir K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4317-20670 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 224 p.572-579dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03850naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003000166245013100196300001600327520201400343592002802357650002502385650002302410650001402433650002802447650001302475650001502488650000902503650001602512650001402528650001002542650002702552650002302579650001002602650002302612650001402635650002402649650001702673650001302690650002502703650001802728650001402746650004402760650001202804653001602816653002402832653002002856653001902876700001702895700001602912700001502928700001902943700001602962700001602978700001602994773011203010856008103122852000903203655001203212IND60652422220221121215949.0190712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065242222DNAL7 a274170162pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311160015182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwarz, C.,d1785?-1863,10aInfluence of high inorganic selenium and manganese diets for fattening pigs on oxidative stability and pork quality parameters  ap. 345-353.  aData are scarce regarding combined high Se and Mn supplementation in livestock diets, however, as Se and Mn are functionally related as cofactors of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), respectively, beneficial synergistic effects on oxidative stability of tissues may result. This experiment evaluated the effect of an oversupply of Se and Mn within European legal limits compared with recommendations on performance, oxidative stability of the organism and meat quality in a randomised complete block design. A total of 60 crossbred gilts were fed maize–barley–soya bean meal diets formulated in a 2×2 factorial approach with inorganic Se (0.2 v. 0.5 mg/kg Se dry matter (DM)) or inorganic Mn (20 v. 150 mg/kg Mn DM) from 31 to 116 kg BW. Se supplementation reduced feed intake, whereas high Mn diets impaired average daily gain (P<0.05). Qualitative carcass characteristics were impaired by Se and Mn predominantly in the semimembranosus muscle. Activity of GPx in liver was increased by high Se diets (P<0.05). Mn supplementation increased catalase (CAT) activity in liver, GPx in plasma and total antioxidative capacity (TAC) in muscle, whereas it decreased CAT activity in plasma (P<0.05). Cu/Zn-SOD in muscle showed higher activity in high-Se-low-Mn diets but lower activity when both high Se and Mn were combined (Se×Mn P<0.05). Mn supplementation increased Mn concentration in longissimus thoracis et lumborum, but simultaneously reduced Se concentration (P<0.05). Upon retail display, Mn increased lipid oxidation more pronouncedly (higher thiobarbituric acid reactive substances; P<0.05) than Se (P<0.10). Despite some positive effects (Mn increased TAC, Se increased GPx, Se and Mn increased tenderness), no synergistic effects of high Se and Mn diets or an overall beneficial impact on meat quality, especially during storage, could be observed. Including the negative effects on performance, feeding Se and Mn up to the maximum legal level cannot be recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aaverage daily gain 3abean meal 3acarcass characteristics 3acatalase 3acrossbreds 3adiet 3afeed intake 3afinishing 3agilts 3aglutathione peroxidase 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3alongissimus muscle 3amanganese 3aoxidative stability 3apork quality 3aselenium 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aswine feeding 3asynergism 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3atissues 0aperformance 0aantioxidant enzymes 0alipid oxidation 0aretail display1 aEbner, K.

Influences of H2S on metal removal, cell viability, and antioxidant response of Phanerochaete chrysosporium upon exposure to heavy metals and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the present study were investigated. An enhancement in Pb(ΙΙ) removal with an increase in concentration of the H2S donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) was observed, and the maximum removal efficiencies increased by 31% and 17% under 100 and 200 mg/L Pb(ΙΙ) exposure, respectively, in the presence of 500 μM NaHS. Application of 500 μM NaHS increased the cell viability by 15%–39% under Pb(II) stress (10–200 mg/L) with relative to the untreated control. Increase in total Ag uptake and cell survival was also elicited by NaHS in a concentration-dependent manner under AgNP stress. Meanwhile, activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase were significantly enhanced with the introduction of NaHS under stresses of Pb(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Ni(II), and AgNPs. The inhibition in lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress was observed in P. chrysosporium cells exposed to these toxicants following NaHS pretreatment, which could be attributed to the upregulation in antioxidant enzymes. The results obtained suggest that H2S can alleviate heavy metals and AgNP-induced toxicity to P. chrysosporium and improve the removal efficiency of these toxicants from wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3aabiotic stress 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiotic stress 3acadmium 3acatalase 3acell communication 3acell viability 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogen sulfide 3alead 3alipid peroxidation 3ananosilver 3anickel 3aoxidative stress 3asilver 3asodium 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3azinc 0aHydrogen sulfide 0aHeavy metals 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aBioremediation 0aAntioxidant response 0aPhanerochaete chrysosporium1 aHe, Kai1 aSong, Zhongxian1 aZeng, Guangming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4230-76471 aChen, Anwei1 aYuan, Lei1 aLi, Hui1 aChen, Guiqiu0 tChemosphere.g2019 June, v. 224 p.554-561dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01438naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245016300162300001400325520040100339592002800740650002200768650001400790650001200804650001400816650001300830650001000843650001300853650001400866650001000880700001900890773010700909856007501016852000901091655001201100IND60637635520221117233115.0190422e20150623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063763552DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.1978.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlech, Kazimierz10aPrzebieg mitozy w korzeniach siewek pszenicy pod wpływem rubidu [Course of mitosis in root seedlings of Triticum aestivum L. under the influence of rubidium]  ap. 33-40.  aThe depresion of mitosis as a result of rubidium action illustrated by the lower frequency of mitosis was found in an investigation made on roots of wheat seedlings grown on a nutrient medium which the total amount of potassium or a half of it was replaced by rubidium.

The 17 study participants were nominated as exemplars of self-management by diabetes experts. Data were generated from four structured focus groups, clinic records of participants, and investigator field notes. Using the constant comparative method of analysis , data were examined for patterns and themes. Analysis revealed that participants moved through three distinct phases of learning to manage diabetes. Movement through phases was heralded by identifiable transitional events. The three phases — management-as-rules, management-as-work, and management-as-living — are described as a model by which healthcare practitioners and educators can better understand the socioclinical aspects in self-management of type 2 diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3awomen 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 2aAdaptation, Psychological 2aAged 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xprevention & control 2aFemale 2aFocus Groups 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aNursing Methodology Research 2aPatient Education as Topicxstandards 2aSelf Carexmethods 0adiabetes mellitus1 aRayman, Kathleen M.0 tDiabetes educator.g1998 June, v. 24, no. 3 p.325-330dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x0145-72177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0145721798024003073Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03123naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245011400205300001600319520171500335592002802050650001702078650001202095650001302107650001702120650002302137650001802160650002302178650001302201650001502214650001202229650001302241650001502254650002002269650001402289650002402303650002002327650001502347700002402362700002202386700001902408700002702427773010902454856008102563852000902644655001202653IND60646018320221120152711.0190605e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064601832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11056-018-9680-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumais, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1932-302110aSurvival and growth dynamics of red spruce seedlings planted under different forest cover densities and types  ap. 573-592.  aAdvance regeneration of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) is scarce in many forest stands, due to past clearcuts and heavy harvesting of large seed trees in partial cuts. Understory enrichment planting has been proposed as a means to reintroduce the species in managed stands in which regeneration is deficient. Here, we present 5-year results regarding survival and growth dynamics of red spruce seedlings planted under hardwood, mixedwood, and coniferous forest covers following various cuts (each made on 0.5–1.2 ha square area): hybrid single-tree and group-selection, irregular shelterwood (two variants: continuous cover and extended irregular shelterwood), uniform regular shelterwood, harvesting with advance regeneration protection (HARP), and careful logging around advanced growth (hereafter referred to as ‘patch clearcut’). Five-year seedling survival did not vary among cuts except under the coniferous cover, where it was better in the heavier cuts (HARP and patch clearcut; 67%) than under continuous cover shelterwood cuts (24%), in which browsing occurrence was high (around 80%). Under the hardwood cover, height, diameter and biomass growth were greater in the extended irregular shelterwood cut than in other treatments. Under the mixedwood and coniferous covers, seedling growth was greater in patch clearcut, likely because transmitted light (90–100% full sunlight) was higher than in other cuts (around 30%). Results suggest that red spruce could be reintroduced using enrichment planting under a partial forest cover, but that additional treatments could be necessary to manage light and to limit browsing pressure in order to optimize long-term survival and growth performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea rubens 3abiomass 3abrowsing 3aclearcutting 3aconiferous forests 3aforest stands 3agrowth performance 3ahardwood 3aharvesting 3alogging 3aplanting 3aseed trees 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3ashelterwood systems 3asolar radiation 3aunderstory1 aLarouche, Catherine1 aRaymond, Patricia1 aBédard, Steve1 aLambert, Marie Claude,0 tNew forests.g2019 July, v. 50, no. 4 p.573-592dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl40921x0169-42867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-018-9680-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010000156300001600256520154400272592002801816650001101844650001001855650002101865650001501886650001801901650001301919650001401932650001601946650001401962650000701976650001401983650002001997700002402017773011002041856007302151852000902224655001202233IND60133139420221119195706.0150518e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013313942DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.121232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrahmand, S.10aHarderian Gland in Canadian Ostrich (Struthio camelus): A Morphological and Histochemical Study  ap. 178-185.  aHeads of ten healthy adult ostrich obtained from slaughter house were the constituted materials of the study. The Harderian gland (HG) was dissected out, and all of the gross morphometrical parameters including length, width and thickness as well as weight of left and right glands were recorded. Tissue sections were stained, using haematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, periodic acid‐Schiff and Alcian blue (pH 2.5) techniques. In ostrich, HG was an orbital organ located ventromedially around the posterior part of the eyeball. It was an oval flatted shape, light pink colour with irregular outline and was pointed in the dorsal end. Its mean length was 35.30 ± 2.84 mm and 35.55 ± 3.58 mm in left and right sides, respectively, and mean width 15.30 ± 1.20 mm and 15.65 ± 1.18 mm in left and right sides, respectively. There was no significant difference between length, thickness, weight and width of left and right glands. Histological results showed that the glandular epithelium was multilobular and compound tubuloalveolar. The gland was surrounded by a connective tissue capsule, and the epithelium was lined by simple columnar epithelial cells of varying height. The secretion of HG was mucous and the secretion type was apocrine. Mucosubstance analysis revealed that secretory units contained acidic and neutral glycoproteins. The granules within the epithelial cells lining the intralobular and inter‐lobular excretory ducts of the gland were positive for periodic acid‐Schiff and Alcian blue (pH 2.5).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acolor 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3aglycoproteins 3agranules 3amaterials 3amethodology 3aostriches 3apH 3asecretion 3aslaughterhouses1 aMohammadpour, A.

The study was carried out in the Spruce Woods Provincial Park (SWPP) located in southwestern Manitoba, Canada. The dry regional climate restricted trembling aspen growth during the growing season via moisture deficiency and temperature induced drought stress. Warm, mild winters also negatively affected radial growth of trembling aspen. Growth of white spruce was moderated by conditions within the aspen stands as radial growth patterns showed low variability from year to year, a low common growth signal, and a stronger response to temperature than to precipitation. Nonetheless, the dry regional climate still restricted growth of white spruce during the growing season via temperature induced drought stress. The findings of the study for white spruce support the stress gradient hypothesis in which facilitative interactions between tree species are expected under harsher environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea glauca 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aboreal forests 3aclimate 3aecotones 3aenvironmental factors 3agrowing season 3amixed forests 3atemperature 3atrees 3awater stress 3awinter 3aManitoba1 aWang, G.

Bile ducts, the gall bladder and portal vein were injected with coloured latex. Using the technique of dissection, bile ducts were isolated from the liver lobes. It was found that the cystic duct in this species is rarely single. Hepatic ducts form a system of multiple anastomosing structures running in the hepatoduodenal ligament. Many bile duct openings were observed in the duodenal papilla. The results confirm wide variations of the biliary tract in mammals and may be important for comparative analysis of the morphological differentiation of these structures in small mammals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliver 3aportal vein 3agall bladder 3aligaments 3abile 3alatex 3abile ducts 3asmall mammals 3aChinchilla (Chinchillidae) 0achinchillas1 aKuchinka, J.1 aSzczurkowski, A.1 aKuder, T.0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2015 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.236-240dBlackwell Sciencex0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.121373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01656naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002900141245026500170300001400435520036600449592002800815650001900843650003200862650001200894650001000906650001700916650002300933650001600956650000900972650001700981650001300998650001701011650001501028650001701043700001901060773010701079856007501186852000901261655001201270IND60637635720221117232722.0190422e20150623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063763572DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.1978.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarczmarczyk, Stanisław10aBadania możliwości stosowania norflurazonu do zwalczania Agropyron repens (L.)

For this, the toxin contents of 97 commercial fish feeds have been estimated, and the most prominent toxins in fish feed are calculated to be deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisins and enniatins. These pose a risk to fish well-being, as can be calculated by the Bayesian models for determining the critical concentrations 5% (CC5) for the different toxins. Besides fishmeal, wheat, soybean products and corn are regularly used as fish feed ingredients. The calculated scenarios show that fish are at high risk of toxin contamination if feed ingredients of low quality are chosen for feed production. Due to this, specific maximum allowable levels for several mycotoxins in fish feeds should be established.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3acorn 3adeoxynivalenol 3afish 3afish feeds 3afish meal 3afumonisins 3aingredients 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asoybean products 3awheat 3azearalenone 3aEurope0 tMycotoxin research.g2020 Feb., v. 36, no. 1 p.41-62dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:1993x0178-78887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12550-019-00368-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245010700157520157400264592002801838650001501866650001201881650001701893650001001910650002701920650002001947650001501967650001401982650001701996650000902013650001402022651001802036700001902054700001802073700002302091773012002114856007202234852000902306655001202315IND60648680820221120200834.0190701e20161014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064868082DNAL7 a10.3390/f71002372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnett, Kevin10aBeyond Fuel Treatment Effectiveness: Characterizing Interactions between Fire and Treatments in the US  aIn the United States, fuel reduction treatments are a standard land management tool to restore the structure and composition of forests that have been degraded by past management. Although treatments can have multiple purposes, their principal objective is to create landscape conditions where wildland fire can be safely managed to help achieve long-term land management goals. One critique is that fuel treatment benefits are unlikely to transpire due to the low probability that treated areas will be burned by a subsequent fire within a treatment’s lifespan, but little quantitative information exists to corroborate this argument. We summarized the frequency, extent, and geographic variation of fire and fuel treatment interactions on federal lands within the conterminous United States (CONUS). We also assessed how the encounters between fuel treatments and fires varied with treatment size, treatment age, and number of times treated. Overall, 6.8% of treatment units evaluated were encountered by a subsequent fire during the study period, though this rate varied among ecoregions across the CONUS. Larger treatment units were more likely to be encountered by a fire, and treatment units were most frequently burned within one year of the most recent treatment, the latter of which is likely because of ongoing maintenance of existing treatments. Our results highlight the need to identify and prioritize additional opportunities to reduce fuel loading and fire risk on the millions of hectares of federal lands in the CONUS that are in need of restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecoregions 3aforests 3afuel loading 3afuels 3ageographical variation 3aland management 3alandscapes 3alongevity 3apublic lands 3arisk 3awildfires 3aUnited States1 aParks, Sean A.1 aMiller, Carol1 aNaughton, Helen T.0 tForests.g2016 Oct. 14, v. 7, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f71002373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245011600152300001600268520137600284592002801660650001101688650002201699650001301721650001101734650001401745650002001759650001101779650001201790650002501802650001001827700001301837700001301850700001401863773013001877856007302007852000902080655001202089IND60133139820221119195617.0150518e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013313982DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.121252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLang, A.10aHistomorphometric Analysis of Collagen and Elastic Fibres in the Cranial and Caudal Fold of the Porcine Glottis  ap. 186-199.  aThe porcine glottis differs from the human glottis in its cranial and caudal vocal folds (CraF, CauF). The fibre apparatus of these folds was studied histomorphometrically in adult minipigs. For object definition and quantification, the colour‐selection tools of the Adobe‐Photoshop program were used. Another key feature was the subdivision of the cross‐sections of the folds into proportional subunits. This allowed a statistical analysis irrespective of differences in thickness of the folds. Both folds had a distinct, dense subepithelial layer equivalent to the basement membrane zone in humans. The subsequent, loose layer was interpreted – in principle – as being equivalent to Reinke's space of the human vocal fold. The next two layers were not clearly separated. Due to this, the concept of a true vocal ligament did not appear applicable to neither CauF nor CraF. Instead, the body‐cover model was emphasized by our findings. The missing vocalis muscle in the CraF is substituted by large collagen fibre bundles in a proportional depth corresponding to the position of the muscle of the CauF. The distribution of elastic fibres made the CraF rather than the CauF more similar to the human vocal fold. We suggest that these data are useful for those wishing to use the porcine glottis as a model for studying oscillatory properties during phonation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abasement membrane 3acollagen 3ahumans 3aligaments 3aminiature swine 3amodels 3amuscles 3astatistical analysis 3aswine1 aKoch, R.1 aRohn, K.1 aGasse, H.0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2015 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.186-199dBlackwell SciencewJournal:jnl3895878x1439-02647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.121253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01585naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245016900159300001400328520057400342592002800916650002300944650001400967650001600981650001100997650001401008650002101022700001901043700001801062773010701080856007501187852000901262655001201271IND60637636120221117232958.0190422e20150623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063763612DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.1978.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalkowski, M.10aCharakterystyka anatomiczno-morfologiczna blaszek liściowych odmian Lolium multiflorum [Anatomical-morphological characteristics of Lolium multiflorum leaf blades]  ap. 85-94.  aResults are reported of morphological-anatomical investigations on cultivated varieties of Lolium multiflorum.

Lambs were randomly assigned to a control diet (13.0% GNC) and two test diets containing SFC (14.5%) and KSC (12.0%), as sole protein supplements and fed respective diets according to requirements recommended by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, 1998 for a period of 155 days. Daily feed intake and fortnightly body weight of each lamb were recorded throughout the feeding trial. After 120 days, a metabolic trial of 6 days was conducted to determine nutrient digestibilities and balances. After the 75th day, all lambs were sensitised intramuscularly with heat-killed Brucella abortus S₉₉ and 20% chicken red blood cell (RBC) suspension and a booster was given after 15 days to assess the humoral immune response. Antibody titres were estimated in serum collected from sensitised lambs on 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35th day post sensitisation. The cell-mediated immune response was assessed by delayed type hypersensitive (DTH) reaction against phytohemagglutinin-P and in vitro lymphocyte proliferative assay (LPA) on the 150th day of the experiment. On the 155th day, four representative lambs from each group were slaughtered for carcass studies. The karanjin content in KSC estimated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was 0.325%, hence constituted 390mg karanjin per kg diet. Dry matter (DM), nutrient intake and digestibilities of proximate constituents, energy and fibre fractions by SFC- and GNC-fed lambs did not differ, but DM and nutrient intake by lambs which were fed KSC was lowered (P<0.05) compared to other diets. This resulted in lower (P<0.05) growth rates, nutrient efficiency and relatively higher digestibility co-efficients for DM, organic matter, crude fat, nitrogen-free extract, energy and neutral detergent fibre in KSC-fed lambs. Balance of phosphorus (P) was comparable among the groups, but calcium (Ca) and nitrogen (N) balance was lower (P<0.05) in KSC-fed lambs. Antibody titres against B. abortus and chicken RBC was depressed (P<0.05) in lambs which were fed KSC diet on the 7th day post sensitisation, while such depression was not observed with SFC feeding. The DTH response and in vitro LPA response were not affected by SFC, but the response was lower on KSC diet. No effect of variation in protein supplements was observed on carcass characteristics. The study indicated that the incorporation of SFC as the sole protein source in the diets of lambs had no effect on body weight, nutrient intake, nutrient digestibilities, immune response and carcass traits. But with 12% KSC inclusion in complete diets (390mg karanjin per kg), there was depressed performance and immunocompetence in lambs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3aNellore 3aagricultural research 3abody weight 3acalcium 3acarcass characteristics 3achickens 3adigestibility 3aerythrocytes 3aexperimental diets 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3aimmunocompetence 3alambs 3alymphocyte proliferation 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anitrogen 3anutrient intake 3anutrient utilization 3aorganic matter 3apeanut cake 3aphosphorus 3aprotein supplements 3asunflower cake1 aDhanalakshmi, K.1 aHimabindu, D.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2011 May, v. 97, no. 1-3 p.12-20dElsevier B.V.x0921-44887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2011.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009400156300002000250520093300270592002801203650002201231650001501253650001201268650001501280650001801295650001001313650001501323650001101338650001801349650001401367650001301381650000701394650001701401650001501418650001101433650001201444650002101456700001601477700001601493700001501509700001401524700001801538700001901556700001701575700001801592773012501610856007401735852000901809655001201818IND60669105420221118014110.0190920e20151008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066910542DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra12009h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Chunlin10aTannin as a gatekeeper of pH-responsive mesoporous silica nanoparticles for drug delivery  ap. 85436-85441.  aTannin grafted on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (tannin-MSNs) was synthesized by the amidation reaction of carboxyl benzyl borate with amino group modified MSN. Tannin-MSNs were an MCM-41 type of mesoporous material with a uniform diameter of about 150 nm. The XRD and N₂ adsorption/desorption isotherm results demonstrated that the rhodamine was effectively loaded and the pores of MSN were blocked by tannin. Rhodamine as a model cargo was used to evaluate the loading and releasing behaviors of tannin-MSNs. The drug release rate of tannin-MSNs was pH dependent. An in vitro cellular cytotoxicity test indicated that tannin-MSNs were highly biocompatible and suitable to be used as drug carriers. The cellular uptake was investigated by confocal laser scan microscopy. The results showed that tannin-MSNs are promising platforms to construct a pH-responsive controlled drug delivery system for cancer and stomach therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aborates 3adesorption 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3anitrogen 3apH 3aporous media 3arhodamines 3asilica 3astomach 3atoxicity testing1 aYu, Lingxue1 aZheng, Zhen1 aWang, Jing1 aLiu, Yuan1 aJiang, Yifeng1 aTong, Guangzhi1 aZhou, Yanjun1 aWang, Xinling0 tRSC advances.g2015 Oct. 08, v. 5, no. 104 p.85436-85441dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra12009h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002700138245013200165520139900297592002801696650001801724650001901742650001201761650001701773650002201790650001301812650002401825650002001849650001601869650001001885650000901895700001801904700002501922700001701947773012001964856007202084852000902156655001202165IND60648681020221120211121.0190701e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064868102DNAL7 a10.3390/f71002402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontoro Girona, Miguel10aRadial Growth Response of Black Spruce Stands Ten Years after Experimental Shelterwoods and Seed-Tree Cuttings in Boreal Forest  aPartial cutting is thought to be an alternative to achieve sustainable management in boreal forests. However, the effects of intermediate harvest intensity (45%–80%) on growth remain unknown in black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) stands, one of the most widely distributed boreal species with great commercial interest. In this study, we analysed the effect of three experimental shelterwood and one seed-tree treatments on tree radial growth in even-aged black spruce stands, 10 years after intervention. Our results show that radial growth response 8–10 years after cutting was 41% to 62% higher than in untreated plots, with stand structure, treatment, tree position relative to skidding trails, growth before cutting and time having significant interactions. The stand structure conditioned tree growth after cutting, being doubled in younger and denser stands. Tree spatial position had a pronounced effect on radial growth; trees at the edge of the skidding trails showed twice the increase in growth compared to interior trees. Dominant trees before cutting located close to the skidding trails manifested the highest growth response after cutting. This research suggests that the studied treatments are effective to enhance radial wood production of black spruce especially in younger stands, and that the edge effect must be considered in silvicultural management planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea mariana 3aboreal forests 3acutting 3aedge effects 3aforest management 3aplanning 3ashelterwood systems 3astand structure 3atree growth 3atrees 3awood1 aMorin, Hubert1 aLussier, Jean-Martin1 aWalsh, Denis0 tForests.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 7, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f71002403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001600146245012300162300001800285520123200303592002801535650001601563650001901579650002001598650001401618650001701632650004301649650001701692650001801709650000801727650001601735650001301751700002301764773013301787856008201920852000902002655001202011IND4463002320221119165436.0141111e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446300232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2011.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSari, Ferda10aEffects of particle size, extraction time and temperature, and derivatization time on determination of theanine in tea  ap. 1130-1135.  aTheanine is a unique amino acid almost exclusively found in tea which is considered to have positive effects on human health. Data on theanine methods of analysis are quite rare in the literature and extraction parameters are not well documented. In this study, optimum extraction parameters such as particle size, extraction temperature and time, and derivatization time with coloring reagent were determined. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detector was used for the determination of theanine, and chromatographic separations were achieved by using reverse-phase C₁₈ column. HPLC gradient program was improved to get better resolution of theanine. Linearity, selectivity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ) and precision of method (intra and inter-day) were also determined. Best extraction conditions for particle size, extraction temperature, extraction time and derivatization time were found to be 150–300μm, 80°C, 25min and 2min, respectively. Precision of the HPLC method was very high since intra-day and inter-day variations were 1.14% and 0.96%, respectively. LOD and LOQ values were found as 20ng/mL and 50ng/mL indicating the method is highly sensitive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3adetectors 3afluorescence 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman health 3aparticle size 3atea 3atemperature 3atheanine1 aVelioglu, Y.

This paper aims to develop geometric and mathematical models of wind and thermal comfort and use them to examine the impacts of six small-scale renewal strategies on the wind and thermal environment at pedestrian level in Dazhimen neighborhood, Wuhan, which is a typical case study of urban renewal project in a mega-city. The key parameters such as the solar radiation, natural convection, relative humidity, ambient crosswind have been incorporated into the mathematical models by using user-defined-function (UDF) method. Detailed temperature and velocity distributions under different strategies have been compared for the optimization of local renewal strategies. It is concluded that five rules generated from the simulation results can provide guidance for building demolition and reconstruction in a neighborhood and there is no need of large-scale demolition. Particularly, combining the local demolition and city virescence can both improve the air ventilation and decrease the temperature level in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abuilding construction 3acase studies 3acities 3aconvection 3ageometry 3amathematical models 3arelative humidity 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3aurban development 3aurban planning 3awind1 aMing, Tingzhen1 aCheng, Jianquan1 aWu, Yongjia1 aPeng, Zhong-Ren0 tSustainability.g2015 Mar. 13, v. 7, no. 3 p.3109-3128dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su70331093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01512naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245013300172300001600305520035300321592002800674650001000702650001100712650001900723650001600742650000900758650001700767650002100784653003000805653000900835653001400844653001700858700001700875700005600892773009100948856009001039852000901129655001201138IND60632904020221122061446.0191214e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063290402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.1982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwak, Jin Il10aSoil algae pipe assay: ex situ method for the evaluation of soil quality based on soil algae and its application to the pot test  ap. 634-636.  aWe aimed to develop an ex situ method for evaluating soil quality using soil algae.

Breeding stably and durably resistant cultivars is the most effective approach for managing and controlling the disease. The success of FHB resistance breeding relies on identification of an effective resistant germplasm. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the high-density wheat 90 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays to better understand the genetic basis of FHB resistance in natural population and identify associated molecular markers. RESULTS: The resistance to FHB fungal spread along the rachis (Type II resistance) was evaluated on 171 wheat cultivars in the 2016–2017 (abbr. as 2017) and 2017–2018 (abbr. as 2018) growing seasons. Using Illumina Infinum iSelect 90 K SNP genotyping data, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 26 loci (88 marker-trait associations), which explained 6.65–14.18% of the phenotypic variances. The associated loci distributed across all chromosomes except 2D, 6A, 6D and 7D, with those on chromosomes 1B, 4A, 5D and 7A being detected in both years. New loci for Type II resistance were found on syntenic genomic regions of chromsome 4AL (QFhb-4AL, 621.85–622.24 Mb) and chromosome 5DL (QFhb-5DL, 546.09–547.27 Mb) which showed high collinearity in gene content and order. SNP markers wsnp_JD_c4438_5568170 and wsnp_CAP11_c209_198467 of 5D, reported previously linked to a soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV) resistance gene, were also associated with FHB resistance in this study. CONCLUSION: The syntenic FHB resistant loci and associated SNP markers identified in this study are valuable for FHB resistance breeding via marker-assisted selection.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0100801;2016YFD0101802cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aBK20171279cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province  aCARS-03-03BcChina Agricultural Research System  a31901544cNational Natural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3aSoil-borne wheat mosaic virus 3aTriticum aestivum 3achromosome mapping 3acrop production 3acultivars 3adisease control 3afood security 3afungi 3agenetic markers 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3agermplasm 3agrowing season 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotype 3aplant breeding 3aresistance genes 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3awheat1 aGao, Derong1 aWu, Hongya1 aLiu, Jian1 aZhang, Chunmei1 aWang, Junchan1 aJiang, Zhengning1 aLiu, Yeyu1 aLi, Dongsheng1 aZhang, Yong1 aLu, Chengbin0 tBMC plant biology.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.29-29dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-019-2177-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013800154300001600292520131400308592002801622650001901650650001101669650002201680650002001702650001001722650004301732650005201775700001501827700001501842700001901857773013001876856007302006852000902079655001202088IND60133140120221122182322.0150518e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013314012DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.121282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoen, K.10aIdentification of Stably Expressed Reference Genes for RT‐qPCR Data Normalization in Defined Localizations of Cyclic Bovine Ovaries  ap. 200-211.  aOvaries are highly complex organs displaying morphological, molecular and functional differences between their cortical zona parenchymatosa and medullary zona vasculosa, and also between the different cyclic luteal stages. Objective of the present study was to validate expression stability of twelve putative reference genes (RGs) in bovine ovaries, considering the intrinsic heterogeneity of bovine ovarian tissue with regard to different luteal stages and intra‐ovarian localizations. The focus was on identifying RGs, which are suitable to normalize RT‐qPCR results of ovaries collected from clinical healthy cattle, irrespective of localization and the hormonal stage. Expression profiles of twelve potential reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, YWHAZ, HPRT1, SDHA, UBA52, POLR2C, RPS9, ACTG2, H3F3B, RPS18 and RPL19) were analysed. Evaluation of gene expression differences was performed using genorm, normfinder, and bestkeeper software. The most stably expressed genes according to genorm, normfinder and bestkeeper approaches contained the candidates H3F3B, RPS9, YWHAZ, RPS18, POLR2C and UBA52. Of this group, the genes YWHAZ, H3F3B and RPS9 could be recommended as best‐suited RGs for normalization purposes on healthy bovine ovaries irrespective of the luteal stage or intra‐ovarian localization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3acattle 3acomputer software 3agene expression 3agenes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction1 aPlendl, J.1 aGabler, C.1 aKaessmeyer, S.0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2015 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.200-211dBlackwell SciencewJournal:jnl3895878x1439-02647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.121283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245010700154520174100261592002802002650001902030650002102049650003702070650001602107650002102123650002002144650002102164650002202185650001702207650002202224650001202246650001202258650002202270650001202292650001702304650003102321650001902352650001002371650001402381650001102395650002502406650001702431700002202448700002102470773012002491856007202611852000902683655001202692IND60648681220221122061349.0190701e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064868122DNAL7 a10.3390/f71002392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunz, Jörg10aEffects of Drought and Rewetting on Growth and Gas Exchange of Minor European Broadleaved Tree Species  aWidespread and economically important European tree species such as Norway spruce, Scots pine, and European beech are projected to be negatively affected by the increasing intensity and frequency of dry and hot conditions in a future climate. Hence, there is an increasing need to investigate the suitability of presumably more drought tolerant species to ensure future ecological stability, biodiversity, and productivity of forests. Based on their distribution patterns and climatic envelopes, the rare, minor broadleaved tree species Sorbus torminalis ((L.) C<inf>RANTZ</inf>), S. domestica (L.), Acer campestre (L.), and A. platanoides (L.) are assumed to be drought tolerant, however, there is only limited experimental basis to support that notion. This study aimed at quantifying growth and gas exchange of seedlings of these species during drought conditions, and their capacity to recover following drought. For that purpose, they were compared to the common companion species Quercus petraea ((M<inf>ATTUSCHKA</inf>) L<inf>IEBL</inf>.) and Fagus sylvatica (L.). Here, potted seedlings of these species were exposed to water limitation followed by rewetting cycles in a greenhouse experiment. Photosynthesis and transpiration rates, stomatal conductance as well as root and shoot growth rates indicated a high drought resistance of A. campestre and A. platanoides. Sorbus domestica showed a marked ability to recover after drought stress. Therefore, we conclude that these minor tree species have the potential to enrich forests on drought-prone sites. Results from this pot experiment need to be complemented by field studies, in which the drought response of the species is not influenced by restrictions to root development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer campestre 3aAcer platanoides 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aQuercus petraea 3aSorbus domestica 3aSorbus torminalis 3abiodiversity 3abroadleaved trees 3aclimate 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aforests 3agas exchange 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aphotosynthesis 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3astomatal conductance 3awater stress1 aRäder, Annemarie1 aBauhus, Jürgen,0 tForests.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 7, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f71002393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245019000170520137600360592002801736650003801764650001701802650001101819650001201830650002001842650001201862650002601874650002201900650001501922650001201937650002201949650002101971650002301992650001602015650002002031650001902051650001102070653002002081653001602101653001702117653001802134653001902152653003302171653001702204653002602221653005002247700001502297700001702312700002002329700001502349700001802364700002102382700002602403700002102429700001902450773009802469856008802567961000902655852000902664655001202673IND60686862220221119234548.0200516e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068686222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1123492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, Narumi10aChemical identification of 18-hydroxycarlactonoic acid as an LjMAX1 product and in planta conversion of its methyl ester to canonical and non-canonical strigolactones in Lotus japonicus  aStrigolactones (SLs) are a group of plant apocarotenoids that act as rhizosphere signaling molecules for both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and root parasitic plants. They also regulate plant architecture as phytohormones. The model legume Lotus japonicus (synonym of Lotus corniculatus) produces canonical 5-deoxystrigol (5DS) and non-canonical lotuslactone (LL). The biosynthesis pathways of the two SLs remain elusive. In this study, we characterized the L. japonicus MAX1 homolog, LjMAX1, found in the Lotus japonicus genome assembly build 2.5. The L. japonicus max1 LORE1 insertion mutant was deficient in 5DS and LL production. A recombinant LjMAX1 protein expressed in yeast microsomes converted carlactone (CL) to 18-hydroxycarlactonoic acid (18-OH-CLA) via carlactonoic acid (CLA). Identity of 18-OH-CLA was confirmed by comparison of the methyl ester derivative of the MAX1 product with chemically synthesized methyl 18-hydroycarlactonoate (18-OH-MeCLA) using LC-MS/MS. (11R)-CL was detected as an endogenous compound in the root of L. japonicus.¹³C-labeled CL, CLA, and 18-OH-MeCLA were converted to [¹³C]-5DS and LL in plant feeding experiments using L. japonicus WT. These results showed that LjMAX1 is the crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis of Lotus SLs and that 18-hydroxylated carlactonoates are possible precursors for SL biosynthesis in L. japonicus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLotus corniculatus var. japonicus 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3aenzymes 3agenome assembly 3alegumes 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amicrosomes 3amutants 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aparasitic plants 3aplant architecture 3arhizosphere 3astable isotopes 3astrigolactones 3ayeasts 0aLotus japonicus 0aLeguminosae 0aBiosynthesis 0aStrigolactone 0a5-Deoxystrigol 0a18-Hydroxylcarlactonoic acid 0aLotuslactone 0aCytochrome P450 (CYP) 0aLotus japonicus MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 1 (MAX1)1 aSado, Aika1 aXie, Xiaonan1 aYoneyama, Kaori1 aAsami, Kei1 aSeto, Yoshiya1 aNomura, Takahito1 aYamaguchi, Shinjirō,1 aYoneyama, Koichi1 aAkiyama, Kohki0 tPhytochemistry.g2020 June, v. 174 p.112349-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1123493Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245017300175300001800348520076700366592002801133650002201161650001101183650002201194650002301216650002301239650001501262650001601277650001401293650002001307653002501327653002501352653002101377653002201398653001401420653002901434700002301463700002301486700002201509700002401531700002301555700003201578773008001610856008101690852000901771655001201780IND60551475520221119063713.0161018e20150506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055147552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2015.03.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorotaev, Vladislav Yu.10aHighly regio- and stereoselective addition of aminoenones to 2-substituted 3-nitro-2H-chromenes.

From these compounds, under acidic conditions, 4-acetoacetonyl-3-nitrochromanes and 5H-chromeno[3,4-b]pyridines, depending on the substituent at the 2-position, were obtained in moderate to good yields.

Despite extensive genetic studies, the molecular aetiology has remained enigmatic. A recent systems biology study suggested a protein–protein interaction network for SZ with 504 novel interactions. The onset of psychiatric disorders is predominant during adolescence, often accompanied by subtle structural abnormalities in multiple regions of the brain. The availability of BrainSpan Atlas data allowed us to re-examine the genes present in the SZ interactome as a function of space and time. The availability of genomes of healthy centenarians and nonpsychiatric Exome Aggregation Consortium database allowed us to identify the variants of criticality. The expression of the SZ candidate genes responsible for cognition and disease onset was studied in different brain regions during particular developmental stages. A subset of novel interactors detected in the network was further validated using gene expression data of post-mortem brains of patients with psychiatric illness. We have narrowed down the list of drug targets proposed by the previous interactome study to 10 proteins. These proteins belonging to 81 biological pathways are targeted by 34 known Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs that have distinct potential for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. We also report the possibility of targeting key genes belonging to celecoxib pharmacodynamics, [Formula: see text] signalling and cGMP-PKG signalling pathways that are not known to be specific to SZ aetiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescence 3abrain 3acognition 3adatabases 3adrugs 3aetiology 3agene expression 3agenomics 3aheritability 3ameta-analysis 3apharmacodynamics 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aschizophrenia 3aspace and time 3atherapeutics1 aPathak, Ankit Kumar1 aSinha, Prashant1 aJainarayanan, ASHWIN K.1 aJain, Sanjeev1 aBrahmachari, Samir K.0 tJournal of genetics.g2019 June, v. 98, no. 2 p.60-60dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16319x0022-13337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12041-019-1101-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010300161300001600264520203400280592002802314650002202342650002402364650002202388650002102410650002202431650001502453650000902468650002002477650001902497650002302516651000902539651001802548773011302566856007402679852000902753655001202762IND60133140320221122155121.0150518e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013314032DNAL7 a10.1111/cobi.124262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHulme, Philip E.10aResolving whether botanic gardens are on the road to conservation or a pathway for plant invasions  ap. 816-824.  aA global conservation goal is to understand the pathways through which invasive species are introduced into new regions. Botanic gardens are a pathway for the introduction of invasive non‐native plants, but a quantitative assessment of the risks they pose has not been performed. I analyzed data on the living collections of over 3000 botanic gardens worldwide to quantify the temporal trend in the representation of non‐native species; the relative composition of threatened, ornamental, or invasive non‐native plant species; and the frequency with which botanic gardens implement procedures to address invasive species. While almost all of the world's worst invasive non‐native plants occurred in one or more living collections (99%), less than one‐quarter of red‐listed threatened species were cultivated (23%). Even when cultivated, individual threatened species occurred in few living collections (7.3), while non‐native species were on average grown in 6 times as many botanic gardens (44.3). As a result, a botanic garden could, on average, cultivate four times as many invasive non‐native species (20) as red‐listed threatened species (5). Although the risk posed by a single living collection is small, the probability of invasion increases with the number of botanic gardens within a region. Thus, while both the size of living collections and the proportion of non‐native species cultivated have declined during the 20th century, this reduction in risk is offset by the 10‐fold increase in the number of botanic gardens established worldwide. Unfortunately, botanic gardens rarely implement regional codes of conduct to prevent plant invasions, few have an invasive species policy, and there is limited monitoring of garden escapes. This lack of preparedness is of particular concern given the rapid increase in living collections worldwide since 1950, particularly in South America and Asia, and highlights past patterns of introduction will be a poor guide to determining future invasion risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotanical gardens 3aecological invasion 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3aissues and policy 3amonitoring 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arisk reduction 3athreatened species 3aAsia 3aSouth America0 tConservation biology.g2015 June, v. 29, no. 3 p.816-824dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.124263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245009700174520104000271592002801311650003401339650001901373650001301392650001301405650002201418650002501440650002201465650001901487650003201506650002601538650002201564650002101586650002501607650001301632650004401645650001901689650002601708653002001734653001901754653002901773653002501802653003901827653001001866700002001876700001801896700002401914700001901938700002001957773009801977856008802075852000902163655001202172IND60686862320221119234529.0200516e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068686232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1123502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKılınç, Hilal10aPhytochemical investigation of Scabiosa sicula guided by a preliminary HPLC-ESIMSn profiling  aThe genus Scabiosa (Caprifoliaceae) is represented by 80 species, widely used as medicinal plants for their positive effects on human diseases. On the basis of the interesting biological activity shown by Scabiosa spp., the phytochemical investigation of Scabiosa sicula L., never investigated before, was carried out. An initial LC-MS profile of the MeOH extract of S. sicula whole plant guided the isolation of 34 compounds, of which the structures were unambiguously elucidated by NMR analysis as phenolic compounds and triterpene saponins, among which eight undescribed compounds.Moreover, the total phenolic content of S. sicula methanol extract has been evaluated. On the basis of the pharmacological activities reported for Scabiosa species the antioxidant activity of the methanol extract was tested by TEAC and DPPH assays. Finally, the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of the methanol extract was assayed, showing an IC₅₀ value (49 μg/mL) comparable to that exerted by acarbose (90 μg/mL), used as positive control.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aCaprifoliaceae 3aScabiosa 3aacarbose 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aantioxidant activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3ahuman diseases 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amedicinal plants 3amedicinal properties 3amethanol 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphytochemicals 3atriterpenoid saponins 0aScabiosa sicula 0aCaprifoliaceae 0aTriterpene-type saponins 0aAntioxidant activity 0aα-glucosidase inhibitory activity 0aLC-MS1 aMasullo, Milena1 aD'Urso, Gilda1 aKarayildirim, Tamer1 aAlankus, Ozgen1 aPiacente, Sonia0 tPhytochemistry.g2020 June, v. 174 p.112350-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1123503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245006100160300001600221520104400237592002801281650001301309650002301322650001301345650001901358650001401377650002501391650001501416650001501431650001701446650001501463650001801478650001501496650002101511650001101532650001101543650001401554650001301568650001301581650002001594650001601614651001301630700002901643700001801672700002001690773010101710856007401811852000901885655001201894IND60693075220221116224509.0200504e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069307522DNAL7 a10.4155/bfs.11.1582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbideen, Zainul14aThe place of halophytes in Pakistan’s biofuel industry  ap. 211-220.  aAn unsustainable supply of fossil fuel necessitates the need to look for suitable alternatives. One solution lies in using plant biomass, which can be converted into a wide range of biofuels. To avoid conflict between feed and fuel, the crops available for human consumption being used presently as biofuel feedstock may be replaced with halophytes, which have the potential to thrive in saline lands and can be irrigated with brackish water; some can even tolerate seawater salinity. This approach will help in producing sustainable fuel without encroaching on the good quality land and water resources needed for food crops. A candidate species should preferably be perennial, having high yield in saline lands with minimum inputs. Other attributes include cellulose/hemicellulose >25–30%, lignin <10%, low salt load in foliage and a non-invasive nature. The unexplored aspects of agronomy of these wild plants need careful study, especially with regards to land degradation and ecological consequences, before large-scale cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3abioenergy industry 3abiofuels 3abrackish water 3acellulose 3aenvironmental impact 3afeedstocks 3afood crops 3afossil fuels 3ahalophytes 3ahemicellulose 3airrigation 3aland degradation 3aleaves 3alignin 3aphytomass 3asalinity 3aseawater 3awater resources 3awild plants 3aPakistan1 aAnsari, R.q(Raziuddin),1 aGul, Bilquees1 aKhan, M.

We conducted a global classification of terrestrial geophysical diversity and analyzed how land protection varies across geophysical diversity types. Geophysical diversity was classified in terms of soil type, elevation, and biogeographic realm and then compared to the global distribution of protected areas in 2012. We found that 300 (45%) of 672 broad geophysical diversity types currently meet the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 11 of 17% terrestrial areal protection, which suggested that efforts to implement geophysical diversity conservation have a substantive basis on which to build. However, current protected areas were heavily biased toward high elevation and low fertility soils. We assessed 3 scenarios of protected area expansion and found that protection focused on threatened species, if fully implemented, would also protect an additional 29% of geophysical diversity types, ecoregional‐focused protection would protect an additional 24%, and a combined scenario would protect an additional 42%. Future efforts need to specifically target low‐elevation sites with productive soils for protection and manage for connectivity among geophysical diversity types. These efforts may be hampered by the sheer number of geophysical diversity facets that the world contains, which makes clear target setting and prioritization an important next step.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aconservation areas 3ageophysics 3aprioritization 3asoil fertility 3asoil types 3athreatened species1 aSegan, Daniel B.1 aWatson, James E.M.0 tConservation biology.g2015 June, v. 29, no. 3 p.649-656dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.125023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245012400164300001600288520185800304592002802162650001002190650001302200650001202213650001502225650001002240650001602250650002302266650001302289650002502302650001502327650001302342650002002355650001902375650002202394650001202416650001002428650001402438651001402452700001802466700002202484700001502506700002302521700001802544773011902562856007902681852000902760655001202769IND60501328020221117223833.0160222e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6050132802DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.125352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNimmo, Dale G.10aRiparian tree cover enhances the resistance and stability of woodland bird communities during an extreme climatic event  ap. 449-458.  aEcosystems world‐wide increasingly are subject to multiple interacting disturbances. Biodiversity in anthropogenic landscapes can be enhanced by manipulating landscape patterns, but could such landscape management also assist biota to cope with the effects of extreme climatic events, such as drought? We surveyed woodland bird communities in 24 ‘whole’ landscapes (each 100 km²) in an agricultural region of south‐eastern Australia near the beginning (2002–2003), middle (2006–2007) and after (2011–2012) an extreme drought (the ‘Millennium Drought’). We quantified the resistance, resilience and stability of the avifauna to the decade of drought and related these measures to properties of the study landscapes: the extent of wooded habitat, configuration of habitat, land‐use composition, landscape productivity and geographic context. Landscape productivity, represented by the extent of riparian tree cover in the landscape, was the strongest driver of the resistance, resilience and stability of avifaunal richness to severe drought. Woodland bird communities in landscapes with larger areas of riparian tree cover retained a larger proportion of their species richness during the Millennium Drought and consequently had greater stability over the drought's duration. Synthesis and applications. Landscape properties can influence the resistance, resilience and stability of faunal communities to an extreme climatic event. By protecting, restoring and enhancing native vegetation in productive areas of landscapes along stream systems, drainage lines and floodplains, land managers can effectively build climatic refugia and thereby enhance the resistance of biota to climatic extremes. However, a net decline over the entire study period suggests this will not, by itself, arrest decline during periods of extreme drought.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3adrainage 3adrought 3aecosystems 3afauna 3afloodplains 3aindigenous species 3aland use 3alandscape management 3alandscapes 3amanagers 3arefuge habitats 3ariparian areas 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 3atrees 3awoodlands 3aAustralia1 aHaslem, Angie1 aRadford, James Q.1 aHall, Mark1 aBennett, Andrew F.1 aJames, Jeremy0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2016 Apr., v. 53, no. 2 p.449-458dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.125353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245011500158500002000273520123100293592002801524596005901552596005901611650002701670650001701697650002501714650001501739650002901754650001801783650001101801650001401812650002301826650001701849650002701866650001101893650000901904650001701913650002901930650002701959700001701986700001902003700001502022700001802037700001902055700001502074700001602089700001702105773013902122856007802261852000902339655001202348IND60631161120221119122921.0190219e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063116112DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2018007952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Peng10aSulforaphane Improves Lipid Metabolism by Enhancing Mitochondrial Function and Biogenesis In Vivo and In Vitro  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSCOPE: Sulforaphane (SFN) is reported to reduce the accumulation of lipids. However, the underling mechanism remains unclear. In this study, the potential of SFN to improve lipid metabolism is investigated through altering mitochondrial function and biogenesis‐related mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: The abnormal lipid metabolism model was established both in HHL‐5 cells and in rats by feeding a high‐fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks. The current findings suggest that SFN alleviates the swelling of mitochondria and stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis. The reduced expression of NRF1 and TFAM, were reversed by SFN. SFN increases the levels of antioxidant compounds via nuclear factor erythroid‐2‐related factor (Nrf2) activation. Furthermore, SFN improves multiple mitochondrial bioactivities, such as mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP, and the electron transfer chain based on PGC‐1α pathway. SFN also activates lipolysis by transcriptionally upregulating adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone‐sensitive lipase (HSL). CONCLUSIONS: SFN enhances utilization of lipids via both the PGC‐ 1α‐dependent promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis and Nrf2 dependent improvement of mitochondrial function.  aPublisher supplied data  a81573135cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018RCD14cHeilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aantioxidants 3abioactive properties 3abiogenesis 3aelectron transport chain 3ahigh fat diet 3alipids 3alipolysis 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3amodels 3arats 3asulforaphane 3atranscription (genetics) 3atriacylglycerol lipase1 aTian, Sicong1 aTeng, Chunying1 aHuang, Lei1 aLiu, Xiaodong1 aWang, Jiaojiao1 aZhang, Yao1 aLi, Baolong1 aShan, Yujuan0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2019 Feb., v. 63, no. 4 p.e1800795-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2018007953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008600170300001600256520141800272592002801690650002901718650001101747650001201758650001701770650001801787650001001805650001301815650001401828650002301842650001501865650001701880650002001897650002001917653002601937653002501963653001501988653002102003700001402024700002002038700001802058700001602076700001702092700001702109773010902126856008602235852000902321655001202330IND60559777020221118034021.0190319e20170105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055977702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2016.11.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Chengmiao10aPhloridzin promotes the growth of Fusarium moniliforme (Fusarium verticillioides)  ap. 187-194.  aApple replant disease (ARD) has been reported from all major fruit-growing regions of the world, and is often caused by biotic (pathogen fungi) and abiotic (phenolic compounds) factors. However, how phenolic compounds affect pathogen fungi is not yet fully understood. The aims of this study were to investigate whether the Fusarium moniliforme (F. moniliforme, a soil-borne pathogen of apple) could be labeled with fluorescent silicon carbide (SiC) quantum dots for a long-term tracing, and to observe the effect of phloridzin on the growth and conidia morphology of F. moniliforme with the help of fluorescence labeling with SiC quantum dots. The phloridzin was set to three concentrations (0mM, 0.5mM and 1.0mM). Results showed that F. moniliforme could be labeled with SiC quantum dots and that the fluorescence in the mycelium could be observed for at least 40days. The fluorescent images during the labeling process showed that F. moniliforme growth and division were slower when there was no phloridzin. The growth and division of F. moniliforme were fast with the help of phloridzin, and the growth and division were faster in the 1.0mM phloridzin than in the 0.5mM phloridzin. These results suggested that SiC quantum dots could successfully label F. moniliforme for a long-term tracing, and phloridzin could promote the growth and conidia division of F. moniliforme under the experimental concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium verticillioides 3aapples 3aconidia 3afluorescence 3afruit growing 3afungi 3amycelium 3apathogens 3aphenolic compounds 3aphloridzin 3aquantum dots 3areplant disease 3asilicon carbide 0aApple replant disease 0aFusarium moniliforme 0aPhloridzin 0aSiC quantum dots1 aXiang, Li1 aWang, Gongshuai1 aWang, Yanfang1 aShen, Xiang1 aChen, Xuesen1 aMao, Zhiquan0 tScientia horticulturae.g2017 Jan. 05, v. 214 p.187-194dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2016.11.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005600149245020700205300001600412520053700428592002800965650002100993650001301014650002601027650001301053700001701066700002001083700001801103700001601121700001201137700001401149700001301163700005401176773011801230856008401348852000901432655001201441IND60765561720221117005424.0220130e20220112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076556172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c041462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Zhi-Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1755-057310aDivergent Conversion of Double Isocyanides with Alkenyl Bromide to Polysubstituted Pyrroles and 4-Imino-4,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrrol-6(1H)-one Derivatives by Pd-Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization Reactions  ap. 859-863.  aHerein a novel and concise approach to pyrrole skeletons via Pd-catalyzed tandem cyclization reactions is investigated.

We examined wild pigs for exposure to Brucella spp. and Francisella tularensis from Oklahoma and Texas to determine their potential role as a regional reservoir for these pathogens since wild pigs co‐occur with livestock, especially on rangelands in this region. Antibodies to Brucella spp. and F. tularensis were found in every location sampled and during multiple years. Overall, wild pigs had a 12.5% prevalence of Brucella spp. and a 14.8% prevalence of F. tularensis in this study. Wild pig prevalence of Brucella spp. was 43 times higher in southcentral Oklahoma compared to previously published results. Understanding and monitoring regional disease prevalence rates in wild pigs are necessary, especially on rangelands managing for livestock that may be susceptible to these diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  cNoble Research Institute  cDepartment of Environmental Toxicology, Texas Tech University 3aBrucella 3aFrancisella tularensis 3aSus scrofa 3adisease prevalence 3ainvasive species 3arangelands 3aswine 3aOklahoma 3aTexas1 aHoffarth, Anna1 aAthanasiou, Kevin1 aHawkins, Samuel L.1 aWilson‐Fallon, Alexander N.1 aGibson, Anna1 aReinoso Webb, Cynthia1 aGaskamp, Joshua A.1 aWebb, Stephen L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6034-51641 aHaydett, Katelyn M.1 aTiffin, Hannah S.1 aPresley, Steven M.0 tEcosphere.g2021 Mar., v. 12, no. 3 p.e03426-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.34263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003700144245008700181300001600268520108700284592002801371650001801399650001601417650001101433650001801444650002701462650001701489650001901506650001401525650001601539650000901555650001701564700002101581700002001602773012901622856004501751852000901796655001201805IND50066647620130523000000.0130523e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006664762DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2012004142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOosterhuis, D.

In addition, K is also involved in numerous physiological functions related to plant health and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. However, K deficiency occurs widely resulting in poor growth, lost yield, and reduced fiber quality. This review describes the physiological functions of K and its role in stress relief and also provides some agronomic aspects of K requirements, diagnosis of soil and plant K status, and amelioration. The physiological processes described include enzymes and the regulation of organic‐compound synthesis, water relations and stomates, photosynthesis, transport, cell signaling, and plant response to drought stress, cold stress, salt stress, as well as biotic stresses. The agronomic aspects of K fertilization include the K requirements of cotton, K uptake, and soil characteristics, genotypic variation in K uptake and use, and characteristics of K deficiency in cotton. In addition, diagnosis and amelioration of K soil and plant status is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotic stress 3acold stress 3acotton 3afiber quality 3agrowth and development 3aplant growth 3aplant response 3apotassium 3asalt stress 3asoil 3awater stress1 aLoka, Dimitra A.1 aRaper, Tyson B.0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2013 June, v. 176, no. 3 p.331-343dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx1436-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.201200414  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008100163300001600244520118700260592002801447650002101475650001701496650001201513650001101525650002601536650001901562650000701581650001901588650001901607650001301626650002401639650001901663650001201682650001801694700001501712773011801727856008201845852000901927655001201936IND60618455020221118055655.0181029e198305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061845502DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517583053005032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, C.D.10aDyeing of Modified Polypropylene: Cationic Dyes on Chlorinated Polypropylene  ap. 274-281.  aPolypropylene fiber was chlorinated by the action of sodium hypochlorite under specific conditions. On chlorination, the moisture content of the fiber increased, but there was no effect on the fiber's mechanical properties. On chlorination, marked affinity was created in the fiber for cationic dyes from alkaline medium. Eight different cationic dyes were used on the chlorinated product under different dye bath pH conditions. Dyeings tended to show that the mechanism of application of cationic dyes on chlorinated polypropylene was a reactive type, i.e., through the formation of a covalent bond between the fiber and the dye. Of the eight cationic dyes, seven possessed poor to moderate light fastness, only Methylene Blue (CI Basic Blue 9) gave very good light fastness. In all the eight dyeings, other fastness properties such as fastness to washing, bleach, sea-water, and soda-boil were good. All the eight dyeings were after-treated with iodine which increased light fastness. Of the eight dyes, four produced photodegrading action on the fiber and four afforded photoprotection. Methylene Blue gave very good photoprotective action to the chlorinated polypropylene fiber.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3achlorination 3afabrics 3aiodine 3amechanical properties 3amethylene blue 3apH 3aphotostability 3apolypropylenes 3aseawater 3asodium hypochlorite 3atextile fibers 3awashing 3awater content1 aJain, D.K.0 tTextile research journal.g1983 May, v. 53, no. 5 p.274-281dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517583053005033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011600164300001600280520086500296592002801161650002101189650002601210650002601236650001701262650001701279650002001296650004101316650002901357650002101386650002601407650002401433653001401457653004101471653002601512653001701538653002901555700002501584700002701609700002101636700006501657773012301722856008501845852000901930655001201939IND60543332020221121230347.0190410e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054333202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2015.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhan, Xin10aAdditional diterpenes from Physcomitrella patens synthesized by copalyl diphosphate/kaurene synthase (PpCPS/KS)  ap. 110-114.  aThe bifunctional diterpene synthase, copalyl diphosphate/kaurene synthase from the moss Physcomitrella patens (PpCPS/KS), catalyses the formation of at least four diterpenes, including ent-beyerene, ent-sandaracopimaradiene, ent-kaur-16-ene, and 16-hydroxy-ent-kaurene. The enzymatic activity has been confirmed through generation of a targeted PpCPS/KS knock-out mutant in P. patens via homologous recombination, through transient expression of PpCPS/KS in Nicotiana benthamiana, and expression of PpCPS/KS in E. coli. GC-MS analysis of the knock-out mutant shows that it lacks the diterpenoids, supporting that all are products of PpCPS/KS as observed in N. benthamiana and E. coli. These results provide additional knowledge of the mechanism of this bifunctional diterpene synthase, and are in line with proposed reaction mechanisms in kaurene biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPhyscomitrella patens 3abiosynthesis 3aditerpenoids 3aenzyme activity 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahomologous recombination 3aknockout mutants 3amosses and liverworts 3areaction mechanisms 0aDiterpene 0aCopalyl diphosphate/kaurene synthase 0aPhyscomitrella patens 0aEnt-beyerene 0aEnt-sandaracopimaradiene1 aBach, Søren Spanner1 aHansen, Nikolaj Lervad1 aLunde, Christina1 aSimonsen, Henrik Toft1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3070-807X0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2015 Nov., v. 96 p.110-114dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2015.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03415naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245015100206300001400357520145500371592002801826596005701854596005701911596005701968596005702025650002202082650001802104650001102122650001502133650003002148650002302178650001502201650001402216650002202230650002202252650002402274650001202298650002702310650002502337650002602362651002302388700002302411700001902434700002202453700001702475700002002492700005802512700006002570700002102630773011902651856008202770852000902852655001202861IND60683370220221118060544.0200208e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068337022DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-019-01219-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIgawa, Takeshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6880-618010aDetecting inter- and intra-island genetic diversity: population structure of the endangered crocodile newt, Echinotriton andersoni, in the Ryukyus  ap. 13-26.  aThe endangered crocodile newt, Echinotriton andersoni, is a relatively large species of the family Salamandridae and is distributed on six islands in the central part of the Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan. Because of an originally small distribution range and recent habitat loss, this species has been steadily declining in number. To elucidate fine-scale population structure, which is essential for effective conservation management, we analyzed genetic diversity and gene flow based on nine microsatellite loci. Our results identified three different island groups (Amamioshima, Tokunoshima, and Okinawajima) and multiple genetic assemblages within the Amami and Okinawa island groups. The gross genetic variation within each island was positively correlated with island size. Population structure followed a latitudinal cline and isolation by distance, even among geographically isolated islands. In northern Okinawajima, relatively complex genetic structure was observed. This unexpected population structure seems to reflect historical migration and distribution expansion through the formation of land bridges and shifted coastlines in the Pleistocene. We also found that small islands showed little genetic variation (Ukeshima, Sesokojima, and Tokashikijima). In particular, our findings revealed that the Tokashikijima population is at greater risk for extinction than the other populations because it has the smallest effective population size.  aPublisher supplied data  a23710282cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a26830144cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a24310173cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a20510216cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aPleistocene epoch 3aSalamandridae 3acoasts 3acrocodiles 3aeffective population size 3aendangered species 3aextinction 3agene flow 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat destruction 3aislands 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3asalamanders and newts 3aRyukyu Archipelago1 aSugawara, Hirotaka1 aHonda, Masanao1 aTominaga, Atsushi1 aOumi, Shohei1 aKatsuren, Seiki1 aOta, Hidetoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1749-34301 aMatsui, Masafumi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2032-25281 aSumida, Masayuki0 tConservation genetics.g2020 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.13-26dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870040x1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-019-01219-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245011800160506002800278520163000306592002801936506003701964650001202001650001602013650001302029650001602042650001602058650001402074650001102088650002102099650002002120650002002140650002202160650005802182650001602240650001002256650000902266653001502275653001102290653001702301653002102318653002102339653001702360700002002377700001902397700002302416700001702439700001802456773012002474856007802594852000902672655001202681IND60785687620221207074734.0210630s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078568762DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha492122962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aACEMİ, Arda10aMolecular weight and concentration of chitosan affect plant development and phenolic substance pattern in arugula  aResource is Open Access  aThe present research reports the role of chitosan’s molecular weight (1, 10, and 100 kDa) on the differentiation of its effects on arugula (Eruca vesicaria ssp. sativa) cultivation in a controlled environment. The leaves' phenolic substance pattern from the plants treated with the chitosan variant that gave the best developmental results was analyzed through a reversed-phase HPLC. The leaf production was enhanced after 10 kDa chitosan treatment at 5 mg L-1, while the leaf area expansion was significantly improved after 1 and 100 kDa chitosan at 20 mg L-1 and 10 kDa chitosan at 5 mg L-1. The plant's rhizogenic development was restricted after all chitosan treatments regardless of their molecular weight and concentration. The contents of chlorophyll b and carotenoids increased after the treatments; however, chlorophyll a content was not significantly affected by the treatments and remained unchanged. The chromatographic analysis showed that 10 kDa chitosan treatment at 5 mg L-1 increased gallic acid, rutin, and p-coumaric acid contents and made significant changes in the individual phenolic substance pattern. The current study indicated that direct application of chitosan to soil restricts root production in arugula but enhances foliar growth, which is beneficial to producers. On the other hand, constant- or over-treatment with chitosan could inhibit root growth and further lead to developmental deficiencies sourced by nutrient uptake disorders. The use of chitosan as an organic and natural biostimulant in controlled-environment agriculture could be a better option than synthetic growth stimulants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarugula 3acarotenoids 3achitosan 3achlorophyll 3agallic acid 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amolecular weight 3anutrient uptake 3ap-coumaric acid 3aplant development 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aroot growth 3arutin 3asoil 0abiopolymer 0achitin 0aEruca sativa 0aleaf development 0aphenolic pattern 0arhizogenesis1 aPOLAT, Ece GÜN1 aÇAKIR, Merve 1 aDEMİRYÜREK, Elif1 aYAVUZ, Bahar1 aÖZEN, Fazıl0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2021, v. 49, no. 2dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha492122963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245014200156300001600298500001500314520149200329592002801821650002101849650002001870650001101890650001201901650001701913650001901930650001201949650002001961650001001981650001001991650001102001650001902012650001502031650001302046650002102059653000902080700001302089700001402102700001902116773010402135856007802239852000902317655001202326IND60132546520221117224440.0150505e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013254652DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2013006702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hui10aEnhanced tolerance and accumulation of heavy metal ions by engineered Escherichia coli expressing Pyrus calleryana phytochelatin synthase  ap. 398-405.  a2019-12-04  aContamination by heavy metals is a major environmental problem worldwide and microbial bioremediation is an efficient method for removing this type of pollution. The plant enzyme phytochelatin synthase (PCS, also known as glutathione γ‐glutamylcysteinyltransferase, EC 2.3.2.15) involved in the synthesis of phytochelatins (PCs), which are metal‐binding cysteine‐rich peptides, has a major role in the detoxification of heavy metals in plants. Expression of the PcPCS1 gene from the bean pear (Pyrus calleryana Dcne.) was induced after cadmium and copper treatments. However, functional analysis of this gene in vivo has not been reported. And it is or not suitable for bioremediation also needs to be assessed. In this study, we found Escherichia coli with over‐expressed PcPCS1 had enhanced tolerance to cadmium, copper, sodium, and mercury. E. coli cells transformed with pPcPCS1 was found to survive in solid M9 medium containing 2.0 mM Cd²⁺, 4.0 mM Cu²⁺, 4.5% (w/v) Na⁺, or 200 µM Hg²⁺. Moreover, the growth curve showed 1.5 mM Cd²⁺, 2.5 mM Cu²⁺, 3.5% (w/v) Na⁺, and 100 µM Hg²⁺had no effect on the growth of the E. coli cells transformed with pPcPCS1. Also, we found the contents of PCs and the accumulation of cadmium, copper, sodium, and mercury ions were enhanced in the recombinant E. coli strain Rosetta™ (DE3). These results suggested the PcPCS1 gene might be a candidate for heavy metal bioremediation via recombinant bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPyrus calleryana 3abioaccumulation 3acopper 3amercury 3aheavy metals 3abioremediation 3acadmium 3ametal tolerance 3apears 3agenes 3asodium 3aphytochelatins 3ametal ions 3abacteria 3aEscherichia coli 0aions1 aCong, Yu1 aLin, Jing1 aChang, Youhong0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2015 Mar., v. 55, no. 3 p.398-405dAkademie-Verlagx0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2013006703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245014200168300001600310520105200326592002801378650002701406650001101433650002001444650002201464650001801486650001001504650001001514650001801524650002601542650001201568650003001580650004501610650001801655650000901673650002201682650001301704651001201717700001901729700001601748700002201764700002001786700002501806773010301831856008401934852000902018655001202027IND4465001920221118060347.0141111e20110927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446500192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2011.04.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImre, Kálmán,10aMolecular characterisation of Cryptosporidium isolates from pre-weaned calves in Romania: Is there an actual risk of zoonotic infections?  ap. 321-324.  aDiarrheic fecal samples from 258 pre-weaned calves (1–30 day-old) from 9 dairy farms located in Banat region, Romania, were microscopically examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Overall, 65 (25%) samples were found positive. A higher percent of infection was recorded in calves aged between 8 and 14 days compared with other age categories (1–7, 8–14, 15–21 and 22–30 days; p<0.05). Genetic characterization was carried out on all Cryptosporidium-positive samples. After DNA extraction, Cryptosporidium species were determined by a nested PCR of the small subunit rRNA gene (18S) followed by RFLP analysis with SspI, VspI and MboII restriction enzymes. The restriction patterns showed that animals were infected with Cryptosporidium parvum. Subsequently, subtyping of 13 C. parvum isolates, based on sequence analysis of the 60kDa glycoprotein (GP60) gene, showed 2 subtypes (IIaA15G2R1 and IIaA16G1R1) belonging to the subtype family IIa.

Newts can possess extreme quantities of TTX and are one of the most well-studied of all TTX-bearing organisms, yet seemingly conflicting results between studies on closely related species continues to generate debate. In this study, eggs from 12 female newts (Taricha granulosa) were reared in captivity and the metamorphosed juveniles were fed a TTX-free diet for 3 years. Using a non-lethal sampling technique, we collected skin samples from each individual each year. Wild-caught juveniles from the same population were also sampled for TTX. In lab-reared juveniles, mass increased rapidly, and after only 2 years individuals approached adult body mass. TTX levels increased slowly during the first two years and then jumped considerably in year three when fed a diet free of TTX. However, wild-caught juvenile newts of unknown age were more toxic than their lab-reared counterparts. These results, coupled with additional data on the long-term production and synthesis of TTX in adult newts suggest that TTX is unlikely to come through dietary acquisition, but rather newts may be able to synthesize their own toxin or acquire it from symbiotic bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaricha 3aadults 3abiogenesis 3abody weight 3acaptive animals 3adiet 3afemales 3ajuveniles 3alaboratory rearing 3atetrodotoxin 3atoxicity 0aTTX 0aSalamandridae 0aToxin 0aToxicity 0aTaricha 0aGranulosa1 aStokes, Amber N.1 aBrodie, Edmund D.1 aBrodie, Edmund D.0 tToxicon.g2022 July 15, v. 213 p.7-12dElsevier LtdwJournal:6279x0041-01017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2022.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01937naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245007200171300001600243520066900259592002800928650002500956650002700981650001001008650002001018650003101038650001001069650001701079650002101096650001901117650002201136650001801158650001001176650004301186650000901229650001401238650002201252700002301274773012701297856008201424852000901506655001201515IND60089413220221122101654.0141102e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008941322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, Atul Kumar10aREM sleep deprivation of rats induces acute phase response in liver  ap. 242-246.  aREM sleep is essential for maintenance of body physiology and its deprivation is fatal.

Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that REM sleep deprivation down regulates AII3 gene and up regulates IL1 β, IL6 and their respective receptors gene expression in the liver initiating its inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3areceptors 3asleep deprivation1 aKar, Santosh Kumar0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 July 1, v. 410, no. 2 p.242-246dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245021300162300001800375520216400393592002802557650002202585650001402607650001602621650000902637650001902646650001702665650001602682650001402698650001202712650001102724650001602735650002802751651001002779700001302789700001602802700001302818700001302831700001702844773011102861856008102972852000903053655001203062IND60548065920221121061030.0170721e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054806592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-016-5122-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, X.

However, myxosporidiosis represents a severe threat to prevent the sustainable development of aquaculture of this species. During the investigation of myxosporean diversity of reared allogynogenetic gibel carp in East China, a new myxosporean with typical characteristics of Myxobolus was found from 169 out of 210 (80.4 %) examined samples, designated as Myxobolus sheyangensis n. sp. by combing comparative analysis of morphological and molecular data. The diagnostic features of this species are reminiscent with Myxobolus pyramidis Chen, 1958 as follows: round or ellipsoidal, grayish white, cyst-like polysporous plasmodia, averaging 219.3 ± 11.9 (98.7–421.7) × 158.4 ± 9.7 μm (79.9–191.8) in size; spores flat-pear shaped in frontal view with tapering anterior and rounded posterior ends and lemon-shaped in sutural view, averaging 11.0 ± 0.31 (10.5–11.9) × 10.2 ± 0.25 (9.2–10.7) × 6.3 ± 0.23 μm (5.9–6.9) in size; and two equal pyriform polar capsules averaging 5.5 ± 0.3 (4.5–6.1) × 3.4 ± 0.26 μm (2.9–4.0) in size with convergent longitudinal axes and polar filaments wounded in seven to eight coils, perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the polar capsules. Spore surface was smooth and two spore valves were symmetrical, with a thin and straight sutural ridge. Occasionally, abnormal spores with typical Henneguya-like caudal appendage and atypical papillary caudal appendage could be observed. The sporogenesis is asynchronous. Histopathological investigation showed that the plasmodia developed inside the capillary network of gill lamellae, belonging to the intralamellar vascular type, and no significant inflammatory responses were provoked by the infection. Homology search by BLAST showed that the newly obtained sequence did not match any available sequences in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis of the aligned sequences indicated that M. sheyangensis n. sp. positioned in a clade composed of Myxobolus species infecting the gill of several freshwater cyprinid fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarassius gibelio 3aMyxobolus 3aaquaculture 3afish 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3arearing 3aspores 3asporulation 3asustainable development 3aChina1 aYuan, S.1 aZhao, Y.

The effectiveness of this repellent treatment depends not only on the chemical composition and concentration of the fluorocarbon, but also on the chemical Composition and physical parameters of the fabric substrate. At the same concentration of the fluorocarbon evaluated, aramid fibers produced lower repellency than wool, probably because of the more oleophilic and hydrophilic nature of the former. A decrease in the density of wool fabric appears to result in lower petrol repellency. A one-bath exhaustion treatment involving the Zirpro flame retardants and a suitable fluorocarbon imparts adequate flame retardance, oil, petrol, and water repellency to wool, including protection against dangerous chemicals and a simulated petrol bomb test, fast to at least 25 charged dry cleanings. Other flammable liquids evaluated in the simulated bomb test, such as diesel, motor oil, and their mixtures with petrol, were less severe than petrol on Zirpro and fluorocarbon treated wool, presumably because they have a higher surface tension than petrol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid tolerance 3achemical composition 3adetergents 3aflame retardants 3agasoline 3ahydrophilicity 3aoils 3aperfluorocarbons 3asurface tension 3atextile fibers 3awool 3awoolen fabric1 aEdmondson, G.K.0 tTextile research journal.g1983 June, v. 53, no. 6 p.329-334dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517583053006013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245011200163300001600275506002800291520158100319592002801900506003701928650001701965650001201982650001601994650001802010650001302028650001302041650000902054650001002063650001902073650001202092650001402104650001702118650000902135650002102144651001302165700002002178700002502198700001802223700002502241700001902266700002402285773013502309856008002444852000902524655001202533IND60785688220221207074730.0150830e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078568822DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha.42.2.94692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aALI, Hakoomat10aNitrogen and Zinc Interaction Improves Yield and Quality of Submerged Basmati Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.)  ap. 372-379.  aResource is Open Access  a<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Garamond Premr Pro',serif">Nitrogen (N) and zinc (Zn) are the two major yield-limiting factors of flooded rice cultivation systems. Both nutrients interact and affect availability of the other in alkaline calcareous soils. In order to evaluate the interactive effects of N and Zn on yield and quality of Basmati rice, a field study was conducted at Sheikhupura (Site I) and Sargodha (Site II), Pakistan. Nitrogen treatments (0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 kg/ha) were kept in main blocks while zinc levels (0, 8, 10, 12 and 14 kg/ha) were kept in sub blocks. The main effects of N and Zn levels were significant for grain yield and yield attributes. N and Zn interaction significantly improved the grain yield, yield components and all kernel quality parameters, except kernel amylose contents. Combined application of 120 kg N/ha and 14 kg Zn/ha produced the maximum grain yields at both sites (6.12 and 5.78 t/ha). This combination also yielded the maximum kernel lengths and widths, water absorption ratio and kernel protein contents. There was a significant positive correlation between grain yield and total dry matter, panicle-bearing tillers, spikelets panicle, grain weight, and harvest index. Application of 160 kg N/ha was detrimental to yield and quality attributes and reduced the agronomic efficiency of N use at both sites. Site comparison showed that soil pH and soil nutrient contents play a significant role in determination of the optimum nitrogen and zinc fertilizer doses for maximum yields.</span></p>  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3aamylose 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3anitrogen 3apanicles 3arice 3aseeds 3asoil nutrients 3asoil pH 3aspikelets 3awater uptake 3azinc 3azinc fertilizers 3aPakistan1 aHASNAIN, Zuhair1 aSHAHZAD, Ahmad Naeem1 aSARWAR, Naeem1 aQURESHI, Muhammad K.1 aKHALIQ, Shazia1 aQAYYUM, Muhammad F.0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2014 Dec., v. 42, no. 2 p.372-379dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha.42.2.94693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245013100161300002000292520185100312592002802163650001202191650002202203650001502225650001302240650001602253650001702269650001902286653002702305653002102332653003102353653002102384653001402405700001502419700001702434700001402451700002402465700001902489700001202508700001902520700005802539700005402597773014102651856007802792852000902870655001202879IND60685555320221119220229.0200304e20200211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068555532DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b233742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Yunkang10aCorrelating Hysteresis and Stability with Organic Cation Composition in the Two-Step Solution-Processed Perovskite Solar Cells  ap. 10588-10596.  aThe two-step solution-based process has demonstrated substantial success in fabricating high-efficiency perovskite solar cells in recent years. Despite the high performance, the underlying mechanisms that govern the formation of perovskite films and corresponding device performance are yet to be fully understood. Particularly, organic cation composition used in the two-step solution processing of mixed-cation lead halide perovskite solar cells plays a critical role in the perovskite film formation and the resultant device performance. However, little is understood about the impacts of organic cation composition on the current density–voltage (J–V) hysteretic behavior and stability of perovskite solar cells. To address this need, here, we study the effect of mixed organic cations, that is, the fraction of formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA) contents, used for the two-step solution-processed perovskite thin films on solar cell performance, including efficiency, J–V hysteresis, and stability. In addition to the efficiency variations, we find that perovskite solar cells based on FA-rich and MA-rich stoichiometries show distinct characteristics in J–V hysteresis and stability. The origins of such a discrepancy are attributed to the thermodynamically driven conversion from lead iodide to perovskites, which is determined by the combination of organic cations. The perovskite solar cells based on the mixed cation FA₀.₆MA₀.₄PbI₃ composition show a champion power conversion efficiency of over 21% and robust stability (retaining more than 90% of initial efficiency) under maximum power-point tracking in dry nitrogen for more than 500 h. Our work provides insights on understanding the formation of perovskite films in the two-step process, which may benefit further investigation on perovskite solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3afilms (materials) 3ahysteresis 3anitrogen 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3athermodynamics 0aperovskite solar cells 0atwo-step process 0aorganic cation composition 0aJ−V hysteresis 0astability1 aChen, Cong1 aLi, Chongwen1 aChen, Lei1 aBista, Sandip Singh1 aLiu, Xiangyang1 aLi, You1 aAwni, Rasha A.1 aSong, Zhaoning1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6677-09941 aYan, Yanfa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3977-57890 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Feb. 11, v. 12, no. 9 p.10588-10596dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b233743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100004100148245011300189520110800302592002801410650003601438650001801474650002101492650001601513650001601529650001801545650001301563650001901576650001201595650001701607650002501624650001501649650001501664650001601679653001601695653003101711653001101742653001901753653001601772700003301788700003801821700004201859700003701901700002501938700003801963773011002001856008302111852000902194655001202203IND60787556920221119171625.0220830e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078755692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2022.1009202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlorentino, Gabrielle Ingrid Bizerra10aCharacterization of a new food packaging material based on fish by-product proteins and passion fruit pectin  aThe development of biodegradable bioplastics based on renewable raw materials has emerged as an innovative option to minimize the adverse effects of improper disposal of petrochemical packaging in the environment.

To ensure sustainable water supply, the fate of NO₃ must be considered in both surface water and ground water. The fate of N was investigated in a Britain catchment, the Coët-Dan watershed, with an integrated management tool: the hydrological SWAT model coupled with the ground water model MODFLOW, and its companion contaminant and solute transport model MT3DMS. The model was validated with respect to water quantity during a 6-yr period and for the NO₃ concentration during a 44-mo period, at two gauging stations in the catchment. The coupled models reproduced accurately the measurements. At the basin outlet, the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients were 0.88 for monthly flow for the entire period and 0.87 for monthly N load. Alternative scenarios were simulated and showed potential benefits of decreasing manure application from 210 to 170 kg N ha⁻¹ as required by the European Commission Nitrates Directive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aSus scrofa 3abasins 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3alivestock production 3amanure spreading 3amodel validation 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3apollution load 3asolutes 3asurface water 3awater quantity 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3aFrance1 aBouraoui, Fayçal1 aTurpin, Nadine1 aMarsily, Ghislain de,1 aBidoglio, Giovanni0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2003 Nov., v. 32, no. 6 p.2026-2032dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2003.20263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02175naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245007600175520112600251592002801377650001701405650001601422650001401438650001401452650000701466650001501473650001601488653001601504653001201520653002001532653002001552653002701572700001301599773010901612856008301721852000901804655001201813IND60787557020221119171951.0220824e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078755702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2022.1009212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Mohammad Imtiyaj10aPlant betalains: Recent applications in food freshness monitoring films  aBetacyanins are pH−sensitive pigments of red/violet in buffers of pH 2–8 but brown/light yellow above pH 8.

Changes in these profiles, especially pH and volatile amines, can be used for monitoring food freshness. This review covers recent advances on the use of betacyanins−incorporated packaging films for food freshness monitoring. Incorporation of betacyanins imparts pH−sensitivity, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, and water vapor and UV−vis light barriers to the films. Type and concentration of polymers, pH of filmogenic solution, film preparation conditions, food items to be stored, food biochemistry, and storage conditions have been reviewed to account for their effect on the performance of betacyanins as freshness indicator in active/intelligent films. Betacyanins incorporation does not cause any unfavorable changes in physicochemical and mechanical properties of the films, suggesting their suitability in active/intelligent packaging applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abetacyanins 3abetalains 3afreshness 3apH 3ashelf life 3awater vapor 0aBetacyanins 0aTVB−N 0aPackaging films 0apH−responsive 0aAntimicrobial property1 aLiu, Jun0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2022 Dec., v. 34 p.100921-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2022.1009213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012000153300001800273520083200291592002801123650003301151650000801184650001301192650001401205650001701219650001001236650000901246650004301255650001301298700001401311700001601325700001501341700001601356700001801372700001501390700002301405700001801428773011101446856007501557852000901632655001201641IND60529653220221122233832.0160717e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052965322DNAL7 a10.1021/ac50143322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yi10aPoint-of-Care Multiplexed Assays of Nucleic Acids Using Microcapillary-based Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification  ap. 7057-7062.  aThis report demonstrates a straightforward, robust, multiplexed and point-of-care microcapillary-based loop-mediated isothermal amplification (cLAMP) for assaying nucleic acids. This assay integrates capillaries (glass or plastic) to introduce and house sample/reagents, segments of water droplets to prevent contamination, pocket warmers to provide heat, and a hand-held flashlight for a visual readout of the fluorescent signal. The cLAMP system allows the simultaneous detection of two RNA targets of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from multiple plasma samples, and achieves a high sensitivity of two copies of standard plasmid. As few nucleic acid detection methods can be wholly independent of external power supply and equipment, our cLAMP holds great promise for point-of-care applications in resource-poor settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aRNA 3adroplets 3aequipment 3afluorescence 3aglass 3aheat 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3aplasmids1 aZhang, Lu1 aSun, Jiashu1 aLiu, Yulei1 aMa, Xingjie1 aCui, Shangjin1 aMa, Liying1 aXi, Jianzhong Jeff1 aJiang, Xingyu0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 July 15, v. 86, no. 14 p.7057-7062dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac50143323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04344naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001400157245005900171300001400230506002800244520293300272592002803205506003703233650001803270650002703288650002203315650000703337650001203344650001003356650001803366650001703384650001303401650002503414650001303439653001803452653001203470653001103482653001003493653002003503653001103523653001103534653001003545653001103555700003403566773014903600856009203749852000903841655001203850IND60785688420221207084057.0190415e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078568842DNAL7 a10.21776/ub.industria.2019.008.01.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSunarmani10aPepaya sebagai Bahan Pengisi pada Produksi Pasta Tomat  ap. 67-78.  aResource is Open Access  aAbstrak Pada umumnya, pasta tomat diproduksi menggunakan bahan dasar tomat yang ditambahkan dengan bahan pengisi, seperti carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Salah satu alternatif pengganti penggunaan CMC sebagai bahan pengisi adalah bahan pengisi alami seperti pepaya. Pepaya dapat dipakai sebagai bahan pencampur pembuatan pasta tomat karena kandungan total padatannya relatif hampir sama dengan total padatan tomat. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui karakteristik pasta tomat dengan penambahan pepaya sebagai bahan pengisinya. Penelitian menggunakan rancangan acak lengkap dengan perlakuan komposisi tomat dan pepaya (perbandingan tomat dan pepaya sebanyak 1:0 (kontrol), 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, dan 6:1). Setiap perlakuan diulang sebanyak lima kali. Variabel pengamatan pada penelitian adalah rendemen, total padatan terlarut, pH, total asam, vitamin C, dan uji organoleptik. Data yang diperoleh diolah menggunakan analisis sidik ragam (ANOVA) yang dilanjutkan dengan uji lanjut Duncan pada taraf nyata 5% (α = 0,05) menggunakan paket program SPSS 21.0 Statistic Software. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa pepaya dapat digunakan sebagai bahan pengisi pada pasta tomat. Penambahan buah pepaya dapat meningkatkan rendemen, total padatan terlarut, total asam, dan kandungan vitamin C pada pasta tomat. Penambahan buah pepaya sampai dengan 50% (komposisi tomat:pepaya sebanyak 2:1) menghasilkan pasta tomat yang stabil dan dapat diterima oleh konsumen. Kata kunci: karakteristik, pasta, pengisi, pepaya, tomat Abstract Generally, tomato paste is produced using tomato as raw material ingredients added with fillers, such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Another alternative to change CMC as filler is the use of natural fillers, such as papaya. Papaya could be used as a mixing material of tomato paste production because the total soluble solid of papaya is relatively almost the same as the total soluble solid of tomato. This study aimed to determine the characteristics of tomato paste with the addition of papaya as filler. The experiment was set up in completely randomized design with the treatment of the composition of tomatoes and papaya (the ratio of tomato and papaya as much as 1:0 (control),1:1, 2:1, 4:1, and 6:1). Each treatment repeated five times. The observation variables in the study were yield, total soluble solid, pH, total acid, vitamin C, and organoleptic test. Data obtained was processed using variance analysis (ANOVA) followed by Duncan’s advanced test at 5% (α = 0,05) using the SPSS 21,0 program statistical package. The results showed that papaya can be used as filler in tomato paste. The addition of papaya could increase yield, total soluble solid, total acid, and vitamin C content in tomato paste. Added papaya fruit up to 50% (tomato and papaya composition is 2:1) produced tomato paste which is stable and acceptable to consumers.

Bacteria have evolved at such contaminated sites that have the ability to degrade HCH. Degradation of various HCH isomers in bacterial strains is mediated primarily by two genes: linA and linB which encode dehydrochlorinase and haloalkane dehalogenase respectively. In this study we explored one such highly contaminated HCH dumpsite located in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. To assess the biostimulation potential of the contaminated site, microbial diversity study and real‐time PCR based quantification of lin genes was carried out. The soil samples from dumpsite and surrounding areas were found to be highly contaminated with HCH residue levels as high as 1.8 × 10⁵ mg kg⁻¹. The residues were detected in areas upto 13 km from the dumpsite. Sphingomonads, Chromohalobacter, and Marinobacter were the dominant genera present at the dump‐site. Role of Sphingomonads in HCH degradation has been well documented. The highest copy numbers of linA and linB genes as determined using real‐time PCR were 6.2 × 10⁴and 5.3 × 10⁵, respectively, were found in sample from the dump site. The presence of Sphingomonads, linA, and linB genes from HCH contaminated soil indicates the presence of indigenous bacterial communities capable of HCH degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChromohalobacter 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aMarinobacter 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3agenes 3aisomers 3apolluted soils 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asoil pollution 3aIndia1 aJindal, Swati1 aKumari, Hansi1 aJit, Simran1 aNigam, Aeshna1 aSharma, Pooja1 aKumari, Kirti1 aLal, Rup0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2015 Mar., v. 55, no. 3 p.363-373dAkademie-Verlagx0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2013002113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245015300203300001800356506007600374520159500450592002802045506003702073650000802110650003202118650001902150650002102169650002302190650002202213650001002235650001102245650001102256650001402267650001402281650001102295650001402306650000902320650001402329650001202343650001302355651001102368700002402379700002302403700002802426773011102454856008102565852000902646655001202655IND60548066220221207123105.0170721e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054806622DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-016-5149-42doi7 aPMC49804132pmcid7 a272499642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLass, Anna10aFresh fruits, vegetables and mushrooms as transmission vehicles for Echinococcus multilocularis in highly endemic areas of Poland: reply to concerns  ap. 3637-3642.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEchinococcus multilocularis is a tapeworm that may cause alveolar echinococcosis (AE), one of the most dangerous parasitic zoonoses. As in the case of other foodborne diseases, unwashed fruits and vegetables, contaminated with dispersed forms of E. multilocularis, may serve as an important transmission route for this parasite. In this article, we reply to the incorrect interpretation of results of our study concerning the detection of E. multilocularis DNA in fresh fruit, vegetable and mushroom samples collected from the highly endemic areas of the Warmia-Masuria Province, Poland, to dispel any doubts. The accusations formulated by the commentators concerning our paper are unfounded; moreover, these commentators demand information which was beyond the purview of our study. Making generalisations and drawing far-reaching conclusions from our work is also unjustified. The majority of positive samples were found in only a few hyperendemic communities; this information corresponds with the highest number of both infected foxes and AE cases in humans recorded in this area. Our findings indicate that E. multilocularis is present in the environment and may create a potential risk for the inhabitants. These people should simply be informed to wash fruits and vegetables before eating. No additional far-reaching conclusions should be drawn from our data. We believe these commentators needlessly misinterpreted our results and disseminated misleading information. Nevertheless, we would like to encourage any readers simply to contact us if any aspects of our study are unclear.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aEchinococcus multilocularis 3aechinococcosis 3aendemic diseases 3afood contamination 3afoodborne illness 3afoxes 3afruits 3ahumans 3aingestion 3amushrooms 3apeople 3araw fruit 3arisk 3atapeworms 3awashing 3azoonoses 3aPoland1 aSzostakowska, Beata1 aMyjak, Przemysław1 aKorzeniewski, Krzysztof0 tParasitology research.g2016 Sept., v. 115, no. 9 p.3637-3642dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-016-5149-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008400165300001800249520107400267592002801341650001901369650002501388650001601413650001201429650001801441650002801459650002401487650002001511650001901531650001701550650001001567650003001577650004501607650003501652650001401687700002301701700002001724700002101744773011101765856008101876852000901957655001201966IND60548066320221121175542.0170721e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054806632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-016-5155-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagy, Gábor,10aBenzimidazole resistance in Haemonchus contortus recovered from farmed red deer  ap. 3643-3647.  aThirty Haemonchus contortus male worms were collected from farmed red deer yearlings in order to determine whether routine administration of albendazole for a long-term period (17 years) could select anthelmintic resistance. PCR–RFLP method based on single-nucleotide polymorphism of codon 200 in isotype 1 ß-tubulin gene (Phe200Tyr) was applied. The results showed a significant frequency of either the resistant allele (85 %) or the homozygous resistant genotype (70 %). By chi-square test, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium of the population was accepted (p = 0.334, power of test 0.01). True prevalence of the resistant genotype (RR) was estimated to be 46.5–87.2 % (confidence interval 95 %) calculated by Sterne’s exact method. These results confirmed that long-term use of benzimidazoles could change the relative allele frequency of genes associated with drug resistance and may cause a large-scale spread of the resistant allele. To our knowledge, this study supported benzimidazole resistance in Haemonchus contortus in red deer for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus elaphus 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aalbendazole 3aalleles 3abenzimidazole 3achi-square distribution 3aconfidence interval 3adrug resistance 3agene frequency 3ahomozygosity 3amales 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3ayearlings1 aCsivincsik, Ágnes1 aZsolnai, Attila1 aSugar, László,0 tParasitology research.g2016 Sept., v. 115, no. 9 p.3643-3647dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-016-5155-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245011200154300001800266520145300284592002801737650001501765650001101780650001701791650002001808650001701828650002101845650001901866650001301885650001501898650002101913650000701934650002101941700001901962700001501981700001501996773011102011856007502122852000902197655001202206IND60529653420221123014013.0160717e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052965342DNAL7 a10.1021/ac501499y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xiang10aCarbon-Dot-Based Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for Imaging and Biosensing of Superoxide Anion in Live Cells  ap. 7071-7078.  aIn this article, a ratiometric fluorescent biosensor for O₂•– was developed, by employing carbon dots (C-Dots) as the reference fluorophore and hydroethidine (HE), a specific organic molecule toward O₂•–, playing the role as both specific recognition element and response signal. The hybrid fluorescent probe CD-HE only emitted at 525 nm is ascribed to C-Dots, while HE was almost nonfluorescent, upon excitation at 488 nm. However, after reaction with O₂•–, a new emission peak ascribed to the reaction products of HE and O₂•– was clearly observed at 610 nm. Meanwhile, this peak gradually increased with the increasing concentration of O₂•– but the emission peak at 525 nm stayed constant, leading to a ratiometric detection of O₂•–. The inorganic–organic fluorescent sensor exhibited high sensitivity, a broad dynamic linear range of ∼5 × 10–⁷–1.4 × 10–⁴ M, and low detection limit down to 100 nM. The present probe also showed high accuracy and excellent selectivity for O₂•– over other reactive oxygen species (ROS), metal ions, and so on. Moreover, the C-Dot-based inorganic–organic probe demonstrated long-term stability against pH changes and continuous light illumination, good cell-permeability, and low cytotoxicity. Accordingly, the developed fluorescent biosensor was eventually applied for intracellular bioimaging and biosensing of O₂•– changes upon oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acarbon 3acytotoxicity 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3alighting 3ametal ions 3aoxidative stress 3apH 3asuperoxide anion1 aDing, Changqin1 aZhu, Anwei1 aTian, Yang0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 July 15, v. 86, no. 14 p.7071-7078dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac501499y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245012600169300001800295520159900313592002801912650004401940650002001984650001402004650002302018650003002041650000902071650001902080650001302099650001102112650001302123650001302136650001402149650001302163650003702176650002002213700002102233700002102254700002202275700002502297700001702322700001802339773014202357856007402499852000902573655001202582IND60668851620221120181101.0190920e20130423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066885162DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta00081h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarwacki, Christopher J.10aStructure–activity relationship of Au/ZrO₂ catalyst on formation of hydroxyl groups and its influence on CO oxidation  ap. 6051-6062.  aThe effect of changes in morphology and surface hydroxyl species upon thermal treatment of zirconia on the oxidation activity of Au/ZrO₂ catalyst was studied. We observed using transmission Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy progressive changes in the presence of monodentate (type I), bidentate (type II) and hydrogen bridged species (type III) for each of the thermally treated (85 to 500 °C) supports consisting of bare zirconia and Au/ZrO₂ catalysts. Furthermore, structural changes in zirconia were accompanied by an increase in crystal size (7 to 58 nm) and contraction of the supports porosity (SSA 532 to 7 m² g⁻¹) with increasing thermal treatment. Deposition of gold nanoparticles under similar preparation conditions on different thermally treated zirconia resulted in changes in the mean gold cluster size, ranging from 3.7 to 5.6 nm. Changes in the surface hydroxyl species, support structure and size of the gold centers are important parameters responsible for the observed decrease (>90%) in CO conversion activity for the Au/ZrO₂ catalysts. Density functional theory calculations provide evidence of increased CO binding to Au nanoclusters in the presence of surface hydroxyls on zirconia, which increases charge transfer at the perimeter of the gold nanocluster on zirconia support. This further helps in reducing a model CO-oxidation reaction barrier in the presence of surface hydroxyls. This work demonstrates the need to understand the structure–activity relationship of both the support and active particles for the design of catalytic materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3agold 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3amoieties 3ananogold 3aoxidation 3aporosity 3astructure-activity relationships 3azirconium oxide1 aKaṇēṣ, Pe.,1 aKent, Paul R.

The relative novelty of the latter explains the lack of knowledge concerning certain relevant aspects related to this parasite, such as its definite geographical distribution and whether its eggs can infect humans or not. So far, only the eggs of T. solium are known to be infective for humans, producing cysticercosis. Although eggs contain the infective stage, the oncosphere, there is a lack of research on the ultrastructure of eggs of human taeniids. We show, for the first time, the ultrastructure of eggs of T. asiatica by means of SEM and TEM analyses. We detected all the envelopes, namely the egg shell, vitelline layer, outer embryophoric membrane, embryophore, granular layer, basal membrane, oncospheral membrane and oncospheral tegument. Hooks surrounded by myofibrils and glycogen-like particles, the two types of secretory granules of the penetration glands, as well as several nuclei and mitochondria were also revealed in the oncospheres. In addition to the already known structures in eggs from other Taenia species, the presence of two types of small vesicles is described herein, possibly corresponding to exosomes and ectosomes because of their shape and size, which could participate in the host/parasite intercellular communication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaenia asiatica 3aTaenia saginata 3aTaenia solium 3acell communication 3acysticercosis 3adefinitive hosts 3aegg shell 3aeggs 3aexosomes 3ageographical distribution 3ahumans 3amitochondria 3amyofibrils 3aoncospheres 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asecretory granules 3atapeworms 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure1 aYang, Yichao1 aMarcilla, Antonio1 aChoe, Seongjun1 aPark, Hansol1 aOsuna, Antonio1 aEom, Keeseon S.0 tParasitology research.g2016 Sept., v. 115, no. 9 p.3649-3655dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-016-5165-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012200169520122700291592002801518653001201546653002201558653001901580653002601599653001301625700001901638700001701657773012001674856008301794852000901877655001201886IND60741936820221118052010.0210708e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074193682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ceja.2021.1001382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorseman, Thomas10aColloidal interactions between model foulants and engineered surfaces: Interplay between roughness and surface energy  aFouling on submerged surfaces is a major limiting factor for membranes, heat exchangers, and marine vessels as it induces mass and heat transfer resistances that increase operating costs and lead to system failures. While the role of surface roughness on fouling has been extensively studied, the specific effect of surface roughness on fouling is debated in literature. In this study, we employed force spectroscopy based on atomic force microscopy with two model colloidal probes to elucidate the role of surface roughness on foulant-surface interactions. Specifically, we quantified the strength and characteristic lengths of the interactions between the colloidal probes and hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces with and without surface texture. We found that hydrophilic surfaces are generally less prone to foulant adhesion than hydrophobic surfaces and that increasing roughness of a hydrophilic surface mitigates foulant adhesion. In comparison, we found that increased roughness of a hydrophobic surface increases the attractive foulant-surface interaction, and thus, its fouling propensity. Based on the results from this study, the implications for developing surfaces with fouling resistance are also examined.  aPublisher supplied data 0aFouling 0aSurface roughness 0aSurface energy 0aColloidal interaction 0aAdhesion1 aWang, Zhangxin1 aLin, Shihong0 tChemical engineering journal advances.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 8 p.100138-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27516x2666-82117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceja.2021.1001383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01617naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245010100166300001600267520055300283592002800836650001500864650001100879650002600890650001700916650001900933700001900952700006200971700005901033773011801092856008401210852000901294655001201303IND60765562920221117005012.0220130e20220119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076556292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c042862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHikone, Yuto10aTotal Synthesis of Resiniferatoxin Enabled by Photocatalytic Decarboxylative Radical Cyclization  ap. 929-933.  aResiniferatoxin (1) is a complex daphnane diterpenoid with a highly oxygenated 5/7/6-membered ABC-ring system.

More seriously, heavy metal ions are usually present in the environment in a mixture, and the synergetic toxicity of multiple heavy metal ions is revealed (Aragay et al. Chem. Rev. 2011, 111, 3433; Chu et al. Aquat. Toxicol. 2002, 61, 53). Unfortunately, most of the existing methods based on DNA sequences are focusing on the detection of one type of metal ions. Simple and multiplexed detection of multiple metal ions has been poorly investigated and remains challenging. Here, we re-engineered the DNA sequences for Pb²⁺, Hg²⁺, and Ag⁺, through which the binding of multiple metal ions initiated the self-assembly of these DNA sequences. On the basis of our rationally designed multicolor fluorescent labeling of the DNA sequences, cascade fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) occurred. As a result, a fingerprint fluorescent spectrum was produced to indicate the presence of a single type of metal ions or multiple metal ions. The major advantages of our cascade FRET fingerprint technology include the following: (1) the “mix and read” detection mode in homogeneous solution is simple without the need of complicated instruments; (2) only single excitation is required to provide the cascade FRET fingerprint spectrum; (3) multiplexed detection capability can be realized intuitively and sensitively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA assembly 3aaquatic environment 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescent labeling 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3alead 3amercury 3ametal ions 3ananomaterials 3anucleotide sequences 3asilver 3atoxicity1 aLin, Meihua1 aZuo, Xiaolei1 aSu, Shao1 aWang, Lianhui1 aHuang, Wei1 aFan, Chunhai1 aHuang, Qing0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 July 15, v. 86, no. 14 p.7084-7087dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac50154363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010900167300001600276520114700292592002801439650001101467650001301478650001901491650002001510650001101530650003701541650001301578650000901591650001901600650001801619700002001637700001801657700001801675700001901693700002101712700002601733700002301759700002201782700001701804700002201821773012701843856008201970852000902052655001202061IND60089414020221121040810.0141102e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008941402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohda, Takashi10aIntracytoplasmic sperm injection induces transcriptome perturbation without any transgenerational effect  ap. 282-288.  aFaithful transcriptome regulation is important in development and also crucial for applications in reproductive and regenerative medicine. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), one of the human assisted reproductive technologies (ART), has long raised concerns about its influence on development. No clear consensus has been reached, however, in spite of many cohort studies carried out in the last two decades on the children conceived by ICSI and/or in vitro fertilization (IVF). In this study, the pre- and postnatal effects of ICSI were assessed using comprehensive transcriptome and phenotypic analyses in mice under strict conditions. Here we demonstrate that, in contrast to IVF, ICSI induces distinct long-lasting transcriptome change that remains at the neonatal stage. Importantly, no remarkable differences were observed in the ICSI adults in either the gene expression or phenotypic profiles, and there was no indication of transmission to the next generation via natural mating. Our results suggest there are no lifelong or transgenerational effects of ICSI, but the ICSI effects during neonatal period remain to be evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3achildren 3acohort studies 3agene expression 3ahumans 3aintracytoplasmic sperm injection 3amedicine 3amice 3anatural mating 3atranscriptome1 aOgonuki, Narumi1 aInoue, Kimiko1 aFuruse, Tamio1 aKaneda, Hideki1 aSuzuki, Tomohiro1 aKaneko-Ishino, Tomoko1 aWakayama, Teruhiko1 aWakana, Shigeharu1 aOgura, Atsuo1 aIshino, Fumitoshi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 July 1, v. 410, no. 2 p.282-288dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01666naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005500149245009200204300001600296520054800312592002800860650001300888650002200901650002300923650002800946650003100974650002001005700002101025700002301046700006001069773011801129856008401247852000901331655001201340IND60765563020221117005930.0220130e20220112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076556302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c042892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamo, Shogo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5799-493710aTotal Synthesis of (−)-Lamellodysidine A via an Intramolecular Diels–Alder Reaction  ap. 921-923.  aIn this study, we achieved an eight-step enantioselective synthesis of (−)-lamellodysidine A, a structurally intriguing sesquiterpene natural product featuring a 5/5/6/6-fused tetracyclic skeleton that was obtained from the marine sponge Lamellodysidea herbacea.

Given recent reports of corals living on or between mangrove roots under the canopy, we hypothesized that mangroves can serve as a refuge for corals from stresses such as high solar irradiance and temperatures that are associated with the adjacent shallow reef. Using field surveys and a reciprocal transplant experiment, we tested the effects of light and habitat (e.g., reef or mangrove) on coral community structure (i.e., coral species richness, abundance, and diversity) and condition (i.e., level of bleaching, tissue loss, and mortality). The surveys revealed higher coral richness in mangroves than on the adjacent reef, indicating that mangroves can serve as refugia for numerous coral species. Our experimental manipulation of light in mangrove and reef habitats indicated that light intensity is a key environmental parameter mediating coral bleaching and survival, with mangrove habitats providing a refuge from the light stress experienced on nearby shallow reefs. Moreover, our experiment revealed that reef corals bleached less than mangrove corals following transplantation, regardless of whether they were transplanted into mangrove or reef habitats. We suggest that the lower coral richness of the shallow reef is the result of the extreme environmental conditions that select for a subset of coral species able to tolerate these conditions. The facilitative interactions that allow mangroves to act as coral refugia by reducing environmental stress will likely become increasingly important with global climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) ‐ CREATE in Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services, and Sustainability (BESS)  cSteven Berkeley Marine Conservation Fellowship  cSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute  cMcGill University 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3acorals 3aenvironmental factors 3alight intensity 3amortality 3arefuge habitats 3asolar radiation 3aspecies richness 3aCaribbean1 aKline, David I.1 aChapman, Lauren J.1 aAltieri, Andrew H.0 tEcosphere.g2021 Mar., v. 12, no. 3 p.e03413-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.34133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012100165300001800286500001100304520095300315592002801268650002501296650002701321650002201348650002001370650003001390650002301420650001201443650001101455650001501466650001401481650001401495650002001509650002001529650001201549651001201561700002001573700002401593700002001617773011101637856008101748852000901829655001201838IND60548066920221121175555.0170721e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054806692DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-016-5189-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKampen, Helge14aThe Anopheles maculipennis complex (Diptera: Culicidae) in Germany: an update following recent monitoring activities  ap. 3281-3294.  aReview  aThe Anopheles maculipennis complex comprises several sibling species including major vectors of malaria parasites of historic Europe. In present-day Europe, these species are probably more relevant with regard to transmission of pathogens other than plasmodia, such as viruses and dirofilariae. Distribution data facilitating risk assessments and modelling of An. maculipennis complex-borne diseases, however, are generally outdated. In Germany, the occurrence and geographic distribution of the complex species have recently been updated within the framework of a national monitoring programme. In addition to the known indigenous species An. maculipennis, Anopheles messeae and Anopheles atroparvus, the newly described sibling species Anopheles daciae was demonstrated. Distribution maps of these species based on the data collected from 2011 to 2014 are presented, whilst ecological characteristics and vector roles are presented and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnopheles atroparvus 3aAnopheles maculipennis 3aAnopheles messeae 3adata collection 3ageographical distribution 3aindigenous species 3amalaria 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aparasites 3apathogens 3arisk assessment 3asibling species 3aviruses 3aGermany1 aSchäfer, Mandy1 aZielke, Dorothee E.1 aWalther, Doreen0 tParasitology research.g2016 Sept., v. 115, no. 9 p.3281-3294dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-016-5189-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01807naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245011000178300001600288520052500304592002800829650001200857650001400869650001500883650004400898650002500942650002600967650003600993650002401029650002301053700001501076700001401091700001201105700001601117700001701133700001901150700001401169773011101183856008201294852000901376655001201385IND4487187620221120094537.0200528e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448718762DNAL7 a223278012pmid7 a10.1007/s11418-012-0634-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yi10aFlavonol glycosides, nigelflavonosides A–F from the whole plant of Nigella glandulifera (Ranunculaceae)  ap. 645-652.  aSix new flavonol glycosides, nigelflavonosides A–F (1–6), together with a known compound (7) were isolated from the whole plant of Nigella glandulifera Freyn et Sint (Ranunculaceae).

We analysed the spatio-temporal configuration of 7790 anthropogenic wildfires (2007–2013) in nine study areas distributed throughout Peninsular Spain by using the Ripley’s K-function. We also related these aggregation patterns to weather, population density, and landscape structure descriptors of each study area. Our results provide statistical evidence for spatio-temporal structures around a maximum of 4 km and six months. These aggregations lose strength when the spatial and temporal distances increase. At short time lags after a wildfire (<1 month), the probability of another fire occurrence is high at any distance in the range of 0–16 km. When considering larger time lags (up to two years), the probability of fire occurrence is high only at short distances (>3 km). These aggregated patterns vary depending on location in Spain. Wildfires seem to aggregate within fewer days (heat waves) in warm and dry Mediterranean regions than in milder Atlantic areas (bimodal fire season). Wildfires aggregate spatially over shorter distances in diverse, fragmented landscapes with many small and complex patches. Urban interfaces seem to spatially concentrate fire occurrence, while wildland-agriculture interfaces correlate with larger aggregates.  aPublisher supplied data 3afire season 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aheat 3alandscapes 3apopulation density 3aprobability 3aspace and time 3aweather 3awildfires 3aSpain1 aComas, Carles1 aVega-Garcia, Cristina0 tForests.g2016 Aug. 26, v. 7, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f70901853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03870naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245018900204300001600393506007600409520215300485592002802638506003702666650001202703650001302715650001402728650003102742650002002773650001302793650001202806650001902818650001602837650001002853650002702863650001102890650001902901650000902920650001402929700002702943700002302970700001702993700003403010700001303044700001803057700002403075700002303099773011603122856008103238852000903319655001203328IND60585187720221207084930.0171105e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058518772DNAL7 a10.1007/s12298-017-0464-52doi7 aPMC56714462pmcid7 a291586372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Amit10aMarker-assisted identification of restorer gene(s) in iso-cytoplasmic restorer lines of WA cytoplasm in rice and assessment of their fertility restoration potential across environments  ap. 891-909.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIso-cytoplasmic restorers possess the same male sterile cytoplasm as the cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) lines, thereby minimizing the potential cyto-nuclear conflict in the hybrids. Restoration of fertility of the wild abortive CMS is governed by two major genes namely, Rf3 and Rf4. Therefore, assessing the allelic status of these restorer genes in the iso-cytoplasmic restorers using molecular markers will not only help in estimating the efficiency of these genes either alone or in combination, in fertility restoration in the hybrids in different environments, but will also be useful in determining the efficacy of these markers. In the present study, the efficiency of molecular markers in identifying genotypes carrying restorer allele of the gene(s) Rf3 and Rf4, restoring male fertility of WA cytoplasm in rice was assessed in a set of 100 iso-cytoplasmic rice restorers using gene linked as well as candidate gene based markers. In order to validate the efficacy of markers in identifying the restorers, a sub-set of selected 25 iso-cytoplasmic rice restorers were crossed with four different cytoplasmic male sterile lines namely, IR 79156A, IR 58025A, Pusa 6A and RTN 12A, and the pollen and spikelet fertility of the F₁s were evaluated at three different locations. Marker analysis showed that Rf4 was the predominant fertility restorer gene in the iso-cytoplasmic restorers and Rf3 had a synergistic effect on fertility restoration. The efficiency of gene based markers, DRCG-RF4-14 and DRRM-RF3-10 for Rf4 (87%) and Rf3 (84%) genes was higher than respective gene-linked SSR markers RM6100 (80%) and RM3873 (82%). It is concluded that the gene based markers can be effectively used in identifying fertility restorer lines obviating the need for making crosses and evaluating the F₁s. Though gene based markers are more efficient, there is a need to identify functional polymorphisms which can provide 100% efficiency.

The analysis serves as a basis for interpreting two suites of fossil woods closely similar to the wood of Robinia. One assemblage had its provenance in western Nevada and the other in southern California. Results of the survey show considerable overlap in ranges of variation in the fossils and extant woods. These findings parallel results of a similar investigation by Matten et al. (1977). Woods from both fossil localities fall within the specifications of the organ species Robinia zirkellii (Platen) Matten, Gastaldo ' Lee. The survey also revealed the kinds of differences that may be found in species of Robinia growing in dissimilar habitats. Differences noted among trunk, branch and root wood of extant Robinia make it possible to distinguish these organs among the fossils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiocene epoch 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3afossils 3ahabitats 3aprovenance 3asecondary xylem 3asurveys 3awood 3aCalifornia 3aNevada 0aRobinia 0afossil wood 0aMiocene 0aCalifomia0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 14, no. 3 p.299-314dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900013333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01541naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245013400153300001800287520037200305592002800677650002400705650002300729650002000752650001400772650002200786650002100808700001700829700001600846700001400862700001500876700001600891700001300907700003000920773013400950856007401084852000901158655001201167IND60639039920221118073909.0190501e20170131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063903992DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc08892a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Juan10aAccelerated room-temperature crystallization of ultrahigh-surface-area porous anatase titania by storing photogenerated electrons  ap. 1619-1621.  aRoom-temperature crystallization, a mild and energy-efficient process, shows important application potentials for developing functional materials.

Deb, a small, perennial, monopodial, terrestrial orchid, is endemic to tropical Himalayas at an altitude of 1200–2000 m asl. The pseudobulbs are important ingredients of century old drug ‘Ashtavarga’ and a polyherbal energetic tonic ‘Chyavanprash’. An efficient genetically stable in vitro propagation protocol using transverse thin cell layer culture system was established for M. wallichii. In the present report, meta-topolin alone proved to be three times more beneficial compared to other routinely used cytokinins in inducing highest number of shoot buds, plant height and growth of regenerated shoots. The highest regeneration frequency (89%) along with maximum number of adventitious shoots per explant (22.5 ± 0.6) was observed in MS medium supplemented with 1.0 mg/l meta-topolin and 0.5 mg/l α-naphthalene acetic acid. Highest rooting frequency with highest number of roots (8.66 ± 0.3) was achieved in half-strength MS medium fortified with 1.0 mg/l indole acetic acid. Clonal stability of in vitro-derived plantlets was evaluated and compared to donor plant using intron splice junction (ISJ) markers and flow cytometry. ISJ markers revealed 4.76% clonal variability indicating high degree of genetic stability amongst the in vitro-derived regenerants. The nuclear DNA content of M. wallichii (2n) was found to be 2C = 2.760 ± 0.02 pg and therefore, 1349.64 Mbp (1C). Flow cytometry analysis of actively growing young and mature leaves from donor as well as in vitro-derived plantlets revealed presence of three peaks corresponding to 2C, 4C and 8C, while 2C was the most abundant. In the present investigation, there was no significant difference in the 2C DNA content between the mother and in vitro-derived plants; however, the frequency of endopolyploid cells varied in young and adult plants. An increased H₂O₂ content as well as lipid peroxidation activities were observed during early stages of acclimatization which declined afterwards. The enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase in acclimatized plantlets as compared to in vitro-grown ones revealed their active involvement in growth and development against oxidative stress under external adverse environment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aMalaxis 3aacclimation 3aadventitious shoots 3aaltitude 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abuds 3acatalase 3aclonal variation 3acytokinins 3adrugs 3aendopolyploidy 3aenzyme activity 3aflow cytometry 3agenetic stability 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aindole acetic acid 3aingredients 3aintrons 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amature plants 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3anuclear genome 3aorganogenesis 3aoxidative stress 3aplant height 3aplantlets 3aroots 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aKumaria, Suman1 aChoudhury, Hiranjit1 aTandon, Pramod0 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2017 Oct., v. 23, no. 4 p.955-968dSpringer Indiax0971-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-017-0474-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03325naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245011100185300001600296520173200312592002802044650001602072650001402088650001602102650002402118650002202142650001602164650001902180650001702199650001602216650002202232650001402254650001202268650002402280650002102304650000902325650002102334650001602355650002102371650001202392650001302404650001202417651001502429653001802444653002302462653002102485700001802506700001502524700001802539773011202557856008102669852000902750655001202759IND60652420820221120182533.0190712e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065242082DNAL7 a273784162pmid7 a10.1017/S175173111600135X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGourdine, J-L.10aGenetic parameters for thermoregulation and production traits in lactating sows reared in tropical climate  ap. 365-374.  aThe objective of this study was to estimate the genetic parameters for thermoregulation traits and the relationships with performance of Large White lactating sows reared in a tropical humid climate. The thermoregulation traits were rectal temperature (RT), cutaneous temperature (CT) and respiratory rate (RR) during lactation measured in the afternoon (1200 h) and in the morning (0700 h). The production traits were sow’s average daily feed intake (ADFI), litter BW gain (LBWg) and sow’s proportion of BW change between farrowing and weaning (BWc). Complete data included 931 lactating performance on 329 Large White sows from the INRA experimental unit in Guadeloupe (French West Indies). Random regression models using linear spline functions were used for longitudinal data (RT, CT, RR and daily feed intake). Results showed that when ignoring values at the beginning and the end of lactation, the traits studied can be treated as the same trait throughout days of lactation, with fairly constant heritability and variance. However, largest heritabilities and genetic variances were estimated in mid-lactation. Heritability estimates on average performance during lactation were low to moderate for thermoregulation traits (0.35±0.09 for RT, 0.34±0.12 for CT and 0.39±0.13 for RR). Heritability estimates for production traits were 0.26±0.08 for ADFI, 0.20±0.07 for BWc and 0.31±0.09 for LBWg. Significant genetic correlations between thermoregulation traits and production traits were only obtained for ADFI and RR (0.35±0.12). From this study it can be concluded that thermoregulation traits are heritable, indicating that there are genetic differences in heat stress tolerance in lactating Large White sows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarge White 3afarrowing 3afeed intake 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic variation 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3aheritability 3ahumid zones 3alactating females 3alactation 3arearing 3aregression analysis 3arespiratory rate 3asows 3astress tolerance 3atemperature 3athermoregulation 3atropics 3avariance 3aweaning 3aGuadeloupe 0alactating sow 0agenetic parameters 0atropical climate1 aMandonnet, N.1 aGiorgi, M.1 aRenaudeau, D.0 tAnimal.g2017 Mar., v. 11, no. 3 p.365-374dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S175173111600135X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03774naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245011000168300001600278520253000294592002802824650001802852650002002870650002202890650002402912650002102936650001302957650001502970650001502985650001603000650001803016650001603034650001603050650001203066650002003078700002203098700001903120700002103139773009803160856008503258852000903343655001203352IND4457659320221121043408.0141110e20110525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445765932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeimer, Sophia10aTowards a new generation of high-resolution meteorological input data for small-scale hydrologic modeling  ap. 317-332.  aCurrent and future challenges of hydrologic sciences are to accurately predict and assess climate-driven impacts on water resources for the relevant scales of planning. However, process-based small-scale hydrologic modeling is data demanding and large uncertainties exist in data-sparse areas. The aim of our study was to test the applicability of the COSMO-DE analysis data (COSMO-DE-A) for hydrologic modeling. COSMO-DE-A data are a new meteorological data set with high temporal and spatial resolution that originates from the German Weather Service data assimilation system using the COSMO-DE weather prediction model. We collected field parameters in a small (10km²) mountainous catchment in the Upper Middle Rhine Valley (west Germany) to parameterize the static boundary conditions of the hydrologic model CATFLOW. We evaluated error components of hourly COSMO-DE-A fields in comparison to interpolated hourly meteorological station data (i.e. reference data), applied two bias-correction methods for precipitation (i.e. linear correction method and quantile–quantile mapping technique), calibrated (in a 36ha large subcatchment) and tested (in another 48ha large subcatchment) the CATFLOW model using the reference data for input, and compared stream flow predictions using uncorrected and bias-corrected COSMO-DE-A data for input. Moreover, we compared soil moisture and latent heat flux from COSMO-DE-A with values simulated by CATFLOW. Relative error between COSMO-DE-A precipitation and interpolated precipitation is ca. 50%. Other climatic variables from COSMO-DE-A are almost unbiased, though errors for global radiation and temperature are autocorrelated. Nash and Sutcliffe efficiencies accounted for 0.83 and 0.33 for the simulated vs. observed stream flow of the calibration and test catchment, respectively. The use of uncorrected COSMO-DE-A precipitation leads to poor performances of the hydrologic model. In contrast, if either of both bias-correction methods is applied to COSMO-DE-A precipitation, predicted hydrographs and soil moisture are almost the same as if interpolated reference data is used. Soil moisture and latent heat flux are simulated consistently by the independent models COSMO-DE-A and CATFLOW. We conclude that COSMO-DE-A data are suitable for hydrologic modeling of longer periods (e.g. seasons), provided that bias correction of precipitation is done prior to model application. Further research is required to test the regional and temporal stability of bias-correction terms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat transfer 3ahydrologic data 3ahydrologic models 3ameteorological data 3amodel validation 3aplanning 3aprediction 3asoil water 3astream flow 3asubwatersheds 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3avalleys 3awater resources1 aPohlert, Thorsten1 aPfahl, Stephan1 aWilcke, Wolfgang0 tJournal of hydrology.g2011 May 25, v. 402, no. 3-4 p.317-332dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.03.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245015800174300001600332520177300348592002802121650002002149650002202169650001802191650001302209650001202222650001802234650000902252650001402261773009802275856004802373852000902421655001202430IND50074139720221120161652.0140321e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007413972DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-013-0680-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeophytou, Charalambos10aBayesian clustering analyses for genetic assignment and study of hybridization in oaks: effects of asymmetric phylogenies and asymmetric sampling schemes  ap. 273-285.  aBayesian clustering methods have been widely used for studying species delimitation and genetic introgression. In order to test the effect of phylogenetic relationships and sampling scheme on the inferred clustering solution and on the performance of Bayesian clustering analysis, I simulated genotypes of the interfertile oak species Quercus robur, Quercus petraea, and Quercus pubescens and I run analyses using two popular software programs, STRUCTURE and BAPS. First, based on purebred simulations, I compared clustering solutions resulting from different sample size configurations. While clustering solution generally reflected the taxonomic relationships when equal samples of each species were included, spurious partition was inferred by STRUCTURE when some species were represented by larger and others by smaller samples. In very unbalanced configurations, STRUCTURE failed to identify the three species, even if three subpopulations were assumed. By contrast, BAPS could properly identify the three species under any sampling scheme. Second, based on simulations of purebreds and hybrids, I tested the performance of individual assignments with variable number of loci. This analysis showed that STRUCTURE can detect introgressed individuals more efficiently than BAPS. However, BAPS could assign purebreds more efficiently with a lower number of loci. Method performance also depended on phylogenetic relationships. In the case of Q. petraea, Q. pubescens, and their hybrids, method performance was lower due to their phylogenetic affinity. Inclusion of three instead of two species into the analysis led to reduction of performance, and to misclassification of hybrids, which often reflected the phylogenetic affinity between Q. petraea and Q. pubescens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus petraea 3aQuercus pubescens 3aQuercus robur 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3aloci 3aphylogeny0 tTree genetics & genomes.g2014 Apr., v. 10, no. 2 p.273-285dSpringer-Verlagx1614-29427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-013-0680-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009700167520099200264592002801256650002301284650002101307650002501328650002101353650001301374650003101387650003001418650001501448650001201463650001501475650001701490650001301507653002001520653003101540653002101571653003601592700001501628700001201643700001701655700001701672773010801689856008601797852000901883655001201892IND60755081520221122174755.0220531e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075508152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1188212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wenna14aThe potential roles of natural plant polysaccharides in inflammatory bowel disease: A review  aInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a long-term chronic disease, about 20% of IBD patients deteriorate to colorectal cancer. Currently, there is no radical cure for IBD. Natural plant polysaccharides (NPP) have low toxic and side effects, which have immune and prebiotic activities and possesses positive effect on alleviating IBD. In this review, we will focus on the alleviating effect of NPP on IBD in vitro and in vivo from three aspects: regulating intestinal flora imbalance, repairing intestinal barrier injury and improving immunity. The relationship between the chemical structure of natural plant polysaccharides and the therapeutic effect of IBD are highlighted. Finally, the synergistic role of NPP as a carrier of drugs or active molecules to reduce side effects and enhance targeting function are discussed, especially pectic polysaccharides. Broadly, this review provides a valuable reference for NPP to be developed as functional food or health products to alleviate IBD.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3achronic diseases 3acolorectal neoplasms 3afunctional foods 3aimmunity 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3apectins 3aprebiotics 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 0aPolysaccharides 0aInflammatory bowel disease 0aIntestinal flora 0aStructure-activity relationship1 aZhao, Ping1 aLi, Xia1 aGuo, Lanping1 aGao, Wenyuan0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 277 p.118821-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1188213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013300168300001400301520136400315592002801679650002501707650002001732650001301752650001701765650001701782650002301799650001201822650001001834650002001844650001601864650001901880650001201899650001701911650001101928650001001939650001201949650002201961650001301983650001001996650002602006650001602032650001902048700002302067700005802090773013402148856008202282852000902364655001202373IND60590948420221123045415.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059094842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-017-1362-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumari, Preetesh10aStable, fertile somatic hybrids between Sinapis alba and Brassica juncea show resistance to Alternaria brassicae and heat stress  ap. 77-86.  aWild relatives of Brassica are a rich reservoir of genes that are invaluable for the improvement of cultivated species. Sinapis alba is a close relative of crop Brassicas that possesses several desirable traits such as tolerance to Alternaria black spot disease, heat stress, insect pests and nematodes. This study is aimed at developing and characterizing hybrids between Brassica juncea and S. alba with the ultimate goal of transferring genes for tolerance to Alternaria brassicae and heat stress, the traits that are lacking in cultivated Brassica. We generated three hybrids between B. juncea and S. alba through protoplast fusion. The hybridity was confirmed through cytology and molecular markers. While two of the hybrids were symmetric, the third one was asymmetric and had greater resemblance to B. juncea. Hybrids showed some characteristic features of the parents and were fully male and female fertile and also set seeds upon back crossing with the parent species. In vitro leaf assay and field inoculation studies revealed that the hybrids are highly resistant to A. brassicae. Besides, hybrids set seeds at temperature of > 38 °C when parents failed to produce seeds indicating that hybrids possess heat tolerance. These stable hybrids provide a reliable genetic resource for transfer of genes from S. alba into cultivated Brassica species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria brassicae 3aBrassica juncea 3aNematoda 3aSinapis alba 3acell biology 3adisease resistance 3afemales 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ahybrids 3ainsect pests 3aleaves 3amales 3aparents 3aprotoplast fusion 3aseed set 3aseeds 3asomatic hybridization 3atemperature 3awild relatives1 aBisht, DeepakSingh1 aBhat, ShripadR.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8349-66910 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2018 Apr., v. 133, no. 1 p.77-86dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33513x0167-68577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-017-1362-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04086naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100006000188245012300248300001100371506007600382520245000458592002802908506003702936650001702973650001402990650001903004650001903023650001003042650001903052650002403071650000903095650001303104650001203117650001503129650002603144650001503170650001403185650001303199650001203212650001903224650001103243650001403254650002103268650001303289650001203302700002303314773011603337856008203453852000903535655001203544IND60626197020221207133018.0181230e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062619702DNAL7 a10.1186/s13620-018-0136-y2doi7 aPMC62979972pmcid7 a305687892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKropf, Josephine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1436-923110aEffects of midazolam on cardiovascular responses and isoflurane requirement during elective ovariohysterectomy in dogs  ap. 26.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded clinical study was conducted to determine whether a single dose of midazolam affects the cardiovascular response to surgical manipulation of the ovaries during elective ovariohysterectomy. Thirty-nine client-owned dogs undergoing elective ovariohysterectomy were recruited. After scoring cage demeanour, dogs were premedicated with acepromazine (0.03 mg kg⁻¹) and pethidine (3 mg kg⁻¹) intramuscularly into the quadriceps muscle and 20 min later sedation was scored. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol intravenously (IV) to effect. The study treatment (group M: midazolam (0.25 mg kg⁻¹); or group P: placebo (Hartmann’s solution) (0.125 ml kg⁻¹)) was administered IV before the intra-operative manipulation of the first ovary. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Morphine (0.3 mg kg⁻¹ IV) was administered prior to the start of surgery. The vaporizer setting was adjusted according to the depth of anaesthesia. If an end-tidal isoflurane concentration (FE’Iso) above 1.6% was required additional analgesia was provided with fentanyl (2 μg kg⁻¹). Dogs received meloxicam (0.2 mg kg⁻¹ IV) at the end of procedure. Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, respiratory rate and end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide as well as FE’Iso were recorded and analysed. RESULTS: A statistical significant difference between groups was detected in FE’Iso, with group M requiring a significantly lower FE’Iso than group P (14.3%) after administration of midazolam. No differences between groups was shown for percentage change in heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure, or end-tidal carbon dioxide and requirement for mechanical ventilation, or rescue analgesia. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of complications in group M and P. Group M received significantly more succinylated gelatin solution pre-administration of midazolam than group P, but no differences in fluid administration post-administration of the study treatment (midazolam/placebo) were detected. No statistical significant difference was demonstrated for the use of anticholinergic agents, dobutamine or noradrenaline. CONCLUSION: No significant effect on cardiovascular parameters could be observed with administration of midazolam, but a modest (14.3%) isoflurane-sparing effect was detected.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacepromazine 3aanalgesia 3aanimal ovaries 3ablood pressure 3acages 3acarbon dioxide 3adepth of anesthesia 3adogs 3afentanyl 3agelatin 3aheart rate 3aintravenous injection 3aisoflurane 3ameloxicam 3amorphine 3amuscles 3anorepinephrine 3aoxygen 3apethidine 3arespiratory rate 3asedation 3aspaying1 aHughes, J.M.

Hence, the study was aimed to investigate the factors that influence market channel choices among wheat producers in Northwestern Ethiopia. METHODS: Using multistage sampling technique, 163 smallholder wheat producers were selected to collect primary data through semi-structures questionnaires. Combinations of data analysis methods such as descriptive statistics and econometrics model (multivariate probit model) were used. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The study identified four major wheat market channel choices such as retailers, assemblers, consumers and wholesalers as alternatives to wheat producers to sell majority of their products. Thus, retailers who accounted for 40.49% of total sold, assemblers (39.2%), consumers (37.5%) and wholesalers (23.93%). The results of a multivariate probit model indicated that age of household, education status, credit access; livestock number, off-farm income and total land-holding size of farmers significantly affected the market channel choice decisions in one or another way. Therefore, strengthening institutions to deliver timely and appropriate credit service and training to a farmer is among the major recommendations from this study.  aPublisher supplied data  a$500cUniversty of Gondar 3acredit 3adescriptive statistics 3aeconometrics 3aeducational status 3afarm income 3afarmers 3afood security 3aherd size 3aland ownership 3amarketing channels 3amarkets 3amodels 3aquestionnaires 3asampling 3awheat 3aEthiopia1 aAbate, Tadie Mirie1 aMekie, Taye Melese0 tAgriculture & food security.g2018 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.91-91dBioMed CentralwJournal:2267x2048-70107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40066-018-0241-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003300113040001800146100002400164245016900188300001800357520146700375592002801842650001301870650001401883650002001897650002301917650002201940650002001962650001301982650002401995650003602019650003302055650002302088650001602111650003202127650004102159650002302200650002902223650004202252650004102294650002302335650002302358650001702381650003202398650002902430650001902459651001202478700002002490700001902510700001902529773009802548856004602646852000902692655001202701IND50073191620221122234029.0140219e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007319162DNAL7 a244469162pmid7 a10.1111/1750-3841.123392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Christoph,10aDetermination of Caffeine, Myosmine, and Nicotine in Chocolate by Headspace Solid‑Phase Microextraction Coupled with Gas Chromatography‑Tandem Mass Spectrometry  ap. T251-T255.  aThe occurrence of the bioactive components caffeine (xanthine alkaloid), myosmine and nicotine (pyridine alkaloids) in different edibles and plants is well known, but the content of myosmine and nicotine is still ambiguous in milk/dark chocolate. Therefore, a sensitive method for determination of these components was established, a simple separation of the dissolved analytes from the matrix, followed by headspace solid‑phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry (HS‑SPME‑GC‑MS/MS). This is the first approach for simultaneous determination of caffeine, myosmine, and nicotine with a convenient SPME technique. Calibration curves were linear for the xanthine alkaloid (250 to 3000 mg/kg) and the pyridine alkaloids (0.000125 to 0.003000 mg/kg). Residuals of the calibration curves were lower than 15%, hence the limits of detection were set as the lowest points of the calibration curves. The limits of detection calculated from linearity data were for caffeine 216 mg/kg, for myosmine 0.000110 mg/kg, and for nicotine 0.000120 mg/kg. Thirty samples of 5 chocolate brands with varying cocoa contents (30% to 99%) were analyzed in triplicate. Caffeine and nicotine were detected in all samples of chocolate, whereas myosmine was not present in any sample. The caffeine content ranged from 420 to 2780 mg/kg (relative standard deviation 0.1 to 11.5%) and nicotine from 0.000230 to 0.001590 mg/kg (RSD 2.0 to 22.1%).  aPublisher supplied data 3acaffeine 3achocolate 3adetection limit 3aheadspace analysis 3amass spectrometry 3amicroextraction 3anicotine 2aAlkaloidsxanalysis 2aBeveragesxanalysisxeconomics. 2aCacaoxchemistryxeconomics. 2aCaffeinexanalysis 2aCalibration 2aCandyxanalysisxeconomics. 2aDairy Productsxanalysisxeconomics. 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Inspectionxmethods 2aFood, Preservedxanalysisxeconomics. 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aLimit of Detection 2aNicotinexanalysis 2aPigmentation 2aSolid Phase Microextraction 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aVolatilization 0aGermany1 aVetter, Florian1 aRichter, Elmar1 aBracher, Franz0 tJournal of food science.g2014 Feb., v. 79, no. 2 p.T251-T255dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.12339  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014600168300001600314520112200330592002801452650002401480650002801504650001001532650003101542650001701573650002001590650001301610650001601623700002201639700001901661700002301680700002101703700002101724773009001745856008101835852000901916655001201925IND60574675120221123042543.0170728e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057467512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-017-9800-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimoda, Takeshi12aA novel method for protecting slow-release sachets of predatory mites against environmental stresses and increasing predator release to crops  ap. 495-503.  aSlow-release sachets of predatory mites are widely employed for controlling small pest arthropods in protected crops. However, environmental stresses can adversely affect the performance of such sachets. To solve this problem, we developed plant-attached shelters that hold sachets of Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) or Amblyseius swirskii (Athias-Henriot). We conducted laboratory experiments to reveal whether sheltered sachets can protect predators against pesticides and drenching. The numbers of each predator in unsheltered sachets were drastically decreased after spraying with a non-selective pesticide (methidathion), and after continuous spraying (four days) with water, whereas the numbers in the sheltered sachets were not seriously affected by these factors. We also found that more predators (at least for N. californicus) were released from sheltered sachets at different temperatures (25 and 17 °C) than from unsheltered sachets. These results indicate sheltered sachets to be potentially useful for protecting predatory mites against environmental stresses and enhancing their release to crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyseius swirskii 3aNeoseiulus californicus 3acrops 3alaboratory experimentation 3amethidathion 3apredatory mites 3aspraying 3atemperature1 aKagawa, Yoshitake1 aMori, Kotarō,1 aHinomoto, Norihide1 aHiraoka, Tadashi1 aNakajima, Tetsuo0 tBioControl.g2017 Aug., v. 62, no. 4 p.495-503dSpringer Netherlandsx1386-61417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-017-9800-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01087naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245010900130300001400239520028900253592002800542650002800570650001500598650002100613650002000634650001100654650001000665653002200675773010300697852000900800655001200809IND60706101320221120121656.0200807e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070610132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJadhav, P.

Exhumation of animals is not a routine practice in forensic pathology. In this study, 30 male 70-day-old Wistar rats were experimentally exposed to the carbamate pesticides aldicarb and carbofuran. Toxicological, macroscopic and microscopic examinations were performed. Groups of 3 animals (2 exposed and 1 control) were evaluated at 24h, 3days, 5days, 7days and 10days post-mortem. In histopathological examination, the brain, liver, lungs and kidneys were assessed, and for toxicological analysis, the gastric contents, liver, vitreous humor, skeletal muscle and larvae (when available) were collected. The pesticides were detected by HPLC and quantified in the analyzed matrices, and a possible delay in tissue putrefaction due to the pesticides was observed. This study has revealed that it is possible to exhume animals for investigations of possible poisoning by carbamates and has demonstrated that the exhumation of an animal in a suspected case of poisoning should not be ruled out. The increasing demand for investigations of suspicious animal deaths, e.g., in cases of poisoning, will likely lead to an increase in the use of this type of procedure in veterinary pathology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldicarb 3aanimal pathology 3abrain 3acarbofuran 3aforensic sciences 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahistopathology 3akidneys 3aliver 3alungs 3amales 3amicroscopy 3amuscle larvae 3apoisoning 3arats 3askeletal muscle 0aExhumation 0aWistar rats 0aPost-mortem toxicology 0aCarbamate pesticides 0aNecropsy 0aHistothanatology1 aRodrigues, Karina Borges Almeida1 aGonçalves-Júnior, Vagner1 aCalefi, Atilio Sersun1 aFukushima, André Rinaldi1 aCuevas, Silvia Elena Campusano1 aSpinosa, Helenice de Souza1 aMaiorka, Paulo César0 tExperimental and toxicologic pathology.g2016 June, v. 68, no. 6 p.307-314dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11954x0940-29937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etp.2016.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04330naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009400163300001800257500002000275500000900295520190100304592002802205596006802233596005902301596005902360596005902419596009002478596004202568596004702610596003002657650002002687650001902707650002002726650002202746650002302768650001702791650001502808650002302823650001002846650003002856650004202886650003302928650001402961650001402975650000702989650001402996650001703010650001303027650001603040650001903056650001803075650001803093650001503111650002203126651001003148700001903158700002203177700002003199700001303219700002203232700001403254700002003268700002203288700002203310773016103332856008203493852000903575655001203584IND60677260520221116170206.0220813e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067726052DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2019.03.00822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Shuai10aNot by Salinity Alone: How Environmental Factors Shape Fungal Communities in Saline Soils  ap. 1387-1398.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCore Ideas Fungal diversity exhibits a longitudinal gradient in saline soils. Soil moisture, then salinity and total potassium, were the main environmental drivers of fungal communities. Environmental variables were more important than geographical distance to variation in trophic guilds. The fungal community assembly was mainly stochastic. Soil salinity is prominent in arid and semiarid regions, especially in local agricultural systems. Fungi play major roles in ecosystem processes, but the determinants of fungal diversity and biogeographical patterns in saline agricultural systems remain poorly understood. Here we performed Illumina MiSeq high throughput sequencing of the fungal ITS1 region from 31 soils covering representative saline agricultural lands in northwest China. The results showed that Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes were the dominant taxonomic groups across all soil samples (>5% of all sequences), while saprotroph, pathotroph‐saprotroph‐symbiotroph and pathotroph were the main functional guilds across all soil samples. Interestingly, the fungal abundance and α diversity increased with increasing longitudinal gradient from 84°13′ E to 89°11′ E. Soil moisture, followed by salinity and total potassium, were the primary environmental drivers of the fungal community; these soil parameters were significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with longitude, and therefore potentially result in longitudinal fungal gradients. Furthermore, the fungal community assembly was mainly stochastic; fungal community exhibited distance‐decay distribution patterns, which were mainly influenced by geographical distance. By contrast, environmental factors (such as salinity pH, soil moisture, or nutrients) mainly contributed to the variation in trophic guilds. These findings enhance our understanding of fungal biogeography in saline agricultural soils.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015‐XBQN‐B‐16cFoundation of Chinese Academy of Sciences  a41671251cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31971448cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aU1803233cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aXDA2003010302cStrategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  a2016YFC0501400cNational Key R&D Plan  cYouth Innovation Promotion Association CAS  cChina Scholarship Council 3aDothideomycetes 3aEurotiomycetes 3aSordariomycetes 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural soils 3abiogeography 3aecosystems 3afungal communities 3afungi 3ageographical distribution 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alongitude 3anutrients 3apH 3apotassium 3asaline soils 3asalinity 3asaprotrophs 3asemiarid zones 3asoil salinity 3asoil sampling 3asoil water 3aspecies diversity 3aChina1 aLiu, Jun‐Jie1 aBanerjee, Samiran1 aWhite, James F.1 aZhou, Na1 aZhao, Zhen‐Yong1 aZhang, Ke1 aHu, Ming‐Fang1 aKingsley, Kathryn1 aTian, Chang‐Yan0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2019 Sept., v. 83, no. 5 p.1387-1398dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2019.03.00823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245008600168300001600254520160300270592002801873650001601901650002301917650001601940650001201956650001101968650001401979650001501993650003402008650002502042650001402067650000902081650001002090650000902100651001702109700001802126700001402144700002002158700002502178700001802203700001702221700001902238773011102257856004802368852000902416655001202425IND4485327120221120051755.0130322e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448532712DNAL7 a10.1007/s12603-012-0030-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitchell, Diane C.10aRelative validity of the geisinger rural aging study food frequency questionnaire  ap. 667-672.  aOBJECTIVE: To determine the relative validity of a population specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and evaluate the effectiveness of the instrument for assessing nutritional risk in older adults. DESIGN: A cross-over design with participants completing two different dietary assessment instruments in random order. SETTING: The Geisinger Rural Aging Study (GRAS), a longitudinal study of over 20,000 adults living in the central, northern and eastern counties of Pennsylvania. PARTICIPANTS: A subset of GRAS consisting of 245 older adults (60% women) ranging in age from 70 to 95 years. MEASUREMENTS: Energy and nutrient intakes were assessed from two instruments: a population specific food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and four 24-hour dietary recalls conducted over a two week period. RESULTS: Pearson correlation coefficients between the FFQ and dietary recalls for most nutrients were 0.5 or higher which suggests that the FFQ provided relatively valid estimates of macro and micronutrient intakes examined. Bland-Altman plots were generated to examine the agreement between instruments. Data are shown for energy, folate and zinc with close agreement at lower intakes indicative of risk for folate and zinc. Sensitivity results also showed that the FFQ was able to correctly classify individuals adequately at risk for most nutrients examined. CONCLUSION: This population specific FFQ appears to be a valid instrument for use in in evaluating risk for many nutrients that are of particular concern in older adults residing throughout many predominately rural counties in Pennsylvania.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3across-over studies 3adiet recall 3aelderly 3aenergy 3aequipment 3afolic acid 3afood frequency questionnaires 3alongitudinal studies 3anutrients 3arisk 3awomen 3azinc 3aPennsylvania1 aTucker, K.

Older people living in Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) have a significantly higher risk of infection and complications from influenza. Influenza vaccine is considered the best strategy to prevent infection in high-risk populations. In Australia, the Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CNDA) suggests a vaccination coverage rate of 95% in both staff and residents1. This study aims to measure the vaccination coverage rates for residents in LTCFs and identify predictors of vaccination uptake for these individuals.This study was conducted in nine LTCFs in four sites from March to September 2018. This was done via medical record reviews for residents over 65 years old in these LTCFs, collecting information such as vaccination status, age, gender, ethnicity and occupation. Simple and multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate the Odds Ratio (OR) to determine significant predictors of influenza vaccination uptake.The overall vaccination rate among LTCF residents was 83.6%. Significant predictors of vaccination were LTCF location, ethnicity and previous year vaccination status. Residents in LTCF Site D were less likely to be vaccinated compared to Site A (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02–0.61), non-Caucasians were less likely to get vaccinated (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01–0.67), and residents who refused the 2017 vaccine were less likely to be vaccinated (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01–0.15).Compared with previous Australian studies on LTCF vaccination rates, the overall vaccination rate was high in these LTCFs (83.6% versus 66–84%), but it varied across different sites. Reasons for varying vaccination rates should be explored further – for example, lower rates in non-Caucasians with diverse cultural backgrounds. Better understanding the causes of under-vaccination can help improve vaccination programs in LTCFs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3aelderly 3agender 3ainfluenza 3ainfluenza vaccination 3ainfluenza vaccines 3along term care 3amedical records 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aAustralia 0aAged care 0aLong term care facilities 0aOutbreaks 0aAgeing1 aLai, Elisa1 aKunasekaran, Mohana1 aChughtai, Abrar A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4203-78911 aTrent, Mallory1 aPoulos, Christopher J.1 aMacIntyre, Chandini R.0 tVaccine.g2019 Oct. 08, v. 37, no. 43 p.6329-6335dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245007700161300001400238520125500252592002801507650004301535650002501578650001301603650001901616650001201635650002201647650002601669650002401695650001001719650002201729650003701751650001501788650001701803650002401820650001801844650002501862650001301887650002901900650002201929650001701951650001201968700001701980700001201997700001602009700001802025700001802043700005202061773013402113856008202247852000902329655001202338IND60590948820221123045456.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059094882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-017-1358-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Liu10aEnhanced drought tolerance in tomato plants by overexpression of SlMAPK1  ap. 27-38.  aDrought stress is one of the most destructive environmental factors that affect plant growth and agricultural production. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are important signaling pathways that participate in both biotic and abiotic stresses, which include drought. In this study, SlMAPK1 was induced by various abiotic stresses and hormone treatments. Transgenic tomato plants overexpressing SlMAPK1 were generated to further investigate the role that SlMAPK1 plays in drought tolerance. Three independent T2 transgenic lines and wild-type (WT) tomato plants were used for analysis of drought tolerance. Compared with WT plants, SlMAPK1-overexpressing lines exhibited less severe wilting, less severe cell membrane damage, and higher soluble protein and soluble sugar content, accumulated less hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), showed higher activities in the antioxidant enzymes including ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase, and had an elevated transcript level of stress-related genes. Taken together, the results suggest that SlMAPK1 plays a positive role in response to drought stress by activating antioxidant enzymes, reducing oxidative damage, and modulating transcription of stress-related genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3acell membranes 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aenvironmental factors 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aperoxidase 3aplant growth 3asignal transduction 3asugar content 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atomatoes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenic plants 3awater stress 3awilting1 aZhao, Ruirui1 aLi, Rui1 aYu, Wenqing1 aYang, Meijing1 aSheng, Jiping1 aShen, Lin1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7458-21330 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2018 Apr., v. 133, no. 1 p.27-38dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33513x0167-68577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-017-1358-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245018200161300001800343520119000361592002801551650002301579650001201602650002301614650001401637650002501651650002401676700002301700700001701723773013401740856007901874852000901953655001201962IND60515781020221121174535.0160320e20130830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051578102DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2013-00462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOno, Kotaro10aHow does species association affect mixed stock fisheries management? A comparative analysis of the effect of marine protected areas, discard bans, and individual fishing quotas  ap. 1792-1804.  aWe developed a spatially explicit bioeconomic model of a mixed-stock fishery with an unproductive and a productive stock to examine how the spatial overlap between species affects the outcome of a fishery under alternative management methods. We considered a competitive total allowable catch (TAC) system, with and without a ban on discards, and an individual vessel quota (IVQ) fishery managed either to maximum sustainable yield (MSY) or maximum economic yield (MEY). We also evaluated the utility of marine protected areas (MPAs) designed to protect the unproductive species for each management scenario. Banning discarding (whether under a TAC or IVQ) created the biggest increase in profit regardless of species overlap as it moves the target species biomass toward Bmey. MPAs reduced the profit in most cases and were not always successful at conserving the unproductive stock above a target size. The IVQ system managed to MEY produced the most profit among all scenarios while preserving the populations above some target values in most cases, but an IVQ system managed to MSY produced lower profits than a competitive TAC with a discard ban at some levels of species overlap.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioeconomic models 3abiomass 3aconservation areas 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3aprofits and margins1 aHolland, Daniel S.1 aHilborn, Ray0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2013 Aug. 30, v. 70, no. 12 p.1792-1804dNRC Research Pressx1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2013-00463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245018600180300001600366520155800382592002801940650002201968650002001990650001602010650001502026650001702041650001702058650001702075650001202092650002402104650001702128650001402145650001502159651001002174651001202184653002702196653001402223653002202237653001702259700006502276700002902341700002902370700006302399700006402462773007902526856008902605852000902694655001202703IND60556312420221121005225.0170710e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055631242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2016.08.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFasanmi, Olubunmi G.13aAn evaluation of biosecurity compliance levels and assessment of associated risk factors for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 infection of live-bird-markets, Nigeria and Egypt  ap. 321-328.  aLive bird market (LBM) is integral component in the perpetuation of HPAI H5N1, while biosecurity is crucial and key to the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Biosecurity compliance level and risk factor assessments in 155LBMs was evaluated in Nigeria and Egypt through the administration of a 68-item biosecurity checklist, scored based on the modifications of previous qualitative data, and analysed for degree of compliance. LBMs were scored as “complied with a biosecurity item” if they had good-very good scores (4). All scores were coded and analysed using descriptive statistics and risk or protective factors were determined using univariable and multivariable logistic regression at p≤0.05. Trading of wild birds and other animal in the LBMs (Odd Ratio (OR)=34.90; p=0.01) and claims of hand disinfection after slaughter (OR=31.16; p=0.03) were significant risk factors while mandatory routine disinfection of markets (OR=0.13; p≤0.00), fencing and gates for live bird market (OR=0.02; p≤0.01) and hand washing after slaughter (OR=0.41; p≤0.05) were protective factors for and against the infection of Nigerian and Egyptian LBMs with the HPAI H5N1 virus. Almost all the LBMs complied poorly with most of the variables in the checklist (p≤0.05), but pathways to improved biosecurity in the LBMs existed. We concluded that the LBM operators play a critical role in the disruption of transmission of H5N1 virus infection through improved biosecurity and participatory epidemiology and multidisciplinary approach is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aavian influenza 3abiosecurity 3acompliance 3adisinfection 3aepidemiology 3ahand washing 3amarkets 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3aslaughter 3awild birds 3aEgypt 3aNigeria 0aBiosecurity compliance 0aHPAI H5N1 0aLive-bird-markets 0aRisk factors1 aAhmed, Syed Sayeem U.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5394-32271 aOladele-Bukola, Mutiu O.1 aEl-Tahawy, Abdelgawad S.1 aElbestawy, Ahmed R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1272-153X1 aFasina, Folorunso O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9759-56420 tActa tropica.g2016 Dec., v. 164 p.321-328dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2016.08.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012300157300001600280520116300296592002801459650001001487650002501497650001301522650001201535650000801547650001201555650001101567650001001578700001701588700001701605700002001622700002201642700002101664700002201685773014701707856007301854852000901927655001201936IND60480460720221119134142.0160127e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048046072DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.124082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaga, Satoshi10aSeasonal foraging patterns of forest‐grazing Japanese Black heifers with increased plasma total antioxidant capacity  ap. 209-216.  aForest‐grazing enables the intake of high total antioxidant capacity (TAC) plants that might be beneficial for the TAC status of cattle. This study evaluated the relation between the seasonal foraging patterns of forest‐grazing Japanese Black (JB) heifers or the TAC levels in shrubs and trees and the changes of plasma TAC. We examined 12 JB heifers, four each of which were allocated to forest‐grazing (F), pasture‐grazing, and pen‐housed groups. The plasma TAC level in F heifers on July 26, August 13, 30 and September 17 were significantly higher than those on April 27 and June 4 (P < 0.05). In F group, the mean rates of foraging frequency (FF) of shrubs and trees during July 5–8 and September 13–16 were much higher than that during May 31–June 3 (P < 0.05). The rate of FF of grass significantly decreased later in the season (P < 0.05). The mean TAC levels in these shrubs and trees were higher than those in grasses, concentrates, and timothy hay. Results suggest that an important factor in the increase of plasma TAC in forest‐grazing cattle might be the increased foraging of TAC‐rich shrubs and trees during summer–fall.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWagyu 3aantioxidant activity 3aforaging 3agrasses 3ahay 3aheifers 3ashrubs 3atrees1 aNakano, Miwa1 aNakao, Seiji1 aHirano, Kiyoshi1 aYamamoto, Yoshito1 aSasaki, Hiroyuki1 aIshizaki, Hiroshi0 tAnimal science journal =.g2016 Feb., v. 87, no. 2 p.209-216dJapanese Society of Zootechnical Science, Jan. 1999-<Apr. 2003>x1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.124083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013300157300001600290520128600306592002801592650001801620650001601638650002101654650002001675650001401695650002201709650001301731650002601744650001701770650001601787650001701803650001101820650001601831650001901847700001501866700001701881773014701898856007302045852000902118655001202127IND60480460820221119134145.0160127e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048046082DNAL7 a10.1111/asj.124192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Nannan10aEffects of pre‐slaughter showering and ventilation on stress, meat quality and metabolite concentrations of broilers in summer  ap. 293-298.  aEffects of pre‐slaughter showering and ventilation on stress, meat quality and energy metabolism of broilers in summer were investigated. After transport, 84 Arbor Acres broilers were randomly divided into four treatment groups: (i) control group without ventilation and showering (C); (ii) 10 min ventilation without showering (VWS); (iii) 10 min showering without ventilation (SWV); (iv) 5 min showering and then 5 min ventilation (SV). Compared with the control group, plasma lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities in the other three treatment groups were (P < 0.05) lower; however, the plasma glucose level did not show any significant changes among all the groups. The breast meat in the SV group had significantly (P < 0.05) higher pHᵤ, glycogen content, lower L*, ΔpH, drip loss, cook loss, R‐value and lactate content than the control group; however, there was no significant difference in shear force values among all the groups. In conclusion, this study indicated broilers in the SV group showed a lower stress level and greater meat quality, which suggest that showering and ventilation after transportation may be a good measure to relieve stress caused by transport under high temperature and improve the meat quality of broilers.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3abreast meat 3abroiler chickens 3acreatine kinase 3adrip loss 3aenergy metabolism 3aglycogen 3alactate dehydrogenase 3ameat quality 3ametabolites 3ashear stress 3asummer 3atemperature 3atransportation1 aXing, Tong1 aXu, Xinglian0 tAnimal science journal =.g2016 Feb., v. 87, no. 2 p.293-298dJapanese Society of Zootechnical Science, Jan. 1999-<Apr. 2003>x1344-39417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.124193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245012500213300001800338520177100356592002802127650002802155650001402183650002402197650001302221650001902234650001302253650001602266650001302282650001702295651001202312653003802324653001102362653003302373653002602406653003702432653002102469653001302490700002502503700002102528700002402549700002802573700005502601700005702656773009902713856008602812852000902898655001202907IND60666108520221118050614.0191004e20191016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066610852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.09.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRieckmann, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8695-237610aSmallpox and BCG vaccination in childhood and cutaneous malignant melanoma in Danish adults followed from 18 to 49 years  ap. 6730-6736.  aEarly smallpox and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccinations have been associated with reduced risk of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). We assessed the association between pre-school smallpox vaccination and early-school BCG vaccination and CMM in a young Danish population.We conducted a register-based case-cohort study of individuals growing up during the phase-out period of smallpox and BCG vaccination in Denmark (born 1965–1976) utilising the decrease in vaccination during this period. Information on childhood vaccinations and potential confounders from Copenhagen school health records were linked with nationwide registers on cancer (CMM diagnoses), migrations and deaths by personal identification numbers.The individuals were followed from age 18 until 31/12/2014 (maximum age at end of follow-up, 49 years). 188 cases of CMM occurred in the background population of 46,239 individuals; 172 CMM cases (91%) had full information and were analysed. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for CMM by BCG and/or smallpox vaccination compared with neither vaccine was 1.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72–2.31). For smallpox vaccination only, HR = 1.23 (95% CI 0.53–2.86) for BCG vaccination only, HR = 1.13 (95% CI 0.61–2.09) and for both smallpox and BCG vaccination, HR = 1.75 (95% CI 0.87–3.48) compared with none of these. Vaccination below the age of one year gave similar results.We found no strong beneficial effect of smallpox and BCG vaccination against CMM among young adult Danes and with broad confidence intervals our data alone could be compatible with both modest preventive effects, no effects, and modest harmful effects. Our estimates do not contradict a potential modest beneficial effect of neonatal vaccination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium bovis BCG 3achildhood 3aconfidence interval 3amelanoma 3arisk reduction 3asmallpox 3avaccination 3avaccines 3ayoung adults 3aDenmark 0aBacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine 0aCancer 0aCutaneous malignant melanoma 0aHeterologous immunity 0aNon-specific effects of vaccines 0aSmallpox vaccine 0aVaccinia1 aMeyle, Kathrine Damm1 aRod, Naja Hulvej1 aBaker, Jennifer Lyn1 aBenn, Christine Stabell1 aAaby, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8331-13891 aSørup, Signe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1942-683X0 tVaccine.g2019 Oct. 16, v. 37, no. 44 p.6730-6736dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03797naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016200167300001800329500002000347500000900367520211100376592002802487596001602515596005602531650001802587650002002605650001402625650001202639650001302651650001202664650001102676650001802687650001502705650001402720650001802734650002202752650001602774650001502790650001002805650001802815651001202833700002102845700002002866700002302886700002102909700002102930700002002951700001902971773016202990856008203152852000903234655001203243IND60677260920221116170159.0220813e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067726092DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2018.08.03062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, Dave M.10aEffects of Biomass Removal Levels on Soil Carbon and Nutrient Reserves in Conifer‐Dominated, Coarse‐Textured Sites in Northern Ontario: 20‐Year Results  ap. S116-S132.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: Biomass removal trials targeted soils sensitive to nutrient removal (shallow to bedrock and infertile sands). 14 long‐term sites (42 plots per treatment) were used to evaluate C and nutrient reserves 20 years post‐harvest. After 20 years, soil C, N, and K reserves did not differ between pre‐harvest levels and SO and FT. Soil reserves of FTB treatments remained significantly lower than the pre‐harvest levels. Jack pine and black spruce declined in height on FTB on sandy sites; there were no differences between SO and FT. Here we report on 20‐yr soil (forest floor plus the upper 20 cm of mineral soil) carbon and nutrient reserves from 14 biomass removal trials established on coarse‐textured, nutrient poor sites. Harvest treatments included stem only (SO, delimbed at the stump), full‐tree (FT, entire trees with boles and branches removed), and full‐tree plus forest floor blading (FTB, full‐tree harvest followed by removal of the forest floor and approximately the upper 5 cm of mineral soil). After 20 yr, there were no significant differences in soil C, N, and K reserves between pre‐harvest levels and the SO and FT treatments. Only the soil reserves of the FTB treatment remained significantly lower than the pre‐harvest levels. Extractable soil Ca and Mg reserves increased in Year 5 in all treatments, followed by slow declines, but all treatments remained comparable to or exceeded pre‐harvest levels at Year 20. For P, harvesting (SO and FT) resulted in significant declines that remain after 20 yr. Both jack pine and black spruce showed reduced top height growth on FTB, but only on some of the sandy sites. There were no differences in top height for either species between SO and FT across all 14 study sites. Current results suggest there is no need for restrictions on full‐tree harvesting for traditional wood products on these nutrient poor sites. However, from a cautionary perspective, it seems prudent at this time to restrict more intensive bioenergy harvests to deep, finer‐textured sites that have larger soil C and nutrient reserves.  aPublisher supplied data  cNRCan‐CFS  cOMNRF Centre for Northern Forest Ecosystem Research 3aPicea mariana 3aPinus banksiana 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3abranches 3acalcium 3acarbon 3aforest litter 3aharvesting 3amagnesium 3amineral soils 3anutrient reserves 3asoil carbon 3atree trunk 3atrees 3awood products 3aOntario1 aHazlett, Paul W.1 aFleming, Rob L.1 aKwiaton, Martin M.1 aHawdon, Laura A.1 aLeblanc, J.‐D.1 aPrimavera, M.J.1 aWeldon, Tom P.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2019 Aug., v. 83 Suppl S1 p.S116-S132dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2018.08.03063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245015400167300001800321520127800339592002801617650002601645650001201671650001801683650002001701650001101721650001401732650002101746650001201767650001301779700002301792700002001815700002001835773013401855856007901989852000902068655001202077IND60515781320221121194946.0160320e20130904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051578132DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2013-00892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunroe, Daphne M.10aHow do shellfisheries influence genetic connectivity in metapopulations? A modeling study examining the role of lower size limits in oyster fisheries  ap. 1813-1828.  aFisheries can potentially alter evolutionary processes such as genetic connectivity and lead to genotypic changes in stocks. Using an individual-based metapopulation genetics model, we examined the possible influence of oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fisheries on genetic connectivity. We simulated a range of realistic fishing pressures, with and without a minimum size limit (limit = 63.5 mm), over a range of fishing scenarios including single-area and stock-wide fisheries. Movement of a neutral marker gene provided an indicator of gene transfer between populations. Simulations showed that fishing may alter genetic connectivity. Increasing fishing pressure tended to decrease potential for fished populations to export genes in fisheries with and without size limits. On average, when instantaneous fishing mortality, location, and time period are held constant, fishing unrestricted by size results in a 3.5% lower allele export. Depression of the spawning potential ratio by unrestricted fishing relative to size-limited fishing argues for more conservative fishing mortality targets for unrestricted fisheries. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the influence of fisheries on source–sink dynamics in future management of marine populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea virginica 3aalleles 3agene transfer 3agenetic markers 3amodels 3amortality 3aoyster fisheries 3aoysters 3aspawning1 aHofmann, Eileen E.1 aPowell, Eric N.1 aKlinck, John M.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2013 Sept. 4, v. 70, no. 12 p.1813-1828dNRC Research Pressx1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2013-00893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03727naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012700167300001600294520183200310592002802142650002302170650001402193650001802207650001902225650002502244650000902269650001502278650002402293650001602317650001402333650001302347650001402360650001902374650001102393650002402404650001002428650001602438650001602454650001402470650001302484650002702497650001902524653002002543653001502563653001502578653002502593653001402618653003102632700002202663700002402685700001902709700001802728700002002746700001702766700001802783700002202801700002502823773012602848856008202974852000903056655001203065IND60526563620221120074735.0190408e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052656362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.etp.2016.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBleyer, Martina10aMorphology and staining behavior of neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)  ap. 335-343.  aCommon marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are frequently used as translational animal models for human diseases. However, a comparative study of cytological and histochemical detection methods as well as morphometric and ultrastructural characterization of neutrophils and eosinophils in this species is lacking. Blood samples of house dust mite sensitized and allergen challenged as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenged marmosets were analyzed with different cytological and histological staining methods. Furthermore, cell size and number of nuclear segments were compared between neutrophils and eosinophils. Electron microscopy was performed to characterize the ultrastructure of granulocytes. Of all applied cytological stains, three allowed differentiation of eosinophils and neutrophils and, thus, reliable quantification in blood smears: May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain, Congo Red and Naphthol AS-D Chloroacetate-Esterase. For histology, Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) could not demonstrate clear differences, whereas Sirius Red, Congo Red, and Naphthol AS-D Chloroacetate Esterase showed capable results for identification of eosinophils or neutrophils in lung tissue. Morphometry revealed that marmoset neutrophils have more nuclear segments and are slightly larger than eosinophils. Ultrastructurally, eosinophils presented with large homogeneous electron-dense granules without crystalloid cores, while neutrophils were characterized by heterogeneous granules of different size and density. Additionally, sombrero-like vesicles were detected in tissue eosinophils of atopic marmosets, indicative for hypersensitivity-related piecemeal degranulation. In conclusion, we provide a detailed overview of marmoset eosinophils and neutrophils, important for phenotypic characterization of marmoset models for human airway diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallithrix jacchus 3aallergens 3aanimal models 3ablood sampling 3acytoplasmic granules 3adust 3adust mites 3aelectron microscopy 3aeosinophils 3aesterases 3agranules 3ahistology 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3alipopolysaccharides 3alungs 3amorphometry 3aneutrophils 3aphenotype 3astaining 3atranslation (genetics) 3aultrastructure 0aCommon marmoset 0aEosinophil 0aNeutrophil 0aCytological staining 0aHistology 0aUltrastructural morphology1 aCurths, Christoph1 aDahlmann, Franziska1 aWichmann, Judy1 aBauer, Natali1 aMoritz, Andreas1 aBraun, Armin1 aKnauf, Sascha1 aKaup, Franz-Josef1 aGruber-Dujardin, Eva0 tExperimental and toxicologic pathology.g2016 June, v. 68, no. 6 p.335-343dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11954x0940-29937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etp.2016.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245007200202300001600274520119800290592002801488596005701516596005701573596005801630650001901688650001501707650002401722650001201746650002201758650001301780650001001793650001201803650001301815650001101828650001301839651002001852651001101872700001801883700001901901700002001920773012501940856008102065852000902146655001202155IND60631366620221120170009.0190221e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063136662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-018-3768-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatoh, Shun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1284-524910aDynamics of sibling aggression of a cichlid fish in Lake Tanganyika  ap. 201-213.  aSiblings often compete for limited resources, particularly food provided by their parents. Such competition is usually nonviolent, but direct aggression has evolved in some species. However, there is little knowledge about sibling aggression in species without parental provisioning. Here, we investigated sibling aggression in the cichlid Neolamprologus furcifer in Lake Tanganyika, Zambia. In this species, females guard their broods in the nest but do not provide any food. Early-stage fry did not show any sibling aggression while foraging on plankton, but began to show nonlethal aggression once they started to forage on small benthic shrimp at 2 weeks of age. The frequency of sibling aggression decreased at week 7, when the density of fry decreased remarkably. Sibling aggression also decreased following a short-term increase in food through supplemental feeding. The aggression was higher in the morning than in the afternoon despite higher abundance of shrimp at that time, and decreased when the number of shrimp in the nest was experimentally reduced. These results indicate that food availability affects sibling aggression of animals that do not exhibit parental provisioning.  aPublisher supplied data  a26540070cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a26118511cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aH17J11490cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aNeolamprologus 3aaggression 3adietary supplements 3afemales 3afood availability 3aforaging 3anests 3aparents 3aplankton 3ashrimp 3asiblings 3aLake Tanganyika 3aZambia1 aOta, Kazutaka1 aAwata, Satoshi1 aKohda, Masanori0 tHydrobiologia.g2019 Apr., v. 832, no. 1 p.201-213dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3768-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245010700178506002800285520132900313592002801642506003701670650002101707650001701728650001801745650001801763650002401781650001901805650001101824650001801835650002601853650001101879650002301890650001701913700002001930700002101950773009601971856008302067852000902150655001202159IND60739599920221207102928.0200302s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073959992DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202017000672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZakirzhan, Bikmukhametov10aAdaptive technologies for intensification of winter wheat grain production in biologized crop rotation  aResource is Open Access  aThe studies were conducted at the experimental base of the Tatar Scientific Research Institute of Agriculture in 1996–2014 to adapt fertilizer systems and basic tillage to achieve yields of 3–5 t/ha. The article cited data on winter wheat – the second crop of the third rotation of the eight-field grain-grass-crop rotation for 2013–2014. We studied the effect of organomineral, organic, mineral fertilizer systems on the winter wheat yield using a differentiated approach to their use in combination with different primary tillage systems (dump plowing to the depth of the arable layer, multi-depth loosening and loosening to a depth of 15–16). The organomineral fertilizer system differed with the saturation with organic fertilizers of 7 t/ha of arable land per year + N36P32K60 according to the balance sheet for receiving 4 t/ha of grain with spring fertilizing using ammonium nitrate, where the yield was 4. 03 t/ha, and the saving on mineral fertilizers, depending on crop rotation and soil saturation with organic matter, was 25–35 %. The yield of winter wheat by the water-saving technology amounted to 4.03 t/ha with a planned level of 4.0 t/ha. At the same time, at the purchase price of 7 rubles/kg, the level of profitability rose to 195.85 %, the cost of 1 center of grain amounted to 236.6 rubles.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aammonium nitrate 3aarable soils 3abalance sheet 3acrop rotation 3amineral fertilizers 3aorganic matter 3aprices 3aprofitability 3aresearch institutions 3aspring 3awater conservation 3awinter wheat1 aRafil, Shakirov1 aRazina, Sabirova0 tBIO web of conferences.g2020, v. 17 p.00067-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202017000673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245016400154300002000318520155000338592002801888650002101916650001401937650001501951650001501966650001801981650001901999700001402018700001702032700001402049700001802063700001902081700001402100773014402114856007402258852000902332655001202341IND60670754620221121231049.0191002e20140610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067075462DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta01073f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Hua10aTowards tunable resistivity–strain behavior through construction of oriented and selectively distributed conductive networks in conductive polymer composites  ap. 10048-10058.  aThe resistivity–strain behavior of conductive polymer composites (CPCs) has gained intense interest due to its importance for various applications. The resistivity of CPCs often increases substantially and linearly under strain. To achieve constant resistivity under strain, a large filler content and special network configuration are often required. And a tunable step-wise resistivity–strain behavior has yet to be reported. Herein, a new method combining polymer blends and pre-stretching is introduced to modify the resistivity–strain behavior of CPCs based on thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)/polyolefin elastomer (POE) with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) selectively incorporated in the TPU phase. Depending on the compositions of blends and the intensity of pre-stretching, various interesting resistivity–strain behaviors have been achieved. The resistivity can be either linearly increasing or constant. Interestingly, two-stepwise resistivity–strain behavior has been achieved, with first an increase then a constant value. To understand this unique phenomenon, the phase morphology and conductive network structure are systematically characterized. It is observed that the orientation of MWCNTs is strongly correlated with overall resistivity. Finally, a mechanism involving fibrillization and “slippage” between conductive phases is proposed to explain the resistivity–strain dependency. This study provides guidelines for the preparation of high performance strain sensors as well as stretchable conductors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemistry 3aguidelines 3apolyolefin 3apolyurethanes 3athermoplastics1 aJi, Mizhi1 aYan, Dongxue1 aFu, Sirui1 aDuan, Lingyan1 aZhang, Mengwei1 aFu, Qiang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 June 10, v. 2, no. 26 p.10048-10058dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta01073f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184242012800201245014300329300001600472506007600488520159500564592002802159506003702187650001302224650002102237650002602258650002002284650001002304650002102314650001102335650001602346650001602362650002602378650001602404650004302420650000902463650001702472650001002489651001002499700002002509700001802529700001802547700001602565700002202581700002402603700001602627773011502643856007702758852000902835655001202844IND60440846620221207065936.0160106e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044084662DNAL7 a10.1631/jzus.B14001682doi7 aPMC43224222pmcid7 a256444662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Hai-ping10a细胞色素P450 CYP81A6基因在水稻中的表达: 组织特异性、 蛋白质亚细胞定位以及对除草剂的响应10aExpression of cytochrome P450 CYP81A6 in rice: tissue specificity, protein subcellular localization, and response to herbicide application  ap. 113-122.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe cytochrome P450 gene CYP81A6 confers tolerance to bentazon and metsulfuron-methyl, two selective herbicides widely used for weed control in rice and wheat fields. Knockout mutants of CYP81A6 are highly susceptible to both herbicides. The present study aimed to characterize the CYP81A6 expression in rice. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses demonstrated that foliar treatment of bentazon (500 mg/L) greatly induced expression of CYP81A6 in both wild-type (Jiazhe B) and its knockout mutant (Jiazhe mB): a 10-fold increase at 9 h before returning to basal levels at 24 h in Jiazhe B, while in the mutant the expression level rose to >20-fold at 12 h and maintained at such high level up to 24 h post exposure. In contrast, metsulfuron-methyl (500 mg/L) treatment did not affect the expression of CYP81A6 in Jiazhe B within 80 h; thereafter the expression peaked at 120 h and returned gradually to basal levels by Day 6. We suggest that a metabolite of metsulfuron-methyl, 1H-2,3-benzothiazin-4-(3H)-one-2,2-dioxide, is likely to be responsible for inducing CYP81A6 expression, rather than the metsulfuron-methyl itself. Use of a promoter-GUS reporter construct (CYP81A6Pro::GUS) demonstrated that CYP81A6 was constitutively expressed throughout the plant, with the highest expression in the upper surfaces of leaves. Subcellular localization studies in rice protoplasts showed that CYP81A6 was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. These observations advance our understanding of CYP81A6 expression in rice, particularly its response to the two herbicides.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abentazon 3acytochrome P-450 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agene expression 3agenes 3aknockout mutants 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3ametsulfuron 3apesticide application 3aprotoplasts 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arice 3aweed control 3awheat 3aChina1 aEdwards, Martin1 aWang, Qi-zhao1 aZhao, Hai-jun1 aFu, Hao-wei1 aHuang, Jian-zhong1 aGatehouse, Angharad1 aShu, Q.

We define JITAIs as having three features: behavioural support that directly corresponds to a need in real-time; content or timing of support is adapted or tailored according to input collected by the system since support was initiated; support is system-triggered. We conducted a systematic review of JITAIs for physical activity to identify their features, feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness. METHODS: We searched Scopus, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, DBLP, ACM Digital Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov and the ISRCTN register using terms related to physical activity, mHealth interventions and JITAIs. We included primary studies of any design reporting data about JITAIs, irrespective of population, age and setting. Outcomes included physical activity, engagement, uptake, feasibility and acceptability. Paper screening and data extraction were independently validated. Synthesis was narrative. We used the mHealth Evidence Reporting and Assessment checklist to assess quality of intervention descriptions. RESULTS: We screened 2200 titles, 840 abstracts, 169 full-text papers, and included 19 papers reporting 14 unique JITAIs, including six randomised studies. Five JITAIs targeted both physical activity and sedentary behaviour, five sedentary behaviour only, and four physical activity only. JITAIs prompted breaks following sedentary periods and/or suggested physical activities during opportunistic moments, typically over three to four weeks. Feasibility challenges related to the technology, sensor reliability and timeliness of just-in-time messages. Overall, participants found JITAIs acceptable. We found mixed evidence for intervention effects on behaviour, but no study was sufficiently powered to detect any effects. Common behaviour change techniques were goal setting (behaviour), prompts/cues, feedback on behaviour and action planning. Five studies reported a theory-base. We found lack of evidence about cost-effectiveness, uptake, reach, impact on health inequalities, and sustained engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Research into JITAIs to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour is in its early stages. Consistent use and a shared definition of the term ‘JITAI’ will aid evidence synthesis. We recommend robust evaluation of theory and evidence-based JITAIs in representative populations. Decision makers and health professionals need to be cautious in signposting patients to JITAIs until such evidence is available, although they are unlikely to cause health-related harm.

However, EGCG3″Me occurs naturally in tea leaves in extremely limited quantities. Finding an enzyme from C. sinensis to catalyze the synthesis of EGCG3″Me is an alternative method to make up for the scarcity of EGCG3″Me in natural situations. In the present study, a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding region and genomic DNA of the caffeoyl-coenzyme A O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) gene were isolated from C. sinensis (designated CsCCoAOMT). Nucleotide sequence analysis of CsCCoAOMT revealed an open reading frame of 738 bp that encodes a polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 28 kDa, which correlated well with the results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The full-length DNA sequence (2678 bp) contained five exons and four introns. The deduced amino acid sequence of CsCCoAOMT shared 92% identity with CCoAOMTs from Codonopsis lanceolata and Betula luminifera. The catalytic activity of CsCCoAOMT was analyzed. Three monomethylated epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) compounds (EGCG4″Me, EGCG3″Me, and EGCG3′Me) were produced by CsCCoAOMT with K ₘ in the micromolar range. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments indicated that the CsCCoAOMT transcript was present at low levels during the early stages of leaf maturity (the first leaf and bud on a shoot) but the relative expression was augmented at advanced stages of leaf maturity (the third or fourth leaf on a shoot), which accorded well with changes in EGCG3″Me content in fresh leaves. Hence, we concluded that CsCCoAOMT catalyzes the syntheses of methylated EGCGs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCamellia sinensis 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aCodonopsis lanceolata 3acatalytic activity 3apolypeptides 3aopen reading frames 3ahuman health 3aBetula 3amolecular weight 3aintrons 3aleaves 3asequence analysis 3atea 3abuds 3acomplementary DNA 3aamino acid sequences 3aexons 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3abioactive properties 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aChina 0agenes1 aLv, Hai-peng1 aMa, Cheng-ying1 aGuo, Li1 aTan, Jun-feng1 aPeng, Qun-hua1 aLin, Zhi0 tJournal of Zhejiang University.g2015 Feb., v. 16, no. 2 p.103-112dZhejiang University Pressx1673-15817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1631/jzus.B14001933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245018400164300001300348520159800361592002801959650001601987650002002003650001202023650000802035650001202043650001302055650001802068650001302086650001202099650002002111650002002131650002102151650002302172650000902195650001802204650001402222650001502236650001202251650001102263650001502274650002102289650001802310650001202328650001402340650001102354650003002365650001402395650001302409650001102422650003102433653002602464653002402490653001302514773014902527856007802676852000902754655001202763IND60522570020221121024545.0160603e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052257002DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1977-1-2082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRöper, Harald,10aAnalytische Untersuchungen des Wehrsekretes von Peripatopsis moseleyi (Onychophora) / Analytical Investigations of the Defensive Secretion from Peripatopsis moseleyi (Onychophora)  ap. 57-b.  aThe defensive secretion of Peripatopsis moseleyi (Onychophora) consists of 84% water and 16% protein and free amino acids. The secretion’s defensive effectiveness is an anti-predator “sticking” action. The secretion is flung out of the oral papillae in liquid state. It is then denaturized by the air and develops increasingly sticky white threads, probably through the devel­opment of disulfide bridges from the protein content. The elastic properties of the secretion threads indicate a micellar structure. The defensive secretion contains no volatile organic components or carbohydrates. This was confirmed by gas- liquid chromatography and thin-layer chromatography. After acidic hydrolysis of the secretion the following amino acids were determined quantita­tively: aspartic acid, threonine, serine, proline, glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, valine, cysteine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, lysine, histidine and arginine. A “rare” amino acid was not identified. Tryptophane was not present (basic secretion hydrolysis). The quantita­tive determination of free amino acids, based on the total content, showed the following results: glycine (40.9%), glutamic acid (10.8%), aspartic acid (2.65%), lysine (1.3%). This result shows, that the secretion is stored in a watery glycine/glutaminic acid buffer in the oral papillae of Peripatopsis moseleyi. High voltage paper electrophoreses and gel filtration experiments with dextran and agarose gels showed, that the secretion protein consists of, at least, two fractions with different molecular weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOnychophora 3aacid hydrolysis 3aagarose 3aair 3aalanine 3aarginine 3aaspartic acid 3acysteine 3adextran 3adisulfide bonds 3aelectrophoresis 3afree amino acids 3agel chromatography 3agels 3aglutamic acid 3ahistidine 3aisoleucine 3aleucine 3alysine 3amethionine 3amolecular weight 3aphenylalanine 3aproline 3asecretion 3aserine 3athin layer chromatography 3athreonine 3atyrosine 3avaline 3avolatile organic compounds 0aPeripatopsis moseleyi 0aDefensive Secretion 0aAnalysis0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 32, no. 1-2 p.57-bdVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1977-1-2083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245013300153300001800286520140800304592002801712650001501740650001501755650002401770650001301794650003101807650001901838650001901857650001601876650001901892650001901911650001501930650001401945650002601959650001501985700001902000700001502019700001502034773014102049856007402190852000902264655001202273IND60670754820221121225727.0191002e20140527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067075482DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta01077a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeng, Bo10aToward the enhanced photoactivity and photostability of ZnO nanospheres via intimate surface coating with reduced graphene oxide  ap. 9380-9389.  aA series of uniform ZnO nanospheres–reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites (ZnO–RGO NCs) with different weight addition ratios of RGO are successfully synthesized via a facile yet efficient method by intimately coating ZnO nanospheres (NSs) with RGO, which is afforded by electrostatic attraction between positively charged ZnO NSs and negatively charged graphene oxide (GO) in an aqueous medium at room temperature. The photocatalytic test of degradation of Rhodamine B shows that the optimal ZnO–10% RGO NCs exhibit a 5-fold enhancement of photoactivity than bare ZnO NSs, which is ascribed to the integrative synergetic effect of enhanced adsorption capacity, the decreased recombination of the electron–hole pairs and the enhanced ultraviolet light absorption intensity. Significantly, the recycled photoactivity tests show that, for ZnO–RGO NCs, the anti-photocorrosion of ZnO NSs is improved remarkably which is attributed to the effective hybridization of ZnO NSs with the RGO sheet via intimate surface coating. Such a significant photoactivity enhancement and anti-photocorrosion phenomenon can not be obtained by simply integrating RGO with ZnO NSs that are not subject to surface charge modification, which thus indicates the importance of intimate surface coating of ZnO with RGO toward the efficiency of enhancement of photoactivity and particularly the anti-photocorrosion of ZnO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3acoatings 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agraphene oxide 3ananocomposites 3ananospheres 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotostability 3arhodamines 3asynergism 3aultraviolet radiation 3azinc oxide1 aYang, Min-Quan1 aZhang, Nan1 aXu, Yi-Jun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 May 27, v. 2, no. 24 p.9380-9389dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta01077a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245009800153300002000251520170900271592002801980650002002008650001902028650002502047650002102072650002002093650001602113650002102129650002602150650001002176650001702186650000902203650001502212650002902227700001902256700001502275700001402290700001802304700002002322700001702342773012402359856007402483852000902557655001202566IND60641504420221120185245.0190505e20170307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064150442DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra28205a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Yan10aIdentification of drug transporters involved in the uptake and efflux of rhein in hepatocytes  ap. 15236-15245.  aAim: Rhein is a herbal medicine with various bioactivities and is derived from an anthraquinone compound. In this study, we aimed to identify drug transporters involved in the uptake and efflux of rhein in hepatocytes. Methods: Rhein uptake and efflux were investigated in rat liver slices, primary rat hepatocytes, human transporter-transfected cells, membrane vesicles, and rats. Rhein was quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Rhein uptake was fitted to a Michaelis–Menten model with a Kₘ = 229.4 ± 58.5 μM and Vₘₐₓ = 428.7 ± 49.2 pmol mg⁻¹ protein in liver slices and a Kₘ = 129.6 ± 22.3 μM and Vₘₐₓ = 9.1 ± 0.6 nmol mg⁻¹ protein in primary rat hepatocytes. Rhein uptake by primary rat hepatocytes was inhibited by organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors (rifampicin and fluvastatin) and an organic anion transporter (OAT) inhibitor (probenecid). Rhein was taken up by HEK293 cells expressing OATP1B3, OATP2B1, and OAT2 and pumped out of MDCKII cells expressing breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), but not from those expressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or from membrane vesicles expressing multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) 2 and 3. In rats, hepatic exposure to rhein was reduced by rifampicin and probenecid (AUC₀–₂ ₕ decreased 0.61- and 0.12-fold, respectively), but increased by pantoprazole (AUC₀–₂ ₕ increased 0.64-fold), a BCRP inhibitor. Conclusion: These results show that OATP1B3, OATP2B1, and OAT2 contribute to hepatic rhein uptake, while BCRP contributes to its hepatic efflux. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms of rhein uptake and efflux in hepatocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aP-glycoproteins 3aanthraquinones 3abioactive properties 3abreast neoplasms 3aenzyme kinetics 3ahepatocytes 3aherbal medicines 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3apolypeptides 3arats 3arifampicin 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aMa, Bing-Liang1 aZheng, Min1 aShi, Rong1 aLi, Yuan-Yuan1 aWang, Tian-Ming1 aMa, Yue-Ming0 tRSC advances.g2017 Mar. 07, v. 7, no. 25 p.15236-15245dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra28205a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245011100173506002800284520126000312592002801572506003701600650000901637650002201646650002101668650002301689650001701712650001401729650002101743650001601764651002001780773009601800856008301896852000901979655001201988IND60739600320221207082420.0201009s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073960032DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202024000772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNana, Shakarishvili10aSeed germination of Paederotella pontica (Rupr. ex Boiss.) Kem-Nath.- rare endemic species of the Caucasus  aResource is Open Access  aPaederotella pontica is a Colchis tertiary relict species, regional narrow endemic to the Caucasus, representative of an oligotypic genus. The aim of this study was to determine dormancy-breaking requirements and develop seed germination protocol for P. pontica. Freshly matured seeds of P. pontica are morphophysiologically dormant (MPD). Mean length of seed is 820 μm, linear embryo is fully differentiated, on average 625 μm long. Penetration of tetrazolium salt indicates the permeability of seed coat and high percentage of vital seeds in capsules. Prior to root emergence, the E:S ratio increased from 0.76 to 0.9. Effects of warm and cold stratification and gibberellic acid (GA3) on embryo growth and seed germination were studied under laboratory conditions. Since cold stratification is the only requirement for the loss of MPD, the longest embryo growth occurred during this treatment and GA3 promoted MPD loss, we concluded that P. pontica seeds have intermediate complex MPD. Based on the treatment results a germination protocol is proposed: 1. Dry storage at 20°C, 2 months; 2. Cold-wet stratification at 3°C, 3 months; 3. Germination at 20/15°C day/night. Under developed conditions germination is fast, synchronous and yields to 80%.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acold 3adormancy breaking 3agibberellic acid 3aindigenous species 3apermeability 3aseed coat 3aseed germination 3atetrazolium 3aCaucasus region0 tBIO web of conferences.g2020, v. 24 p.00077-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202024000773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01621naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009400164300001600258500001500274520040200289592002800691650002300719650001800742650000900760651001100769651001100780653001500791653001300806653002100819653001800840653001300858653002700871653001500898700002300913700002600936700002200962773013600984856008201120852000901202655001201211IND60124852820221119214254.0151029e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012485282DNAL7 a10.3161/000345414X6824812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlis, Łukasz10aSome Observations on Ogma aquitanense (Fies, 1968) (Nematoda: Tylenchida: Criconematidae)  ap. 279-285.  a2019-12-04  aThis article provides new morphological and molecular data for Ogma aquitanense (Fies, 1968).

The AHP procedure was utilised to compare the discharges of suspended sediments measured at a station on the Armand River with results calculated with the equations derived by Kalinske (1942), Brooks (1963) and Toffaleti (1969). The equations were then used with the applicable coefficients from the literature to estimate sediment loads for the same periods as those calculated from the field data. A weighted coefficient was calculated from the estimated results from each equation and compared to each other and the field data. The results of the analysis with the AHP model provided an objective screening and ranking procedure with respect to accuracy, economic, and numbers of input parameters criteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amodels 3apollution load 3arivers 3ascreening 3asediment yield 3asuspended sediment 3aIran 0aanalytical hierarchy process 0aAHP 0aLane–Kalinske equations 0aBrooks equations 0aToffaleti equations 0asuspended sediment discharges 0arivers 0aIran1 aSalajegheh, Ali0 tInternational journal of water.g2015 Jan. 1, v. 9, no. 1 p.89-104dInderscience Publishersx1465-66207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1504%2FIJW.2015.0674493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01970naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245012300171300001600294520084800310592002801158650001901186650001201205650001901217650001401236650002601250650002201276650001101298650000901309650001101318650001901329650001601348700002401364700002201388773012901410856004801539852000901587655001201596IND4471157020221120124004.0120815e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447115702DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-011-9342-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorvanger, AsbjÃ¸rn10aOil price scenarios and climate policy: welfare effects of including transportation in the EU emissions trading system  ap. 753-768.  aThe stringency of policies needed to meet a climate target is influenced by uncertain oil prices because price changes cause emission changes, making the robustness of climate policy instruments important. As a result of its dependence on oil, emissions from the transport sector are particularly sensitive to oil price changes. We use a computable general equilibrium model to study the effects of including the transport sector in the EUâs emissions trading scheme under three future oil price scenarios. Our results show that there are potentially significant welfare gains from including transportation in the emissions trading scheme because the system as a whole helps absorb required changes in climate policy to meet the overall EU cap on emissions. There is, however, a cost in terms of somewhat greater permit price uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aemissions 3aenvironmental markets 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aoils 3aprices 3atransportation 3auncertainty1 aKallbekken, Steffen1 aTollefsen, Petter0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2012 Oct., v. 17, no. 7 p.753-768dSpringer-Verlagx1381-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-011-9342-6  aDNAL 7aarticle01810naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008900170300001600259520081500275592002801090650002001118650001201138651001101150653001601161653002701177653002301204700001601227700002001243700001901263773010801282856008501390852000901475655001201484IND50075082020221120165953.0200416e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007508202DNAL7 a10.1080/09614524.2011.5580582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilligan, Simon10aConnecting smallholders with dynamic markets: a market information service in Zambia  ap. 357-370.  aCommodity markets have changed significantly in the past two decades, with smallholders increasingly requiring robust market intelligence to understand and secure benefit from the new environment.

For balanced data, the simplest approach is to use genotypic mean estimates for the whole target region, and this has often been shown to yield better predictions than simple means per subregion. A disadvantage of this approach is that it gives equal weight to all neighboring subregions and the targeted subregion, thus ignoring potential heterogeneity in information content. The objective of the present paper is to propose a method that allows a weighted combination of data from several subregions and to compare that method to other estimators. The proposed method is based on best linear unbiased prediction, which employs a weighted mean of subregion means. It follows from the theory of mixed models that the resulting estimator is optimal under the assumed model, minimizing prediction errors and maximizing the expected gain from selection. Using published variance component estimates, we found the resulting predictions to be superior to other approaches. We also show that the estimator is beneficial when selecting for global adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3aeconomic sustainability 3agenotype 3aprediction 3astatistical models 3avariance1 aMöhring, J.0 tCrop science.g2005 May, v. 45, no. 3 p.1151-1159dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2004.03983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245012800163300001600291520154800307592002801855650001201883650001301895650001301908650002601921650001101947650002001958650001101978650001601989650001702005650002302022650002602045650002202071650001302093650001302106650001402119650001502133650001402148650001302162650001102175700002102186700001702207700002602224700001802250700002302268700002402291700002502315700001802340700002502358773010302383856007902486852000902565655001202574IND60479193920221121183500.0160119e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047919392DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.129302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHug, Laura A.10aCritical biogeochemical functions in the subsurface are associated with bacteria from new phyla and little studied lineages  ap. 159-173.  aNitrogen, sulfur and carbon fluxes in the terrestrial subsurface are determined by the intersecting activities of microbial community members, yet the organisms responsible are largely unknown. Metagenomic methods can identify organisms and functions, but genome recovery is often precluded by data complexity. To address this limitation, we developed subsampling assembly methods to re‐construct high‐quality draft genomes from complex samples. We applied these methods to evaluate the interlinked roles of the most abundant organisms in biogeochemical cycling in the aquifer sediment. Community proteomics confirmed these activities. The eight most abundant organisms belong to novel lineages, and two represent phyla with no previously sequenced genome. Four organisms are predicted to fix carbon via the Calvin–Benson–Bassham, Wood–Ljungdahl or 3‐hydroxyproprionate/4‐hydroxybutarate pathways. The profiled organisms are involved in the network of denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia, ammonia oxidation and sulfate reduction/oxidation, and require substrates supplied by other community members. An ammonium‐oxidizing Thaumarchaeote is the most abundant community member, despite low ammonium concentrations in the groundwater. This organism likely benefits from two other relatively abundant organisms capable of producing ammonium from nitrate, which is abundant in the groundwater. Overall, dominant members of the microbial community are interconnected through exchange of geochemical resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aaquifers 3abacteria 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3adenitrification 3agenome 3agroundwater 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3anitrate reduction 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aproteomics 3asediments 3asulfates 3asulfur1 aThomas, Brian C.1 aSharon, Itai1 aBrown, Christopher T.1 aSharma, Ritin1 aHettich, Robert L.1 aWilkins, Michael J.1 aWilliams, Kenneth H.1 aSingh, Andrea1 aBanfield, Jillian F.0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2016 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.159-173dBlackwell Sciencex1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.129303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100001400155245008600169300001600255520167400271592002801945650002301973650002301996650002002019650001102039650002102050650001502071650002002086650001802106650002702124650004102151650002202192650005002214650004802264650005602312650002402368650003702392650001802429650002402447650003202471650003102503700001902534700002302553700001602576700002202592700001602614773010402630856003902734852000902773655001202782IND4468437620221119180215.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446843762DNAL7 a216183112pmid7 a10.1002/pca.13312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Lijia10aSimultaneous Determination of Eight Anthraquinones in Semen Cassiae by HPLC‐DAD  ap. 110-116.  aINTRODUCTION: Semen Cassiae (SC), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of various diseases, is known to contain active anthraquinone ingredients. However, since the content of some anthraquinones is too low, previous analytical methods only allow the quantitation of a few anthraquinones or a hydrolysis step has to be included in the sample preparation. A rapid and accurate method to examine the content of as many anthraquinones as possible in SC would be desirable. OBJECTIVE: To develop a rapid, sensitive and accurate high‐performance liquid chromatography–diode array detection (HPLC‐ DAD) method to simultaneously quantify eight major anthraquinones (obtusifolin‐2‐glucoside, aurantio‐obtusin, aloe‐ emodin, rhein, obtusifolin, emodin, chrysophanol and physcion) in SC. METHODOLOGY: The separation of anthraquinones was achieved on a C18‐column with a gradient elution using acetonitrile and 0.1% phosphoric acid. The detection wavelength was 278 nm and the analysis finished within 25 min. RESULTS: The limits of detection of these compounds ranged from 0.07 to 0.15 µg/mL while the limits of quantitation ranged from 0.24 to 0.51 µg/mL. All calibration curves showed good linearities (r2 > 0.999) within the test ranges. This validated method was successfully used to analyse 22 batches of SC samples collected from various geographical locations. CONCLUSION: The method was validated to be simple, rapid, accurate and reliable to simultaneously determine eight major anthraquinones in SC. Meanwhile, a more specific anthraquinone, obtusifolin, was proposed to serve as a marker for SC, replacing chrysophanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aanalytical methods 3adetection limit 3aemodin 3aherbal medicines 3ahydrolysis 3aphosphoric acid 3arapid methods 2aAcetic Acidxchemistry 2aAnthraquinonesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aCassiaxchemistry 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbalxanalysisxchemistry. 2aEmodinxanalogs & derivativesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aFormatesxchemistry 2aGlycosidesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aLinear Models 2aMolecular Structure 2aPhosphoric Acidsxchemistry 2aReproducibility of Results1 aChan, Chi‐on1 aLau, Ching‐ching1 aYu, Zhiling1 aMok, Daniel K.

This diversity is thought to reflect adaptation to conditions under which sperm function as a way to ensure the survival of sperm in fertilization environments and to maximize fertilizing capacity thereof. The existence of morphological diversity among species is widely assumed, although this diversity seems less clear as we go deeper (between males, between ejaculates from the same male and even within the same ejaculate), with different theories addressing this heterogeneity. Moreover, the development of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) has led to changes in the physiological conditions in which sperm fertilize, which could lead, ultimately, to a selection towards more favourable sperm design. Regardless of the origin of this diversity, when studying the relationship between shape and function of sperm, it is advisable to assess the degree of heterogeneity of sperm and takes into account to be more likely to identify those morphological characteristics determining the fertile ability of sperm. Otherwise, these relationships could be hidden as a result of considering an average shape not representative of morphological characteristics of sperm. In addition, the knowledge of this morphological diversity in terms of changes arising from modifications in the sperm environment and mechanisms that generate these changes could be useful for understanding the reproductive capacity of males but also in enhancing their fertile ability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3amales 3areproductive performance 3aspermatozoa1 aJiménez‐Rabadán, P1 aGarcía‐Álvarez, O1 aMaroto‐Morales, A1 aSoler, AJ1 aFernández‐Santos, MR1 aPérez‐Guzmán, MD1 aGarde, JJ0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2014 Oct., v. 49 Suppl s4 p.30-36dP.

Two hundred and thirty seven proteins representative of the genome‐scale metabolic network were identified and classified into pathway categories. We found that nutrient resources shape the general orientation of metabolism through coordinated changes in the average abundances of proteins and in enzymatic activities that all belong to the same pathway category. For example, each culture medium induces a specific oxidative response whatever the strain. On the contrary, differences between strains concern isolated proteins and enzymes within pathway categories in single environments. Our study confirms the predominance of genotype by environment interactions at the proteomic and enzyme activity levels. The buffering of genetic variation when considering life‐history traits suggests a multiplicity of evolutionary strategies. For instance, the uropathogenic isolate CFT073 shows a deregulation of iron demand and increased oxidative stress response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aculture media 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype-environment interaction 3ahumans 3alife history 3ametabolism 3aoxidative stress 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3astress response 3aurine1 aAubron, Cécile1 aGlodt, Jérémy1 aBalliau, Thierry1 aLangella, Olivier1 aChevret, Didier1 aRigal, Odile1 aBourgais, Aurélie1 aPicard, Bertrand1 aVienne, Dominique1 aDenamur, Erick1 aBouvet, Odile1 aDillmann, Christine0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2016 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.100-117dBlackwell Sciencex1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.128553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245018000164300001600344520104500360592002801405650002301433650001501456650001301471650001901484650001901503650001501522650002001537773014901557856007701706852000901783655001201792IND60521010720221117000930.0160527e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052101072DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1951-05072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeidel, Wolfhard10aÜber die Zellmembran von Escherichia Coli BbI.

Electron micrographs and observations with the phase contrast microscope give strong evidence of drastic alterations occurring to both phage particle (T 2) and membrane on which it is adsorbed. Enzymatic activities on the part of the phage paralleling those encountered with viruses of the Mumps-NDV-Influenza Group may be involved.

Microclimate is normally affected by the urban morphology parameters. The objective of this work is to investigate the correlation between air temperature variations and urban morphology parameters in tropical cities. Field measurement was carried out to record the air temperature at 27 points within an 8 km2 urban area continuously in Singapore for one year. Geographical information system was applied to extract the urban morphology parameters. Generally, the maximum and minimum air temperature spatial differences in the study area ranged from 3.2 to 6.5 °C, indicating the significant effects of urban morphology on the air temperatures. Based on the fitting results of created multilinear regression models, parametric study has been performed to investigate the specific effects of urban morphology parameters on air temperatures. This work has proposed a much more precise regression model to predict the air temperature with various urban morphology parameters. In addition, meaningful value of reference has been offered for urban planners and landscape designers to effectively control the air temperature in tropical cities such as Singapore.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3acities 3ageographic information systems 3aheat island 3alandscapes 3amicroclimate 3aregression analysis 3aSingapore1 aCui, Peng1 aWong, Nyuk Hien1 aIgnatius, Marcel0 tSustainability.g2018 Jan. 16, v. 10, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100102063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245019400157300002000351520131300371592002801684650002201712650001301734650001901747650002401766650002201790650000901812650001301821650002601834650001401860650002201874650001901896650000701915650001901922650001901941650001401960650001701974650002101991700001702012700001502029700001602044700001902060773012402079856007402203852000902277655001202286IND60641505020221120175512.0190505e20170413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064150502DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra28224e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wenxia10aGraphene oxide supported titanium dioxide & ferroferric oxide hybrid, a magnetically separable photocatalyst with enhanced photocatalytic activity for tetracycline hydrochloride degradation  ap. 21287-21297.  aA facile, robust approach to the synthesis of Fe₃O₄/rGO/TiO₂ nanocomposites is described. The synthesis involves two major steps: (1) preparation of Fe₃O₄/GO by an electrostatic self-assembly method; (2) deposition of TiO₂ on the surface of the Fe₃O₄/rGO nanocomposite via a hydrothermal method. The as-prepared Fe₃O₄/rGO/TiO₂ photocatalyst exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-HCl) over a wide pH range from 3.0 to 11.0. At optimal conditions, a 92.6% degradation rate of TC-HCl was achieved within 330 min. The enhanced photocatalytic activity could be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the photo-Fenton reaction and electron transportation of graphene. A possible photocatalytic mechanism for TC-HCl by the Fe₃O₄/rGO/TiO₂ nanocomposite and H₂O₂ was proposed based on the quenching tests and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. Furthermore, a leaching test was also carried out and the result suggested that the leached iron from the reaction system was negligible and the catalyst still exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity after five reaction cycles, which clearly demonstrated that the Fe₃O₄/rGO/TiO₂ nanocomposite was reusable, excellently stable and highly effective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3aleaching 3aliquid chromatography 3amagnetism 3amass spectrometry 3ananocomposites 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asynergism 3atetracycline 3atitanium dioxide1 aXiao, Kaijun1 aZhu, Liang1 aYin, Yurong1 aWang, Chaomei,0 tRSC advances.g2017 Apr. 13, v. 7, no. 34 p.21287-21297dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra28224e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009900168300001600267520096900283592002801252650001701280650002501297650002201322650001301344650001101357650001801368650001101386650001001397650002601407650002101433650001601454650001901470651001001489653002501499653002701524653001501551773010801566856008501674852000901759655001201768IND50075082420221120165952.0200416e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007508242DNAL7 a10.1080/09614524.2011.5580622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahat, Ishara10aGender, energy, and empowerment: a case study of the Rural Energy Development Program in Nepal  ap. 405-420.  aRural women in general, and mountain women in particular, are greatly involved in managing household energy systems in Nepal. Alternative energy technologies have a high potential to reduce women's workloads and improve their health status, as well as increasing efficient energy supply. Interventions in rural energy are primarily aimed at reducing firewood use and increasing economic growth through rural electrification, rather than aiming to reduce human drudgery, especially that of women. Hence, such intervention takes place without considering the needs, roles, interests, and potential of rural women, even though women are the primary users and managers of rural energy resources. This article aims to analyse the gender implications of rural energy technologies in Kavre district, where the Rural Energy Development Program (REDP) has been implemented, especially in terms of saving women's labour and increasing socio-economic opportunities for women.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aeconomic development 3aenergy efficiency 3afuelwood 3agender 3ahealth status 3ahumans 3alabor 3arural electrification 3arural population 3arural women 3asocioeconomics 3aNepal 0aGender and diversity 0aLabour and livelihoods 0aSouth Asia0 tDevelopment in practice.g2011 May 1, v. 21, no. 3 p.405-420dRoutledgewJournal:12201x1364-92137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09614524.2011.5580623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02021naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002500148245011200173300001800285520108300303592002801386650001301414650000901427650001201436650001401448650001001462651001501472651001301487700001501500773009901515856008401614852000901698655001201707IND4472712220221120124106.0150808e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447271222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2011.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavin, L.q(Lionel),13aTheimpact of fossils on the Evolutionary Distinctiveness and conservation status of the Australian lungfish  ap. 3140-3142.  aThe recognition of phylogenetic information for evaluating conservation priorities has stressed the importance of basal taxa. The âEvolutionary Distinctivenessâ index (ED) is a species-specific index that includes branch length expressed as an absolute value measured in millions of years that can be applied to a single terminal taxon in a phylogeny. The ED depends on the tree pattern, i.e. of a cladogram included into a time-scale. When calculated for the Australian lungfish (Neoceratodusforsteri), a threatened dipnoan that occurs naturally only in southeast Queensland, the ED index shows variable value according to the chosen tree. On the basis of a recently proposed phylogeny including a new fossil find from the Early Cretaceous of Thailand, the ED value reaches the highest value for piscine sarcopterygians, and for all vertebrates, and thus reinforces the âoriginalityâ of this fish. This example points out the importance of fossils in the resolution of phylogenies and beyond, in the calculation of indexes supporting conservation decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abranches 3afish 3afossils 3aphylogeny 3atrees 3aQueensland 3aThailand1 aKemp, Anne0 tBiological conservation.g2011 Dec., v. 144, no. 12 p.3140-3142dElsevier Ltdx0006-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2011.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245017800155300002000333520154600353592002801899650002001927650002301947650001601970650001501986650001002001650001202011650001102023650001502034650001202049650001502061650001602076700002002092700001502112700001202127773014302139856007402282852000902356655001202365IND60670755520221119151556.0191002e20140708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067075552DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta01103a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yixin10aTunable p–n transition behaviour of a p-La₀.₆₇Sr₀.₃₃MnO₃/n-CeO₂ nanofibers heterojunction for the development of selective high temperature propane sensors  ap. 11651-11659.  aHigh temperature hydrocarbon sensors are of paramount importance to provide precise control of various combustion processes and directly evaluate the efficiency of catalytic converters. In this study, both p-type La₀.₆₇Sr₀.₃₃MnO₃ (LSMO) and n-type CeO₂ nanofibers (NFs) were prepared by electrospinning followed by facile two-step calcination. p-LSMO NFs/n-CeO₂ NFs composites with different weight ratios (CeO₂ NFs wt%: 0%, 25%, 50%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 90% and 100%) were then prepared by physical mixing with the help of sonication and further were employed as sensing elements to systematically investigate their response to carbon monoxide (CO) and propane (C₃H₈) at 800 °C. Clear p–n transition behaviour was observed from p-LSMO NFs dominated composites to n-CeO₂ NFs dominated composites in the presence of targeting gases. At the specific p-LSMO NFs/n-CeO₂ NFs composition (CeO₂ NFs wt% = 70%), the sensor exhibited an opposite response direction to CO and C₃H₈ which offers a simple way to differentiate them. Moreover, the p-LSMO NFs/n-CeO₂ NFs composite with the CeO₂ NFs content of 80% showed good sensitivity and selectivity to C₃H₈ over other reducing gases such as CO and CH₄ at a high operation temperature of 800 °C. The mechanisms of enhanced selectivity and p–n transition behaviour are also proposed based on the observed experimental results. This study opens an avenue for tailoring the selectivity of high temperature gas sensors by simply tuning the p–n heterojunction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalytic activity 3aceric oxide 3acombustion 3agases 3amethane 3amixing 3ananofibers 3apropane 3asonication 3atemperature1 aSun, Xiangcheng1 aLi, Baikun1 aLei, Yu0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 July 8, v. 2, no. 30 p.11651-11659dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta01103a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03556naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011200159300002000271520183100291592002802122650002102150650000802171650002702179650001902206650002102225650001902246650001902265650002502284650001702309650001502326650001902341650001702360650001602377650002402393650001902417650000902436650001802445650001902463650002102482650000702503650001702510650002102527700002602548700003002574700002102604700002602625700002702651700003202678700003202710700002902742773012402771856007402895852000902969655001202978IND60641505220221120175541.0190505e20170307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064150522DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra28234b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbnous, Khalil12aA novel aptamer-based DNA diamond nanostructure for in vivo targeted delivery of epirubicin to cancer cells  ap. 15181-15188.  aThe clinical administration of epirubicin (Epi) in the treatment of cancer has been restricted, owing to its cardiotoxicity. Targeted delivery of anticancer agents could increase their therapeutic efficacy and decrease their off-target effects. In this study, a novel Epi-DNA diamond nanostructure (DDN) conjugate containing two kinds of aptamers (MUC1 and ATP aptamers) was designed and evaluated in the treatment of target cells, including C26 cells (murine colon carcinoma cell) and MCF-7 cells (breast cancer cell). DDN and Epi-DDN conjugate formations were analyzed by gel retardation assay and fluorometric analysis, respectively. Release profiles of Epi from the developed Epi-DDN conjugate were evaluated at pHs 5.4 and 7.4. For the MTT assay (cell viability study), CHO cells (Chinese hamster ovary cell, nontarget), C26 and MCF-7 cells (target) were treated with the Epi-DDN conjugate, DDN, Epi, Epi-DDN conjugate without ATP aptamer and Epi-DDN conjugate without MUC1 aptamer. Internalization of the Epi-DDN conjugate was assessed by flow cytometry analysis and fluorescence imaging. Finally, the designed Epi-DDN conjugate was utilized for inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. 10 μM Epi was efficiently loaded in 1 μM DDN. The drug was released from the Epi-DDN conjugate in a pH-sensitive manner (higher release in acidic conditions). The results of flow cytometry analysis and fluorescence imaging confirmed that the developed Epi-DDN conjugate was effectively internalized into target cells, but not into nontarget cells. The results of the MTT assay were consistent with the internalization data. The Epi-DDN conjugate had more cytotoxicity in MCF-7 and C26 cells and less cytotoxicity in CHO cells in comparison with Epi alone. Moreover, the Epi-DDN conjugate could effectively prohibit tumor growth in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese hamsters 3aDNA 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aanimal ovaries 3abreast neoplasms 3acardiotoxicity 3acell viability 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3aepirubicin 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3afluorometry 3agel electrophoresis 3aimage analysis 3amice 3ananomaterials 3aneoplasm cells 3aoligonucleotides 3apH 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity testing1 aDanesh, Noor Mohammad1 aRamaz̤ānī, Muḥammad,1 aLavaee, Parirokh1 aJalalian, Seyed Hamid1 aYazdian-Robati, Rezvan1 aEmrani, Ahmad Sarreshtehdar1 aHassanabad, Koroush Yousefi1 aTaghdisi, Seyed Mohammad0 tRSC advances.g2017 Mar. 07, v. 7, no. 25 p.15181-15188dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra28234b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245014500206300001100351520205100362592002802413650001902441650001802460650002402478650002202502650001102524650001802535650001202553650002202565650001802587650002202605650001602627700002202643700002802665700001602693700001802709773015902727856008302886852000902969655001202978IND60775342320221122005808.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077534232DNAL7 a10.1186/s12966-022-01287-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3586-553310aCalorie reformulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the effect of manipulating food energy density on daily energy intake  ap. 48.  aBACKGROUND: Dietary energy density is thought to be a contributor to obesity, but the extent to which different magnitudes and types of reductions to food energy density decreases daily energy intake is unclear. The primary objective was to systematically review and meta-analyse experimental studies that have examined the effect that manipulating energy density of food has on total daily energy intake. Secondary objectives were to examine moderators of the effect that altering energy density has on daily energy intake and effects on body weight. METHODS: A systematic review and multi-level meta-analysis of studies on human participants that used an experimental design to manipulate the energy density of foods served and measured energy intake for a minimum of 1 day. RESULTS: Thirty-one eligible studies sampling both children (n = 4) and adults (n = 27) contributed 90 effects comparing the effect of higher vs. lower energy density of served food on daily energy intake to the primary meta-analysis. Lower energy density of food was associated with a large decrease in daily energy intake (SMD = − 1.002 [95% CI: − 0.745 to − 1.266]). Findings were consistent across studies that did vs. did not manipulate macronutrient content to vary energy density. The relation between decreasing energy density and daily energy intake tended to be strong and linear, whereby compensation for decreases to energy density of foods (i.e. by eating more at other meals) was minimal. Meta-analysis of (n = 5) studies indicated that serving lower energy dense food tended to be associated with greater weight loss than serving higher energy dense food, but this difference was not significant (− 0.7 kg difference in weight change, 95% CIs: − 1.34, 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing the energy density of food can substantially reduce daily energy intake and may therefore be an effective public health approach to reducing population level energy intake.

The vagina of both species has a thickening of the dorsal aspect called dorsal medial fold, which restricts the lumen of the paracervix, making catheterization of the cervix difficult both with manual and endoscopic techniques. Manual catheters have been used initially in the bitch and are now gradually being replaced by rigid endoscopy through the adaptation of human cystoscopes and ureteroscopes. Cystoscopes provide excellent imaging of the vagina, but cervical catheterization is more difficult due to the oblique 30° viewing angle of its telescope and may not be long enough to catheterize large size bitches. Ureteroscopes allow an acceptable view of the vaginal mucosa and offer advantages such as the possibility to catheterize the cervix of bitches of all body sizes, manipulate the cervical tubercle when the external cervical os is not visible, offer a better visualization of the cervix using the shunt (a large Foley catheter which allows insufflation and distention of the vagina). Feline cervical catheterization has been achieved with three different types of catheters; the last one, developed following careful anatomical studies of how the feline vaginal lumen changes during estrus, allows cervical catheterization thanks to digital manipulation of the cervix through the rectum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial insemination 3abitches 3acatheters 3acats 3acervix 3aendoscopy 3aestrus 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3arectum 3avaginal mucosa1 aLopate, C0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2014 Oct., v. 49 Suppl s4 p.56-63dP.

Its fruits are edible and its fruits and leaves are used in folk medicine for diverse purposes. Previous studies have shown that the fruits are rich in flavonoids, responsible for their antioxidant properties and compounds isolated from the entire plant were promising in cancer chemopreventive therapy. Strawberry tree fruits and leaves extracts enriched in polyphenols, but devoid of organic acids, carotenoids and sugars, were prepared by solid phase extraction (SPE) and tested for their antioxidant activities and their ability to inhibit metalloproteinases: attributes that could be related with initiation and proliferation of cancer cells. After fractionation by SPE, the apparent polyphenol yield was reduced for both leaf and fruit samples by the elimination of vitamins and organic acids, but the antioxidant and metalloproteinases inhibitory activities were potentiated. The antioxidant activity and the MMP-9 inhibitory activity of the polyphenol-enriched fractions of A. unedo tissues were similar or higher than those of blackberry and green tea, which have been recognized in the literature as highly effective. The phenolic profile of the fruit was dominated by gallic acid and quercetin derivatives with smaller amounts of proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins. The phenolic profile of the leaves was also dominated by gallic acid derivatives, flavonol derivatives and some tannins but lacked anthocyanins. The fractions obtained from both strawberry tree tissues seem to be quite promising as antioxidants and antiproliferative agents. Further cell-based assays are underway to study these possible outcomes.</p>  aPublisher supplied data 3aArbutus unedo 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablackberries 3acarotenoids 3achemoprevention 3afractionation 3afruits 3agallic acid 3agreen tea 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3ametalloproteinases 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aproanthocyanidins 3aquercetin 3asolid phase extraction 3asugars 3atannins 3atherapeutics 3atree fruits 3avitamins 3aMediterranean region 0aArbutus unedo 0apolyphenols 0aantioxidant activity 0aMMP-9 0aHPLC-MS1 aFortalezas, S.1 aCarrilho, C.1 aMcDougall, G.J.1 aStewart, D.1 aFerreira, R.B.1 aSantos, C.N.0 tJournal of berry research.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 1, no. 1 p.3-12dIOS Pressx1878-50937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3233%2FBR-2010-0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245011700203300001600320500001100336506007600347520107500423592002801498506003701526650002301563650001901586650001401605650003901619650001601658650002101674650002601695650002501721651001801746700001901764700002301783773009201806856007301898852000901971655001201980IND50089257020221207141642.0150206e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008925702DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.122742doi7 aPMC43458242pmcid7 a246746492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrossman, Judah D.10aContemporary evolution of an invasive grass in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 at a Mojave Desert FACE site  ap. 710-716.  aLETTER  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aElevated atmospheric CO₂has been shown to rapidly alter plant physiology and ecosystem productivity, but contemporary evolutionary responses to increased CO₂have yet to be demonstrated in the field. At a Mojave Desert FACE (free‐air CO₂enrichment) facility, we tested whether an annual grass weed (Bromus madritensis ssp. rubens) has evolved in response to elevated atmospheric CO₂. Within 7 years, field populations exposed to elevated CO₂evolved lower rates of leaf stomatal conductance; a physiological adaptation known to conserve water in other desert or water‐limited ecosystems. Evolution of lower conductance was accompanied by reduced plasticity in upregulating conductance when CO₂was more limiting; this reduction in conductance plasticity suggests that genetic assimilation may be ongoing. Reproductive fitness costs associated with this reduction in phenotypic plasticity were demonstrated under ambient levels of CO₂. Our findings suggest that contemporary evolution may facilitate this invasive species' spread in this desert ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aat-risk population 3acarbon dioxide 3aevolution 3afree air carbon dioxide enrichment 3agrass weeds 3ainvasive species 3aphenotypic plasticity 3astomatal conductance 3aMojave Desert1 aRice, Kevin J.1 aGurevitch, Jessica0 tEcology letters.g2014 June, v. 17, no. 6 p.710-716dBlackwell Sciencex1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.122743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245008800168520121400256592002801470650001901498650002301517650002401540650001401564650002501578650001501603650001201618650001801630650002201648650001101670650001301681650001001694650001501704650002001719650002001739650001601759700003301775700003501808773012701843856007401970852000902044655001202053IND60652126020221120035320.0190712e20180116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065212602DNAL7 a10.3390/su100102122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallego Valero, Leticia14aThe Tax Burden on Wastewater and the Protection of Water Ecosystems in EU Countries  a80% of all wastewater is discharged into the environment without first eliminating contaminants, and the consequences are cause for concern. The ecotaxes levied on effluents in many developed countries are aimed at preventing and minimizing water pollution and also, in part, helping to finance proper water reclamation facilities. The aim of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis of the current tax burden in a set of European Union countries on wastewater discharges and to assess its relationship with the quality of fresh water and other economic and political variables. The paper draws on different theoretical arguments and estimates a panel data model to verify the effectiveness of taxes in protecting aquatic ecosystems. These taxes are directly dependent on the environmental health status of water and inversely linked to the volume of discharged wastewater. In addition, a direct relationship is found between the tax burden on wastewater discharges and the variables representing the Human Development Index, the per capita expenditure on protecting water resources, the relative weight of ecotaxes in a country’s total tax revenues, and public support for green political movements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aaquatic ecosystems 3adeveloped countries 3aeffluents 3aenvironmental health 3afreshwater 3afunding 3ahealth status 3ahuman development 3aincome 3apolitics 3ataxes 3awastewater 3awater pollution 3awater resources 3awater reuse1 aMoral Pajares, Encarnación,1 aRomán Sánchez, Isabel María0 tSustainability.g2018 Jan. 16, v. 10, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100102123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01756naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100003500146245009700181300001600278520067900294592002800973650002301001650002701024650001801051650001001069650002201079650001501101650002201116700002501138700003201163700002401195773010801219856008201327852000901409655001201418IND4462231620221119180509.0141111e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446223162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2011.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbuquerque, Tânia Gonçalves10aTrends in the analytical methods for the determination of trans fatty acids content in foods  ap. 543-560.  aPartially hydrogenated vegetable oils containing trans fatty acids (TFA) have been used in the food industry, due to its low cost compared with other fats and availability to extend the shelf-life of products, as well as to impart desirable characteristics to the food.

Therefore, we produced transgenic wheat genotypes over-expressing the cDNA of alfalfa aldose reductase gene. These plants consequently exhibit 1.5–4.3 times higher detoxification activity for the aldehyde substrate. Permanent drought stress was generated in the greenhouse by growing wheat plants in soil with 20 % water capacity. The control and stressed plants were monitored by a semi automatic phenotyping platform providing computer-controlled watering, digital and thermal imaging. Calculation of biomass values was based on the correlation (R² = 0.7556) between fresh weight and green pixel-based shoot surface area. The green biomass production by plants of the three transgenic lines was 12–26–41 % higher than the non-transgenic plants’ grown under water limitation. Thermal imaging of stressed non-transgenic plants indicated an elevation in the leaf temperature. The thermal status of transformants was similar at both normal and suboptimal water regime. In drought, the transgenic plants used more water during the growing season. The described phenotyping platform provided a comprehensive data set demonstrating the improved physiological condition of the drought stressed transgenic wheat plants in the vegetative growth phase. In soil with reduced water capacity two transgenic genotypes showed higher seed weight per plant than the control non-transgenic one. Limitation of greenhouse-based phenotyping in analysis of yield potential is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehyde reductase 3aaldehydes 3aalfalfa 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomass production 3acytotoxicity 3adata collection 3adrought 3agenes 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3alipids 3aphenotype 3aseed weight 3aseed yield 3asoil 3asurface area 3atemperature 3avegetative growth 3awater stress 3awheat1 aMajer, Petra1 aSass, László1 aLantos, Csaba1 aCsiszár, Jolán,1 aTuróczy, Zoltán1 aMihály, Róbert1 aMai, Antal1 aHorváth, Gábor V.1 aVass, Imre1 aDudits, Dénes,1 aPauk, János0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2014 Mar., v. 36, no. 3 p.663-673dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-013-1445-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245018200172300001600354520109700370592002801467650001701495650001301512650001301525650001601538650001001554650001401564650001601578650002501594650001401619650001401633650001801647650001301665651001001678653000801688653000801696653000901704653000801713653000901721653001701730653002001747653001401767653002101781653001501802653001301817700001701830700002401847700001401871700001701885700002201902700002101924700002401945700002501969700002101994700001702015700001802032773012602050856008402176852000902260655001202269IND60570702720221119051240.0190405e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057070272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.syapm.2017.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmin, A.K.M.

All aspects of phylogenetic (16S rRNA phylogeny, MLSA), phenotypic and genetic (ANI, DDH, AAI, and the number of core genes) cohesions between the two identified species were high enough to propose them as members of a new genus within the family Vibrionaceae. Consequently, an eighth genus Thaumasiovibrio gen. nov. is proposed that contains two new species Thaumasiovibrio occultus sp. nov. strain C4II189T (=DSM 101554T=JCM 31629T) (type species) and Thaumasiovibrio subtropicus sp. nov. strain C4V358T (=DSM 101555T=JCM 31630T). Thaumasiovibrio species were phylogenetically distinct from the other Vibrionaceae species based on pyrH gene sequences. The combination of catalase negative, sensitivity to vibriostatic agent O/129, and green colony formation on TCBS for the phylogenetically affiliated strains was the diagnostic features for the current tentative identification of this genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrionaceae 3acatalase 3acohesion 3acoral reefs 3agenes 3anew genus 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3aseawater 3aJapan 0aANI 0aAAI 0aMLSA 0aDDH 0aTCBS 0aVibrionaceae 0aThaumasiovibrio 0aNew genus 0aGenomic taxonomy 0aCoral reef 0aSeawater1 aTanaka, Mami1 aAl-saari, Nurhidayu1 aFeng, Gao1 aMino, Sayaka1 aOgura, Yoshitoshi1 aHayashi, Tetsuya1 aMeirelles, Pedro M.1 aThompson, Fabiano L.1 aGomez-Gil, Bruno1 aSawabe, Toko1 aSawabe, Tomoo0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g2017 July, v. 40, no. 5 p.290-296dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl34624x0723-20207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.syapm.2017.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010000169300001600269520175100285592002802036653004002064653002302104653002602127700002102153700002102174700002302195700002102218773012902239856008402368852000902452655001202461IND60596289220221123031853.0180618e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059628922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dental.2018.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLassila, Lippo10aMechanical properties and fracture behavior of flowable fiber reinforced composite restorations  ap. 598-606.  aThe aim was to evaluate the effect of short glass-fiber/filler particles proportion on fracture toughness (FT) and flexural strength (FS) of an experimental flowable fiber-reinforced composite (Exp-SFRC) with two methacrylate resin formulations. In addition, we wanted to investigate how the fracture-behavior of composite restorations affected by FT values of SFRC-substructure.Exp-SFRC was prepared by mixing 50wt% of dimethacrylate based resin matrix (bisGMA or UDMA based) to 50wt% of various weight fractions of glass-fiber/particulate filler (0:50, 10:40, 20:30, 30:20, 40:10, 50:0wt%, respectively). FT and FS were determined for each experimental material following standards. Specimens (n=8) were dry stored (37°C for 2 days) before they were tested. Four groups of posterior composite crowns (n=6) composed of different Exp-SFRCs as substructure and surface layer of commercial particulate filler composite were fabricated. Crowns were statically loaded until fracture. Failure modes were visually examined. The results were statistically analysed using ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey’s test.ANOVA revealed that ratio of glass-fiber/particulate filler had significant effect (p<0.05) on tested mechanical properties of the Exp-SFRC with both monomer systems. Exp-SFRC (50wt%) had significantly higher FT (2.6MPam¹/²) and FS (175.5MPa) (p<0.05) compared to non-reinforced material (1.3MPam¹/², 123MPa). Failure mode analysis of crown restorations revealed that FT value of the substructure directly influenced the failure mode.This study shows that short glass-fibers can significantly reinforce flowable composite resin and the FT value of SFRC-substructure has prior importance, as it influences the crack arresting mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 0aFiber reinforced flowable composite 0aFracture toughness 0aPosterior restoration1 aKeulemans, Filip1 aSäilynoja, Eija1 aVallittu, Pekka K.1 aGaroushi, Sufyan0 tDental materials.g2018 Apr., v. 34 p.598-606dElsevier LtdaThe Academy of Dental MaterialswJournal:26790x0109-56417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dental.2018.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010800165300001600273500001900289520124500308592002801553650001401581650002101595650001901616650001301635650002401648650001701672650002101689650001501710650001401725650001801739650001401757650001501771650001001786700002201796700002301818700002001841700001801861773010201879856008101981852000902062655001202071IND50073142520221122060844.0150213e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007314252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-013-1446-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamas, Necdet10aAltitudinal changes in the content of bioactive substances in Hypericum orientale and Hypericum pallens  ap. 675-686.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAltitudinal changes in the content of hypericin, pseudohypericin, hyperforin, adhyperforin, chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, 2,4-Dihydroxybenzoic acid, amentoflavone, hyperoside, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, quercetin, avicularin, rutin, (+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin among Hypericum orientale L. and Hypericum pallens Banks and Sol. populations from Northern Turkey were investigated for the first time.

The plant materials were dried at room temperature and subsequently assayed for chemical contents by HPLC. All chemicals were detected in both species at various levels depending on altitude of growing sites except for caffeic acid which was absent in H. pallens.

Silanes are very effective in adhesion promotion between resin composites and silica-based or silica-coated indirect restorative materials. It is generally accepted that for non-silica-based restorations, surface pretreatment is a mandatory preliminary step to increase the silica content and then, with help of silane, improve resin bonding. This review discusses the silane-based adhesion chemistry, silane applications in dentistry, surface pretreatment methods, and presents the recent development of silane coupling agents.A silane coupling agent is considered a reliable, good adhesion promoter to silica-based (or silica-coated) indirect restorations. Surface pre-treatment steps, e.g., acid etching for porcelain and tribo-chemical silica-coating for metal alloys, is used before silanization to attain strong, durable bonding of the substrate to resin composite. In clinical practice, however, the main problem of resin bonding using silanes and other coupling agents is the weakening of the bond (degradation) in the wet oral environment over time.A silane coupling agent is a justified and popular adhesion promoter (adhesive primer) used in dentistry. The commercial available silane coupling agents can fulfil the requirements in clinical practice for durable bonding. Development of new silane coupling agents, their optimization, and surface treatment methods are in progress to address the long term resin bond durability and are highly important.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSilane 0aAdhesion chemistry 0aDental restorative materials 0aBonding 0aResin composites1 aLung, Christie Ying Kei1 aTsoi, James Kit Hon0 tDental materials.g2018 Jan., v. 34 p.13-28dElsevier LtdaThe Academy of Dental MaterialswJournal:26790x0109-56417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dental.2017.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245010000204300001800304506007600322520141600398592002801814506003701842650001701879650001301896650001101909650002201920650001201942650001801954650002501972650002101997650000902018650001102027650001902038650001102057650001802068700002002086700001602106700002902122700002102151773017202172856008302344852000902427655001202436IND4472657120221207081044.0120502e20120207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447265712DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11195781092doi7 aPMC32775112pmcid7 a223084392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanner, Kandice10aCoherent angular motion in the establishment of multicellular architecture of glandular tissues  ap. 1973-1978.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlandular tissues form ducts (tubes) and acini (spheres) in multicellular organisms. This process is best demonstrated in the organization of the ductal tree of the mammary gland and in 3D models of morphogenesis in culture. Here, we asked a fundamental question: How do single adult epithelial cells generate polarized acini when placed in a surrogate basement membrane 3D gel? Using human breast epithelial cells from either reduction mammoplasty or nonmalignant breast cell lines, we observed a unique cellular movement where single cells undergo multiple rotations and then maintain it cohesively as they divide to assemble into acini. This coherent angular motion (CAMo) was observed in both primary cells and breast cell lines. If CAMo was disrupted, the final geometry was not a sphere. The malignant counterparts of the human breast cell lines in 3D were randomly motile, did not display CAMo, and did not form spheres. Upon "phenotypic reversion" of malignant cells, both CAMo and spherical architecture were restored. We show that cell-cell adhesion and tissue polarity are essential for the formation of acini and link the functional relevance of CAMo to the establishment of spherical architecture rather than to multicellular aggregation or growth. We propose that CAMo is an integral step in the formation of the tissue architecture and that its disruption is involved in malignant transformation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacinar cells 3aadhesion 3aadults 3abasement membrane 3abreasts 3acell adhesion 3acell differentiation 3aepithelial cells 3agels 3ahumans 3amammary glands 3amodels 3amorphogenesis1 aMori, Hidetoshi1 aMroue, Rana1 aBruni-Cardoso, Alexandre1 aBissell, Mina J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Feb. 7, v. 109, no. 6 p.1973-1978dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11195781093Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245016700173300001800340520163600358592002801994650001602022650001702038650001202055650003002067650002202097650001302119700002902132700002702161700002202188773011702210856005502327852000902382655001202391IND4510622120221117234132.0150730e200211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451062212DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03233.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRial, Daniela V.13aTheimport of ferredoxinâNADP+ reductase precursor into chloroplasts is modulated by the region between the transit peptide and the mature core of the protein  ap. 5431-5439.  aProtein transport across organelles' membranes requires that precursor proteins adopt an unfolded structure in order to be translocated by the import machinery. FerredoxinâNADP+ reductase precursor, as well as many others, acquires a tightly folded structure that needs to be unfolded before or during its import. Several steps of chloroplast protein import are not fully understood. In particular, the role of different regions of the precursor protein has not been completely elucidated. In this work, we have studied the import into chloroplasts of precursor proteins with inclusions of amino acid spacers between the transit peptide and the mature protein, and with deletions in the Nâterminal region of the mature enzyme. We measured the import rate constants for these precursors and the results indicate that the distance between the transit peptide and the core of the mature protein determines the import kinetics. The longer precursors were imported into the organelle faster than the wild type form. Precursors with deletions in the Nâterminal region of the mature protein also showed increased import rates compared to the wild type. Homology studies amongst all family members reveal that only chloroplastic proteins possess this region. We suggest that even if the first amino acids of the mature protein do not contribute to its overall structural stability, they condition the kinetic parameters of the import reaction. Besides, the distance between the transit peptide and the mature protein core may be modulating the import rate at which the chloroplast incorporates this protein from the cytosol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3achloroplasts 3acytosol 3aferredoxin-NADP reductase 3aprotein transport 3aproteins1 aLombardo, VerÃ³nica A.1 aCeccarelli, Eduardo A.1 aOttado, Jorgelina0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2002 Nov., v. 269, no. 22 p.5431-5439dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03233.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245018400178300001400362500001400376520105300390592002801443650002301471650001401494650001101508650002701519650001001546650001801556650002401574650002401598650001701622650001401639650001201653650002001665650003301685650002201718650001201740653000801752653000801760653001001768653003001778653002801808653002601836700003601862773008701898856008401985990002302069852000902092655001202101IND60708726320221120141812.0201023e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070872632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2020.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrujillo-Uscanga, Adrian10aHost cell p53 associates with the feline calicivirus major viral capsid protein VP1, the protease-polymerase NS6/7, and the double-stranded RNA playing a role in virus replication  ap. 78-88.  aNAL-light  ap53 is implicated in several cellular pathways such as induction of cell-cycle arrest, differentiation, senescence, and apoptosis. p53 is activated by a broad range of stress signals, including viral infections. While some viruses activate p53, others induce its inactivation, and occasionally p53 is differentially modulated during the replicative cycle. During calicivirus infections, apoptosis is required for virus exit and spread into the host; yet, the role of p53 during infection is unknown. By confocal microscopy, we found that p53 associates with FCV VP1, the protease-polymerase NS6/7, and the dsRNA. This interaction was further confirmed by proximity ligation assays, suggesting that p53 participates in the FCV replication. Knocked-down of p53 expression in CrFK cells before infection, resulted in a strong reduction of the non-structural protein levels and a decrease of the viral progeny production. These results indicate that p53 is associated with the viral replication complex and is required for an efficient FCV replication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFeline calicivirus 3aapoptosis 3aassays 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acells 3acoat proteins 3aconfocal microscopy 3adouble-stranded RNA 3ainactivation 3ainfection 3aprogeny 3aprotein content 3aviral nonstructural proteins 3avirus replication 3aviruses 0ap53 0aVP1 0adsRNA 0aProtease-polymerase NS6/7 0aRNA-protein interaction 0aReplication complexes1 aGutiérrez-Escolano, Ana Lorena0 tVirology.g2020 Nov., v. 550 p.78-88dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.08.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245011200175300001600287520143600303592002801739650001301767650002201780650001101802650001601813650001301829650002601842650001101868650001801879650002101897650001801918650001101936650001301947650001301960650001601973650001201989650001502001650001102016653001102027653000802038653001302046653001402059653002402073700002402097700002002121700002002141773012602161856008402287852000902371655001202380IND60570702920221119051312.0190405e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057070292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.syapm.2017.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiancalana, Florencia12aA protocol for the simultaneous identification of chitin-containing particles and their associated bacteria  ap. 314-320.  aChitin is the second most abundant polymer on Earth, playing a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycles. A core issue for studying its processing in aquatic systems is the identification and enumeration of chitin-containing particles and organisms, ideally in a manner that can be directly linked to bulk chitin quantification. The aim of this study was the development of such a technique. We successfully combined the methodology of bulk chitin determination using wheat germ agglutinin (FITC-WGA) for staining chitin-containing particles and organisms along with CARD-FISH staining of either chitin-containing eukaryotic cells or bacteria associated with them. Environmental chitin staining was successfully applied to natural water samples. Fungal hyphae, diatoms, and dinoflagellates, sestonic aggregates and chitin-containing structures derived from metazoa were observed. Also, hybridized bacteria attached to chitinaceous debris were clearly visualized. Finally, as proof of principle, cultured yeast cells were simultaneously-targeted by FITC-WGA and the EUK516 probe without exhibiting any interference between both stains. The presented approach appears as a powerful tool to evaluate the contribution of different size classes and organisms to chitin production and consumption, opening the possibility for application of single-cell approaches targeting the ecophysiology of chitin transformations in aquatic systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnimalia 3aBacillariophyceae 3aMiozoa 3aagglutinins 3abacteria 3abiogeochemical cycles 3achitin 3aecophysiology 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahybridization 3ahyphae 3apolymers 3astaining 3atemperature 3awashing 3awheat germ 3ayeasts 0aChitin 0aWGA 0aBacteria 0aCARD-FISH 0aSestonic aggregates1 aKopprio, Germán A.1 aLara, Rubén J.1 aAlonso, Cecilia0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g2017 July, v. 40, no. 5 p.314-320dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl34624x0723-20207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.syapm.2017.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245012600163520111200289592002801401650001501429650002201444650002101466650001601487650002501503650003101528650001701559650001201576650002201588653003401610653001001644653000701654653000801661653000801669653000901677653001201686653000901698653001001707653001001717653000901727653001001736653000801746653000701754653001001761653000901771653000801780653000701788653000701795653000801802653000801810653001101818653001501829653002001844653002201864653003001886700001801916700001401934700001701948700001701965700001701982700001601999700001302015773010802028856008602136852000902222655001202231IND60755079620221121161850.0220531e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075507962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1187892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jun14aThe role of surface functional groups of pectin and pectin-based materials on the adsorption of heavy metal ions and dyes  aNatural macromolecules have been used to adsorb pollutants including heavy metal ions and organic dyes due to low-cost, accessible, biodegradable, and eco-friendly advantages. Pectin, an important natural polymer, possesses abundant carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups that can interact with the metal and organic cations via electrostatic interaction; as well as be modified by other chemicals for preparing hybrid and composite materials. The resultant materials have been employed to remove pollutants from aqueous solution; the importance of chemical composition was unlocked. Here, we reviewed contaminant removal by pectin, and pectin-based hybrid and composite materials, and highlighted the role of functional groups on pollutant removal. The removal of heavy metal ions was mainly due to surface coordination, while that of organic cations to electrostatic interactions of the functional groups. Moreover, the influence of initial contaminant concentration was critically discussed. The comprehensive review can provide valuable information on pectin and its application in contaminant removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abiodegradability 3abiopolymers 3achemical composition 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aheavy metals 3apectins 3apollution control 0aPec (in the hybrid materials) 0aPmPDA 0aMA 0aAAm 0aAAc 0aAMPS 0aNIPAMPA 0aNIPA 0aMETAC 0aAPTAC 0aAAGa 0aEGDMA 0aMBA 0aGG 0aSPION 0aGalA 0aEPR 0aDE 0aMw 0aPFO 0aPSO 0aPectin 0aAdsorption 0aHeavy metal ion 0aOrganic pollutant 0aSurface functional groups1 aYang, Zai-lei1 aDing, Tao1 aSong, Yi-Jia1 aLi, Hai-Chao1 aLi, De-qiang1 aChen, Sheng1 aXu, Feng0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 276 p.118789-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1187893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012500160300001800285520144300303592002801746650001201774650001001786650002401796650002401820650001801844650001201862650001301874650002301887650002701910650001401937650001801951650001001969700001901979773009801998856007302096852000902169655001202178IND60480458120221119121339.0160127e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048045812DNAL7 a10.1890/13-1715.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeVore, Jayna L.10aGrass invasion increases top‐down pressure on an amphibian via structurally mediated effects on an intraguild predator  ap. 1724-1730.  aPlants serve as both basal resources and ecosystem engineers, so plant invasion may exert trophic influences on consumers both via bottom‐up processes and by altering the environmental context in which trophic interactions occur. To determine how these mechanisms affect a native predator we used a mark–recapture study in eight pairs of 58‐m² field enclosures to measure the influence of Japanese stilt grass invasion on 3200 recently metamorphosed American toads. Toad survivorship was lower in invaded habitats despite abiotic effects that favor amphibians. Prey densities were also lower in invaded habitats, but growth was unaffected. Frequent spider predation events in invaded habitats led us to use factorial field cage manipulations of stilt grass and lycosid spiders to determine if invasion increases predation rates. Spiders persisted at higher densities in the presence of stilt grass, and toad survival was lowest in cages with both grass and spiders. Invasion alone did not significantly reduce toad survival. Our results demonstrate that despite prey reductions and abiotic effects, it is increased spider persistence that reduces toad survival in invaded habitats. Invasion therefore affects resident forest floor consumers by modifying trophic interactions between native species, causing structurally mediated reductions in intraguild predation rates among spiders, with cascading implications for toad survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3acages 3aecological invasion 3aecosystem engineers 3aforest litter 3agrasses 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3amark-recapture studies 3apredation 3asurvival rate 3atoads1 aMaerz, John C.0 tEcology.g2014 July, v. 95, no. 7 p.1724-1730dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-1715.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024004000135040001800175100002600193245009000219300001300309520156400322592002801886650001601914650001401930650001101944650001501955650001601970650001901986650002502005650001902030650001602049650001502065650001002080650001602090650001002106650007802116650005002194650001102244650001102255650000902266650005302275650001602328700002002344700001902364700001902383700002102402700002202423700002002445700001902465700002202484773008202506856008602588990002302674852000902697655001202706IND60091891420221119045702.0141103e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009189142DNAL7 a229027682pmid7 aPMC35134002pmcid7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2012.07.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKleinhans, Natalia M.10aAge-related abnormalities in white matter microstructure in autism spectrum disorders  ap. 1-16.  aAbnormalities in structural and functional connectivity have been reported in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) across a wide age range. However, developmental changes in white matter microstructure are poorly understood. We used a cross-sectional design to determine whether white matter abnormalities measured using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were present in adolescents and adults with ASD and whether age-related changes in white matter microstructure differed between ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals. Participants included 28 individuals with ASD and 33 TD controls matched on age and IQ and assessed at one time point. Widespread decreased fractional anisotropy (FA), and increased radial diffusivity (RaD) and mean diffusivity (MD) were observed in the ASD group compared to the TD group. In addition, significant group-by-age interactions were observed in FA, RaD, and MD in all major tracts except the brain stem, indicating that age-related changes in white matter microstructure differed between the groups. We propose that white matter microstructural changes in ASD may reflect myelination and/or other structural differences including differences in axonal density/arborization. In addition, we suggest that white matter microstuctural impairments may be normalizing during young adulthood in ASD. Future longitudinal studies that include a wider range of ages and more extensive clinical characterization will be critical for further uncovering the neurodevelopmental processes unfolding during this dynamic time in development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aadulthood 3aadults 3abrain stem 3adiffusivity 3aimage analysis 3alongitudinal studies 3amicrostructure 3amyelination 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aChild 2aChild Development Disorders, Pervasivexdiagnosisxmetabolismxpathology. 2aDiffusion Magnetic Resonance Imagingxmethods 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNerve Fibers, Myelinatedxmetabolismxpathology. 2aYoung Adult1 aPauley, Gregory1 aRichards, Todd1 aNeuhaus, Emily1 aMartin, Nathalie1 aCorrigan, Neva M.1 aShaw, Dennis W.1 aEstes, Annette1 aDager, Stephen R.0 tBrain research.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 1479 p.1-16dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2012.07.0563Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013100171300001800302520237000320592002802690653000802718653002802726653002602754653001902780653002502799700002402824700002402848700002202872700002002894700002002914773009802934856008403032852000903116655001203125IND60596289520221123031856.0180618e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059628952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dental.2017.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAusiello, Pietro10aCAD-FE modeling and analysis of class II restorations incorporating resin-composite, glass ionomer and glass ceramic materials  ap. 1456-1465.  aTo investigate the influence of specific resin-composite, glass ceramic and glass ionomer cement (GIC) material combinations in a “multi-layer” technique to replace enamel and dentin in class II mesio-occlusal-distal (MOD) dental restorations using 3D-Finite Element Analysis (FEA).Four 3D-FE models (A–D) of teeth, adhesively restored with different filling materials, were created and analyzed in comparison with a 3D model (E) of a sound lower molar. Models A, B & C had “multilayer” constructions, consisting of three layers: adhesive, dentin replacement and enamel replacement.Model A: had a low modulus (8GPa) composite replacing dentin and a higher modulus (12GPa) composite replacing enamel.Model B: had a GI cement replacing dentin and a higher modulus (12GPa) composite replacing enamel.Model C: had a low modulus (8GPa) composite replacing dentin and a very high modulus (70GPa) inlay replacing enamel.Model D: had a lithium disilicate inlay replacing both dentin and enamel with a luting cement base-layer.Polymerization shrinkage effects were simulated and a load of 600N was applied. All the materials were assumed to behave elastically throughout the entire deformation.Model A showed the highest stress distribution along all the adhesive interfaces of the shrinking resin-based materials with a critical condition and failure risk marginally and internally. Model D, by contrast, showed a more favorable performance than either of the multilayer groups (A–C). Stress and displacement plots showed an elastic response similar to that obtained for the sound tooth model. Model B and Model C performed according to their bilayer material properties. The use of a non-shrink dentin component simulating a GIC clearly affected the shrinkage stress at the basis of the Model B; while the bulk resin composite having a 12GPa Young’s modulus and linear polymerization shrinkage of 1% strongly influenced the biomechanical response in the bucco-lingual direction.Direct resin-based composite materials applied in multilayer techniques to large class II cavities, with or without shrinking dentin layers, produced adverse FEA stress distributions and displacements. An indirect lithium disilicate inlay used to replace lost dentin and enamel in posterior restored teeth generated lower stress levels, within the limits of the elastic FEA model.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCAD 0aFinite element analysis 0aClass II restorations 0aImage analysis 0aMaterials properties1 aCiaramella, Stefano1 aMartorelli, Massimo1 aLanzotti, Antonio1 aGloria, Antonio1 aWatts, David C.0 tDental materials.g2017 Dec., v. 33 p.1456-1465dElsevier LtdwJournal:26790x0109-56417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dental.2017.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009800166300001600264520134200280592002801622650001501650650001001665650001001675650001801685650000901703650001201712650001901724650001201743650002701755650002301782650002301805650001601828653001301844653002401857653001201881653002301893700001501916700001701931773010801948856008202056852000902138655001202147IND60570703020221118060824.0190405e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057070302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2017.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPourabedin, M.10aEffect of flaxseed flour on rheological properties, staling and total phenol of Iranian toast  ap. 173-178.  aEffect of adding flaxseed flour (10%, 20% and 30% w/w) to wheat flour on rheological properties of dough, including water absorption, stability and development time, extensibility and resistance to extension, was studied at 45, 90 and 135 min proving time. Qualitative properties of toast regarding staling (after 24 and 72 h) were determined. Phenolic compounds, peroxide values, sensory characteristics and color indices of the breads were evaluated. The results indicated that water absorption and development time increased as the proportion of flaxseed increased in dough. Stability decreased with the increment of flax flour compared to control sample (100% wheat flour). Extensibility and resistance to extension of flaxseed samples respectively decreased and increased comparing to those of control sample. Staling in toast with 20% flaxseed flour was seen to be lower than that of the control. Adding flax flour caused phenolic compounds to increase, however it decreased peroxide value. Bread color parameters L and a reduced by adding flax flour, while parameter b did not show significant different compared to the control (p < 0.05). Results of sensory evaluation indicated that brightness of the toasts decreased with increasing flaxseed flour and that 30% flaxseed toast had the lowest score for overall acceptability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acolor 3adough 3aextensibility 3aflax 3alinseed 3aperoxide value 3aphenols 3arheological properties 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3awheat flour 0aFlaxseed 0aIranian toast bread 0aStaling 0aPhenolic compounds1 aAarabi, A.1 aRahbaran, S.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2017 July, v. 76 p.173-178dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2017.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245008900160520177400249592002802023650000802051650002502059650001602084650001602100650001102116650001002127650002702137650001402164650002202178650001002200650001202210651001002222651001102232700001502243700001702258700001802275700002102293700001502314700001502329700001402344700001402358700003402372773012102406856007602527852000902603655001202612IND60780826020221120213305.0220623e20220620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078082602DNAL7 a10.3390/ani121215882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Dengjin 10aPrevalence and Evolution Analysis of Porcine Circovirus 3 in China from 2018 to 2022  aPorcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) is an emerging virus, causing substantial economic losses in pig populations, that was first detected in 2016. Furthermore, the virus has already been reported in Europe, the Americas, and Asia, including China, indicating that the virus has spread worldwide. However, the molecular epidemiology of PCV3 still needs further study. To investigate PCV3 epidemiological characteristics in China, 2707 serum samples of pigs were randomly collected from 17 provinces in China between September 2018 and March 2022 and analyzed via PCR assays. The study showed that PCV3 infection was prevalent in the overall population with 31.07% (841/2707) and 100.0% (17/17) at sample and province levels, respectively, though the positivity rate of PCV3 varied from 7.41 to 70.0% in different provinces, suggesting that PCV3 infection has a widespread distribution in China. We selected 22 serum samples from different regions that had high levels of viral DNA for amplification and sequenced their ORF2 (Cap) gene. According to the phylogenetic analysis, all isolates in the current study could be grouped into two separate subclades, with 15 strains belonging to clade 3a and 7 strains belonging to clade 3b, indicating that PCV3a and PCV3b were the predominant subtypes in the regions of China studied. Meanwhile, additional analysis revealed that the capsid gene sequences identified in this study displayed 97.46~99.8% nucleotide (nt) and 97.06~100% amino acid (aa) sequence similarity with other PCV3 available reference strains, respectively. In general, our studies provide important insights for understanding the prevalence and evolution of PCV3 in China and will guide future efforts to develop measures for preventing and controlling the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPorcine circovirus-3 3aamino acids 3ablood serum 3acapsid 3agenes 3amolecular epidemiology 3aphylogeny 3asequence homology 3aswine 3aviruses 3aChina 3aEurope1 aHuang, Yi 1 aGuo, Yating 1 aWang, Lihong 1 aZhang, Yongning 1 aZhou, Lei 1 aGe, Xinna 1 aHan, Jun 1 aGuo, Xin 1 aThīanchai ʻĪamwō̜ramēt,0 tAnimals.g2022 June 20, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani121215883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013700166520120000303592002801503650001201531650002301543650001401566650002201580650001801602650001901620650001901639650001101658650002601669650001901695653002601714653002301740653002101763653002901784700001501813700001501828700001901843700001901862700001601881773010801897856008602005852000902091655001202100IND60755079820221121161810.0220531e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075507982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1187932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Wenli10aNovel strategy for establishment of an FT-Raman spectroscopy based quantitative model for poplar holocellulose content determination  aRaman spectroscopy is effective for studying the ultrastructure, lignin content, and cellulose crystallinity of lignocellulosic materials. However, the quantitative analysis of holocellulose in lignocellulosic materials by this technique is challenging. In this study, based on Fourier-transform Raman (FT-Raman) spectroscopy, a novel strategy for building poplar holocellulose content quantitative model was proposed. Different algorithms were applied, including Principal component regression (PCR), partial least square regression (PLSR), ridge regression (RR), lasso regression (LR), and elastic net regression (ENR). Combined with different algorithms, twelve candidates of internal standard were selected. Sixty models combined by five regression algorithms and twelve internal standards were performed by five-fold cross validation. Consequently, the models constructed through RR, LR, and ENR combined with the internal standard of peak intensity of 2945 cm⁻¹ were credible (Rₚ > 0.9, RMSEₚ < 1.0, and MAEₚ < 0.9). Credible models were obtained, indicating the high potential of FT-Raman spectroscopy for predicting the holocellulose content of lignocellulosic materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3aleast squares 3alignin content 3alignocellulose 3amodels 3aquantitative analysis 3aultrastructure 0aHolocellulose content 0aRaman spectroscopy 0aPredictive model 0aRegularization algorithm1 aShu, Ding,1 aGuan, Ying1 aLing, Shengjie1 aLiu, Shengquan1 aZhou, Liang0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 277 p.118793-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1187933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009800158300001800256520208700274592002802361650002602389650001502415650001402430650001402444650002202458650001102480650002202491650002002513650001502533650000902548650001402557650002502571650001402596650002202610700001802632700002202650700001902672700001702691700001702708700002002725700001902745773009802764856007302862852000902935655001202944IND60480458320221119121508.0160127e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048045832DNAL7 a10.1890/13-0733.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOppel, Steffen10aAssessing population viability while accounting for demographic and environmental uncertainty  ap. 1809-1818.  aPredicting the future trend and viability of populations is an essential task in ecology. Because many populations respond to changing environments, uncertainty surrounding environmental responses must be incorporated into population assessments. However, understanding the effects of environmental variation on population dynamics requires information on several important demographic parameters that are often difficult to estimate. Integrated population models facilitate the integration of time series data on population size and all existing demographic information from a species, allowing the estimation of demographic parameters for which limited or no empirical data exist. Although these models are ideal for assessments of population viability, they have so far not included environmental uncertainty. We incorporated environmental variation in an integrated population model to account for both demographic and environmental uncertainty in an assessment of population viability. In addition, we used this model to estimate true juvenile survival, an important demographic parameter for population dynamics that is difficult to estimate empirically. We applied this model to assess the past and future population trend of a rare island endemic songbird, the Montserrat Oriole Icterus oberi, which is threatened by volcanic activity. Montserrat Orioles experienced lower survival in years with volcanic ashfall, causing periodic population declines that were compensated by higher seasonal fecundity in years with high pre‐breeding season rainfall. Due to the inclusion of both demographic and environmental uncertainty in the model, the estimated population growth rate in the immediate future was highly imprecise (95% credible interval 0.844–1.105), and the probability of extinction after three generations (in the year 2028) was low (2.1%). This projection demonstrates that accounting for both demographic and environmental sources of uncertainty provides a more realistic assessment of the viability of populations under unknown future environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental factors 3aextinction 3afecundity 3ajuveniles 3amodel uncertainty 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3aprediction 3arain 3asongbirds 3atime series analysis 3aviability 3avolcanic activity1 aHilton, Geoff1 aRatcliffe, Norman1 aFenton, Calvin1 aDaley, James1 aGray, Gerard1 aVickery, Juliet1 aGibbons, David0 tEcology.g2014 July, v. 95, no. 7 p.1809-1818dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-0733.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03870naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245012100207300001600328500001500344520200600359592002802365650001302393650001502406650002302421650002102444650001602465650002002481650001202501650000902513650001402522650001602536650002102552650002602573650001102599650001202610650002502622650001802647650002102665650001302686650000902699650001702708650001302725650001902738650002702757650001502784653001202799653001502811653001302826653001202839653002302851653001902874653001702893700002002910700002102930700002102951700002202972773013502994856008203129852000903211655001203220IND60526560920221120093624.0190408e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052656092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.etp.2015.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Sanket N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1674-711X10aComparison of taurine and pantoyltaurine as antioxidants in vitro and in the central nervous system of diabetic rats  ap. 103-112.  a2019-12-06  aThis study has comparatively evaluated the antiradical and antilipid peroxidizing actions of taurine (TAU) and its N-pantoyl analog pantoyltaurine (PTAU) in vitro, and has determined the extent to which these findings agree with the in vivo ability of these compounds to prevent changes in plasma glucose and in indices of oxidative stress in the plasma, brain and spinal cord induced by the diabetogen streptozotocin (STZ) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Using free radical-generating and oxidizing systems, PTAU was found more effective than TAU in scavenging DPPH, hydroxyl, peroxyl, and superoxide anion radicals and peroxynitrite, and in preventing lipid peroxidation of a brain homogenate by iron (III)-dopamine and the oxidation of dopamine by iron (III). On the other hand, when administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a 1.2mM/kg dose, 75min and 45min before a single i.p., 60mg/kg, dose of (STZ), TAU was about equipotent with PTAU in attenuating STZ-induced increases in glucose, malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO), and the loss of reduced glutathione (GSH) in plasma collected at 24h post STZ. Moreover, the analysis of concurrently collected brain and spinal cords samples revealed that both TAU and PTAU were able to equally reverse the increases in MDA and NO concentrations and to effectively counteract the decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio caused by STZ. Likewise, both compounds were very effective in preventing the losses of tissue catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities. A comparison of the results for spinal cord and for brain parts such as the cerebellum, cortex and brain stem suggested the existence of regional differences in antioxidant potency between TAU and PTAU, especially in terms of antioxidant enzymes. In general, differences in antiradical and antioxidant potencies between TAU and PTAU derived from in vitro test are not reliable indicators of the antioxidant potencies these compounds may subsequently manifest in a living organism.  aPublisher supplied data 3adopamine 3abrain stem 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aglutathione 3amalondialdehyde 3aglucose 3airon 3aoxidation 3aspinal cord 3asuperoxide anion 3aanimal disease models 3acortex 3ataurine 3asuperoxide dismutase 3ablood glucose 3ain vitro studies 3adiabetes 3arats 3anitric oxide 3acatalase 3astreptozotocin 3aglutathione peroxidase 3acerebellum 0aIn vivo 0aComparison 0aIn vitro 0aTaurine 0aAntioxidant action 0aPantoyltaurine 0aantioxidants1 aPandya, Kashyap1 aClark, George J.1 aParikh, Mitul C.1 aLau-Cam, Cesar A.0 tExperimental and toxicologic pathology.g2016 Feb.,  Mar., v. 68, no. 2-3 p.103-112dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11954x0940-29937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etp.2015.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245009000164520138600254592002801640650003001668650001201698650001001710650001001720650001801730650001001748650001901758650001501777650001001792650001301802650001001815650001101825650001101836650001001847651001401857651001101871651001601882651001701898651001801915700002501933700001801958773012101976856007602097852000902173655001202182IND60780826120221120213307.0220623e20220620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078082612DNAL7 a10.3390/ani121215902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUzal, Francisco A.10aYellow Lamb Disease (Clostridium perfringens Type A Enterotoxemia of Sheep): A Review  aYellow lamb disease is an infrequent disease in sheep for which there is scant literature, and that has been reported in the US, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Europe, although anecdotal evidence indicates that it may have also been diagnosed in South America. The disease is produced by some strains of Clostridium perfringens type A that produce unusually high levels of alpha- toxin. Because C. perfringens type A is ubiquitous and is found in the intestine of most clinically healthy sheep, diagnosis of yellow lamb disease is challenging and requires quantitating the amount of this microorganism present in feces and/or intestinal content. Clinically, yellow lamb disease is characterized by depression, anemia, icterus and hemoglobinuria. Occasionally, sudden death may occur. Gross findings include generalized icterus, red urine in the bladder, enlarged, pale, and friable spleen, enlarged liver with an acinar pattern, and dark, swollen kidneys. Microscopically, yellow lamb disease is characterized by centrilobular necrosis of the liver, hemoglobinuria-associated acute tubular injury, splenic congestion, pulmonary congestion and edema. Although there are no vaccines specifically designed to prevent yellow lamb disease, several vaccines against the different types of C. perfringens may afford at least some level of protection against yellow lamb disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium perfringens A 3abladder 3adeath 3aedema 3aenterotoxemia 3afeces 3ahemoglobinuria 3aintestines 3aliver 3anecrosis 3asheep 3aspleen 3atoxins 3aurine 3aAustralia 3aEurope 3aNew Zealand 3aSouth Africa 3aSouth America1 aGiannitti, Federico 1 aAsin, Javier 0 tAnimals.g2022 June 20, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani121215903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006000164300001600224500001900240520146300259592002801722650000901750650001201759650001601771650001401787650001201801650001301813650000901826700002001835700002601855700002301881700001901904773010201923856008102025852000902106655001202115IND50073143020221122041134.0150213e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007314302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-013-1451-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBokor, Boris10aSilicon does not always mitigate zinc toxicity in maize  ap. 733-743.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe have investigated the influence of silicon on higher zinc concentration reducing the growth of aboveground parts by ca 50 % in young maize plants (hybrid Novania) grown in hydroponics. Eight different treatments were used: control, Zn (800 μM ZnSO₄·7H₂O), Si1/Si2.5/Si5 (1/2.5/5 mM Na₂SiO₇) and Zn+Si (combination of zinc and all silicon concentrations). The concentration of Zn and Si and their distribution in plants was determined. The growth parameters (length of primary seminal root, leaf area of first and second leaves, fresh and dry weight of below- and above-ground plant parts) of plants grown in various Zn+Si treatments were significantly decreased in comparison to all other treatments. Increasing concentration of Si in combination with Zn treatment and selected hybrid (Novania) resulted in increased physiological stress in comparison to Zn treatment. However, roots and shoots of all Zn+Si treated plants contained significantly lower amount of Zn than Zn treatment. The Si concentration in roots was the same in Si and Zn+Si plants. In general, higher amount of Si was observed in shoots than in roots of Si1- and Si2.5-treated plants and opposite was observed in Si5-treated plants. In spite of significantly decreased root and shoot accumulation of Zn in the presence of Si, no positive effect of Si on Zn toxicity in young maize plants under experimental conditions used in this work and used maize hybrid was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3ahybrids 3ahydroponics 3aleaf area 3asilicon 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aVaculík, Marek1 aSlováková, Ľudmila1 aMasarovič, Daniel1 aLux, Alexander0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2014 Mar., v. 36, no. 3 p.733-743dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-013-1451-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04150naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006100155245017700216300001600393520208500409592002802494650002402522650002802546650002402574650001002598650001202608650001602620650001102636650001002647650001102657650003302668650002002701650001802721650001602739650001502755650001402770650003002784650001202814650001702826650001002843650001002853650001202863651002502875651001002900653002402910653002602934653002402960653002802984653001703012653001703029653001003046700001703056700001303073700001703086700002203103700005703125700002503182700002103207700001603228700001403244700001703258773007903275856008903354852000903443655001203452IND60556310320221120230136.0170710e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055631032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2016.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBravo-Barriga, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3481-731010aDetection of Leishmania DNA and blood meal sources in phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) in western of Spain: Update on distribution and risk factors associated  ap. 414-424.  aLeishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is present in Mediterranean countries, with high prevalence in areas of the center and south of Spain. However, in some regions such as Extremadura (in southwest of Spain), data has not been updated since 1997. The aim of this work was (i) to provide information about the distribution of phlebotomine sand fly species in western of Spain (Extremadura region), (ii) to determine risk factors for the presence of sand fly vectors and (iii) to detect Leishmania DNA and identify blood meal sources in wild caught females.During 2012–2013, sand flies were surveyed using CDC miniature light-traps in 13 of 20 counties in Extremadura. Specimens were identified morphologically and females were used for molecular detection of Leishmania DNA by kDNA, ITS-1 and cyt-B. In addition, blood meals origins were analyzed by a PCR based in vertebrate cyt b gene.A total of 1083 sand flies of both gender were captured and identified. Five species were collected, Phlebotomus perniciosus (60.76%), Sergentomyia minuta (29.92%), P. ariasi (7.11%), P. papatasi (1.48%) and P. sergenti (0.74%). The last three species constitute the first report in Badajoz, the most southern province of Extremadura region. Leishmania DNA was detected in three out of 435 females (one P. pernicious and two S. minuta). Characterization of obtained DNA sequences by phylogenetic analyses revealed close relatedness with Leishmania tarentolae in S. minuta and L. infantum in P. perniciosus. Haematic preferences showed a wide range of hosts, namely: swine, humans, sheep, rabbits, horses, donkeys and turkeys.The simultaneous presence of P. perniciosus and P. ariasi vectors, the analysis of blood meals, together with the detection of L. infantum and in S. minuta of L. tarentolae, confirms the ideal conditions for the transmission of this parasitosis in the western of Spain. These results improve the epidemiological knowledge of leishmaniosis and its vectors in this part of Spain, highlighting the need for ongoing entomological and parasitological surveillance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania infantum 3aPhlebotomus perniciosus 3aSergentomyia minuta 3aasses 3afemales 3ahematophagy 3ahorses 3ahosts 3ahumans 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3akinetoplast DNA 3aleishmaniasis 3alight traps 3amonitoring 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arabbits 3arisk factors 3asheep 3aswine 3aturkeys 3aMediterranean region 3aSpain 0aLeishmania infantum 0aLeishmania tarentolae 0aSergentomyia minuta 0aPhlebotomus perniciosus 0aBlood source 0aRisk factors 0aSpain1 aParreira, R.1 aMaia, C.1 aAfonso, M.O.1 aBlanco-Ciudad, J.1 aSerrano, F.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4335-54211 aPérez-Martín, J.E.1 aGómez-Gordo, L.1 aCampino, L.1 aReina, D.1 aFrontera, E.0 tActa tropica.g2016 Dec., v. 164 p.414-424dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2016.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013100169300001600300520191700316592002802233653003102261653001102292653002202303653002302325653001702348653001902365700001802384700001602402700001402418700002102432700001502453700002202468700001802490700002002508773012902528856008402657852000902741655001202750IND60596289820221123021043.0180618e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059628982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dental.2018.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Kunneng10aLong-term dentin remineralization by poly(amido amine) and rechargeable calcium phosphate nanocomposite after fluid challenges  ap. 607-618.  aPrevious studies investigated short-term dentin remineralization; studies on long-term dentin remineralization after fluid challenges mimicking fluids in oral environment are lacking. The objective of this study was to develop a long-term remineralization method to via poly(amido amine) (PAMAM) and rechargeable composite containing nanoparticles of amorphous calcium phosphate (NACP) after fluid challenges for the first time.NACP composite was immersed at pH 4 to exhaust its calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) ions, and then recharged with Ca and P ions, to test the remineralization of the exhausted and recharged NACP composite. Dentin was acid-etched with 37% phosphoric acid. Four groups were prepared: (1) dentin control, (2) dentin with PAMAM, (3) dentin with the recharged NACP composite, and (4) dentin with PAMAM plus recharged NACP composite. PAMAM-coated dentin was immersed in phosphate-buffered saline with shaking for 72 days, because there is fluid flow in the mouth which could potentially detach the PAMAM from dentin. Specimens were treated with a cyclic artificial saliva/lactic acid regimen for 35 days.After 72days of immersion plus shaking, the PAMAM still successfully fulfilled its mineralization nucleation. The recharged NACP composite still provided acid-neutralization and ion re-release, which did not decrease with increasing the number of recharge cycles. The immersed-PAMAM plus NACP achieved complete dentin remineralization and restored the hardness to that of healthy dentin.In conclusion, superior long-term remineralization of the PAMAM plus NACP method was demonstrated for the first time. The immersed-PAMAM plus recharged NACP completely remineralized the pre-demineralized dentin, even after prolonged fluid-challenge similar to that in oral environment. The novel PAMAM plus NACP composite method is promising to provide long-term tooth protection and caries inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLong-term remineralization 0aDentin 0aPoly(amido amine) 0aNACP nanocomposite 0aIon recharge 0aAcid challenge1 aXiao, Shimeng1 aWu, Junling1 aLi, Jiyao1 aWeir, Michael D.1 aCheng, Lei1 aReynolds, Mark A.1 aZhou, Xuedong1 aXu, Hockin H.K.0 tDental materials.g2018 Apr., v. 34 p.607-618dElsevier LtdaThe Academy of Dental MaterialswJournal:26790x0109-56417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dental.2018.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010300164300001600267500001900283520147900302592002801781650002601809650002001835650001601855650001101871650002401882650001501906650001101921650002001932650001401952650001701966650001201983650001101995700001602006700001402022700001502036700001602051700001502067773010202082856008102184852000902265655001202274IND50073143120221122041041.0150213e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007314312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-013-1452-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChai, Minwei10aGrowth and physiological responses to copper stress in a halophyte Spartina alterniflora (Poaceae)  ap. 745-754.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA study quantifying the effects of different copper (Cu) concentrations (50, 200, 800 and 1,000 mg kg⁻¹Cu) on Cu bioaccumulation and physiological responses of Spartina alterniflora was conducted. Plant biomass and Cu accumulation were determined. Plant height, tiller number, chlorophyll, leaf electrolyte leakage rate (ELR), malondialdehyde (MDA), proline, soluble sugar, and organic acids were also measured. The results showed that S. alterniflora mainly accumulated Cu in fine roots. No significant changes of biomass of fine roots were detected except for obvious reduction under 1,000 mg kg⁻¹Cu. In leaves, rhizomes and fine roots, the highest Cu accumulations were detected under 800 mg kg⁻¹Cu. The highest Cu accumulation in stem was revealed under 200 mg kg⁻¹Cu. Plant height decreased under 1,000 mg kg⁻¹Cu; chlorophyll content reduced under >50 mg kg⁻¹Cu; levels of ELR and MDA increased under >200 mg kg⁻¹Cu. However, osmotic components such as proline and soluble sugar were accumulated to cope with higher Cu stresses (800 and 1,000 mg kg⁻¹). Further, oxalic and citric acids were positively related with Cu contents in leaves and stems, suggesting that oxalic and citric acids may be related to Cu detoxification in aboveground parts of S. alterniflora. However, in above and belowground parts, no detoxification function of ascorbic and fumaric acids was observed due to unchanged or decreased trend under Cu stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpartina alterniflora 3abioaccumulation 3achlorophyll 3acopper 3aelectrolyte leakage 3ahalophytes 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3aphytomass 3aplant height 3aproline 3asugars1 aShi, Fuchen1 aLi, Ruili1 aQiu, Guoyu1 aLiu, Fuchun1 aLiu, Limin0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2014 Mar., v. 36, no. 3 p.745-754dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-013-1452-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245013200168300001400300520136100314592002801675650001601703650001401719650001301733650001501746650002301761650001101784650001401795650001101809650001101820650001101831650001601842650001501858651001101873651001801884773012901902856007902031852000902110655001202119IND60515778620221120161934.0160320e20121017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051577862DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2012-02702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLacroix, Gilles L.10aMigratory strategies of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) postsmolts and implications for marine survival of endangered populations  ap. 32-48.  aThe migration of wild and hatchery Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) postsmolts of different origins was monitored using ultrasonic tags and arrays of acoustic receivers across the Bay of Fundy (BoF), Canada. Postsmolts from outer BoF populations migrated rapidly into the Gulf of Maine (GoM) and did not return, and most were classified as distant migrants (77%–100%). In contrast, postsmolts from inner BoF populations were usually classified as coastal migrants that returned to the BoF for the summer (30%–90%). They used well-defined migration corridors, close to shore, associated with prevailing surface currents. An Akaike information criterion (AIC) evaluation of migration models identified region and watershed, date of river exit, and migration speed as important predictive variables for coastal residency. A late or slow migration increased residency, as did delaying hatchery releases. The BoF provided returning postsmolts with a summer thermal refuge (8–14 °C) encircled by warm water (>20 °C), but extended residency in this coastal habitat increased exposure to sources of mortality absent further at sea. This reduced marine survival of inner BoF salmon to almost nothing. It is likely that the different migratory strategies of inner and outer BoF salmon populations influenced their relative marine survival and endangered status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aacoustics 3ahabitats 3ahatcheries 3amigratory behavior 3amodels 3amortality 3arivers 3asalmon 3asummer 3aultrasonics 3awatersheds 3aCanada 3aGulf of Maine0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2012 Oct. 17, v. 70, no. 1 p.32-48dNRC Research Pressx1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2012-02703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009500167520103000262592002801292650004401320650003701364650002501401650001601426650002201442650001101464650001301475650002201488650000701510650001501517650001501532650002301547650001401570650001101584650001401595653001101609653002001620653002701640653002501667700001601692700001401708700001501722700001801737700001401755700001401769773010801783856008601891852000901977655001201986IND60755080020221122055132.0220531e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075508002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1188032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Menghan10aPreparation and structural properties of starch phosphate modified by alkaline phosphatase  aIn this study, a method for the synthesis of starch phosphate using the transferase properties of alkaline phosphatase was explored. Maize starch was treated with a pyrophosphate solution containing alkaline phosphatase and catalytic ions under pH 8 at 37 °C. The synthesis of starch phosphate was evaluated and compared with untreated and treated starch controls. The phosphorus content of the samples increased up to 8500% with the catalytic ion concentration, whereas the peak viscosity by up to 41.4% decreased. The crystallinity and enthalpy of the phosphorylated samples were reduced by up to 26.8% and 23.3%, respectively; however, no significant was observed by Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer. The roughness of the starch surface and the distribution of elemental phosphorus were observed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive Spectrometry. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry results further indicated the grafting of the phosphate radical.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acorn starch 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3amass spectrometry 3apH 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus content 3aroughness 3astarch 3aviscosity 0aStarch 0aPhosphorylation 0aEnzymatic modification 0aAlkaline phosphatase1 aLi, Yanning1 aLi, Jinge1 aXu, Shuang1 aGu, Zhengbiao1 aCheng, Li1 aHong, Yan0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 276 p.118803-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1188033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245014800213300001200361506007600373520163600449592002802085506003702113650001002150650002302160650001802183650001102201650001902212650002102231650000902252650001202261650002102273650001102294650001502305650002702320650001302347651001202360651001202372651001202384651001002396651001102406651001302417651001602430700001802446700002102464700002202485700002002507773011302527856008202640852000902722655001202731IND60626195420221207133443.0191016e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062619542DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-018-3199-42doi7 aPMC62960352pmcid7 a305586602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPfitzner, Wolf Peter10aFirst record and morphological characterization of an established population of Aedes (Hulecoeteomyia) koreicus (Diptera: Culicidae) in Germany  ap. 662.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The East Asian mosquito species Aedes koreicus was recorded out of its native range for the first time in Belgium in 2008. Since then, several other European populations or single individuals have been observed throughout Europe with reports from Italy, Switzerland, European Russia, Slovenia, Germany and Hungary. The Italian population seems to be the only one that is expanding rapidly, so the Swiss population very likely derives from it. RESULTS: In a surveillance program for invasive mosquito species, a single larva of Ae. koreicus was found in a cemetery vase in 2016 in the city of Wiesbaden, Germany. In the following year the finding was confirmed and an established population could be proven over an area of about 50 km². The morphological identification of the first larva was confirmed by sequencing of a region within the nad4 sequence. A study of adult females showed that the morphological characteristics of this population are not identical to the populations from Belgium and Italy. The eggs and larvae were found together with Aedes j. japonicus in the same breeding sites and ovitraps, as well as with other indigenous mosquito species such as Culex pipiens/Culex torrentium, Aedes geniculatus and Anopheles plumbeus. CONCLUSIONS: Since the newly discovered population in Germany shows different morphological characteristics to the populations in Belgium and Italy, it seems to originate from an independent introduction. It remains unknown how the introduction took place. A further spread similar to the one in northern Italy can be assumed for the future due to similar climatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes 3aAnopheles plumbeus 3aCulex pipiens 3aadults 3abreeding sites 3aclimatic factors 3aeggs 3afemales 3ainvasive species 3alarvae 3amonitoring 3anew geographic records 3aovitraps 3aBelgium 3aGermany 3aHungary 3aItaly 3aRussia 3aSlovenia 3aSwitzerland1 aLehner, Alice1 aHoffmann, Daniel1 aCzajka, Christina1 aBecker, Norbert0 tParasites & vectors.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.662-662dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-3199-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245019500175520184500370592002802215650002302243650002302266650002602289650002502315650001202340650001002352650001802362650001402380650001502394650002702409650001002436650001002446650002602456650002102482650001902503650001802522650003102540650001402571650001002585650001802595650001402613651002502627653002402652653001502676653001202691653002602703653003202729700002902761773009902790856008502889852000902974655001202983IND60666106220221118050659.0200210e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066610622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2019.1049522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMantzoukas, Spiridon14aThe effect of three entomopathogenic endophytes of the sweet sorghum on the growth and feeding performance of its pest, Sesamia nonagrioides larvae, and their efficacy under field conditions  aSesamia nonagrioides, commonly known as the Mediterranean corn stalk borer, is one of the most important pests of the sweet sorghum in the circum Mediterranean countries. In the present study, the feeding performance of larvae, post treatment with the entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium robertsii and Isaria fumosorosea, was first evaluated in laboratory experiments. The efficacy of the three entomopathogens in protecting the sorghum from its pest was then examined in a tritrophic field experiment in a farm, under natural conditions. The fungi, efficiently induced the mortality of larvae and reduced their relative growth rate (RGR), with the virulence of I. fumosorosea being relatively higher (90–93%). The feeding performance of larvae was significantly affected by the three entomopathogens. Reduced food consumption (39–64%), relative food consumption rate (15–38%) and the feces produced (48–81%) compared to untreated larvae, resulted in slight changes of digestibility. The weight of treated larvae remained almost unchanged while ECD and ECI increased in infected larvae compared to control. The infected larvae were also sluggish and static, and unwieldy on the food surface. The impact of infection should be rather attributed to their altered behaviour than to disturbed digestion. The tritrophic field experiment confirmed the efficacy of entomopathogens which were experimentally introduced into the plants as endophytes, against larvae of S.nonagrioides under natural conditions. In fact, they reduced infestation by 20–30% and the tunnelling length by 19–43%, and increased larval mortality by 57–82%, without affecting sorghum growth. Consequently, the three fungi could be used for the control of S. nonagrioides in sorghum crops, at least in areas with a Mediterranean-like climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aIsaria fumosorosea 3aMetarhizium robertsii 3aSesamia nonagrioides 3aclimate 3acrops 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3aendophytes 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3afarms 3afeces 3afield experimentation 3afood consumption 3ainsect control 3ainsect larvae 3alaboratory experimentation 3amortality 3apests 3asweet sorghum 3avirulence 3aMediterranean region 0aFeeding performance 0aStem borer 0aSorghum 0aFungal entomopathogen 0aTritrophic field experiment1 aGrammatikopoulos, George0 tCrop protection.g2020 Jan., v. 127 p.104952-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2019.1049523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04367naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245015700161520257700318592002802895650001802923650001502941650002502956650002702981650001603008650001503024650001303039650002003052650002403072650001303096650001303109650002003122650001203142650002703154650002203181650001003203650001303213650002103226650003003247650001203277650002603289650001603315650001003331650002003341650001403361650001703375650002003392650002503412700002003437700001703457700002003474700001803494700001803512700001703530773012103547856007603668852000903744655001203753IND60780826320221120221456.0220623e20220620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078082632DNAL7 a10.3390/ani121215912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Weiguang 10aEffects of Dietary Fucoidan Supplementation on Serum Biochemical Parameters, Small Intestinal Barrier Function, and Cecal Microbiota of Weaned Goat Kids  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of fucoidan supplementation on serum biochemical parameters, small intestinal barrier function, and cecal microbiota of weaned goat kids. A total of 60 2-month-old weaned castrated male goat kids (Chuanzhong black goat) were used in this 30-day experiment. The goat kids were randomly divided into four groups: a control group (CON) fed the basal diet, and three other groups supplemented with 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5% fucoidan in the basal diet (denoted as F1, F2, and F3 groups, respectively). The results indicated that dietary fucoidan supplementation decreased (p < 0.05) the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the content of glucose (GLU) as measured on day 15. As measured on day 30, dietary fucoidan increased (p < 0.05) the content of total protein (TP) and decreased the activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and supplementation with 0.3% and 0.5% fucoidan decreased (p < 0.05) the activity of LDH. Dietary fucoidan decreased (p < 0.05) the content of D-lactic acid (D-LA) and the activity of diamine oxidase (DAO). Dietary fucoidan increased (p < 0.05) the activity of catalase (CAT) in the duodenum. Dietary 0.3% and 0.5% fucoidan enhanced (p < 0.05) the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the ileum, the activity of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) in the jejunum and ileum, and the activity of CAT in the ileum. Dietary 0.3% and 0.5% fucoidan reduced the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum and the content of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) in the duodenum. Dietary fucoidan increased (p < 0.05) the content of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in the duodenum. Supplementation of 0.3% and 0.5% fucoidan upregulated (p < 0.05) the gene expression of ZO-1 and claudin-1 in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, and dietary supplementation of 0.3% and 0.5% fucoidan upregulated (p < 0.05) the gene expression of occludin in the jejunum and ileum. The 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing results showed that at the phylum level, dietary fucoidan increased (p < 0.05) the abundance of Bacteroidetes while decreasing (p < 0.05) the abundance of Firmicutes. At the genus level, dietary 0.3% and 0.5% fucoidan increased (p < 0.05) the abundances of Unspecified_Ruminococcaceae, Unspecified_Bacteroidale, Unspecified_Clostridiales, and Akkermansia. In conclusion, dietary fucoidan supplementation had positive effects on intestinal permeability, antioxidant capacity, immunity function, tight junctions, and the cecal microflora balance in weaned goat kids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aFirmicutes 3aantioxidant activity 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acastration 3acatalase 3adiamine oxidase 3adietary supplements 3aduodenum 3afucoidan 3agene expression 3aglucose 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aileum 3aimmunity 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ajejunum 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alactic acid 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3aoccludins 3apermeability 3aprotein content 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aGuo, Guangzhen 1 aChen, Jiayi 1 aWang, Shengnan 1 aGao, Zhenhua 1 aZhao, Zhihui 1 aYin, Fuquan 0 tAnimals.g2022 June 20, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani121215913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245015500166500001900321520143500340592002801775650001701803650001401820650001901834650002201853650001101875650002201886650001301908650001401921650000701935650002201942650002101964650001301985650001301998650001002011653000702021653001002028653002002038653002102058653003302079700001602112700005502128700005902183700005702242700001802299700001902317773009702336856008502433852000902518655001202527IND60708726820221120141847.0210401e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070872682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2020.1163362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Wenlei10aKinetic and mechanistic insights into the abatement of clofibric acid by integrated UV/ozone/peroxydisulfate process: A modeling and theoretical study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe feasibility of integrated UV/ozone (O₃)/peroxydisulfate (PDS) process for abatement of clofibric acid (CA) was systematically explored in this study with focus on the kinetic simulation and oxidation mechanisms. The results indicated the UV/O₃/PDS process was of prominent treatment capability with pseudo-first-order rate constant of CA degradation increased by 65.9% and 86.0% compared to UV/O₃ and UV/PDS processes, respectively. A chemical kinetic model was developed and successfully employed to predict CA elimination as well as the specific contributions of UV, hydroxyl radical (•OH) and sulfate radical (SO₄•⁻) under different PDS dosage, pH, natural organic matters, bicarbonate and chloride conditions in UV/O₃/PDS process. According to quantum chemical calculation, radical addition on ortho site of isopropoxy substituent and single electron transfer were corroborated to be the dominant reaction channels for the oxidation of CA by •OH and SO₄•⁻, respectively. Additionally, the reactive sites and transformation pathways of CA were proposed via Fukui function calculation and UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis. Moreover, the performance of UV/O₃/PDS process was further evaluated with regard to the energy demand and bromate formation. This study first proposed a kinetic model in UV/O₃/PDS process and elucidated the regioselectivity and products distribution of CA during oxidative treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abicarbonates 3achlorides 3aclofibric acid 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3ahydroxyl radicals 3akinetics 3aoxidation 3apH 3aquantum mechanics 3aregioselectivity 3aresearch 3asulfates 3awater 0aUV 0aOzone 0aPeroxydisulfate 0aKinetic modeling 0aQuantum chemical calculation1 aLin, Zhuang1 aDong, Huiyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5955-62281 aYuan, Xiangjuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8257-171X1 aQiang, Zhimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6555-33811 aLiu, Shaogang1 aXia, Dongsheng0 tWater research.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 186 p.116336-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1163363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003100166245014400197300001800341520146000359592002801819650002301847650001101870650001601881650002001897650001001917650001901927650002401946650001901970650002901989650002602018650003102044650001702075650003402092650002602126650004202152650004402194650002702238650001502265650008002280650001902360650002702379700002002406700002402426700002902450773011602479856004802595852000902643655001202652IND50067216820221118173655.0130618e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006721682DNAL7 a235638852pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-013-4862-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatcher, Gwynneth Felicity10aComplex pathways for regulation of pyrimidine metabolism by carbon catabolite repression and quorum sensing in Pseudomonas putida RU-KM3S    ap. 5993-6007.  aPseudomonads are metabolically versatile microbes that employ complex regulatory networks to control gene expression, particularly with respect to carbon and nitrogen metabolism. The aim of this study was to characterise the regulatory networks that control pyrimidine metabolism (hydantoin-hydrolysing activity) in Pseudomonas putida strain RU-KM3S, focussing on transcriptional activation of dihydropyrimidinase (Dhp) and β-ureidopropionase (Bup), encoding dhp and bup, respectively. The two genes are arranged divergently on the chromosome and are separated by ORF1, encoding a putative transporter, which lies upstream of and in the same orientation as bup. The results from this study reveal that pyrimidine metabolism, as a function of Bup and Dhp activity in P. putida RU-KM3S, is controlled by a complex regulatory network including several global pathways in addition to induction by the substrate. Three major control pathways act at the level of transcriptional and include: (1) induction of transcriptional activation in the presence of hydantoin, (2) carbon catabolite repression mediated via a pathway independent of Crc and (3) quorum sensing that does not require a putative lux box located upstream of the dhp transcriptional start. Finally, the data suggest a minor role for the global regulators Anr, Vfr and Crc, likely through regulation of the activity of transcription factors interacting directly with the bup/ORF1–dhp promoter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas putida 3acarbon 3achromosomes 3agene expression 3agenes 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen metabolism 3aquorum sensing 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 3atransporters 2aAmidohydrolasesxbiosynthesis 2aCatabolite Repression 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aHydantoinsxmetabolism 2aHydrolysis 2aPseudomonas putidaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aQuorum Sensing 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aJiwaji, Meesbah1 ade la Mare, Jo-Anne1 aDorrington, Rosemary Ann0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2013 July, v. 97, no. 13 p.5993-6007dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-4862-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03587naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245010700170300001600277520215200293592002802445650001502473650001402488650001302502650001002515650002302525650001502548650001502563650002202578650001202600650001902612650001802631650002502649650002302674651001102697653000802708653000902716653000802725653000702733653000902740653002802749653001102777653002302788653001302811653001302824700002002837700002302857773007902880856008902959852000903048655001203057IND60556310520221121030903.0170710e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055631052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2016.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiow, Eric10aHow unlicensed drug vendors in rural Uganda perceive their role in the management of childhood malaria  ap. 455-462.  aA large number of caregivers in Uganda rely on the private drug delivery sector to manage childhood illnesses such as malaria. In rural settings where the formal private sector is scarce, unlicensed retail drug outlets are an important initial source of care for households. Despite their abundance, little is known about them. This study explores unlicensed retail drug outlet vendors’ perceptions of their practice and social environment in one rural district of Uganda.A qualitative design using semi-structured interviews was conducted with vendors from unlicensed retail drug outlets across all 10 sub-counties of Butaleja District. The study was conducted over a six-week period in 2011. Open-ended questions were used to gain insight into participants’ perspectives, and data were analyzed using acceptable qualitative research protocols.Interviews were carried out with 75 vendors by trained local research assistants. Most vendors operated out of drug shops, just over half were both owners and shop attendants, and only 14% had qualifications to apply for operating a licensed drug shop. Vendors’ experiences with managing malaria in children aged five and under in their community revealed five major themes, their perceptions of: 1) their role in the community, 2) their ability to manage uncomplicated malaria in young children, 3) the challenges of day-to-day operations, 4) the effect of regulatory policies on their ability to serve their communities, and 5) the prospect of future training programs. While the literature has raised concerns regarding the quality of care provided at such unlicensed outlets, most vendors in this study had a limited awareness of their deficiencies.There was a general sentiment among vendors that the public health system within Butaleja was failing the community and their presence was filling an important vacuum. Given the dominance of unlicensed retail drug outlets over their formal (licensed) counterparts in many rural settings, further deliberations and research is critical to determine how best to fit in and create value from the unlicensed sector within the formal health system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaregivers 3achildhood 3achildren 3adrugs 3aeducation programs 3ahouseholds 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3amalaria 3aprivate sector 3apublic health 3aqualitative analysis 3asocial environment 3aUganda 0aACT 0aiCCM 0aCHW 0aDV 0aAMFm 0aUnlicensed drug vendors 0aUganda 0aMalaria management 0aInformal 0aTraining1 aKassam, Rosemin1 aSekiwunga, Richard0 tActa tropica.g2016 Dec., v. 164 p.455-462dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2016.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02048naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245010700132300001600239520089000255592002801145650002301173650002201196650000901218650001301227650001601240650001101256650001601267650002401283650001401307650001201321650001401333650001001347653001701357653001301374653002901387653001501416653001401431700002101445700001701466700001801483773010401501852000901605655001201614IND60706099220221120030514.0200807e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070609922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaut, Ankush H.10aResistance Mechanism of Sorghum Genotypes Against Shootfly, Atherigona Soccata, Rodani in Rabi Sorghum  ap. 542-546.  aField studies under different population pressure of shootfly (Atherigona soccata), showed that the genotypes RSV 1098, RSV 1188 and RSV 1151 were promising for shootfly resistance and recorded the lowest mean number of eggs per plant and mean percentage of dead hearts at 28 DAE which indicated oviposition non-preference as primary mechanism of resistance.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a notifiable parasitic disease that increased in incidence in Morocco over the past few years and has recently emerged in several new foci, causing a public health problem in Morocco. The aim of this study is to describe the spatio-temporal distribution of VL in Morocco between 1990 and 2014 period in order to highlight important features and trends of VL and its epidemiology and to assess whether the activity of the unit reflects the situation of the disease at the national level and whether it could constitute an indicator of public health relevance. Two thousand four hundred and twenty one cases were reported in Morocco between 1990 and 2014 with an average annual reported incidence rate of 0.4 cases per 100.000 inhabitants. Before 1996 the average annual incidence of VL was 50 cases on average. After this date the number of cases increased and then remained stable with around 100–150 cases per year. Children whose age varies between 1 and 4 years old are the most affected with 1327 (74%) of total cases; nevertheless the adult starts to be affected by the disease. In 2000, 65% of positive cases of VL are concentrated at both northern regions: Taza-Al Hoceima- Taounate with 45% of cases, Tanger- Tetouan mainly represented by Chefchaoun with 20% of cases. The Fez-Boulemane region located in the center recorded 12% of cases. Throughout the years the map VL distribution has been progressively changed and spatial spread of the disease to the center is noted in 2007. 2014 has been marked by an even greater extension of the disease to the center and south of Morocco. Nationally in 2014, 34 of 75 provinces and prefectures are affected compared to 2000, when 22 out of 82 provinces and prefectures were affected. Leishmania infantum was identified the causative agent based on species- specific PCR-Lei70 assay. VL remains a sporadically endemic parasitic disease in Morocco with a progressive extension of its range of distribution. Such a situation would relate to the geographical succession of Phlebotomine sand fly vectors, the difficulty of actions against the canine population reservoirs of L. infantum and unfavorable socio-economic factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania infantum 3aPhlebotominae 3aadults 3abasins 3achildren 3adogs 3aepidemiology 3apublic health 3asocioeconomic factors 3avisceral leishmaniasis 3aMorocco 0aVisceral leishmaniasis 0aL. infantum 0aEpidemiology 0aPCR- Lei70 0aMorocco 0aPhlebotomine sand flies1 aFellah, Hajiba1 aAmarir, Fatima1 aEt-touys, Abdeslamd1 aBekhti, Khadija1 aAdlaoui, El Bachir1 aBakri, Youssef1 aNhammi, Haddou1 aSadak, Abderrahim1 aSebti, Faiza0 tActa tropica.g2017 June, v. 170 p.169-177dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2016.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100006000188245012500248300001300373506007600386520109900462592002801561596004401589506003701633650002301670650001201693650002101705650002201726650001301748650001101761650001301772651001101785700002001796700002801816700002201844700003301866700002001899700002501919700001701944700003901961700001702000700002102017700002002038700001702058700001802075773010002093856008102193852000902274655001202283IND60626195620221207124136.0181218e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062619562DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-018-1046-72doi7 aPMC62971092pmcid7 a295726072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEriksson, Louise1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6673-007910aInvasive forest pathogens in Europe: Cross-country variation in public awareness but consistency in policy acceptability  ap. 1-12.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolitical action can reduce introductions of diseases caused by invasive forest pathogens (IPs) and public support is important for effective prevention. The public’s awareness of IP problems and the acceptability of policies aiming to combat these pathogens were surveyed in nine European countries (N = 3469). Although awareness of specific diseases (e.g., ash dieback) varied, problem awareness and policy acceptability were similar across countries. The public was positive towards policies for informational measures and stricter standards for plant production, but less positive towards restricting public access to protected areas. Multilevel models, including individual and country level variables, revealed that media exposure was positively associated with awareness of IP problems, and strengthened the link between problem awareness and policy acceptability. Results suggest that learning about IPs through the media and recognizing the associated problems increase policy acceptability. Overall, the study elaborates on the anthropogenic dimension of diseases caused by IPs.  aPublisher supplied data  aBiodivERsAcSeventh Framework Programme0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconservation areas 3adieback 3aforest pathogens 3aissues and policy 3alearning 3amodels 3apolitics 3aEurope1 aBoberg, Johanna1 aCech, Th.q(Thomas L.),1 aCorcobado, Tamara1 aDesprez-Loustau, Marie-Laure1 aHietala, Ari M.1 aJung, Marília Horta1 aJung, Thomas1 aLehtijarvi, Hatice Tuğba Doğmuş1 aOskay, Funda1 aSlavov, Slavtcho1 aSolheim, Halvor1 aStenlid, Jan1 aOliva, Jonàs0 tAmbio.g2019 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.1-12dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28633x0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-018-1046-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008700156300001800243520156200261592002801823650002601851650001101877650001101888650002401899650001301923650001401936650001501950650001301965650001501978650002101993650001802014650002102032650001902053650001902072650001402091650001002105650001002115650000902125650001302134651001002147700001802157700001702175773009802192856007302290852000902363655001202372IND60480458820221119121418.0160127e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048045882DNAL7 a10.1890/13-2283.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhengjie10aRecruitment and herbivory affect spread of invasive Spartina alterniflora in China  ap. 1972-1980.  aHow multiple factors interact to mediate the spread of invasive species is poorly understood. We studied cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, which is invading the entire Chinese coast, occupying mudflats throughout this range, and displacing mangroves in the upper intertidal of southern China. For two years, we studied the roles of propagule pressure, competition, disturbance, and herbivory in the dynamics of this invasion at a typical mangrove habitat, Zhangjiang Estuary, southern China. Seed of cordgrass dispersed to all intertidal habitats. The density of seeds in surficial soils was 20‐fold greater in cordgrass than in dense mangrove, the ecotone between mangrove and cordgrass, or the open mudflat. Seed predation or herbivory on seedlings was intense in all habitats. While seeds of cordgrass germinated in all habitats, no unprotected seedlings survived anywhere except on the mudflat in our two‐year study. Survival was nil in other habitats where seed predation, herbivory, and shading by dense vegetation killed all seeds and seedlings. Seed dispersal to the mudflat exceeded seed predation and herbivory, however, and a few seedlings survived to grow into large clones of cordgrass. Repeated waves of seed dispersal and rapid clonal growth have transformed the mudflat into cordgrass stands within a decade, despite high consumer pressure. Disturbance by typhoons, freezes, and humans make gaps in mangrove that fill with cordgrass. This process is gradually converting mangrove forests into monospecific intertidal grasslands in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpartina alterniflora 3aclones 3acoasts 3aecological invasion 3aecotones 3aestuaries 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3ainvasive species 3alittoral zone 3amangrove forests 3aseed dispersal 3aseed predation 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashade 3asoil 3atyphoons 3aChina1 aWang, Wenqing1 aZhang, Yihui0 tEcology.g2014 July, v. 95, no. 7 p.1972-1980dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-2283.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245008000174300001400254520164100268592002801909650002501937650001501962650002201977650001401999650001302013650000902026650001402035650001002049650001602059650001502075650000902090653001002099653000902109653002502118700002102143700002902164700006202193700002402255773011802279856008302397852000902480655001202489IND60570703620221118060858.0190405e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057070362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2017.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValadares, Rodrigo C.10aNeostigmine Combined or Not With Lidocaine for Epidural Anesthesia in Mares  ap. 18-23.  aOnly a few studies have examined the effect of neostigmine combined with lidocaine on epidural anesthesia in gelding horses. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate clinical effects, ataxia, and the sensory block duration caused by adding neostigmine to epidural lidocaine in mares. Three independent treatments including neostigmine (NEOST), 2% lidocaine (LIDO), or 2% lidocaine combined with neostigmine (LIDO + NEOST) were administered to six mares using epidural catheters. Each animal received all treatments. A cutaneous pinprick nociception test with fine needle was used in perianal, sacral, and lumbar dermatomes in both antimeres. The response (attempt to kick, movement of the limbs, tail, or head toward the stimulus) was assessed immediately before and after each treatment (every 15 minutes in the first hour, and then every 30 minutes thereafter until the animal would go back to basal response). Analysis of variance (P < .05) was used to compare the treatment responses. The NEOST group did not show sign of anesthesia in any of the dermatomes. The LIDO and LIDO + NEOST groups showed sensory block of the perianal and sacral dermatomes, but not of the lumbar dermatome. The mean duration of anesthesia on perineal dermatomes was 58.4 minutes using lidocaine alone and 64.2 minutes when neostigmine were added to lidocaine with no significant difference between these two treatments (P > .05). No relevant changes in clinical and behavioral parameters were observed. In conclusion, adding neostigmine to lidocaine has not brought any relevant benefits to the epidural anesthesia in clinically normal mares.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aanesthesia 3aataxia (disorder) 3acatheters 3ageldings 3ahead 3alidocaine 3amares 3aneostigmine 3apain tests 3atail 0aHorse 0aPain 0aNeuraxial anesthesia1 aPaz, Cahuê F.R.1 aRocha Junior, Sérgio S.1 aCastro, Tatiana C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8021-18681 aFaleiros, Rafael R.0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2017 Oct., v. 57 p.18-23dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2017.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245011700162520132500279592002801604650001501632650001001647650002201657650001401679650001001693650001501703650001401718650002201732650001501754651001001769700002001779700002001799700001901819700002201838700002601860700002301886700002101909700002301930700002001953700002101973700002301994700002302017700002802040700001902068700002302087773012102110856007602231852000902307655001202316IND60780826620221120232802.0220623e20220620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078082662DNAL7 a10.3390/ani121215932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProsperi, Alice 10aInfluenza A in Wild Boars: Viral Circulation in the Emilia-Romagna Region (Northern Italy) between 2017 and 2022  aA systematic surveillance against influenza A viruses (IAVs) in the Suidae population is essential, considering their role as IAV mixing vessels. However, the viral circulation in wild Sus scrofa species is poorly investigated in comparison to the knowledge of IAV infection dynamics in domestic pigs. This study investigated the circulation and the genetic diversity of wild boars’ IAVs detected in the Emilia-Romagna region (2017–2022). A total of 4605 lung samples were screened via an M gene real-time RT-PCR for SwIAV; positive samples were subtyped by multiplex RT-PCR, and viral isolation was attempted. Isolated strains (3 out of the 17 positives) were fully sequenced to evaluate viral genotypic diversity. H1N1 was the most frequently detected subtype, with identification of H1pdm09N1 and H1avN1. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis revealed SwIAVs belonging to different genotypes, with different genetic combinations, and highlighted the simultaneous circulation of the same genotypes in both pigs and wild boars, supporting the hypothesis of SwIAV spillover events at the wildlife–livestock interface. This study represents an update on the wild boar SwIAV Italian situation, and the strains’ complete genome analysis showed an evolving and interesting situation that deserves further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSus scrofa 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ainfluenza 3alungs 3amonitoring 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3awild boars 3aItaly1 aSoliani, Laura 1 aCanelli, Elena 1 aBaioni, Laura 1 aGabbi, Valentina 1 aTorreggiani, Camilla 1 aManfredi, Roberta 1 aCalanchi, Irene 1 aPupillo, Giovanni 1 aBarsi, Filippo 1 aBassi, Patrizia 1 aFiorentini, Laura 1 aFrasnelli, Matteo 1 aFontana, Maria Cristina1 aLuppi, Andrea 1 aChiapponi, Chiara 0 tAnimals.g2022 June 20, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani121215933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245010500160300001600265520141200281592002801693650001301721650001901734650001901753650001701772650002201789650000901811650001501820650001401835650002401849650002001873650003101893650001001924650002601934650003301960650002601993650001102019650001202030650001602042700001302058700001202071700001402083700001502097700001402112700001402126773013402140856008202274852000902356655001202365IND60590947220221123045430.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059094722DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437180201522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Y.H.10aBioinformatics Analysis of Microarray Data to Reveal Novel Genes Related to Cold-Resistance of Maize  ap. 278-285.  aLow temperature has become a major abiotic stress factor that can reduce maize yield and cause a number of economic loss. This study was designed to identify key genes and pathways associated with coldresistance of maize. The gene expression profile GSE46704, including 4 control temperature treated plants and 4 low temperature treated plants, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by limma package. Then, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module selection were constructed using Cytoscape. Moreover, the DEGs were re-matched based on the Zea mays L. gene ID and symbol data from PlantRegMap. Finally, the re-matched DEGs were performed functional and pathway enrichment analyses by the DAVID online tool. A total of 750 DEGs were screened (including 387 up-regulated and 363 down-regulated genes) In the PPI network, GRMZM2G070837_P01 and GRMZM2G114578_P01 had higher degrees. Besides, carbohydrate metabolic process, starch and sucrose metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were significantly enriched in functional and pathway enrichment analysis. GRMZM2G070837_P01 and GRMZM2G114578_P01 might play a critical role in cold-resistance of maize. Meanwhile, carbohydrate metabolic process, starch and sucrose metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites might function in cold-resistance of maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aabiotic stress 3abioinformatics 3abiosynthesis 3acomputer software 3acorn 3acrop yield 3adatabases 3afinancial economics 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3aprotein-protein interactions 3asecondary metabolites 3astarch 3asucrose 3atemperature1 aLi, S.Y.1 aLin, H.1 aPan, L.Y.1 aYang, G.W.1 aLai, Y.H.1 aSun, D.Q.0 tRussian journal of plant physiology.g2018 Mar., v. 65, no. 2 p.278-285dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl3870074x1021-44377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10214437180201523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245011000206300001600316520154300332592002801875650001301903650002801916650001901944650002101963650001301984650001001997650001002007650001302017650001702030650001602047650001102063650001702074650001702091650001602108653001902124653001602143653000802159653001402167653001402181700003402195700002402229700002502253700002602278700002202304700002102326773013502347856008202482852000902564655001202573IND60526561520221120035549.0190408e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052656152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.etp.2015.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewczuk, Bogdan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2604-926X10aHistological structure of duodenum in gilts receiving low doses of zearalenone and deoxynivalenol in feed  ap. 157-166.  aDeoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEN), produced by microfungi of the Fusarium family, are among the most commonly occurring mycotoxins. They are considered important factors affecting human and animal health as well as livestock productivity. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of low doses of these mycotoxins on the histological structure of the pig duodenum. The study was performed on 72 gilts, with initial weights of approximately 25kg, divided into 4 equal groups. Group I received per os ZEN (40μg/kg BW), group II—DON (12μg/kg BW), group III—ZEN (40μg/kg BW) and DON (12μg/kg BW), and group IV—vehicle. The pigs were killed after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 weeks of the treatment, and the duodenum samples were prepared for histological investigations. The slides were digitalized and subjected to morphometrical analysis. The treatment with DON and ZEN did not change the architecture of the mucosa or the ratio between goblet and adsorptive cells in the epithelium. The administration of DON induced an increase in the number of lymphocytes in the mucosal epithelium. Both mycotoxins, administered alone or together, increased the quantity of lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages with black-brown granules in the lamina propria. The time-courses of changes in the number of defense system cells evoked by DON and ZEN were different. In conclusion, dietary exposure to low doses of Fusarium mycotoxins should be considered an important risk factor for subclinical inflammation in the small intestine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3aanimal and human health 3adeoxynivalenol 3adietary exposure 3aduodenum 3afungi 3agilts 3agranules 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3amucosa 3aplasma cells 3arisk factors 3azearalenone 0aDeoxynivalenol 0aZearalenone 0aPig 0aIntestine 0aHistology1 aPrzybylska-Gornowicz, Barbara1 aGajęcka, Magdalena1 aTargońska, Krystyna1 aZiółkowska, Natalia1 aPrusik, Magdalena1 aGajęcki, Maciej0 tExperimental and toxicologic pathology.g2016 Feb.,  Mar., v. 68, no. 2-3 p.157-166dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11954x0940-29937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etp.2015.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01806naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245009600128300001600224520091100240592002801151650002301179650001301202650001501215650001401230650001401244650001001258653002901268653001401297700001701311700001801328700001701346773010801363852000901471655001201480IND60706099620221117174130.0200908e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070609962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVare, R.

Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were fabricated by electrospinning cellulose acetate solution followed by deacetylation. The CNFs were then treated with silver nitrate, ammonia, and sodium hydroxide and subsequently with dopamine as reducing and adhesive agent. Ag ions on the CNF surface were photo-reduced to Ag nanoparticles (NPs) using UVA irradiation to produce a dense layer of silver nanoparticles on the nanofibers. This is based on the simultaneous formation of polydopamine and Ag NPs on CNFs. Overall, this is a fast, simple, and efficient procedure that takes place in a conventional method at ambient temperature. The crystalline structure of CNFs decorated with AgNPs was studied by X-ray diffraction. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray patterns showed uniform distribution of silver nanoparticles on the CNF surface. Incorporation of AgNPs on the CNF surface via dopamine improved the electrical conductivity and also the tensile strength of the nanomat. The CNFs decorated with AgNPs exhibited a low electrical resistivity around 35 KΩ/square and a tensile strength of 87% higher than untreated CNFs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3aammonia 3abiodegradability 3acellulose 3acellulose acetate 3acellulose microfibrils 3acrystal structure 3adopamine 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrical resistance 3aions 3ananofibers 3ananosilver 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3asilver nitrate 3asodium hydroxide 3atensile strength 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet radiation1 aMontazer, Majid0 tCellulose.g2017 Aug., v. 24, no. 8 p.3179-3190dSpringer Netherlandsx0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-017-1343-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010200160300001800262520174200280592002802022650002902050650001602079650000902095650001002104650001202114650002202126650001102148650001402159650001402173650001502187650002202202651001302224700002202237700002302259700002302282700002202305773009802327856007302425852000902498655001202507IND60480459020221119122010.0160127e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048045902DNAL7 a10.1890/13-1270.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWood, Chelsea L.10aFishing drives declines in fish parasite diversity and has variable effects on parasite abundance  ap. 1929-1946.  aDespite the ubiquity and ecological importance of parasites, relatively few studies have assessed their response to anthropogenic environmental change. Heuristic models have predicted both increases and decreases in parasite abundance in response to human disturbance, with empirical support for both. However, most studies focus on one or a few selected parasite species. Here, we assess the abundance of parasites of seven species of coral reef fishes collected from three fished and three unfished islands of the Line Islands archipelago in the central equatorial Pacific. Because we chose fish hosts that spanned different trophic levels, taxonomic groups, and body sizes, we were able to compare parasite responses across a broad cross section of the total parasite community in the presence and absence of fishing, a major human impact on marine ecosystems. We found that overall parasite species richness was substantially depressed on fished islands, but that the response of parasite abundance varied among parasite taxa: directly transmitted parasites were significantly more abundant on fished than on unfished islands, while the reverse was true for trophically transmitted parasites. This probably arises because trophically transmitted parasites require multiple host species, some of which are the top predators most sensitive to fishing impacts. The increase in directly transmitted parasites appeared to be due to fishing‐driven compensatory increases in the abundance of their hosts. Together, these results provide support for the predictions of both heuristic models, and indicate that the direction of fishing's impact on parasite abundance is mediated by parasite traits, notably parasite transmission strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acoral reefs 3afish 3ahosts 3aislands 3amarine ecosystems 3amodels 3aparasites 3apredators 3aprediction 3aspecies diversity 3aKiribati1 aSandin, Stuart A.1 aZgliczynski, Brian1 aGuerra, Ana Sofía1 aMicheli, Fiorenza0 tEcology.g2014 July, v. 95, no. 7 p.1929-1946dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-1270.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012500169520123700294592002801531650001401559650002501573650001401598650001701612650001601629650001301645650002001658650001701678650002101695650002801716650001401744653001501758653001701773653001401790653002201804653001601826700001701842700001301859700001501872700001701887700001701904700001401921773010801935856008602043852000902129655001202138IND60755080520221122080720.0220531e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075508052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1188102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Guanghui10aHydrazided hyaluronan/cisplatin/indocyanine green coordination nanoprodrug for photodynamic chemotherapy in liver cancer  aIt is still a huge challenge for concurrent highly efficient loading of chemotherapeutic agent and photosensitizer into single nanocarrier via stimuli-responsive linkages due to their different physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetics. Herein, based on the discovery of unique cisplatin-hydrazide and cisplatin-indocyanine green (ICG) coordination reactions, a multifunctional coordination nanoprodrug, cisplatin/ICG co-loaded hydrazided hyaluronan/bovine serum albumin (HBCI) nanoparticles, was developed by a desolvation-dual coordination process. The nanoprodrug exhibited ultrahigh drug loading efficiency and glutathione/NIR light dual-responsive drug release behavior. In vitro cellular studies demonstrated efficient internalization and apoptosis-inducing ability of the nanoprodrug in HepG2 cells. In vivo results confirmed the efficacious tumor accumulation and biosafety of HBCI nanoprodrug and synergistic effect of HBCI-based combined photodynamic chemotherapy on inhibiting tumor growth. Overall, this work not only provides a novel dual coordination approach for highly efficient loading of cisplatin and ICG but also verifies the therapeutic potential of HBCI nanoprodrug in combating hepatocellular carcinoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosafety 3abovine serum albumin 3acisplatin 3adrug therapy 3aglutathione 3ahepatoma 3ahyaluronic acid 3ananocarriers 3apharmacokinetics 3aphotosensitizing agents 3asynergism 0aHyaluronan 0aCoordination 0aCisplatin 0aIndocyanine green 0aNanoprodrug1 aQian, Junmin1 aGuo, Min1 aXu, Weijun1 aWang, Jinlei1 aWang, Yaping1 aSuo, Aili0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 276 p.118810-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1188103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
