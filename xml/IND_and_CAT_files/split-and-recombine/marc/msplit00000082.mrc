The empirical results show that: (1) with the long-term steady improvement of China’s per capita income, the income growth and air quality have shown a clear coordinated development trend (2) the regional multi-centered development has a significant mechanism of promoting the rise and then the fall of smog pollution (3) China’s secondary industry and transportation industry no longer have significant pollution-promoting effect at present, and are upgrading to environment-friendly industries. Besides, this study makes some additional contributions: On the one hand, the correction of night-time light data can provide more accurate data processing criterion for related research. On the other, the time-varying panel estimation further explains the complex mechanism between economic variables and smog pollution as well as reveals the origin of the instability of the EKC hypothesis. These improvements may provide an important academic reference for the subsequent researches and a general empirical evidence for policy makers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aair quality 3aequations 3aestimation 3aevolution 3ainformation processing 3aissues and policy 3alight 3amodels 3apaper 3aper-capita income 3aresearch 3asmog pollution 3atransportation industry 3aChina 0aTime-varying panel model 0aUrban spatial structure 0aModified night-time light data1 aHe, Yongda1 aWang, Qiaoru1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9216-45950 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 20, v. 285 p.124847-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1248473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03347naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245020700166500001400373520181000387592002802197650003002225650002202255650000902277650001102286650001802297650001702315650002202332650001802354650001402372650001302386650000902399650000902408650001802417651001002435653002702445653003002472653001802502653001602520653001902536700001402555700001602569700001402585700001602599700001802615773011302633856008602746852000902832655001202841IND60716270820221121034924.0210121e20210220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071627082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1248492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Yujie10aSpatiotemporal simulation, early warning, and policy recommendations of the soil heavy metal environmental capacity of the agricultural land in a typical industrial city in China: Case of Zhongshan City  aNAL-light  aSoil environmental capacity and risk warning are the core contents of soil security research. In this study, geostatistical analysis, a material balance linear model, and an environmental load capacity method were selected to simulate the environmental capacities of eight heavy metals (Hg, As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn and Cd) in the agricultural land of north Zhongshan City. Then, based on the capacity data in 2015 as the baseline year, risk early warning assessment was carried out, and the management strategy of soil heavy metal pollution under the goal of “soil security” was proposed accordingly. The results showed that between 2015 and 2035, there was a 1.73-fold increase in the average annual capacity of heavy metals in the soil samples collected in the study area. Generally, the heavy metal environmental capacities showed an upward trend, except for Hg, and the low capacity areas were primarily distributed in the northern plain. The comprehensive risk level was medium, based on the soil heavy metal environmental capacities. Further, the average environmental capacity indexes of Hg, As, Cr, and Pb were all >1, corresponding to no risk. However, those of Ni and Zn were 0.8 and 0.7, which corresponded to mild risk, while those of Cu and Cd were all <0, corresponding to extreme risk. Additionally, it is necessary for the government to consider the main pollution sources when formulating targeted measures aimed at controlling agricultural land heavy metal pollution in industrial cities. The results of this study provide theoretical contributions on early warning of risks related to heavy metal environmental capacity of the agricultural land in industrial cities, and serve as practical reference for speeding up the formulation of agricultural land pollution management policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aagricultural land 3aarea 3acities 3ageostatistics 3aheavy metals 3aissues and policy 3alinear models 3apollution 3aresearch 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3aChina 0aEnvironmental capacity 0aSpatiotemporal simulation 0aEarly warning 0aSoil safety 0aZhongshan city1 aDing, Lei1 aXie, Shuyun1 aZeng, Min1 aZhang, Jing1 aPeng, Hongxia0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 20, v. 285 p.124849-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1248493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245006900162300001800231520147500249592002801724650001201752650002001764650001101784650001301795650001001808650002201818650001401840650002001854650001301874650001301887650001501900650001201915650001801927650002001945653001601965653005001981653002202031653001502053653002802068700002102096700002302117700001602140700002302156700001702179700002002196700002202216773011802238856007502356852000902431655001202440IND60569401220221123025155.0170527e20150605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056940122DNAL7 a10.1021/pr501254j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, Nathan J.14aThe CPTAC Data Portal: A Resource for Cancer Proteomics Research  ap. 2707-2713.  aThe Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute’s Office of Cancer Clinical Proteomics Research, is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of proteomic technologies and workflows to clinical tumor samples with characterized genomic and transcript profiles. The consortium analyzes cancer biospecimens using mass spectrometry, identifying and quantifying the constituent proteins and characterizing each tumor sample’s proteome. Mass spectrometry enables highly specific identification of proteins and their isoforms, accurate relative quantitation of protein abundance in contrasting biospecimens, and localization of post-translational protein modifications, such as phosphorylation, on a protein’s sequence. The combination of proteomics, transcriptomics, and genomics data from the same clinical tumor samples provides an unprecedented opportunity for tumor proteogenomics. The CPTAC Data Portal is the centralized data repository for the dissemination of proteomic data collected by Proteome Characterization Centers (PCCs) in the consortium. The portal currently hosts 6.3 TB of data and includes proteomic investigations of breast, colorectal, and ovarian tumor tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The data collected by the consortium is made freely available to the public through the data portal.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreasts 3adata collection 3agenome 3agenomics 3ahosts 3amass spectrometry 3aneoplasms 3aphosphorylation 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3atissues 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0aData portal 0aClinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium 0amass spectrometry 0aproteomics 0aThe Cancer Genome Atlas1 aOberti, Mauricio1 aThangudu, Ratna

The inevitability of e-waste management and the development of a holistic system to deal with it has become an indispensable socio-economic and environmental issue for the sustainable development of Malaysia. However, no comprehensive research has yet been carried out, and only a few works in a discreet manner have been begun. In view of the above, and as a small endeavor towards achieving the country’s Vision 2020, this study explores the present status and future perspectives of the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment in Malaysia. This article presents an overview of e-waste management practices around the world, including the generation of e-waste, the implementation of management strategies, and collection and recovery activities in Malaysia. It also presents the corresponding responses adopted so far with respect to legislation and other infrastructural development. Finally, through the use of structured and semi-structured interviews, it reveals the barriers and challenges, as well as future perspectives and sustainability issues related to the e-waste management system in this fast developing country.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3aelectronic wastes 3ainterviews 3alaws and regulations 3asustainable development 3awaste management 3aMalaysia1 aAhmed, Shamsuddin1 aIslam, Md.

A rapidly emerging problem is that of secondary invasion — an increase in abundance of non-target exotics following treatment of targeted invasive plants. Here, we present a global literature review and meta-analysis directed at quantifying the magnitude of secondary invasion effects and identifying possible causes. Of 168 studies examining the efficacy of exotic plant management in terrestrial habitats, 29% quantified community responses sufficiently to evaluate secondary invasion. Meta-analysis of 60 cases from 38 studies showed that control efforts strongly reduced target invader abundance overall, but secondary invaders increased, with a mean effect size double what was found for native plants, which increased only weakly. Moreover, 89% of the secondary invaders identified were classified as noxious or invasive plants. Increases in secondary invaders were correlated with target invader reductions, but control method and target invader growth form failed to explain variation in secondary invader responses. These results suggest that target invader suppression is the key factor driving release of secondary invaders. However, management side effects, target invader legacy effects, provenance effects, and shifting environmental conditions may all facilitate secondary invasion. Invasive plant management often successfully suppresses target invaders, but the result is largely secondary invasion. Addressing this problem requires management strategies that anticipate and suppress secondary invaders while rapidly restoring native plants to fill the space vacated by the target weed.

The term EV, as coined by the International Society of Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV), encompasses exosomes (30–100 nm in diameter), microparticles (100–1000 nm), apoptotic blebs, and other EV subsets. EVs have been implicated in cell–cell communication, coagulation, inflammation, immune response modulation, and disease progression. Multiple studies report that EV secretion from disease-affected cells contributes to disease progression, e.g., tumor niche formation and cancer metastasis. EVs are attractive sources of biomarkers due to their biological relevance and relatively noninvasive accessibility from a range of physiological fluids. This review is focused on the molecular profiling of the protein and lipid constituents of EVs, with emphasis on mass-spectrometry-based “omic” analytical techniques. The challenges in the purification and molecular characterization of EVs, including contamination of isolates and limitations in sample quantities, are discussed along with possible solutions. Finally, the review discusses the limited but growing investigation of post-translational modifications of EV proteins and potential strategies for future in-depth molecular characterization of EVs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aanalytical methods 3aapoptosis 3abiomarkers 3acell communication 3acell culture 3acoagulation 3aculture media 3aexosomes 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3ametabolites 3ametastasis 3amicroparticles 3aneoplasms 3aphospholipids 3apost-translational modification 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asecretion 0aextracellular vesicle 0aEV 0aexosome 0amicrovesicle 0amicroparticle 0amolecular profiling 0amass spectrometry 0aproteomics 0alipidomics 0apost-translational modifications1 aBelov, Arseniy M.1 aGhiran, Ionita1 aMurthy, Shashi

Studies have been carried out to identify new alternatives for monitoring and controlling this sandfly species, particularly with the use of chemical baits. The attractiveness of odours emitted by foxes and alcohols found in some plants has already been demonstrated in laboratory tests with Lu. longipalpis. However, no studies have evaluated the responses of these insects to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by dogs. The present study was carried out to investigate the effects on Lu. longipalpis of individual and blends of VOCs identified in hair from dogs infected with L. infantum. Effects in male and female Lu. longipalpis were assessed using wind tunnel methodology. Individual compounds including octanal, nonanal, decanal and heptadecane showed capacity for activating and/or attracting male Lu. longipalpis. Only decanal and nonanal showed effects on females. The combination of octanal, decanal and heptadecane increased activation and attraction behaviour in male sandflies, as did the blend of octanal and decanal. These findings indicate that VOCs emitted by dogs may be an interesting source of new attractants of sandflies.  aPublisher supplied data  a498/2011cResearch Foundation of the State of Bahia  a1799/2012cResearch Foundation of the State of Bahia 3aLeishmania infantum 3aLutzomyia longipalpis 3aattractants 3abiomarkers 3adogs 3afemales 3ainsects 3amales 3amonitoring 3aodors 3avolatile organic compounds 3awind tunnels 3aNorth America 3aSouth America1 aOliva‐Filho, A.

The formation of α-terpineol (2) from β-pinene (1) is a reaction of commercial significance that is typically run with strong acid. We demonstrate that the reaction can be performed under more environmentally benign conditions using the in situ acid formation capabilities of two different green technologies: CO₂ expanded liquids and reactions in hot water (200 °C). This work presents an example of the application of these methods to a reaction that has commercial significance and adds to our knowledge about the benefits and effects of co-solvents.

Proteins associated with stroke pathogenesis may appear in the serum of AIS patients due to blood–brain barrier dysfunction, thus permitting the development of blood-based biomarkers for early diagnosis of stroke. These biomarkers could perhaps be an adjunct to the existing imaging modalities and aid in better management and therapeutic intervention during the course of the disease. For this exploratory study, a combination of multiplexed isobaric tagging using iTRAQ reagents and high resolution tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify differentially expressed proteins in serum samples from AIS patients. The quantitative proteomic analysis of serum from both AIS and control subjects revealed 389 high confidence protein identifications and their relative levels. Among them, 60 proteins showed a ≥1.5-fold change in the AIS subjects. We verified the altered serum levels of candidate proteins such as vWF, ADAMTS13, S100A7, and DLG4 through ELISA, and the results also corroborate with the experimental findings. vWF and ADAMTS13 are key players that regulate blood hemostasis, and their altered concentration may contribute to endothelial dysfunction. S100A7 is a novel candidate protein identified in this study that is also known to mediate inflammation, endothelial proliferation, and angiogenesis. The current study provided a potential and novel biomarker panel that may in turn provide diagnostic aid to the existing imaging modalities for the rapid diagnosis of ischemic stroke  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aangiogenesis 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3ablood-brain barrier 3aearly diagnosis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahemostasis 3aimage analysis 3ainflammation 3aliquid chromatography 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3astroke 3atandem mass spectrometry 0ahemostasis 0athrombus 0ainflammation 0aLTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer 0adiagnostic marker 0aischemic stroke 0ahigh density lipoprotein (HDL) 0alow density lipoprotein (LDL)1 aGowda, Harsha1 aChavan, Sandip1 aAdvani, Jayshree1 aKelkar, Dhanashree1 aKumar, G.

In this study, we applied a biogeochemical model, Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC), to assess impacts of N management on vegetable yields, N₂O emissions, and NO₃⁻-N leaching from GV systems. The model was evaluated using multi-year (2011–2013) field measurements of vegetable yields, N₂O emissions, and NO₃⁻-N concentrations in the surface soil layer and soil leachate under three treatments with different N management. The model evaluations demonstrated that the simulations of the vegetable yields and seasonal cumulative N₂O emissions were consistent with the corresponding observations after calibration. In addition, DNDC generally captured the seasonal variations of the N₂O fluxes and NO₃⁻-N concentrations in the surface soil layer and the seasonal patterns and magnitudes of the measured NO₃⁻-N concentrations in soil leachate in 2011. We then assessed impacts on the vegetable yields, N₂O emissions, and NO₃⁻-N leaching of different N management practices by conducting simulations under scenarios with changes in rate of the applied N-fertilizers and the application of nitrification inhibitor (NI). The results suggested that 1) the increasing of organic or synthetic N application rate generally increased the N₂O emissions and NO₃⁻-N leaching, but did not persistently increase the vegetable yields, 2) urea N application could induce more N₂O emissions and NO₃⁻-N leaching in comparison with organic N amendment, and 3) the NI application could decrease the N₂O emissions and NO₃⁻-N leaching while maintaining the vegetable yields at the GV fields. The optimum management practice identified in this study was applying organic manure at a rate of 320 kg N ha⁻¹ four season⁻¹ and urea at a rate of 334 kg N ha⁻¹ four season⁻¹, combined with the NI application. The optimum management practice reduced the rates of organic manure (1600 kg N ha⁻¹ four season⁻¹) and urea (1670 kg N ha⁻¹ four season⁻¹) under the farm's conventional practice by 80%. This practice maintained or slightly increased the yields and mitigated the N₂O emissions and NO₃⁻-N leaching by 81% to 90% and 92% to 95%, respectively, among different vegetable growing seasons.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNational Key Research and Development Program of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100012166  cNatural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afarms 3afertilizer rates 3aflood irrigation 3agreenhouses 3aleachates 3amodels 3anitrates 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3asoil 3aurea 3aurea nitrogen 3avegetables 0aN2O emission 0aNO3−-N leaching 0aGreenhouse vegetable fields 0aNitrogen management 0aDNDC1 aLi, Hu1 aDeng, Jia1 aWang, Ligang0 tGeoderma.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 382dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.1147013Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7106434  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245007700168500001900245520112200264592002801386650002401414650002401438650000901462650001701471650002401488700002601512700002201538700002501560700002501585700002501610700002601635700002501661700002501686773013201711856007701843852000901920655001201929IND60704081820221119165135.0200722e20200403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070408182DNAL7 a10.3390/vetsci70200382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchegiani, Andrea 10aImpact of Nutritional Supplementation on Canine Dermatological Disorders  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNutritional supplements, also known as complementary feeds, are products administered with the aim of furnishing health benefits, regardless of nutritional needs.

This review highlights how these feeds can be considered useful in the management of dermatological disorders and outlines their beneficial effects in the prevention of dietary deficiencies and treatment of diseases, alone, or in addition to conventional pharmacological therapy. In recent years, nutritional supplements have found increasing potential application in veterinary medicine, and the scientific proofs of their beneficial effects are described in this review.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomplementary foods 3adietary supplements 3adogs 3atherapeutics 3aveterinary medicine1 aFruganti, Alessandro 1 aSpaterna, Andrea 1 aDalle Vedove, Elena 1 aBachetti, Benedetta 1 aMassimini, Marcella 1 aDi Pierro, Francesco 1 aGavazza, Alessandra 1 aCerquetella, Matteo 0 tVeterinary sciences.g2020 Apr. 03, v. 7, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27139x2306-73817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vetsci70200383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01657naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245008700168300001400255520062300269592002800892650001600920650001100936650001400947650002200961650002300983650001701006650001101023700002601034700002501060700002101085773012201106856008201228852000901310655001201319IND60566134720221118120325.0170402e20160114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056613472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b098262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPahlavanlu, Paniz10aControlled Intramolecular Charge Transfer Using a Sulfur-Containing Acceptor Group  ap. 70-77.  aA series of donor–acceptor (D–A) and donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) molecules containing anthracene chromophores paired with a sulfur-containing acceptor group have been prepared.

Because species with wide geographical distributions are known to exhibit variations that influence their vectorial capacity, the present study aimed to analyze genetic diversity and rickettsia infection of A. ovale collected during the investigation and surveillance of SF cases in the Cerrado and Atlantic rainforest (ARF) Brazilian biomes. Samples had their DNA extracted, amplified and sequenced for 16S rDNA, 12S rDNA, cytochrome oxidase subunit II and D‐loop markers for tick analyses, as well as the gltA, htrA, ompA and ompB genes for rickettsia detection. Between 11 and 33 A. ovale haplotypes were identified, all of them exclusive to areas within individual analyzed biome areas. The A. ovale populations appeared to be structured, with Cluster I restricted to Cerrado + ARF isolated in Caatinga and Cluster II to ARF continuous area. Rickettsia bellii, R. parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest (first report for Goiás state, Cerrado), Rickettsia asemboensis (first record in A. ovale for Brazil) and Rickettsia felis (first detection in this ixodid) were identified. A. ovale clusters were not associated with rickettsia types.  aPublisher supplied data  aTC 334/2013cFundo Nacional de Saúde/Minitério da Saúde  aSIAFI 677.202‐FNS/FIOCRUZcFundo Nacional de Saúde/Minitério da Saúde  a25000.204745/2013‐08cFundo Nacional de Saúde/Minitério da Saúde 3aAmblyomma 3aNeotropics 3aRickettsia bellii 3aRickettsia felis 3aRickettsia parkeri 3acaatinga 3acerrado 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aecosystems 3afever 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amonitoring 3apopulation structure 3arain forests 3aribosomal DNA 3aticks 3avectorial capacity 3aBrazil1 aAmorim, M.1 ade Oliveira, S.

Its genetic improvement compromised due to limited understanding of available germplasm diversity. To address the gap, we report morphology (50 traits) and genic-SSRs (27)-based characterization of a germplasm collection of 110 accessions of Jack naturalized across diverse habitats in Eastern India and conserved in Field Gene Bank. Before analysis, the entire germplasm collection was divided into five sub-populations based on their naturalization sites. We observed a wide spectrum of diversity for qualitative (26) and quantitative (24) traits in the sub-populations. Principal component analysis using 24 quantitative traits explained 99.73% of the total variation through the first four-axis. Cluster analysis highlighted the dominance of vegetable purpose Jack in the sub-populations. Both morphological and genic-SSR markers revealed significant polymorphism (PIC = 0.12 to 0.46, polymorphism = 100%; PIC = 0.07 to 0.43, polymorphism = 100%) among the accessions. Morphological markers, namely leaf-blade margin, petiole shape, grooves on the petiole, fruit bracteole, and vivipary,exhibited the highest mean resolving power (1.0). Among the genic-SSR markers, JFSSR-4 exhibited the highest mean resolving power of 1.36. Overall, genic-SSR markers revealed higher genetic diversity at the species level (SI = 0.36, He = 0.23, P = 82.71%). Structure analysis using qualitative morphological markers, genic-SSR makers, and a combination of both marker types identified 2, 3 and 2 distinct groups, respectively,with frequent admixtures. The findings convincingly demonstrate that morphological and genic-SSR markers may together effectively explain complex biological diversity, particularly in perennial fruit trees like Jack.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtocarpus heterophyllus 3abiodiversity 3acluster analysis 3afruit trees 3afruits 3agene banks 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3ageoreferencing 3agermplasm 3agermplasm conservation 3aleaf blade 3apetioles 3aprincipal component analysis 3avegetables 3aIndia 0aDIVA-GIS 0aFunctional traits 0aPolymorphism 0aPopulation structure 0aTropical fruit1 aGurjar, Suresh Chandra1 aSingh, Binay Kumar1 aSingh, Devendra Kumar1 aSharma, Hariom Kumar1 aHoro, Seema1 aKumari, Neetu1 aAmrapali, Shephalika1 aAhlawat, Sudhir Pal1 aSingh, Kuldeep0 tScientia horticulturae.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 295 p.110852-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1108523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245015100164300001600315520103200331592002801363650002501391650002601416650000801442650002101450650001401471650002301485650001901508650001401527650001501541650001101556650001501567650001601582651001001598653001401608653001601622653001401638653001001652773015501662856007801817852000901895655001201904IND60706171120221119023440.0200908e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070617112DNAL7 a10.18805/IJARe.A-49912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarshney, Kalpna10aComparative analysis of efficacy and longevity of different pheromone baited septa for control of Gram Pod Borer in Chickpea in Uttaranchal, India  ap. 581-584.  aPheromones are species specific chemicals which are biodegradable, eco-friendly, chemically safe, and required in ultra low dosages and used as efficient tool for insect pest management. Efficiency of pheromone traps used for pest control depends on air borne pheromone stimulus, in specific ratio and concentration released from septa. Field longevity of synthetic lures for Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctudae) and efficacyof different septa were evaluated by mass trapping experiments in Pantnagar, India. The longevity (shelf life) of septa impregnated with pheromone components (Hexadecenol) and 97: 3 blend (Z-11-hexadecenal and Z-9-Hexadecenal) were studied by gas chromatographic estimation of the residual pheromone remaining on the septa at different time interval and temperature conditions. The rubber eraser septum isfound to be mosteffective one. This studyis helpful topopularizethe pheromone technology among the farmers as they can store the already loaded septa and use them for control of H.armigera.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aagricultural research 3aair 3abiodegradability 3achickpeas 3agas chromatography 3ainsect control 3alongevity 3apheromones 3arubber 3ashelf life 3atemperature 3aIndia 0aChick pea 0aHelicoverpa 0aPheromone 0aSepta0 tIndian journal of agricultural research.g2018 Oct., v. 52, no. 5 p.581-584dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2026x0976-058X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18805/IJARe.A-49913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245011600181300001600297520100100313592002801314650002301342650003101365650002201396650001801418650002301436650001001459650001701469650001501486650001601501650001501517650002001532653001901552653001701571653002801588653001501616700002901631700003101660700003001691700002701721700007501748700002801823700003201851700003601883700004101919700003001960700003701990700002502027700003002052700007602082700003802158700003402196773010802230856008602338852000902424655001202433IND60598077620221122043622.0190628e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059807762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.06.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa, Stefany Guimarães10aChemical structure and anti-inflammatory effect of polysaccharide extracted from Morinda citrifolia Linn (Noni)  ap. 515-523.  aPolysaccharides extracted from plants are very promising molecules in the field of pharmacotherapy. Knowing this, the aim of this study was to extract, characterize and evaluate the action of the polysaccharide of Morinda citrifolia Linn (Noni-PLS) in biological models of inflammatory processes. The characterization tests shown that sample refers to a heteropolysaccharide composed mainly of homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan. This polysaccharide at dose of 10 mg/kg, when tested in our models of inflammation, showed significant activity in reducing carrageenan-induced paw oedema as well as all mediators edemas. This polysaccharide was able to inhibit the migration of leukocytes to the site of inflammation, and still reduced inflammatory nociception tests. This results, allows us to conclude that the polysaccharide extracted from Morinda citrifolia linn has anti-inflammatory potential since it reversed inflammatory parameters such as edema, leukocyte migration and nociception.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorinda citrifolia 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abiological models 3acell movement 3achemical structure 3aedema 3ainflammation 3aleukocytes 3anociception 3apain tests 3apolysaccharides 0aPolysaccharide 0aInflammation 0aMorinda citrifolia linn 0aPaw oedema1 aOliveira, Lorena Almeida1 ade Aguiar Magalhães, Diva1 ade Brito, Tarcisio Vieira1 aBatista, Jalles Arruda1 aPereira, Cynthia Maria Carvalho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3331-452X1 ade Souza Costa, Mariana1 aMazulo, José Carlos Raposo1 ade Carvalho Filgueiras, Marcelo1 aVasconselos, Daniel Fernando Pereira1 ada Silva, Durcilene Alves1 aBarros, Francisco Clark Nogueira1 aSombra, Venícios G.1 aFreitas, Ana Lúcia Ponte1 ade Paula, Regina Célia Monteiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7617-03431 ade Andrade Feitosa, Judith Pessoa1 ados Reis Barbosa, André Luiz0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 197 p.515-523dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.06.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245009900166300001600265520148900281592002801770650002501798650002601823650001701849650000901866650001501875650002501890650002401915650002301939650002301962650002201985650001502007650001302022650002702035650001802062650001202080650001202092651002602104653000902130653000902139653002102148653002602169653003102195700002202226700002302248700002102271700002102292700002302313700002202336700002502358773012402383856007602507961001202583852000902595655001202604IND60603990120221120124947.0180716e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060399012DNAL7 a10.3955/046.092.02072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranklin, Thomas W.12aA Non-Invasive Sampling Method for Detecting Non-Native Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu)  ap. 149-157.  aThe smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) is a cool-water fish species native to central North America. Widespread introductions and secondary spread outside of its historical range have led to new recreational fisheries and associated economic benefits in western United States, but have also resulted in a number of ecological impacts to recipient ecosystems, including threats to Pacific salmon. Management of introduced smallmouth bass populations, now and into the future, relies on accurate detection and monitoring of this species. To address this need, we developed an environmental DNA assay that can detect smallmouth bass DNA extracted from filtered water samples in concentrations as low as 2 mtDNA copies per reaction. Field testing demonstrated that eDNA sampling produced results largely consistent with snorkel surveys, a traditional visual assessment, and gained a few additional positive detections. While this assay is robust against non-target detection, including the only other Micropterus in Pacific Northwest streams, largemouth bass (M. salmoides), the high genetic similarity within the sunfish family Centrarchidae made it unable to distinguish smallmouth bass from spotted bass (M. punctulatus) and some Guadalupe bass (M. treculii). The high sensitivity of this method and assay will be particularly useful for identifying the location of non-native smallmouth bass in the Pacific Northwest, quantifying its rate of spread, and aiding management actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicropterus dolomieu 3aMicropterus salmoides 3aOncorhynchus 3abass 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3afinancial economics 3agenetic similarity 3aindigenous species 3amitochondrial DNA 3amonitoring 3asampling 3asecondary transmission 3asport fishing 3astreams 3asurveys 3aWestern United States 0aeDNA 0aqPCR 0ainvasive species 0anon-invasive sampling 0aaquatic species monitoring1 aDysthe, Joseph C.1 aRubenson, Erika S.1 aCarim, Kellie J.1 aOlden, Julian D.1 aMcKelvey, Kevin S.1 aYoung, Michael K.1 aSchwartz, Michael K.0 tNorthwest science.g2018 May, v. 92, no. 2 p.149-157dWashington State University PresswJournal:19722x0029-344X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.092.02073Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245014200154300001600296520128300312592002801595650002201623650001501645650001901660650001401679650002301693650002301716650001001739650002301749650002101772650003301793650002001826650004401846650002101890650002001911650001301931650002301944650002101967650003201988650000902020700001202029700001302041700001802054773012002072856007202192852000902264655001202273IND60662226620221118055150.0190904e20040504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066222662DNAL7 a10.1039/b400624k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Y.

The molecular structure of zinc metallophthalocyanine-containing polymer was confirmed by Fourier-transform spectroscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction technique, UV-visible spectra, and ¹H-NMR spectra. The zinc metallophthalocyanine-containing polymer was found to be soluble in some solvents, and the colored polymer showed maximum visible absorption at 665 nm. Copolymerization between carbon dioxide and propylene oxide (PO) was performed using the zinc metallophthalocyanine end-capped poly(arylene ether sulfone) as a catalyst. This is the first report to describe the use of metallophthalocyanine-containing polymer as a polymer-supported catalyst to activate carbon dioxide. Catalytic activity (30 g-polymer/g catalyst) was achieved by optimizing the PO/catalyst ratio. NMR measurement revealed that the synthesized copolymer from carbon dioxide and PO had an alternating structure. Thermal properties of the copolymer were determined by thermogravimetric analysis, and the results demonstrated that the copolymer exhibited a high glass transition temperature of 35 °C and decomposition temperature of 247 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical structure 3acolor 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3aglass transition temperature 3agreen chemistry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphenolphthaleins 3apropylene oxide 3asolvents 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3awide-angle X-ray scattering 3azinc1 aWan, W.1 aXiao, M.1 aHay, Allan S.0 tGreen chemistry.g2004 May 4, v. 6, no. 5 p.249-253dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b400624k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01814naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002600112245002700138520076600165592002800931650003800959650003100997650003201028650002001060650002801080650001201108650002501120650001701145651001601162773011701178856020801295852000901503655001201512IND60477781820221119103549.0160106e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047778182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNettles, Mary Frances10aNFSMI research summary  aNFSMI Research Summary is a continuing series of summaries reporting recently completed research funded by the National Food Service Management Institute.

However, SAP genes in eggplant (SmSAP) have been little reported. It has important significance in identifying SAP members, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying stress responses, and tolerance. We performed a comprehensive study of the A20/AN1 domains, motifs, gene structures, phylogenetic relationships, chromosomal locations, gene replications, collinearity, cis-acting elements, and expression pattern responses to various abiotic stresses. Twenty-one SAP genes were identified in eggplant (SmSAP) and were localized on 10 chromosomes. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of the SmSAP proteins showed a high homology with the tomato SAP members, and 21 members were divided into four groups based on the homology of the SAP members in eggplant, tomato, rice, and Arabidopsis. Further analysis revealed that SmSAP proteins contain the characteristic A20/AN1 domains, the A20 domain composed of motif 2 (ILCINNCGFFGSPATMNLCSKCYKDMJLK). Four pairs of tandem duplications were found in eggplant, and 10 SmSAP genes had collinearity with SAP genes from Arabidopsis, potato, or tomato, but only four SmSAP genes were collinear with SAP genes in the three species mentioned above. Moreover, the promoters of SmSAP genes were predicted to contain many cis-acting elements that respond to abiotic stress and hormones. A qRT-PCR analysis of the four selected SmSAP genes exhibited diverse expression levels in response to various environmental stresses. These results provided a comprehensive analysis of the SmSAP genes and lay a solid foundation for improving the understanding of the functional diversification of SAP genes under various environmental stresses in eggplant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aabiotic stress 3aeggplants 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3apotatoes 3arice 3atomatoes 3azinc finger motif1 aXu, Yuhu 1 aWang, Sulong 1 aGao, Jun 1 aLu, Dan 1 aZhou, Chenghong 1 aLiao, Yanqing 1 aMa, Yanyan 1 aZheng, Yu 0 tHorticulturae.g2022 Jan. 25, v. 8, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae80201083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245014500208300001600353520206200369592002802431596005602459650002502515650002602540650002802566650002302594650001702617650001102634650001002645650001102655650001302666650001802679650001402697650002002711773013402731856008202865852000902947655001202956IND60744636020221120224630.0210716e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074463602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-021-02282-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzdemir, Zahide1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2770-126410aIdentification of Enterobacteriaceae members and fluorescent pseudomonads associated with bacterial rind necrosis and rot of melon in Turkey  ap. 797-812.  aDuring the 2016 growing season, melon fruits were severely affected by rind necrosis and rot and nearly 80% of the fruits were unmarketable in a field in Koçarlı district of Aydın. In order to determine occurrences of the fruit infections in the following year, surveys were conducted in 2017. Isolations were made from the symptomatic fruits and bacterial growths were observed consistently. In this study, we identified the causal agents of melon fruit necrosis and rot. Pathogenicity of the bacterial strains was determined on melon fruit by needle injection method and thirteen strains were further characterized with phenotypic characterization, analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and specific PCR assays. As a result of the pathogenicity tests, brown spots and necrosis formation was observed initially and in the later stage, inoculated fruit burst out by the fermentative strains. The oxidative strains produced limited necrosis on the rind. Fermentative bacterial agents isolated from the melon necrosis and rot were identified as Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kosakonia cowanii. Enterobacter cloacae strains were further tested with tDNA-PCR using T5A/T3B primers. The oxidative bacteria were phenotypically grouped within the fluorescent pseudomonads.Homology search of the oxidative strains using the sequence information of partial 16S rRNA gene identified the strains as Pseudomonas spp. The oxidative strain 413-Si2-L2 and the reisolate 06R2K were the most similar to strains of Pseudomonas putida and P. reidholzensis including the type strains. The strain, 413-MKV-3 and the reisolate 03R2K were the most related to Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. baetica, P. syringae, and Pseudomonas sp. strains.The ability of Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kosakonia cowanii to cause disease on melon fruit was shown for the first time in this study by fulfilling Koch postulate. Furthermore, although limited rind necrosis was produced, pathogenicity of the fluorescent pseudomonads on melon fruit was also confirmed.  aPublisher supplied data  aZRF-17026cAydın Adnan Menderes Üniversitesi (TR) 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aPseudomonas putida 3afluorescence 3afruits 3agenes 3amelons 3anecrosis 3apathogenicity 3aphenotype 3aplant pathology0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2021 Aug., v. 160, no. 4 p.797-812dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-021-02282-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245009500159300001600254500001500270520146100285592002801746650001601774650001901790650001901809650002601828650002801854650001101882650003901893650002501932650002001957650005201977650001102029650001002040650002002050650001702070650000702087650003002094650002102124650002302145650001702168653002002185700002302205700001502228700002102243700002202264700001902286773012202305856007802427852000902505655001202514IND60340865920221122184250.0150809e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034086592DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2014007862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Min10aCloning, expression, and characterization of a novel xylose reductase from Rhizopus oryzae  ap. 907-921.  a2019-12-05  aRhizopus oryzae is valuable as a producer of organic acids via lignocellulose catalysis. R. oryzae metabolizes xylose, which is one component of lignocellulose hydrolysate. In this study, a novel NADPH‐dependent xylose reductase gene from R. oryzae AS 3.819 (Roxr) was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Homology alignment suggested that the 320‐residue protein contained domains and active sites belonging to the aldo/keto reductase family. SDS–PAGE demonstrated that the recombinant xylose reductase has a molecular weight of approximately 37 kDa. The optimal catalytic pH and temperature of the purified recombinant protein were 5.8 and 50 °C, respectively. The recombinant protein was stable from pH 4.4 to 6.5 and at temperatures below 42 °C. The recombinant enzyme has bias for D‐xylose and L‐arabinose as substrates and NADPH as its coenzyme. Real‐time quantitative reverse transcription PCR tests suggested that native Roxr expression is regulated by a carbon catabolite repression mechanism. Site‐directed mutagenesis at two possible key sites involved in coenzyme binding, Thr²²⁶ → Glu²²⁶ and Val²⁷⁴ → Asn²⁷⁴, were performed, respectively. The coenzyme specificity constants of the resulted RoXRᵀ²²⁶ᴱ and RoXR(v²⁷⁴ᴺ) for NADH increased 18.2‐fold and 2.4‐fold, which suggested possibility to improve the NADH preference of this enzyme through genetic modification.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3alignocellulose 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aorganic acids and salts 3axylose 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3arecombinant proteins 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3acarbon 3agenes 3aRhizopus oryzae 3aactive sites 3apH 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3amolecular weight 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrolysates 0aPichia pastoris1 aJiang, Shao‐tong1 aZheng, Zhi1 aLi, Xing‐jiang1 aLuo, Shui‐zhong1 aWu, Xue‐feng0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2015 July, v. 55, no. 7 p.907-921dAkademie-VerlagwJournal:jnl39022x0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2014007863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03334naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012600173300001800299520170700317592002802024650000802052650001502060650002002075650002602095650002302121650001502144650003502159650001102194650001202205650001402217650001402231650001402245653001702259653002202276653002202298653001902320700001902339700002002358700002102378700002202399700002202421700002402443700002202467700002202489700002302511700001802534700002602552773012002578856008502698852000902783655001202792IND60582412520221117020002.0180829e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058241252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.01.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusumeci, Domenica10aTandem application of ligand-based virtual screening and G4-OAS assay to identify novel G-quadruplex-targeting chemotypes  ap. 1341-1352.  aG-quadruplex (G4) structures are key elements in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation and their targeting is deemed to be a promising strategy in anticancer therapy.A tandem application of ligand-based virtual screening (VS) calculations together with the experimental G-quadruplex on Oligo Affinity Support (G4-OAS) assay was employed to discover novel G4-targeting compounds. The interaction of the selected compounds with the investigated G4 in solution was analysed through a series of biophysical techniques and their biological activity investigated by immunofluorescence and MTT assays.A focused library of 60 small molecules, designed as putative G4 groove binders, was identified through the VS. The G4-OAS experimental screening led to the selection of 7 ligands effectively interacting with the G4-forming human telomeric DNA. Evaluation of the biological activity of the selected compounds showed that 3 ligands of this sub-library induced a marked telomere-localized DNA damage response in human tumour cells.The combined application of virtual and experimental screening tools proved to be a successful strategy to identify new bioactive chemotypes able to target the telomeric G4 DNA. These compounds may represent useful leads for the development of more potent and selective G4 ligands.Expanding the repertoire of the available G4-targeting chemotypes with improved physico-chemical features, in particular aiming at the discovery of novel, selective G4 telomeric ligands, can help in developing effective anti-cancer drugs with fewer side effects.

Recently developed, the validity and precision of BAI has been studied with adult samples of men and women, populations from different countries and ethnicities, varying amounts of BF, and sensitivity to detecting change over time. However, it is still necessary to determine its potential use in clinical practice and epidemiologic studies. Thus, our objective was to verify, through a systematic review, the validity of the BAI in predicting BF% in adults. Two independent researchers performed a search using PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Scopus databases. In order to be included, the studies had to use dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as a reference method. We excluded studies with samples from individuals with diseases or syndromes that alter the regional distribution of BF%. We included 19 studies with samples on individuals from different continents, varied ethnicities, both sexes, and a wide age range (18–83 y). The concordance of the BAI with DXA assessed by Lin's concordance correlation coefficient showed results classified as poor (pc < 0.90). Bland-Altman plots showed that the BAI produced large individual errors when predicting BF% in all studies using this analysis. The studies were consistent in affirming that the BAI showed limited capacity to estimate BF% in adults. The BAI shows wide individual errors, in agreement with the reference method, and a lack of sensitivity in detecting change in BF% over time. The method presents a systematic error of BF% overestimation in individuals with ≤20% of BF, and underestimation in individuals with >30% of BF, regardless of sex, age, and ethnicity. The results of this systematic review show enough evidence that the BAI does not present satisfying results, and its use is not recommended for BF% determination in adults.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadiposity 3aadults 3adatabases 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aepidemiological studies 3amen 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aprediction 3asystematic review 3awomen 0aaged 0amale 0afemale 0abody composition 0aanthropometry 0aDXA1 aSantos, Carolina Araújo dos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5947-87441 aSilva, Diego Augusto Santos1 aAmorim, Paulo Roberto dos Santos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4327-91901 aMarins, João Carlos Bouzas1 aFranceschini, Sylvia do Carmo Castro0 tAdvances in nutrition.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 9, no. 5 p.617-624dOxford University PresswJournal:2280x2156-53767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmy0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03617naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245012200183300001400305520179100319592002802110650001702138650001702155650001202172650001902184650002302203650002002226650001902246650001002265650000902275650001502284650002602299650001502325650002002340650002302360650001302383650003502396650001202431650001602443650001702459651001502476653003702491653002302528653001002551653003002561653001902591653002202610700003002632700002202662700001502684700001502699700001702714700001802731700002002749700002402769773010402793856008502897852000902982655001202991IND60564354620221118093810.0190215e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056435462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2016.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMantyka-Pringle, Chrystal S.10aPrioritizing management actions for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity under changing climate and land-cover  ap. 80-89.  aFreshwater ecosystems are declining under climate change and land-use change. To maximize the return on investment in freshwater conservation with limited financial resources, managers must prioritize management actions that are most cost-effective. However, little is known about what these priorities may be under the combined effects of climate and land-cover change. We present a novel decision-making framework for prioritizing conservation resources to different management actions for the conservation of freshwater biodiversity. The approach is novel in that it has the ability to model interactions, rank management options for dealing with conservation threats from climate and land-cover change, and integrate empirical data with expert knowledge. We illustrate the approach using a case study in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia under climate change, land-cover change and their combined effects. Our results show that the explicit inclusion of multiple threats and costs results in quite different priorities than when costs and interactions are ignored. When costs are not considered, stream and riparian restoration, as a single management strategy, provides the greatest overall protection of macroinvertebrate and fish richness in rural and urban areas of SEQ in response to climate change and/or urban growth. Whereas, when costs are considered, farm/land management with stream and riparian restoration are the most cost-effective strategies for macroinvertebrate and fish conservation. Our findings support riparian restoration as the most effective adaptation strategy to climate change and urban development, but because it is expensive it may often not be the most cost-efficient strategy. Our approach allows for these decisions to be evaluated explicitly.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acost effectiveness 3adecision making 3aexpert opinion 3afarms 3afish 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3aland cover 3aland use change 3amacroinvertebrates 3amanagers 3anatural resources conservation 3astreams 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aQueensland 0aFreshwater conservation planning 0aManagement actions 0aCosts 0aBayesian decision network 0aClimate change 0aLand-cover change1 aMartin, T.

Relative abundance of total and active bacteria were studied in bulk soil and rhizosphere samples collected from different growth stages of groundnut plant by sequencing PCR‐amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments from soil genomic DNA and reverse‐transcribed soil community RNA. Plant growth promoting potential of cultivable rhizobacteria was evaluated using assays for inorganic phosphate solubilization and production of indole acetic acid, siderophores, biofilm, 1‐amino‐cyclopropane‐1‐carboxylate deaminase, laccase, and anti‐fungal chemicals. Our study demonstrates that groundnut plant rhizosphere harbors a core microbiome populated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria. A distinct bacterial assemblage at nodulation stage due to predominance of Flavobacteria and Actinobacteria in DNA and RNA derived libraries respectively was also observed. Majority of cultivable isolates exhibiting plant growth promoting activities belonged to Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Of them, Pseudomonas indica and Bacillus megaterium were detected in the rhizosphere samples from all the developmental stages of groundnut plant. This polyphasic study establishes the impact of plant development on rhizobacterial population of groundnut and underscores the applicability of soil isolates as a reliable component in sustainable agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aArachis hypogaea 3aBacillus megaterium 3aDNA 3aFlavobacteria 3aPseudomonas 3abacterial communities 3abiofilm 3adevelopmental stages 3afactor analysis 3agenes 3aindole acetic acid 3alaccase 3amicrobiome 3anodulation 3apeanuts 3aphosphates 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3arhizosphere 3arhizosphere bacteria 3aribosomal RNA 3asiderophores 3asoil 3asolubilization 3asustainable agriculture1 aSengupta, Sanghamitra0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2015 July, v. 55, no. 7 p.922-928dAkademie-Verlagx0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2014006833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012300167300001800290520155100308592002801859650002201887650002201909650001501931650001001946650002401956650001001980650002401990650001902014650001202033650001802045650001802063650002502081650001502106650001302121650002002134650001602154653000702170653000802177653000902185653000802194653000702202653001002209653000802219653000702227653000802234653001402242653000802256653001302264653002602277653001602303700002002319700001602339700001902355700001902374700002302393700006302416773012202479856008502601852000902686655001202695IND60582412620221117015502.0180829e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058241262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoshi, Kyoka12aA unique glycan-isoform of transferrin in cerebrospinal fluid: A potential diagnostic marker for neurological diseases  ap. 2473-2478.  aCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is sequestered from blood by the blood-brain barrier and directly communicates with brain parenchymal interstitial fluid, leading to contain specific biomarkers of neurological diseases.CSF contains glycan isoforms of transferrin (Tf): one appears to be derived from the brain and the other from blood.CSF contains two glycan-isoforms; brain-type Tf and serum-type Tf. Glycan analysis and immunohistochemistry suggest that serum-type Tf having α2, 6sialylated glycans is derived from blood whereas brain-type Tf having GlcNAc-terminated glycans is derived from the choroid plexus, CSF producing tissue. The ratio of serum-type/brain-type Tf differentiates Alzheimer's disease from idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, which is an elderly dementia caused by abnormal metabolism of CSF. The ratios in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients were higher than those of controls and did not appear to be normally distributed. Indeed, detrended normal Quantile-Quantile plot analysis reveals the presence of an independent subgroup showing higher ratios in PD patients. The subgroup of PD shows higher levels of CSF α-synuclein than the rest, indicating that PD includes two subgroups, which differ in levels of brain-type Tf and α-synuclein.Glycosylation in central nervous system appears to be unique. The unique glycan may be a tag for glycoprotein, which is biosynthesized in the central nervous system.

But human intervention accompanied with some natural factors has deteriorated the quality of these habitats. Present study aims to assess the status of avifaunal habitability of 21 floodplain wetlands, interspersed over the lower part of the Ganges delta by using Avifaunal Habitability Index (AHI). Seven widely used Ecological Indicators namely Avifauna Density, Total numbers of Avifauna, Simpson Index of Species Dominance, Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index, Species Richness, Simpsons Reciprocal Index, and Shannon Evenness Index have been used to compute AHI. The result unveils that wetlands like Purbasthali (11.58), Chariganga (5.51), Char Chakundi–I (4.81) have granted higher avifaunal habitability while wetlands like Sudhakarpur (-4.23), Akandanga (-3.5), and Raibali (-3.29) have revealed perceptible degenerated situation. Spatial variation of the habitability status is examined by Wetland Threat Index (WTI) and size of the wetlands. One way ANOVA-Tukey’s post hoc test exhibits that wetlands with less threat (WTI > 0.08) extends healthier habitats (p < 0.001; F = 5.79) and vice-versa. Subsequently, the study also reveals that larger wetlands (> 101 ha) have recorded greater AHI score than the small wetlands ((< 40 ha) at < 0.001 significance level (F = 13.40)). Therefore, this paper not only categorizes some floodplain wetlands based on AHI but also addresses spatial pattern and determinants of such habitability status over the Ganges delta. This study may attract the researchers and policy makers to assess the health of wetlands by using simple composite index in local to global level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aavifauna 3afloodplains 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3ariver deltas 3aspecies richness 3awetlands 3aIndia1 aYasmin, Benojir1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4015-90191 aRoy, Arindam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3549-355X1 aGhose, Subhendu,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4479-440X1 aSiddique, Giyasuddin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5401-05360 tWetlands.g2022 Oct., v. 42, no. 7 p.70-70dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl57834x0277-52127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-022-01591-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245014400203300002000347500001900367520072000386592002801106650000801134650002401142650001501166650002001181650001301201650001301214650002501227650002001252650001901272650001901291700001801310700001901328700001601347700002001363700005901383700001701442700006001459773017201519856008001691852000901771655001201780IND60697270720221122061628.0200603e20200505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069727072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c006202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshihara, Ryo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4862-484310aFabrication of Storable Surface-Functionalized Power-Free Microfluidic Chip for Sensitive MicroRNA Detection Utilizing Ultraviolet Grafting  ap. 10464-10468.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecently, circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in body fluids have been reported as one of the cancer diagnostic biomarkers, and detection of miRNAs is expected to improve early cancer diagnosis.

We combine first-principles molecular dynamics at low temperature with simulated annealing and optimization steps to allow relaxation of the solvent structure without strongly perturbing the geometry of adsorption complexes. On the example of uranyl(VI) adsorption at the (110) edge surface of smectite minerals we show by density functional calculations using periodic slab models that our approach yields more reliable energies than direct optimization. In this way we were able to identify the preferred adsorption complex at this smectite surface. By decomposing the complex formation energies into deprotonation energies of the surface and adsorption energies as well as by a charge analysis of the adsorption sites, we rationalize this result as well as the composition and the structures of less stable adsorbed species. Our computational results are compatible with available experimental structural data of uranyl(VI), adsorbed at montmorillonite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3ageometry 3amechanical methods 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3amontmorillonite 3aquantum mechanics 3asmectite 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aKrüger, Sven,1 aRösch, Notker0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Jan. 14, v. 120, no. 1 p.324-335dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b099023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245012800161300001600289520080700305592002801112650002201140650001201162650001901174650001501193650001401208650002301222650001501245650002201260650001101282650001301293650002001306650001401326650002101340650001701361650001601378650002101394700002001415700002001435700002401455700001501479700002001494773012201514856007201636852000901708655001201717IND60662226820221118055211.0190904e20040415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066222682DNAL7 a10.1039/b401215a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomishige, Keiichi10aCatalytic performance and properties of ceria based catalysts for cyclic carbonate synthesis from glycol and carbon dioxide  ap. 206-214.  aCeria based catalysts are very effective for the synthesis of cyclic carbonate such as ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) by the reaction of CO₂ with ethylene glycol and propylene glycol. In these reactions, polycarbonate and ethers (diethylene glycol and dipropylene glycol) were not detected under optimum reaction conditions. This indicates that the PC and EC formation over CeO₂–ZrO₂ catalysts is highly selective. Catalytic activity was much dependent on the composition and calcination temperature of catalysts.

In India, fly ash bricks are gaining popularity against fired clay bricks due to their green benefits. However, the lack of technical guidelines on mixing methodology, and disproportionate moisture content in raw materials adversely affect the performance and production of fly ash bricks. To mitigate this, dry and powdered form hydrated lime is suggested in place of slaked lime to avoid the excess moisture content. This study experimentally examines the combined effect of two distinct mixing sequences at five different moisture contents on the properties of hydrated lime fly ash (HLF) bricks. Compressive strength, dry bulk density, water absorption, percentage voids, dynamic modulus of elasticity, impact energy, and drying shrinkage were selected as the parameters for comparison of HLF bricks. Bricks with 15% moisture content produced by a two-stage mixing sequence were found to have enhanced mechanical and durability performance. Furthermore, economic and environmental comparisons (in terms of embodied energy and embodied carbon calculations) revealed that HLF bricks are more beneficial compared to fired clay bricks.  aPublisher supplied data 3abricks 3abulk density 3acalcium hydroxide 3acarbon 3aclay 3acompression strength 3adrying 3adurability 3aembodied energy 3afly ash 3aguidelines 3amethodology 3amixing 3amodulus of elasticity 3araw materials 3ashrinkage 3awater content 3awater uptake 3aIndia 0aFly ash bricks 0aMixing sequence 0aMoisture content 0aHydrated lime 0aImpact1 aSiddique, Salman1 aChaudhary, Sandeep0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 20, v. 285 p.124859-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1248593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015700163300001800320520187700338592002802215650002602243650002502269650002102294650001802315650002102333650002202354650001602376650004402392650002402436650001402460650001202474650004402486700001702530700001702547700001402564700001802578700001602596700001402612773014802626856008102774852000902855655001202864IND60438141020221120194953.0151107e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043814102DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-015-8777-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Huiqin13aAn integrated strategy for the systematic characterization and discovery of new indole alkaloids from Uncaria rhynchophylla by UHPLC/DAD/LTQ-Orbitrap-MS  ap. 6057-6070.  aThe exploration of new chemical entities from herbal medicines may provide candidates for the in silico screening of drug leads. However, this significant work is hindered by the presence of multiple classes of plant metabolites and many re-discovered structures. This study presents an integrated strategy that uses ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography/linear ion-trap quadrupole/Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC/LTQ-Orbitrap-MS) coupled with in-house library data for the systematic characterization and discovery of new potentially bioactive molecules. Exploration of the indole alkaloids from Uncaria rhynchophylla (UR) is presented as a model study. Initially, the primary characterization of alkaloids was achieved using mass defect filtering and neutral loss filtering. Subsequently, phytochemical isolation obtained 14 alkaloid compounds as reference standards, including a new one identified as 16,17-dihydro-O-demethylhirsuteine by NMR analyses. The direct-infusion fragmentation behaviors of these isolated alkaloids were studied to provide diagnostic structural information facilitating the rapid differentiation and characterization of four different alkaloid subtypes. Ultimately, after combining the experimental results with a survey of an in-house library containing 129 alkaloids isolated from the Uncaria genus, a total of 92 alkaloids (60 free alkaloids and 32 alkaloid O-glycosides) were identified or tentatively characterized, 56 of which are potential new alkaloids for the Uncaria genus. Hydroxylation on ring A, broad variations in the C-15 side chain, new N-oxides, and numerous O-glycosides, represent the novel features of the newly discovered indole alkaloid structures. These results greatly expand our knowledge of UR chemistry and are useful for the computational screening of potentially bioactive molecules from indole alkaloids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUncaria rhynchophylla 3abioactive properties 3aherbal medicines 3ahydroxylation 3aindole alkaloids 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3areference standards 3ascreening 3asurveys 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aYang, Wenzhi1 aZhang, Yibei1 aYang, Min1 aFeng, Ruihong1 aWu, Wanying1 aGuo, Dean0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2015 Aug., v. 407, no. 20 p.6057-6070dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-015-8777-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245011600159300001600275520106500291592002801356650002601384650002101410650001201431650001801443650001701461650001101478650001301489650001101502650002601513650001001539650001301549653004001562653002501602653002401627653003401651653001801685700002301703700002001726773015501746856007601901852000901977655001201986IND60706171620221119023454.0200807e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070617162DNAL7 a10.18805/IJARe.A-4242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhorbani, E.10aAgro-Morphological Variation in Some Iranian Melon (Cucumismelo L.)

Analysis of variance showed significant differences between genotypes for all quantitative traits. However, the studied melon genotypes were previously clustered in two main groups of inodorous and cantalopensis, cluster analysis classified them in four different groups based on all traits, in particular outlaying Shadegani genotype from Inodorous group. Clustering was also supported by principal components analysis (PCA). The first two PCs contributed 60% of the total variability and demonstrated variations mainly on the basis of yield related traits including fruit number, day to flower, day to harvest, fruit weight, fruit length and other distinctive traits such as rind pattern, peduncle attachment strength, fruit firmness and aroma. Accordingly, agro-morphological traits could be used for variation studies in melons and results might be useful for improving breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural research 3acluster analysis 3aflowers 3afruit quality 3afruit weight 3afruits 3agenotype 3amelons 3amultivariate analysis 3aodors 3apeduncle 0aAgro-morphological characterization 0aDiversity evaluation 0aGenetic improvement 0aPrincipal components analysis 0aWard's method1 aMotallebi-Azar, A.1 aBolandnazar, S.0 tIndian journal of agricultural research.g2020 Apr., v. 54, no. 2 p.161-167dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2026x0976-058X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/IJARe.A-4243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001800094040001800112100002000130245008800150300001400238520107500252592002801327650001401355650002001369650001801389650001101407650001501418650002101433651001501454653001601469653001601485653001801501653002101519700001901540700002201559773017101581852000901752655001201761IND60603990520221120124928.0180716e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060399052DNAL4 amoco-34-01-15  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDale, Pat E. R.10aUsing Present Value as a Simple Approach to Compare Mosquito Larval Control Methods  ap. 25-33.  aSimple economic-based comparisons of source reduction and larvicide treatment are generally lacking in the mosquito control literature. The aim is to address this by developing an Excel tool that calculates the total present value (PV) of control methods. We use 15 years as the time frame, but this can be varied. Total PV is calculated based on the cost of each method at the start. A 3% discount rate is applied to recurring costs, and one-off costs are included throughout because they are part of the total PV. The data are based on information provided by mosquito control agencies in southeast Queensland, Australia. Values in the tool can be simply edited to reflect specific program characteristics. The outcome for the data used showed that source reduction is an appropriate option if maintenance is minimal. When major maintenance is needed, then larviciding may be the better option, particularly if money is the main consideration. However, if the frequency of applying larvicides increases, then source reduction becomes an increasingly attractive option.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3acontrol methods 3adiscount rate 3alarvae 3alarvicides 3amosquito control 3aQueensland 0aComparisons 0alarviciding 0apresent value 0asource reduction1 aKnight, Jon M.1 aDaniels, Peter L.0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2018 Mar., v. 34, no. 1 p.25-33dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Inc.wJournal:jnl46567x8756-971X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007800170520144200248592002801690650002101718650001501739650001001754650001201764650001601776650000901792650001601801650001901817650000701836650001901843650002101862650000901883650001501892700001701907700002401924700001901948773012601967856008502093852000902178655001202187IND60768366120221120184944.0220225e20220126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076836612DNAL7 a10.3390/horticulturae80201112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodgers, Dylan 10aComplementary Nutrients in Decoupled Aquaponics Enhance Basil Performance  aAquaponics combines raising fish and growing plants by recycling water and nutrients to reduce water consumption and reliance on chemical fertilizers. Coupled aquaponics systems recirculate water between fish and plant crops, whereas decoupled systems send mineralized fish effluent and wastewater unidirectionally to an independent hydroponic loop. Decoupling enables changes to the water, such as pH adjustments and complementary nutrient additions, to promote plant performance. In this study, basil, Ocimum basilicum (L.), was transplanted into 4 L containers filled with decoupled aquaponic (DAP), nutrient-complemented decoupled aquaponic (DAP+), or chemical-based conventional hydroponic (CON) nutrient solutions and grown for 21 days at pH 5.8. Plants grown in DAP+ and CON had greater biomass, height, and Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) chlorophyll index and lower root:shoot biomass ratios than those in DAP. Shoot fresh and dry biomass was 11% greater for CON than DAP+, while height, SPAD chlorophyll index, and root:shoot ratio did not differ. We concluded that added nutrients in DAP+ enhanced performance compared to DAP, and the biologically derived nutrition in DAP+ enhanced performance to be similar, but not equal, to CON. We cannot recommend specific adjustments to the targeted blend of complementary nutrients tested, but findings suggest that complementary nutrients are effective in decoupled aquaponics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOcimum basilicum 3aaquaponics 3abasil 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3afish 3ahydroponics 3amineralization 3apH 3aplant analysis 3aroot shoot ratio 3asoil 3awastewater1 aWon, Eugene 1 aTimmons, Michael B.1 aMattson, Neil 0 tHorticulturae.g2022 Jan. 26, v. 8, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae80201113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002600137245006900163300001600232520137100248592002801619650001901647650001401666650000901680650001001689650001101699650001601710650002401726650001501750650000901765650002001774650001801794650002501812651001401837700002901851700001901880700002301899700002201922773011101944856007102055852000902126655001202135IND60519122220221119154100.0160420e199411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051912222DNAL7 a10.2307/19420112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarpenter, Stephen R.10aInteractions of Anglers and Walleyes in Escanaba Lake, Wisconsin  ap. 822-832.  aInteractions of anglers and walleyes (Stizostedion vitreum vitreum) were analyzed by fitting difference equations to a 33—yr time series from Escanaba Lake, Wisconsin. Fish population dynamics were density—dependent, and harvest by anglers followed a sigmoid functional response. The deterministic form of the model was stable and suggested that the fishery could withstand relatively high exploitation rates. The stochastic form of the model compared management strategies using the probabilities of increased or decreased fish and angler populations and the probability that fish populations will fall below a threshold level. These calculations exposed high risks associated with management strategies based on deterministic, equilibrium equations. The probabilities of sustaining both the fish stock and angler effort increase if harvest rates are reduced below the optimum derived from deterministic models. Consideration of angler dynamics reduced the prediction error of fish stock forecasts and substantially altered risk assessments and management recommendations. If angler dynamics were ignored, the optimal exploitation rate and the risk of overfishing would be overestimated. Lake sport fishery assessments can be improved by coupling models of fish dynamics at the scale of individual lakes with angler models at the larger scale of lake districts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSander vitreus 3aequations 3afish 3alakes 3amodels 3aoverfishing 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asport fishing 3atime series analysis 3aWisconsin1 aMunoz-Del-Rio, Alejandro1 aNewman, Steven1 aRasmussen, Paul W.1 aJohnson, Brett M.0 tEcological applications.g1994 Nov., v. 4, no. 4 p.822-832dEcological Society of Americax1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19420113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009200165300001800257520129700275592002801572650001401600650002001614650002701634650001301661650002001674700001401694700001301708700001601721700001301737700001501750773010501765856008101870852000901951655001201960IND60081676520221120163205.0141009e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008167652DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-014-3169-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Weimin M.10aEffects of salt solutions on the hydro-mechanical behavior of compacted GMZ01 Bentonite  ap. 2621-2630.  aIn this study, the effects of salinity of infiltrating solutions on the swelling strain, compressibility, and hydraulic conductivity of compacted GMZ01 Bentonite were investigated. After swelling under vertical load using either distilled water or NaCl solutions with concentrations of 0.1, 0.5 M, and 1 M, laboratory oedometer tests were conducted on the compacted GMZ01 Bentonite. Based on the oedometer test results, hydraulic conductivity was determined using the Casagrande’s method. Results show that the swelling strain of highly compacted GMZ01 Bentonite decreases as the concentration of NaCl solution increases. The compression index C c * increases and then turns to decrease with an increase in the vertical stress or a decrease in the void ratio for different solutions, and the C c * decreases as the concentration of NaCl solution increases. The secondary consolidation coefficient C α increases linearly with the increase of the compression index C c * . Furthermore, a bi-linear relationship between the swelling index C ₛ * and the secondary consolidation coefficient C α can be characterized clearly. The hydraulic conductivity increases as the concentration of NaCl solution increases, however, this increase can be prevented if a high confining stress is applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3abentonite 3acompressibility 3ahydraulic conductivity 3asalinity 3asodium chloride1 aZhang, F.1 aChen, B.1 aChen, Y.

Berk. and Br., along with two strains of Pisolithus tinctorius (Pers.) Coker and Couch, on the proliferation and subsequent maturation of two embryogenic cell lines of Abies cephalonica Loud., designated lines 6 and 8, were investigated. In the presence of these ECM fungi, the proliferation of both embryogenic cell lines was inhibited. L. bicolor and P. tinctorius strain 2 resulted in the highest inhibition rates. On the other hand, cultivation of embryogenic cultures along with ECM fungi, termed a dual culture, increased radial growth of both P. tinctorius strains; whereas, L. bicolor and L. laccata did not grow as well in the presence of embryogenic cell masses. The dual culture during the proliferation period of embryogenic cells, however, enhanced the subsequent embryo formation and maturation of A. cephalonica; i.e. the capability of embryogenic cell lines to form somatic embryos as well as increasing the mean number of somatic embryos per 1 g fresh weight of embryogenic cell mass. However, levels of responses were highly dependent on the interaction between the specific embryogenic cell line and fungal strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies cephalonica 3aLaccaria bicolor 3aLaccaria laccata 3aPisolithus tinctorius 3acell differentiation 3acell proliferation 3aectomycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3asomatic embryogenesis 3asomatic embryos1 aNiemi, Karoliina1 aGömöry, Dušan1 aHäggman, Hely,0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2012 May, v. 109, no. 2 p.353-361dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-011-0100-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01350naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011200164300001400276500001400290520029500304592002800599650001300627650002300640650001100663650001600674650001900690651001000709653001700719653002200736653001300758700001800771700001400789773009400803856008200897852000900979655001200988IND60699106720221116230245.0210116e20180813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069910672DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.781.257132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xiaoying12aA new species of Leptopulvinaria Kanda from China, with a key to species (Hemiptera, Coccomorpha, Coccidae)  ap. 59-66.  aNAL-light  aA new species Leptopulvinaria sapinda sp. n. is described and illustrated based on adult females collected on Sapindus saponaria (Sapindaceae) from Shanghai and Jiangsu.

This paper aims to study the effect of activated carbon (AC) on the property of bio-treated China Standard sand. Six sample groups were prepared considering various dosages of cementation solutions and bacterial suspensions. In each group, samples were prepared at six different AC ratios (0%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 3% by weight of sand). Bacterial retention ability, calcium carbonate mass, unconfined compression strength (UCS), and microstructures of bio-treated samples were examined and evaluated in the presence of AC. It was found that the improved yield of calcium carbonate crystals and increased UCS were correlated to the enhanced bacterial retention ability attributed to AC. In addition, the test results showed that the amount of cementation solution played an important role in the MICP process, but volume variation of the bacterial suspension had a little effect on the bio-treated samples.  aPublisher supplied data  a51409102cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aU1704243cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a172102310190cHenan Science and Technology Project 3aactivated carbon 3abacteria 3acalcium carbonate 3achemical precipitation 3acompression strength 3acrystals 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3asand 3asoil 3aChina1 aFan, Cunbin1 aLiu, Pinghui1 aFang, Houguo1 aHuang, Zhiquan0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2018 Sept., v. 77, no. 17 p.615-615dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7797-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245014300209500001400352520173800366592002802104650001902132650001402151650001902165650001402184650001102198650002602209650001702235650001402252650002202266650001502288650001002303650001502313650002802328650002502356650002802381651001802409653003102427653001802458653003502476653001302511653001902524700001802543700002402561700006502585773011302650856008602763852000902849655001202858IND60716271920221120053131.0210121e20210220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071627192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1248632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmar, Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5773-595414aThe imperativeness of environmental quality in the United States transportation sector amidst biomass-fossil energy consumption and growth  aNAL-light  aThe recent historical increase in energy-related CO₂ emissions globally have put the United States of America’s (USA) transportation sector in the spotlight, courtesy of the significantly high pollutant emissions from this particular sector. Taking a cue from this, this paper follows sustainable development goals of the United Nations, and investigates the impact of biomass energy consumption, fossil fuel energy consumption, and economic growth (GDP) on carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions in the transportation sector of the USA. In doing so, this study also employs the Gregory-Hansen cointegration, Hatemi-J cointegration, cointegration regression (FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR), and Spectral Breitung-Candelon causality test for the period between 1981Q1 and 2019Q4. The findings reveal that (i) a significant nonlinear cointegration among the environmental quality determinants is observed, using the threshold cointegration test. This test determines the structural breaks endogenously and combines two cointegration tests, namely the Gregory-Hansen Cointegration and Hatemi-J Cointegration tests; (ii) while the use of biomass energy consumption and real GDP have a negative effect on CO₂ emissions in the transportation sector, the rising fossil fuel energy consumption is associated with increasing the CO₂ emissions that are stemming from the transportation sector; (iii) in the long-run, biomass energy consumption, fossil fuel energy consumption, and real GDP cause CO₂ emissions to stem from the transportation sector in the USA at different frequency levels. In general, the current study offers policy insights for the transportation sector of the USA and other similar economies that replicate the same conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations 3abioenergy 3acarbon dioxide 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenvironmental quality 3afossil fuels 3afrequency 3aissues and policy 3aobjectives 3apaper 3apollutants 3asustainable development 3atime series analysis 3atransportation industry 3aUnited States 0aBiomass energy consumption 0aCO2 emissions 0aFossil fuel energy consumption 0aReal GDP 0aTransportation1 aJi, Xiangfeng1 aKirikkaleli, Dervis1 aAlola, Andrew Adewale1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5355-37070 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 20, v. 285 p.124863-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1248633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03709naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245007900132520191200211592002802123650001402151650002802165650002002193650001102213650001302224650001902237650001702256650001702273650001902290650001802309650002302327650001702350650001602367650001102383650001102394650002102405651001502426651001902441651001102460651001702471651001002488700002102498700001502519700002202534700002102556700002302577700002502600700002202625700001902647700002402666700002202690773011702712856028002829961001303109852000903122655001203131IND60477782220221119103523.0160106e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047778222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartstein, Jill10aImpact of the HEALTHY study on vending machine offerings in middle schools  aPurpose/Objectives: The purpose of this study is to report the impact of the three-year middle school-based HEALTHY study on intervention school vending machine offerings. There were two goals for the vending machines: serve only dessert/snack foods with 200 kilocalories or less per single serving package, and eliminate 100% fruit juice and beverages with added sugar. Methods Six schools in each of seven cities (Houston, TX, San Antonio, TX, Irvine, CA, Portland, OR, Pittsburg, PA, Philadelphia, PA, and Chapel Hill, NC) were randomized into intervention (n=21 schools) or control (n=21 schools) groups, with three intervention and three control schools per city. All items in vending machine slots were tallied twice in the fall of 2006 for baseline data and twice at the end of the study, in 2009. The percentage of total slots for each food/beverage category was calculated and compared between intervention and control schools at the end of study, using the Pearson chi-square test statistic. Results: At baseline, 15 intervention and 15 control schools had beverage and/or snack vending machines, compared with 11 intervention and 11 control schools at the end of the study. At the end of study, all of the intervention schools with beverage vending machines, but only one out of the nine control schools, met the beverage goal. The snack goal was met by all of the intervention schools and only one of the four control schools with snack vending machines. Applications to Child Nutrition Professionals: The HEALTHY study's vending machine beverage and snack goals were successfully achieved in intervention schools, reducing access to less healthy food items outside the school meals program. Although the effect of these changes on student diet, energy balance and growth is unknown, these results suggest that healthier options for snacks can successfully be offered in school vending machines.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3achi-square distribution 3achild nutrition 3acities 3adesserts 3aenergy balance 3afruit juices 3ahealthy diet 3amiddle schools 3anutritionists 3aoffer versus serve 3aschool meals 3asnack foods 3asnacks 3asugars 3avending machines 3aCalifornia 3aNorth Carolina 3aOregon 3aPennsylvania 3aTexas1 aCullen, Karen W.1 aVirus, Amy1 aGhormli, Laure El1 aVolpe, Stella L.1 aStaten, Myrlene A.1 aBridgman, Jessica C.1 aStadler, Diane D.1 aGillis, Bonnie1 aMcCormick, Sarah B.1 aMobley, Connie C.0 tJournal of child nutrition & management.g2011 Fall, v. 35, no. 2dSchool Nutrition Associationx1559-56767nnas40uhttp://www.schoolnutrition.org/5--News-and-Publications/4--The-Journal-of-Child-Nutrition-and-Management/Fall-2011/Volume-35,-Issue-2,-Fall-2011---Hartstein,-Cullen,-Virus,-Ghormli,-Volpe,-Staten,-Bridgman,-Stadler,-Gillis,-McCormick,-Mobley/3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01934naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245005200165300001600217500001500233520079000248592002801038650001401066650002401080650002101104650000801125650001501133650001001148650001901158650001001177650002801187650002701215650001701242650001001259653001001269700002101279700003201300773009801332856008501430852000901515655001201524IND4451709020221119015038.0141112e20110510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445170902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2010.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVijayan, K.10aGermplasm conservation in mulberry (Morus spp.)  ap. 371-379.  a2019-12-06  aAs the threat from urbanization, climatic changes, out breaks of new diseases and pests, and the frequent occurrence of natural calamities increases as a result of global warming, conservation of plant genetic resources is seen widely as a necessary step to preserve the world's germplasm for posterity.

From their deposition in the vagina to final migration in the oviduct, sperm pass through the different compartments of the genital tract in which they encounter different environments. The cervix and the uterotubal junction (UTJ) are two barriers with different relative importance according to the species. The protein composition, the degree of glycosylation and the hydration of the cervical mucus change during the oestrous cycle. Several sperm surface proteins are associated with their migration through the cervical mucus and the UTJ. Data regarding the interaction of sperm with secretions of the epithelial tissue lining the different compartments of the female genital tract during the sperm transit are reviewed, with a particular emphasis on the migration of sperm through the cervix.  aPublisher supplied data 3acervical mucus 3aestrous cycle 3afemale genitalia 3aprotein composition 3asperm transport 3aspermatozoa 3asurface proteins 3avagina 2aAnimals 2aEpithelial Cellsxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFertilizationxphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulationxphysiology 2aGenitalia, Femalexphysiology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aSperm Motilityxphysiology 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2012 Aug., v. 47 Suppl s4 p.348-352dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2012.02097.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013700168300001800305520100700323592002801330650001301358650001501371650001501386650001201401650001001413650001001423650001501433650001301448650001101461650001701472650002501489700002701514700002401541700002701565773014801592856008101740852000901821655001201830IND60438141320221120194844.0151107e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043814132DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-015-8784-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSonnberg, Saskia10aDetection of tetrahydrocannabinol residues on hands by ion-mobility spectrometry (IMS).

Regarding the usefulness of hand residues as potential samples for determining THC handling and abuse, we studied the correlation between data obtained from cannabis consumers who were classified as positive after saliva analysis and from those who were classified as positive on the basis of the information from hand-residue analysis. Sampling consisted of wiping the hands with borosilicate glass microfiber filters and introducing these directly into the IMS after thermal desorption. The possibility of false positive responses, resulting from the presence of other compounds with a similar drift time to THC, was evaluated and minimised by applying the truncated negative second-derivative algorithm. The possibility of false negative responses, mainly caused by competitive ionisation resulting from nicotine, was also studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCannabis 3aalgorithms 3adesorption 3afilters 3aglass 3ahands 3aionization 3anicotine 3asaliva 3aspectroscopy 3atetrahydrocannabinol1 aArmenta, S.q(Sergio),1 aGarrigues, Salvador1 aGuardia, Miguel de la,0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2015 Aug., v. 407, no. 20 p.5999-6008dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-015-8784-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01931naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001800094040001800112100001700130245006400147300001400211520062700225592002800852650002000880650003700900650001500937650001100952650001600963650001200979650001200991650001101003650001801014650002101032650001501053650001201068650001101080651001301091653003001104653002401134653002001158653002301178653002001201700001701221700002301238700002001261773017101281852000901452655001201461IND60603990720221120125029.0180716e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060399072DNAL4 amoco-34-01-09  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradt, David10aFirst Record of Aedes japonicus japonicus in Oklahoma, 2017  ap. 38-41.  aIn spring 2017, mosquito larvae were collected from 25 sites across eastern Oklahoma as part of a Zika virus vector surveillance effort.

In the earlier work, it was established that zircons in these pegmatites have suffered a high degree of metamictization that has enhanced continuous loss of some radionuclides since the time of emplacement of the pegmatite host rock to the present. The aim of this work is to determine whether or not there is corresponding increase in the concentration of radionuclides in groundwater in the study area. Fifteen groundwater samples were collected from both hand dug wells and boreholes in the area. Ten samples were from Ede town, two samples each from nearby communities of Iddo and Ekuro and one from Iwoye, where the bedrocks were not pegmatites. All the 15 samples were analyzed with the Sodium Iodide scintillator (NaI [Tl]) detector at the Centre for Energy Research and Development, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. The results showed varying concentrations of the radionuclides in the water samples. Activity concentrations of Potassium-40 (⁴⁰K) indicated an average value of 17.149 Bq/L for samples from Ede, 9.265 Bq/L for Iddo, 6.6 Bq/L for Ekuro, while Iwoye has a value of 21.21 Bq/L. The Uranium-238 (²³⁸U) series had an average value of 13.64 Bq/L for Ede, 13.49 Bq/L for Ekuro, 11.685 Bq/L for Iddo and 12.04 Bq/L for the lone sample from Iwoye. Thorium-232 (²³²Th) series had an average value of 11.182 Bq/L for Ede, while average values of 7.79 Bq/L and 9.025 Bq/L, respectively, were recorded for Iddo and Ekuro and 12.25 Bq/L for Iwoye. The annual effective dose level of ⁴⁰K is generally below the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended dosage of 0.1 mSv/y except for three locations, while those of ²³⁸U and ²³²Th are in excess of the standard values. The high radionuclides in the groundwater in the study area were not due to anthropogenic sources but directly due to geological processes which release the radioisotopes from rocks after weathering, continuous loss from metamict minerals and natural lateral mobility from regions of radionuclides’ release to other areas. There is thus the need to carry out systematic studies of the radionuclides concentrations on regional scale in the area which could lead to investigating on both short- and long-term health effects on organic species in these areas, and development of purification systems before utilizing water from the areas for domestic and industrial purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3agroundwater 3aminerals 3apotassium 3aradionuclides 3arocks 3athorium 3auranium 3aweathering 3awells 3aNigeria1 aOlorunfemi, A.

The protocol, based on an easy and rapid extraction with a water/acetonitrile 1 % formic acid solution, followed by sonication and centrifugation, exploits an LC-diode array detector-quadrupole-time-of-flight (DAD-QTOF) system. The extraction method was optimized both at high concentrations and at trace levels. These two situations are typically encountered in pharmaceutical formulations and herbal food supplements. Carryover effects, never reported before and occurring mainly for vardenafil, were overcome using a polymer-based column. An in-house validation was carried out using five blanks of different bulk matrices spiked with seven standard analytes, namely yohimbine, sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil, homosildenafil, pseudovardenafil and hydroxyhomovardenafil. Reliable quantitation was possible using a conventional standard solution for all the pharmaceutical and herbal samples considered, as matrix effects were eliminated. Accuracy ranged from 80.9 to 108.1 % with overall relative standard deviation (RSD) <11 % (N = 15), measured at 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 μg/g. Limits of detection (LODs) obtained ensured the determination of cross contaminations at nanogram per gram levels. A database with 82 PDE-5 inhibitor analogues was implemented for automatic non-target analysis. Among the 26 samples of dietary supplements and herbal remedies bulk marketed for erectile dysfunctions, three samples were found to be contaminated with both registered and unregistered synthetic PDE-5 inhibitors, i.e. yohimbine, sildenafil, dimethylsildenafil and thiodimethylsildenafil or thiomethisosildenafil. The occurrence of such contaminations, both at trace levels and at pharmaceutical dosage, indicates the illicit use of synthetic PDE-5 analogues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3acentrifugation 3achromatography 3adatabases 3adetection limit 3adietary supplements 3adrug formulations 3aformic acid 3aherbal medicines 3ascreening 3ayohimbine1 aPivato, Antonio1 aBogialli, Sara1 aPastore, Paolo0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2015 Aug., v. 407, no. 20 p.6207-6216dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-015-8801-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011700168300001800285520139200303592002801695650001901723650002001742650000901762650001001771650001701781650002601798650002201824650001701846650000901863650001701872650002101889650001301910650002101923653002501944653001801969653001001987653001701997653001202014700001902026700002202045700002302067773011802090856008702208852000902295655001202304IND60569402220221123034345.0170527e20150702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056940222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b001282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xinzhu10aComprehensive Metabolic Profiling of Age-Related Mitochondrial Dysfunction in the High-Fat-Fed ob/ob Mouse Heart  ap. 2849-2862.  aThe ectopic deposition of fat is thought to lead to lipotoxicity and has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and diabetic cardiomyopathy. We have measured mitochondrial respiratory capacities in the hearts of ob/ob and wild-type mice on either a regular chow (RCD) or high-fat (HFD) diet across four age groups to investigate the impact of diet and age on mitochondrial function alongside a comprehensive strategy for metabolic profiling of the tissue. Myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction was only evident in ob/ob mice on RCD at 14 months, but it was detectable at 3 months on the HFD. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) was used to study the profiles of acylcarnitines and the accumulation of triglycerides, but neither class of lipid was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. However, a targeted LC–MS/MS analysis of markers of oxidative stress demonstrated increases in GSSG/GSH and 8-oxoguanine, in addition to the accumulation of diacylglycerols, which are lipid species linked to lipotoxicity. Our results demonstrate that myocardial mitochondria in ob/ob mice on RCD maintained a similar respiratory capacity to that of wild type until a late stage in aging. However, on a HFD, unlike wild-type mice, ob/ob mice failed to increase mitochondrial respiration, which may be associated with a complex I defect following increased oxidative damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiomyopathy 3adiacylglycerols 3adiet 3aheart 3alipotoxicity 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolomics 3amice 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3aproteome 3atriacylglycerols 0aRespiratory capacity 0ahigh-fat diet 0aaging 0ametabolomics 0aobesity1 aWest, James A.1 aMurray, Andrew J.1 aGriffin, Julian L.0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2015 July 02, v. 14, no. 7 p.2849-2862dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jproteome.5b001283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004700092040001800139100002500157245008900182300001800271500000900289520205300298592002802351650001202379650001302391650001302404650001302417650002402430650001602454650002002470650003002490650002202520700003102542700002102573773021002594852000902804856009402813655001202907IND2046268020221119111234.0191028e199409  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204626802DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1994.00472425002300050029x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrzyszowska, Anna J.10aAssessment of the Fate of Two Herbicides in a Wyoming Rangeland Soil: Column Studies  ap. 1051-1058.  aepub  aExtensive use of dicamba (2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid) and picloram (4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid) in arid Wyoming, along with large volumes of irrigation water used in some areas, has created a concern for the potential contamination of surface and groundwaters by these herbicides. Persistence and mobility of dicamba and picloram were investigated in a Wyoming rangeland soil using batch adsorption and soil column studies. The objectives of this study were to characterize soil chemical and physical properties that affect herbicide transport, examine herbicide sorption, model herbicide movement, and estimate degradation rate constants. Essentially no sorption of dicamba was detected; however, picloram sorption was greatest in the highest organic C content horizon. Both saturated (5.90, 2.96, and 0.82 kg ha⁻¹ dicamba and 1.85, 0.97, and 0.47 kg ha⁻¹ picloram) and unsaturated (2.76 and 1.00 kg ha⁻¹ for dicamba and picloram, respectively) column experiments were conducted. The herbicides and Br tracer (34, 38, 69, and 137 mg L⁻¹) were displaced through the soil columns using distilled water that was added in daily increments (60 mL d⁻¹). Degradation rate constants were calculated using both a simple recovery fraction technique and by matching LEACHP-generated breakthrough curves to experimental data. For the two columns receiving intermediate application rates, anaerobic picloram dissipation was more rapid (t₁/₂ = 19 d) than for aerobic conditions (t₁/₂ = 87 d). The rate of dissipation of dicamha was approximately the same under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (t₁/₂ = 15 and 17 d in the saturated and unsaturated columns, respectively). Piclorum and dicamba dissipation was more rapid at the lowest application rates, with t₁/₂ of 13 and 10 d. At the highest application rates, t₁/₂ of 23 and 17 d were measured for picloram and dicamba, respectively. Both herbicides were found to be highly mobile, with the mobility of picloram increasing at higher pore-water velocities.  aPublisher supplied data 3adicamba 3apicloram 3aleaching 3asorption 3asoil organic matter 3adegradation 3arangeland soils 3agroundwater contamination 3asimulation models1 aAllen, Richq(Richard D.),1 aVance, George F.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g1994 Sept., v. 23, no. 5 p.1051-1058dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1994.00472425002300050029x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02039naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245005200179300001600231520044000247592002800687650001300715650001600728650001600744650001300760650001400773650001400787650001600801650002800817650002300845651001100868653002300879653001600902653001500918653003200933653001500965653002000980653001601000653001501016653002401031653001401055700002801069700002001097700002301117700002401140700003001164700002401194773020001218856008201418852000901500655001201509IND60544201820221119211751.0190415e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054420182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rmb.2015.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBautista-Hernández, Silvia10aGeastrum violaceum, registro nuevo para México  ap. 569-572.  aGeastrum violaceum is recorded for the first time to the Mexican mycobiota of the tropical dry forest.

Electrospun nanofibrous substrates have been pursued as platforms for tissue engineering and cell studies that recapitulate features of the native ECM, in particular its fibrous nature. In recent years, progress in the design of electrospun hydrogel systems has demonstrated that molecular design also enables unique studies of cellular behaviors. In comparison to the use of hydrophobic polymeric materials, electrospinning hydrophilic materials that crosslink to form hydrogels offer the potential to achieve the water-swollen, nanofibrous characteristics of endogenous ECM. Although electrospun hydrogels require an additional crosslinking step to stabilize the fibers (allowing fibers to swell with water instead of dissolving) in comparison to their hydrophobic counterparts, researchers have made significant advances in leveraging hydrogel chemistries to incorporate biochemical and dynamic functionalities within the fibers. Consequently, dynamic biophysical and biochemical properties can be engineered into hydrophilic nanofibers that would be difficult to engineer in hydrophobic systems without strategic and sometimes intensive post-processing techniques. This Review describes common methodologies to control biophysical and biochemical properties of both electrospun hydrophobic and hydrogel nanofibers, with an emphasis on highlighting recent progress using hydrogel nanofibers with engineered dynamic complexities to develop culture systems for the study of biological function, dysfunction, development, and regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3acrosslinking 3aextracellular matrix 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ananofibers 3apolymers1 aHighley, Christopher B.0 tBiomaterials science.g2021 June 15, v. 9, no. 12 p.4228-4245dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0bm01588a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008400166300001600250520185600266592002802122650002302150650001202173650002202185650001502207650001402222650001202236650001602248650002302264650000902287650000902296650001702305650001702322651001002339700001802349700002102367700002802388700002102416700002402437773011402461856008302575852000902658655001202667IND60791897220221119175757.0220902e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079189722DNAL7 a10.1007/s13165-022-00399-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaniya, Seema10aRice accessions of Gorkha District of Nepal and their drought tolerance ability  ap. 419-429.  aNepal is considered as one of the hotspots of rice landraces. Currently, Nepalese farmers are attracted toward improved and exotic rice varieties, and hence, the local landraces are becoming endangered. On the other hand, rice has been facing problems of changing climatic events such as drought. This study aims to document the rice accessions from two of the villages of Gorkha District, Gandaki Province, Nepal, and assess the drought tolerance ability of the selected landraces. A total of 13 landraces and 5 improved rice varieties were reported from the study area. Among them, Anpjhutta and Anadi were the popular landraces while Mana-muri and Jhino-masino were disappeared from the study area. Other landraces such as Sobhara, Kalo-masino, Marshi, Taichin, Jhinuwa, Ekle, Seto-masino, Pokhreli, and Krishnabeli were the varieties that are at the risk of extinction. Desertion of seed storage habits, introduction of improved/exotic varieties, advertisement, and availability of seeds in the local market are the factors affecting the renunciation of the rice landraces. Results after growing the rice varieties such as Jhapamansuli and landraces Anpjhutta, Kartika, and Aanadi under drought-stressed conditions showed that the Anpjhutta and Jhapamansuli can accumulate high biomass as compared to others including improved varieties (Khumal-8 and Khumal-10). In addition, mycorrhizal association in these varieties was comparatively high than other varieties. In the varieties Khumal-10 and Anadi the mycorrhizae association increased in response to droughts. Overall, the varieties Jhapamansuli and Anpjhutta are the best-suited varieties under droughts in terms of biomass accumulation under drought stress. Therefore, such landraces should be preserved and utilized for the production of high-yielding and drought-tolerant varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aextinction 3alandraces 3amarkets 3amycorrhizae 3aorganic production 3arice 3arisk 3aseed storage 3awater stress 3aNepal1 aThapa, Lal B.1 aPant, Deepak Raj1 aPokhrel, Chandra Prasad1 aPant, Ramesh Raj1 aPal, Khadka Bahadur0 tOrganic agriculture.g2022 Sept., v. 12, no. 3 p.419-429dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:2238x1879-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13165-022-00399-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245011600180520127700296592002801573650000801601650000801609650001501617650001401632650002401646650002001670650001401690653001501704653002901719653003101748653002401779653003301803653002001836700002301856700002401879700002201903700002001925700002101945700002401966700002401990700002302014700001702037773009102054856009002145852000902235655001202244IND60736859320221119213828.0211129e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073685932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1307172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSohrabi, Hessamaddin10aNanoscale Metal-Organic Frameworks: Recent developments in synthesis, modifications and bioimaging applications  aPorous Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as eye-catching materials in recent years. They are widely used in numerous fields of chemistry thanks to their desirable properties. MOFs have a key role in the development of bioimaging platforms that are hopefully expected to effectually pave the way for accurate and selective detection and diagnosis of abnormalities. Recently, many types of MOFs have been employed for detection of RNA, DNA, enzyme activity and small-biomolecules, as well as for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), which are valuable methods for clinical analysis. The optimal performance of the MOF in the bio-imaging field depends on the core structure, synthesis method and modifications processes. In this review, we have attempted to present crucial parameters for designing and achieving an efficient MOF as bioimaging platforms, and provide a roadmap for researchers in this field. Moreover, the influence of modifications/fractionalizations on MOFs performance has been thoroughly discussed and challenging problems have been extensively addressed. Consideration is mainly focused on the principal concepts and applications that have been achieved to modify and synthesize advanced MOFs for future applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3abioimaging 3achemistry 3acomputed tomography 3aenzyme activity 3amagnetism 0aBioimaging 0aMetal-organic frameworks 0aMagnetic resonance imaging 0aComputed tomography 0aPositron-emission tomography 0aOptical imaging1 aJavanbakht, Siamak1 aOroojalian, Fatemeh1 aRouhani, Farzaneh1 aShaabani, Ahmad1 aMajidi, Mir Reza1 aHashemzaei, Mahmoud1 aHanifehpour, Younes1 aMokhtarzadeh, Ahad1 aMorsali, Ali0 tChemosphere.g2021 Oct., v. 281 p.130717-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1307173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011800157300001800275500001900293520098300312592002801295650002801323650002101351650001901372650001501391650001001406650001401416650001301430650000901443650001801452650001201470650001401482650002401496700001301520700001401533700001701547700001901564773013001583856007401713852000901787655001201796IND60741585820221118102439.0210616e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074158582DNAL7 a10.1039/d0bm01766c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chendan10aTopical delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs using nano-hybrid hydrogels to inhibit post-surgical tumour recurrence  ap. 4356-4363.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResidual microtumours after surgical resection leading to tumour relapse is one of the major challenges for cancer therapy. Herein, we developed a nano-hybrid oligopeptide hydrogel for topical delivery of a chemotherapeutic drug, docetaxel (DTX), to inhibit the post-surgical tumour recurrence. This nano-hybrid hydrogel (DTX-CTs/Gel) was prepared by encapsulating DTX in cell-penetrating peptide-modified transfersomes followed by embedment in an oligopeptide hydrogel. The obtained DTX-CTs/Gel showed paintable and injectable properties, and could support prolonged retention at the administrated sites after topical administration. DTX-CTs released from the hydrogel presented high skin and tumour penetration capabilities, and increased the accumulation of DTX in the cancer cells leading to enhanced cell death. We showed that the topical delivery of DTX using DTX-CTs/Gel efficiently slowed down the tumour relapse in post-surgical mouse melanoma and breast tumour models.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3abreast neoplasms 3acancer therapy 3acell death 3adrugs 3ahydrogels 3amelanoma 3amice 3aoligopeptides 3arelapse 3aresection 3atopical application1 aMa, Yudi1 aGuo, Song1 aHe, Bingfang1 aJiang, Tianyue0 tBiomaterials science.g2021 June 15, v. 9, no. 12 p.4356-4363dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0bm01766c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245009100166300001400257520116300271592002801434650001101462650002501473650002701498650002301525650001801548650001401566650001001580653001601590653003301606653003201639653001101671653001301682653002201695653003501717653003901752653001101791653001801802700002501820700002101845773010401866856007801970852000902048655001202057IND60520077520221118035319.0160513e20150605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052007752DNAL7 a10.1515/hepo-2015-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen Farhat, Mouna10aOil yield and fatty acid profile of seeds of three Salvia species. A comparative study  ap. 14-29.  aA comparative study of the oil yield and fatty acid composition of three Salvia species seeds collected in different locations has been conducted. Seed oil extraction was made using a Soxhlet-extractor and fatty acid analysis was undertaken using a GC-FID. The effect of the collecting site on oil yield, as well as the content of individual fatty acid and total fatty acid and fatty acid content was significant. Seed oil yield varied from 14.94 to 22.83% and the total fatty acids ranged from 67.36 to 82.49 mg/g DW. α-Linolenic (24.02-49.19%), linoleic (20.13-42.88%), oleic (12.97-17.81%) and palmitic (8.37-16.63%) acids were the most abundant fatty acids in all analyzed samples. α-Linolenic acid was found to be the major fatty acid in S. verbenaca and S. officinalis species, however, S. aegyptiaca was characterized by the prevalence of linoleic acid. Among the unsaturated fatty acids, which were represented in all samples in high amounts (78.16-89.34%), the polyunsaturated fatty acids (α-linolenic and linoleic acids) showed important levels ranging from 63.09 to 74.71%. Seeds of S. verbenaca were the richest in polyunsaturated fatty acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvia 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3afatty acid composition 3agas chromatography 3alinoleic acid 3aseed oils 3aseeds 0afatty acids 0aprincipal component analysis 0apolyunsaturated fatty acids 0aSalvia 0aseed oil 0akwasy tłuszczowe 0aanaliza składowych głównych 0awielonienasycone kwasy tłuszczowe 0aSalvia 0aolej z nasion1 aChaouch -Hamada, Rym1 aLandoulsi, Ahmed0 tHerba Polonica.g2015 June 5, v. 61, no. 2 p.14-29dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:17307x0018-05997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hepo-2015-00123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01913naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012000172300001600292520071600308536008401024592002801108650002401136650001501160650001201175650001101187650002301198653001901221653001901240653001901259653001201278700002201290700001901312773012501331856008601456852000901542655001201551IND60761535020221116165744.0211231e20210902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076153502DNAL7 a10.1080/10454446.2021.20165362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhatt, Siddharth10aDifferentiating Price Sensitivity from Willingness to Pay: Role of Pricing in Consumer Acceptance of Upcycled Foods  ap. 331-339.  aThe problem of food waste continues to plague the world. Upcycled foods, made from ingredients remaining from the manufacturing of other food products, are a partial solution to the food waste problem. Limited research on consumer acceptance of upcycled foods suggests a commercial prospect for these foods. While encouraging, extant findings tell us little about the role of pricing in crafting a market for such foods. We investigate consumers’ price sensitivity for upcycled foods vis-à-vis conventional alternatives. We find that compared to conventional alternatives, consumers exhibit a higher price sensitivity for upcycled foods. We discuss the academic and managerial implications of these findings.  aThis work was supported using funds from a grant provided by Claneil Foundation  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer acceptance 3afood waste 3amarkets 3aprices 3awillingness to pay 0aUpcycled foods 0asustainability 0afood marketing 0apricing1 aDeutsch, Jonathan1 aSuri, Rajneesh0 tJournal of food products marketing.g2021 Sept. 02, v. 27, no. 7 p.331-339dRoutledgewJournal:jnl48134x1540-41027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10454446.2021.20165363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245008500168300001400253520215100267592002802418650002502446650002502471650001302496650000902509650001602518650001202534650001502546650001302561650001502574650001502589650001302604650001802617650001502635650003002650650001502680650001302695650000902708650001202717653002502729653002202754653002702776653002502803653002402828653003702852700002202889700003102911773010402942856007803046852000903124655001203133IND60520077620221118040248.0160513e20150605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052007762DNAL7 a10.1515/hepo-2015-00132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanni, Fatimah Saka10aAntidiarrheal activity of fractions from aqueous extract of Detarium senegalense  ap. 30-40.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different fractions of the aqueous crude extract of Detarium senegalense stem bark on castor oil-induced diarrhea. Castor oilinduced diarrhea, gastrointestinal motility and castor oil-induced enteropooling methods were used to evaluate the antidiarrheal effects of the fractions. Castor oil was used to induce diarrhea and the effect of all the fractions (chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, methanol and residual aqueous) were evaluated at the doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight. The results show that all fractions significantly (p<0.05) decreased the frequency of defecation in rats following the induction of diarrhea with castor oil. Ethyl acetate which produced the highest antidiarrheal activity was further subjected to gastrointestinal motility and castor oil-induced enteropooling tests. In the gastrointestinal motility, two test doses of the extract (200 and 400 mg/kg) were administered orally to two groups of rats (n=5), while the third group of rats (control), were treated with normal saline, and the fourth group were treated with diphenoxylate, a conventional anti-diarrheal drug. In the castor oil-induced enteropooling experiment, normal saline was used for the control animals, while 200 and 400 mg/kg of the extract was administered to groups two and three, respectively and atropine, a standard drug, was administered to rats in group four. The ethyl acetate fraction significantly (p<0.05) decreased the gastro-intestinal motility, as shown by the extent of movement of the charcoal meal in the treated rats. It also significantly inhibited the fluid accumulation within the intestine. These findings suggest that the ethyl acetate fraction possess antidiarrheal effect, which may be due to the presence of some phytochemical constituents (alkaloids, flavonoids and tannins) in the plant, which may either be working alone or in combination with each other. This study has demonstrated that D. senegalense fractions, especially the ethyl acetate fraction, possess antidiarrheal activity thus supporting the use of the plant in the treatment of diarrheal diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDetarium senegalense 3aantidiarrheal effect 3aatropine 3abark 3abody weight 3abutanol 3acastor oil 3acharcoal 3achloroform 3adefecation 3adiarrhea 3aethyl acetate 3aflavonoids 3agastrointestinal motility 3aintestines 3amethanol 3arats 3atannins 0aDetarium senegalense 0astem bark extract 0aantidiarrheal activity 0aDetarium senegalense 0awyciąg z kory pnia 0awłaściwości przeciwbiegunkowe1 aHamza, Hajja Gana1 aOnyeyili, Patrick Azubuike0 tHerba Polonica.g2015 June 5, v. 61, no. 2 p.30-40dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:17307x0018-05997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hepo-2015-00133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010900171300001600280520114700296592002801443650001401471650001101485650001101496653002801507653001801535653001801553653002801571653003101599700002801630773012501658856008601783852000901869655001201878IND60761535120221116165735.0211231e20210902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076153512DNAL7 a10.1080/10454446.2021.20211192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGuicken, Tara10aWhat Do Carbon Labels Signal? the Role of Biospheric Values on Perceptions of “Green” Food Consumers  ap. 340-364.  aCostly signaling theory suggests that individuals might be more likely to consume sustainable food products if doing so signals an underlying prosocial value to others. However, it is unclear whether prosocial signals are equally interpreted by others. We study whether consumers of carbon-labeled (vs. non carbon-labeled) products are perceived more positively and if observers’ biospheric values and product prices influence such perceptions. An experimental study (N = 229) assessed participants’ perceptions of consumers of carbon and non-carbon labeled food products described as being either cheaper or more-expensive-than-average. Results indicated that consumers of carbon-labeled products were perceived more positively and that such perceptions were accentuated when observers strongly endorsed biospheric values. Further, positive perceptions of consumers occurred regardless of a product’s price, although effects were strongest amongst observers with high biospheric value endorsement when products were cheap and carbon-labeled. Implications for carbon labeling initiatives and food marketing more generally are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosphere 3acarbon 3aprices 0aCostly signaling theory 0acarbon-labels 0afood products 0asustainable consumption 0asustainable food marketing1 aPalomo Vélez, Gonzalo,0 tJournal of food products marketing.g2021 Sept. 02, v. 27, no. 7 p.340-364dRoutledgewJournal:jnl48134x1540-41027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10454446.2021.20211193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012900174300001800303500001500321520149100336592002801827650001901855650001101874650002301885650001901908650001401927650001301941650002101954653002301975653002401998653003202022653000902054653001802063653002202081653002102103700001302124700002202137700002102159700001902180700002102199700001602220700001802236700002402254700002002278773012202298856008502420852000902505655001202514IND60582413120221121225358.0180829e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058241312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiss, R.q(Robert),10aStructural features of human DJ-1 in distinct Cys106 oxidative states and their relevance to its loss of function in disease  ap. 2619-2629.  a2019-12-06  aDJ-1 (PARK7) is a multifunctional protein linked to the onset and progression of a number of diseases, most of which are associated with high oxidative stress. The Cys106 of DJ-1 is unusually reactive and thus sensitive to oxidation, and due to high oxidative stress it was observed to be in various oxidized states in disease condition. The oxidation state of Cys106 of DJ-1 is believed to determine the specific functions of the protein in normal and disease conditions. Here we report molecular dynamics simulation and biophysical experimental studies on DJ-1 in reduced (Cys106, S⁻), oxidized (Cys106, SO2⁻), and over-oxidized (Cys106, SO3⁻) states. To simulate the different oxidation states of Cys106 in DJ-1, AMBER related force field parameters were developed and reported for 3-sulfinoalanine and cysteine sulfonic acid. Our studies found that the overall structure of DJ-1 in different oxidation states was similar globally, while it differed locally significantly, which have implications on its stability, function and its link to disease on-set. Importantly, the results suggest that over-oxidation may trigger loss of functions due to local structural modification in the Cys106 containing pocket of DJ-1 and structurally destabilize the dimeric state of DJ-1, which is believed to be its bioactive conformation. Such loss of functions would result in reduced ability of DJ-1 to protect from oxidative stress insults and may lead to increased progression of disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3asulfur dioxide 3ahumans 3amolecular dynamics 3asulfonic acids 3aoxidation 3acysteine 3aoxidative stress 0aMolecular dynamics 0aParkinson's disease 0aStructure based drug design 0aDJ-1 0asulfonic acid 0aProtein structure 0aOxidative stress1 aZhu, Max1 aJójárt, Balázs1 aCzajlik, András1 aSolti, Katalin1 aFórizs, Balázs1 aNagy, Éva,1 aZsila, Ferenc1 aBeke-Somfai, Tamás1 aTóth, Gergely,0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 Nov., v. 1861, no. 11 p.2619-2629dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245022300163300001600386520172500402592002802127650001602155650002302171650001102194650001202205650002302217650002102240650001702261650002002278650002102298650002002319650001402339650002102353650001702374650001802391650002102409650002402430650002602454700001902480700002002499700001302519700002002532700001902552700001702571773012402588856008202712852000902794655001202803IND60566135420221118120406.0170402e20160114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056613542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b101002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Junjing10aFrom the Unimolecuclar Template of Water-Soluble Multiarm Star Brush Copolymers to One-Dimensional Colloidal Nanocrystal Clusters: Facile Synthesis via a Combination of Magnetic Assembly with Photoinduced Cross-Linking  ap. 705-714.  aAn effective process for the fabrication of one-dimensional (1D) colloidal superparamagnetic magnetite (Fe₃O₄) nanocrystal clusters was developed by combining magnetic assembly and photoinduced cross-linking under an external magnetic field. First, a series of water-soluble multiarm star brush copolymers with different molecular weights using α-cyclodextrin as a multifunctional initiator, star brush copolymer PEO-g-PAA, which consisted of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as the main chain and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) as functional side chains, were prepared by combining anionic ring-opening copolymerization with atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Sequentially, star brush copolymer PEO-g-PAA as a spherical unimolecuclar template was utilized to structure-direct the in situ formation of spherical superparamagnetic Fe₃O₄ colloidal nanocrystal clusters by loading precursors of Fe₃O₄ (FeCl₃ and FeCl₂) into the PAA compartment. Surface-tethered PAA grafting chains of spherical Fe₃O₄ colloidal nanocrystal clusters, produced by ATRP, retain terminal bromine atoms that were subsequently converted into photo-cross-linkable azide groups (-N₃) through nucleophilic substitution. The spherical Fe₃O₄ colloidal nanocrystal clusters coated with photo-cross-linkable azide groups were assembled into temporary 1D secondary nanostructures by being exposed to external magnetic fields. The resulting temporary 1D nanoclusters were efficiently cross-linked by exposure to UV light to stabilize the 1D secondary nanostructures of Fe₃O₄ nanocrystals. The dimension of the resulting stable and cross-linked 1D clusters can be tuned by adjusting the strength of the external magnetic field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aalpha-cyclodextrin 3aazides 3abromine 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3acrosslinking 3aferric chloride 3aferrous chloride 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetite 3amolecular weight 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3apolyacrylic acid 3apolyethylene glycol 3aultraviolet radiation1 aWang, Xiaobing1 aFu, P.q(Peng),1 aCui, Zhe1 aZhao, Qingxiang1 aPang, Xinchang1 aLiu, Minying0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Jan. 14, v. 120, no. 1 p.705-714dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b101003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04295naa a2201069 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006600168300001600234520190700250592002802157650001602185650001902201650004402220650001302264650001902277653000802296653000902304653000802313653000802321653000802329653001102337653000802348653000702356653000802363653000902371653000902380653001102389653001002400653000902410653000702419653000802426653000902434653000802443653000802451653000802459653000802467653000902475653000802484653000902492653000802501653000702509653000802516653001102524653000702535653000802542653000702550653000802557653000802565653000802573653000802581653001002589653000802599653000802607653000802615653000802623653000702631653001002638653000802648653000702656653001002663653000902673653000902682653000802691653000802699653000802707653000802715653000902723653000702732653001002739653000902749653001002758653002302768653003002791653001302821653002802834653002902862653001602891700001702907700001702924700001602941700001702957700002602974773011903000856008503119852000903204655001203213IND60582413320221121225305.0181015e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058241332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkeya, Teppei10aSolution NMR views of dynamical ordering of biomacromolecules  ap. 287-306.  aTo understand the mechanisms related to the ‘dynamical ordering’ of macromolecules and biological systems, it is crucial to monitor, in detail, molecular interactions and their dynamics across multiple timescales. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an ideal tool that can investigate biophysical events at the atomic level, in near-physiological buffer solutions, or even inside cells.In the past several decades, progress in solution NMR has significantly contributed to the elucidation of three-dimensional structures, the understanding of conformational motions, and the underlying thermodynamic and kinetic properties of biomacromolecules. This review discusses recent methodological development of NMR, their applications and some of the remaining challenges.Although a major drawback of NMR is its difficulty in studying the dynamical ordering of larger biomolecular systems, current technologies have achieved considerable success in the structural analysis of substantially large proteins and biomolecular complexes over 1MDa and have characterised a wide range of timescales across which biomolecular motion exists. While NMR is well suited to obtain local structure information in detail, it contributes valuable and unique information within hybrid approaches that combine complementary methodologies, including solution scattering and microscopic techniques.For living systems, the dynamic assembly and disassembly of macromolecular complexes is of utmost importance for cellular homeostasis and, if dysregulated, implied in human disease. It is thus instructive for the advancement of the study of the dynamical ordering to discuss the potential possibilities of solution NMR spectroscopy and its applications.

Six samples using pitfalls, baited with squid and dung, and light traps, were carried out in dry and rainy seasons in 2 environments. A total of 3,369 specimens were caught belonging to 26 species. Eurysternus aeneus, Canthon quinquemaculatus, Canthon chalybaeus, Deltochilum komareki and Canthidium sp. represented 65% of all captures. Non-parametric richness estimators showed a reliable inventory. Significant differences in the Scarabaeinae assemblages structure was observed between periods, among baits and between sampled months, but not among environments. Abundance and diversity were slightly higher in the dry season. Richness, abundance and diversity were higher in the dryer period and in March (2011). More species were captured in excrement traps and more individuals in carrion traps. Maximum temperature was the variable that best explained the variation in the community structure. This is the first study of Scarabaeinae diversity in a protected area of the Ramsar Site Chaco Wetlands. The observed richness highlights the importance of maintaining even small areas for conservation purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanthon 3abaits 3acommunity structure 3aconservation areas 3adead animals 3adry season 3afeces 3ainventories 3alight traps 3asquid 3atemperature 3awet season 3awetlands 3aArgentina 0aDiversidad 0aColeoptera 0aÁrea protegida 0aAmbientes nativos 0aNoreste argentino 0aDiversity 0aColeoptera 0aProtected area 0aNative environments 0aNortheastern Argentine1 aDamborsky, Miryam P.1 aPorcel, Eduardo0 tRevista mexicana de biodiversidad.g2015 Sept., v. 86, no. 3 p.744-753dElsevier España, S.L.U.aUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Instituto de BiologíawJournal:23226x1870-34537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmb.2015.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007400169520135700243592002801600650002001628650001501648650001201663650001501675650002301690650003001713650001101743650001101754650002301765650002201788650002401810653002101834653003301855653001301888653001401901653000901915653000701924653000701931653001001938653000801948653000801956653000801964653000801972653000701980653000701987653000801994653000802002653000802010653000702018653000802025700002002033700001402053700001702067700005502084700001402139773008702153856008502240852000902325655001202334IND60740858020221120045052.0211029e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074085802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2021.1055012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Dongliang10aOxygen footprint: An indicator of the anthropogenic ecosystem changes  aDrylands are one of the most sensitive areas to anthropogenic climate change and are projected to experience accelerated expansion throughout the end of this century. However, the responses of drylands degradation to anthropogenic ecosystem changes remain unclear. This study proposes a new perspective of the ‘oxygen footprint’, defined as the ratio between oxygen consumption and oxygen production, which could be regarded as an indicator in evaluating the effects of anthropogenic climate change on global dryland ecosystems. A global distribution of the trend of oxygen footprint in response to climate change indicators and the transformations for ecosystem functioning is presented. The response of oxygen footprint to human activities and global warming is projected to enhance in the 21st century. Under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), linear regression analysis between oxygen footprint and other indicators shows oxygen footprint to increase with the increase of air temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and dryland areas, respectively. Our study suggests that when oxygen production is unsustainable combined with oxygen consumption, this scenario will accelerate the degradation of dryland ecosystem, with fundamental and negative consequences for the capacity of drylands to supply essential ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aarid lands 3acatenas 3aecosystems 3aevapotranspiration 3ageographical distribution 3ahumans 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3aoxygen production 3aregression analysis 0aOxygen footprint 0aAnthropogenic climate change 0aDrylands 0aModelling 0aRisk 0aAI 0aAT 0aCMIP5 0aCO2 0aGHG 0aNEP 0aNPP 0aO2 0aOF 0aPET 0aPRE 0aRCP 0aRh 0aSOC1 aHuang, Jianping1 aDing, Lei1 aLiu, Xiaoyue1 aLi, Changyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1537-75081 aYang, Fan0 tCatena.g2021 Nov., v. 206 p.105501-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.1055013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245015600171300001200327520158000339592002801919596008701947596004902034650001902083650002602102650001602128650002102144650001402165650001802179650001002197650002202207650001302229650001302242650001102255650001602266650001702282650000902299650002202308650002002330650001302350650001502363650002102378650001702399650001302416650001002429700001902439700002202458700002202480700001802502700006402520773010802584856008302692852000902775655001202784IND60744636720221120234642.0220726e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074463672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-021-02891-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWidiarsih, Sasanti10aInheritance of seed quality and seed germination in two doubled haploid populations of oilseed rape segregating for acid detergent lignin (ADL) content  ap. 161.  aThe high lignin content of the seed hull of oilseed rape leads to its black seed color compared to yellow seeded soybean. Reducing lignin and increasing oil and protein content is an important breeding aim in oilseed rape. The objective of the present study was to analyze the inheritance of two rapeseed genetic resources with reduced lignin content in the seeds and to elucidate the effects on seed germination and composition. These resources were crossed to black seeded Express 617 and F1 plants were used to develop two doubled haploid (DH) populations. The two DH populations were tested in field experiments in three to five environments. Significant genetic variation for lignin content and bimodal frequency distributions were found in both populations. SNP marker segregation in contrasting bulks revealed for both populations overlapping narrow genomic regions on chromosome C03, responsible for reduced lignin content. The low lignin bulks had a significantly higher percentage of seeds showing bacterial and fungal growth, but germination and vigor was not affected. Non-targeted metabolome analysis of immature green seeds showed exclusively a depletion of metabolites of the proanthocyanidin pathway in DH lines with a reduced lignin content. In these DH lines, a cinnamate-4-hydroxylase gene copy was identified as candidate gene in the overlapping genomic region of both populations. The newly identified QTL for reduced lignin content on chromosome C03 is valuable for studying additive and epistatic effects in combination with other low lignin genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data  aRISET-PRO Ph.D scholarship programcIndonesian Ministry of Research and Technology  aZUK 45/2010cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3aBrassica napus 3aacid insoluble lignin 3achromosomes 3adoubled haploids 3aepistasis 3afungal growth 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3ahaploidy 3alignin 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aoils 3aproanthocyanidins 3aprotein content 3arapeseed 3aseed color 3aseed germination 3aseed quality 3asoybeans 3avigor1 aNagel, Manuela1 aBörner, Andreas,1 aFeussner, Kirstin1 aFeussner, Ivo1 aMöllers, Christian,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2148-08860 tEuphytica.g2021 Aug., v. 217, no. 8 p.161-161dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-021-02891-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004700092040001800139100002200157245007600179300001600255500000900271520173500280592002802015650001802043650002602061650002302087773020702110852000902317856009402326655001202420IND2047739020221119111324.0191028e199407  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204773902DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1994.00472425002300040002x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanlon, Edward A.10aNaturally Occurring Radionuclides in Agricultural Products: An Overview  ap. 630-632.  aepub  aLow levels of naturally occurring radionuclides exist in phosphatic clays, a by-product of phosphatic mining and beneficiation processes. Concerns about these radionuclides entering the human food chain were an immediate research priority before the phosphatic clays could be reclaimed for intensive agricultural purposes. Efforts included the assembly of a large body of data from both soils and plants, part of which were produced by the Polk County (Florida) Mined Lands Agricultural Research/Demonstration Project (MLAR/DP). Additional detailed studies involving dairy and beef cattle (Bos taurus) were conducted by researchers working with the MLAR/DP. A national symposium was conducted in which data concerning the MLAR/DP work and other research projects also dealing with naturally occurring radionuclides in agriculture could be discussed. The symposium included invited review papers dealing with the identification of radionuclide geological origins, the geochemistry and movement of radionuclides within the environment, mechanisms of plant uptake, entry points into the food chain, and evaluation of dose and risk assessment to the consumer of low levels of radionuclides. The risk to human health of an individual obtaining 0.1 of his or her dietary intake from crops produced on phosphatic clays increased by 1 in 5 × 10⁶/yr above a control individual consuming no food grown on phosphatic clays. Leaf tissues were found to be generally higher than fruit, grain, or root tissues. The natural range in radionuclide content among various food types was greater than the difference in radionuclides content between the same food produced on phosphatic clays vs. natural soils.

Enzyme immobilization and recycling can be a tool to decrease costs. However, high solid loading is a key factor towards high product titers, and recovery of immobilized enzymes from this thick liquid is often overlooked. This paper aims to evaluate the economic feasibility of immobilized enzymes in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of lignocellulose biomass in general, as well as the recuperation of magnetic immobilized enzymes (m-CLEAs) during high solid loading in simultaneous saccharification, detoxification and fermentation processes (SSDF) of lignocellulose biomass.Enzyme prices were obtained from general cost estimations by Klein-Marcuschamer et al. [Klein-Marcuschamer et al. (2012) Biotechnol. Bioeng. 109, 1083–1087]. During enzyme cost analysis, the influence of inoculum recirculation as well as a shortened fermentation time was explored. Both resulted in 15% decrease of final enzyme product price. Enzyme recuperation was investigated experimentally and 99.5 m/m% of m-CLEAs was recovered from liquid medium in one step, while 88 m/m% could still be recycled from a thick liquid with high solid concentrations (SSF fermentation broth). A mathematical model was constructed to calculate the cost of immobilized and free enzyme utilization and showed that, with current process efficiencies and commercial enzyme prices, the cost reduction obtained by enzyme immobilization can reach around 60% compared to free enzyme utilization, while lower enzyme prices will result in a lower percentage of immobilization related savings, but overall enzyme costs will decrease significantly.These results are applied in a case study, estimating the viability of shifting from sugar to lignocellulose substrate for a 100 t lactic acid fermentation batch. It was concluded that it will only be economically feasible if the enzymes are produced at the most optimistic variable cost and either the activity of the immobilized catalyst or the recovery efficiency is further increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3amathematical models 3asaccharification 3alignocellulose 3amagnetism 3asugars 3aimmobilized enzymes 3aprices 3acost analysis 3acatalysts 3aliquids 3alactic fermentation 3ahydrolysis 3acost effectiveness 3aeconomic feasibility 3acase studies 3aculture media 3abiomass 3ainoculum 0aenzymes 0aCost estimation 0aLactic acid 0am-CLEAs 0aHigh solid simultaneous saccharification and fermentation 0aSSDF 0aImmobilized enzyme 0aSSF1 aLenaerts, Silvia1 aCornet, Iris0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2018 Mar. 20, v. 270 p.70-76dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2018.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245006800170300001800238520154700256592002801803650001101831650002101842650002301863650001101886650003001897650002001927650001701947650004301964700002002007700003202027700005702059773011902116856008102235852000902316655001202325IND60612670720221117192606.0180906e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061267072DNAL7 a10.1007/s11625-018-0548-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBifulco, Francesco10aCrossing technology and sustainability in cities’ development  ap. 1287-1297.  aThis paper deals with sustainability in cities and the role technology plays in furthering sustainable results. Recently, many interventions have been implemented in cities to propose paths and models promoting the sustainability of cities from an overall perspective. Technologies are favouring the achievement of aims recalling the three spheres of sustainability as proposed by Arcadis (2017), namely “planet”, “profit”, and “people”. The ties between technology and the three spheres are investigated through a content analysis of reports issued by the 10 cities with the most significant advances in terms of becoming sustainable cities, as indicated in the Arcadis Report 2016. The results highlight technology as an element crossing sustainability, as processes and models in cities management and service provisions to citizens are significantly changing. New tools are innovating the processes addressing environmental issues, thus leading to cost efficiency and better economic conditions. Parallel to this, new models for city management and the provision of public services are addressing the need for a better quality of life for citizens and cities’ other stakeholders. Technology itself is thought of as sustainable because it should lead to efficiency and being efficient itself. A qualitative cluster analysis and a focus on excerpts from reports are proposed to highlight the ties between technologies and the elements representing key issues in managing and leading a city towards more sustainable conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3acluster analysis 3acost effectiveness 3amodels 3apublic services and goods 3aquality of life 3astakeholders 3asustainability science and engineering1 aD’Auria, Anna1 aAmitrano, Cristina Caterina1 aTregua, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1579-76760 tSustainability science.g2018 Sept., v. 13, no. 5 p.1287-1297dSpringer JapanwJournal:J000001136x1862-40657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-018-0548-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009900167300001600266520150400282592002801786650002301814650001801837650002601855650002601881650001501907650001401922650002301936650002101959650001801980650001901998650001402017650001002031650002002041650001002061650001802071653001302089653001802102653001602120700001602136700003402152700001802186773015502204856008102359852000902440655001202449IND60706167820221121045630.0200807e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070616782DNAL7 a10.18805/ijare.v50i6.66752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabariya, C.

GM 4 having high germination percentage and low moisture content (below 8%) was taken for each repetition and given the treatments. The experiment was carried out using completely randomized design (CRD). After proper mixing or smearing, seeds were packed in 500 gauge polythene bags and kept in laboratory under ambient condition. Observations were recorded at bimonthly interval on germination (%), root length (cm), shoot length (cm), seedling dry weight (g), seed vigour index I, seed vigour index II and seed moisture content (%). The results indicated that all the treatments exhibited significant difference for all the traits studied except shoot length after two years of storage. The Indian Minimum Seed Certification Standards in mungbean for germination percentage is 75 per cent. Looking to the germination percentage and Seed vigourindex I and II, among all the treatments, T₁ (Neem Seed kernel powder @ 5 g/kg seed), T₂(Neem seed kernel powder @ 10 g/kg seed), T₃ (Neem Cake @ 5g/kg Seed) and T₄ (Neem Cake @ 10g/kg Seed) recorded the higher values for these traits and can be recommended as a seed treatment before storage for maintaining the seed germination and seedling vigour for more than two years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzadirachta indica 3aVigna radiata 3aagricultural colleges 3aagricultural research 3amung beans 3aneem cake 3aseed certification 3aseed germination 3aseed moisture 3aseed treatment 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3astorage quality 3avigor 3awater content 0aMungbean 0aNeem products 0aStorability1 aPatel, J.B.1 aRibadiya, K.H.

The load ratio is the ratio between the current density and the TAN loading rate. It is currently not known if the load ratio concept applies to a bioelectrochemical system (BES) because the current density and TAN loading rate cannot be controlled independently. RESULTS: We found a clear increasing trend in TAN removal efficiency with respect to load ratio in the BES for both human and synthetic urine. The maximum TAN removal efficiency was 60.9% at a load ratio of 0.7, corresponding to a TAN transport rate of 119 gN m⁻² day⁻¹ at an electrical energy input of 1.9 kWh kgN⁻¹ (synthetic urine). Low load ratios (<1) were obtained, indicating that the current was not enough to transport all the TAN across the membrane. CONCLUSIONS: BES and ES show the same general relationship between TAN removal efficiency and load ratio. Therefore, given a stable current density, the concept of load ratio can also predict the TAN removal efficiency in BES. Higher current densities, and insights into the factors limiting current, are needed to increase the load ratio and therefore the TAN removal efficiency. © 2019 The Authors.

In this work, cell wall polysaccharides from S. odorifera pulp were isolated by sequential extraction with water, citric acid, and sodium hydroxide solutions. The monosaccharide composition of crude polysaccharide fractions was determined. The aqueous fractions displayed the highest yields and they were constituted by pectins, having mainly galactans as side chains. The citric acid fraction (SCA) had galactose as the main component. The hemicellulosic fractions consisted mainly of xylose, mannose, galactose, and glucose, suggesting the presence of xyloglucans, xylans and mannans. The SCA fraction was further purified, resulting in a linear galactan (SCAI2). NMR and methylation analysis showed that SCAI2 was a β-(1→4) d-galactan with molar mass of 17,560 g/mol, determined by light scattering. The presence of a linear galactan in free form in fruits is unusual because these polymers usually occur as side chains of type I rhamnogalacturonans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSicana odorifera 3acell walls 3acitric acid 3afruits 3agalactans 3agalactose 3aglucose 3alight scattering 3amannans 3amannose 3amethylation 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apectins 3apolymers 3apulp 3asodium hydroxide 3axyloglucans 3axylose 0aCell wall 0aSicana odorifera fruit 0aGalactan 0aPectins 0aPolysaccharides 0aSequential extractions1 aCorrêa-Ferreira, Marília Locatelli1 ade Oliveira Petkowicz, Carmen Lúcia0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 197 p.395-402dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245012400201300001800325520182600343592002802169650002902197650001802226650001202244650001402256650001602270650004302286651001602329700001702345700002102362700001702383700001602400773011902416856008102535852000902616655001202625IND60612670820221117192631.0180906e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061267082DNAL7 a10.1007/s11625-018-0554-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTriste, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6887-268710aCommunities of practice for knowledge co-creation on sustainable dairy farming: features for value creation for farmers  ap. 1427-1442.  aCommunities of Practice (CoPs) are a promising concept for transdisciplinary knowledge co-creation in sustainable agricultural development, but empirical evidence from the farmers’ viewpoint is scarce. This paper contributes to empirical insights on the knowledge creation in CoPs as valued by farmers. Using concepts from CoP theory (domain, community, and practice) and the value creation framework (VCF) developed by Wenger et al. (Promoting and assessing value creation in communities and networks: a conceptual framework. Netherlands Ruud de Moor Center Rapport 18:60, 2011), we examined two cases issuing from a European project on sustainable dairy farming. Results indicate regional differences between the two cases and relate CoP features to value creation cycles (immediate, potential, applied, realized and reframing value). They show how specific features regarding domain, community, and practice development can enhance knowledge creation on sustainable agricultural development. Domain development should be considered consciously taking into account the project duration. The community should include actors with specific competencies, such as farmers with an open attitude, researchers with (practical) domain expertise, and advisors with skills as translators between researchers and farmers. The practice development, or the actual knowledge creation, should unify two equally important types of interaction that contribute differently to value creation in CoPs: individual farmer–researcher–advisor interactions and farmer group–advisor interactions. Our research provides both valuable information for designing and managing knowledge co-creation initiatives and anchors further research on competencies and activities required to foster the two types of interactions for knowledge creation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3adairy farming 3afarmers 3aknowledge 3aresearchers 3asustainability science and engineering 3aNetherlands1 aDebruyne, L.1 aVandenabeele, J.1 aMarchand, F.1 aLauwers, L.0 tSustainability science.g2018 Sept., v. 13, no. 5 p.1427-1442dSpringer JapanwJournal:J000001136x1862-40657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-018-0554-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001200169245010300181300001800284500001500302520104900317592002801366650001401394650002701408650003201435650000801467650003101475650002301506650001001529650001601539650001301555650001601568650001501584650001901599653004301618700001501661700001501676700001701691700001601708773009101724856008601815852000901901655001201910IND4450877020221118145952.0141111e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445087702DNAL7 a252141272pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.01.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuy, F.10aPrediction of lamb meat fatty acid composition using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS)  ap. 1280-1286.  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) for predicting lamb meat fatty acid composition. We compared ground vs. intact non-ground meat samples to determine whether grinding and homogenisation of meat samples improved the performance of the predictions. We used 76 male lambs, of which 32 were pasture-fed and 44 stall-fed with concentrate and hay. The reflectance spectrum of Longissimus lumborum muscle was measured at wavelengths between 400 and 2500nm. Predictions were better with ground than with intact muscle samples. NIRS accurately predicts several individual fatty acids (FA) (16:0, 18:0, 16:1 Δ9 cis, 17:1 Δ9 cis, 18:1 Δ9 cis, 18:1 Δ11 cis and 16:1 Δ9 trans) and several FA groups (total linear saturated FA, total branched saturated FA, total saturated FA, total cis monounsaturated FA (MUFA), total trans MUFA, total MUFA and total polyunsaturated PUFA). These results show the potential of NIRS as a rapid, and convenient tool to predict the major FA in lamb meat.  aPublisher supplied data 3alamb meat 3afatty acid composition 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3ahay 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3alongissimus muscle 3alambs 3awavelengths 3agrinding 3areflectance 3aprediction 3ahomogenization 0anear-infrared reflectance spectroscopy1 aPrache, S.1 aThomas, A.1 aBauchart, D.1 aAndueza, D.0 tFood chemistry.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 127, no. 3 p.1280-1286dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.01.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100006200188245013800250300001100388506007600399520164100475592002802116506003702144650004802181650001102229650001102240650002002251650001702271650001802288650003002306650001002336650002402346650001002370650003202380650001102412650002102423650001602444650002402460700001602484700002502500700002402525700002002549773011102569856008202680852000902762655001202771IND60603988020221207140900.0190919e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060398802DNAL7 a300056982pmid7 aPMC60440532pmcid7 a10.1186/s13567-018-0557-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamanes, Guillaume1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4848-467610aControl measures to prevent the increase of paratuberculosis prevalence in dairy cattle herds: an individual-based modelling approach  ap. 60.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aParatuberculosis, a gastrointestinal disease caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map), can lead to severe economic losses in dairy cattle farms. Current measures are aimed at controlling prevalence in infected herds, but are not fully effective. Our objective was to determine the most effective control measures to prevent an increase in adult prevalence in infected herds. We developed a new individual-based model coupling population and infection dynamics. Animals are characterized by their age (6 groups) and health state (6 states). The model accounted for all transmission routes and two control measures used in the field, namely reduced calf exposure to adult faeces and test-and-cull. We defined three herd statuses (low, moderate, and high) based on realistic prevalence ranges observed in French dairy cattle herds. We showed that the most relevant control measures depend on prevalence. Calf management and test-and-cull both were required to maximize the probability of stabilizing herd status. A reduced calf exposure was confirmed to be the most influential measure, followed by test frequency and the proportion of infected animals that were detected and culled. Culling of detected high shedders could be delayed for up to 3 months without impacting prevalence. Management of low prevalence herds is a priority since the probability of status stabilization is high after implementing prioritized measures. On the contrary, an increase in prevalence was particularly difficult to prevent in moderate prevalence herds, and was only feasible in high prevalence herds if the level of control was high.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aadults 3acalves 3acontrol methods 3adairy cattle 3adairy farming 3adigestive system diseases 3afeces 3afinancial economics 3aherds 3alivestock and meat industry 3amodels 3aparatuberculosis 3aprobability 3aveterinary medicine1 aJoly, Alain1 aFourichon, Christine1 aBen Romdhane, Racem1 aEzanno, Pauline0 tVeterinary research.g2018 Dec., v. 49, no. 1 p.60-60dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4142873x1297-97167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-018-0557-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010100171300001800272520149300290592002801783650001501811650002301826650001401849650001601863650001801879650000901897650001501906650001301921650002201934650001301956650001201969653002701981653000802008653002002016653002402036653002502060653001802085653001502103653000802118653000802126653001902134700001902153700002202172700001702194700001702211773013302228856008702361852000902448655001202457IND60569399720221118061440.0170527e20150605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056939972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b001752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsperger, Arndt10aLow Abundant N-linked Glycosylation in Hen Egg White Lysozyme Is Localized at Nonconsensus Sites  ap. 2633-2641.  aAlthough wild-type hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) is lacking the consensus sequence motif NX(S/T), in 1995 Trudel et al. (Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995, 73, 307–309) proposed the existence of a low abundant N-glycosylated form of HEL; however, the identity of active glycosylation sites in HEL remained a matter of speculation. For the first time since Trudel’s initial work, we report here a comprehensive characterization by means of mass spectrometry of N-glycosylation in wild-type HEL. Our analytical approach comprised ZIC-HILIC enrichment of N-glycopeptides from HEL trypsin digest, deglycosylation by ¹⁸O/PNGase F as well as by various endoglycosidases, and LC–MS/MS analysis of both intact and deglycosylated N-glycopeptides engaging multiple techniques of ionization and fragmentation. A novel data interpretation workflow based on MS/MS spectra classification and glycan database searching enabled the straightforward identification of the asparagine-rich N-glycopeptide [34–45] FESNFNTQATNR and allowed for compositional profiling of its modifying N-glycans. The overall heterogeneity profile of N-glycans in HEL comprised at least 26 different compositions. Results obtained from deglycosylation experiments provided clear evidence of asparagine residues N44 and N39 representing active glycosylation sites in HEL. Both of these sites do not fall into any known N-glycosylation-specific sequence motif but are localized in rarely observed nonconsensus sequons (NXN, NXQ).  aPublisher supplied data 3aasparagine 3aconsensus sequence 3adatabases 3aegg albumen 3aglycosylation 3ahens 3aionization 3alysozyme 3amass spectrometry 3aproteome 3atrypsin 0ahen egg white lysozyme 0aHEL 0aN-glycosylation 0anonconsensus sequon 0aglycan heterogeneity 0aMALDI-TOF/TOF 0aLC−MS/MS 0aCID 0aETD 0abioinformatics1 aMarx, Kristina1 aAlbers, Christian1 aMolin, Laura1 aPinato, Odra0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2015 June 05, v. 14, no. 6 p.2633-2641dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jproteome.5b001753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008700165300001600252520114100268592002801409650002401437650002601461650002301487650001101510650001601521650001201537650001901549650001501568650001401583650001001597650001101607651001001618653001301628653001701641653002201658653001701680700002201697700001601719773015501735856008101890852000901971655001201980IND60706168020221120120716.0200807e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070616802DNAL7 a10.18805/ijare.v50i6.66772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeena, Mukesh10aAdoption and impact of zero tillage in the rice-wheat production system of Haryana  ap. 584-588.  aZero Tillage (ZT) has been considered as a proven technology to increase the farm income, but its adoption in the semi-arid part of western India is still uncertain.

The most pronounced impact of ZT is at the cost-saving compartment. However, since ZT wheat farmers could sow the crop much earlier than their conventional counterparts results in gaining 8 percent increase in yield. Determinants of adoption were attempted employing a multinomial logit model. Ownership of ZT drill, cropping pattern and household factors were influencing ZT adoption. Although a number of constraints for continuous adoption of ZT, including uncongenial field situation (excess moisture, undulated plots, small landholding etc.) and difficulty to manage previous/kharifcrop (pearl millet, cotton) residues.

By analyzing recent advancements in knowledge offered by ICT, it is possible to identify their strong correlation with the principles, aims, and interests of sustainability science, which can be highly inspired by ICT-intensive domains. In this paper, we study the theoretical background on system thinking as an interpretative lens able to support better understanding of dimensions and dynamics involved in the domain of sustainability, and examine the role of ICT in advancing sustainability goals. Then, we analyze the domain of the Smart Grid as a prominent example of complex technological contribution in face of the challenges of sustainability, and present the insights from this domain, which are turned into sustainability guidelines for other domains, linking smartness, and sustainability in the light of systems thinking and Smart Grid experience. In summary, the core recommendation of this work is the employment of information technology to widen the scope of the sustainability “game” by sliding activities in time and space, and in engaging more “players” in the game, which is now made possible thanks to the advancement in ICT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3acommunications technology 3aelectrical equipment 3aguidelines 3ainformation technology 3asociety 3astakeholders 3asustainability science and engineering1 aBuhnova, Barbora1 aWalletzký, Leonard0 tSustainability science.g2018 Sept., v. 13, no. 5 p.1299-1309dSpringer JapanwJournal:J000001136x1862-40657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-018-0555-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03651naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245009200211520206100303592002802364650001202392650002202404650001202426650001302438650001502451650001102466650000902477650001502486650002402501650001302525650000902538650001902547650001302566650001602579653001502595653002402610653003002634653001202664700002402676700006002700700006602760700002502826700001802851700001702869700002802886700002102914773010402935856008503039852000903124655001203133IND60710641420221118065721.0220228e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071064142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1101862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrestha, Srishti1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2017-452110aPesticide use and incident Parkinson's disease in a cohort of farmers and their spouses  aExtensive literature suggests an association between general pesticide use and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, with few exceptions, little is known about associations between specific pesticides and PD. We evaluated use of pesticides and incident PD in 38,274 pesticide applicators and 27,836 of their spouses in the Agricultural Health Study cohort followed over 20 years. We used self-reported information on ever-use of 50 specific pesticides as of enrollment for both applicators and spouses, and considered intensity-weighted lifetime days (IWLD) reported at enrollment and through the first 5-year follow-up among applicators. We estimated covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox regression. We also examined heterogeneity in associations by history of head injury and chemical resistant glove use. A total of 373 applicators and 118 spouses self-reported incident doctor-diagnosed PD. Ever-use of the insecticide terbufos (HR:1.31, 95%CI:1.02–1.68) and the herbicides trifluralin (HR:1.29, 95%CI: 0.99–1.70) and 2,4,5-T (HR:1.57, 95%CI:1.21–2.04) was associated with elevated PD risk. On the other hand, diazinon (HR:0.73, 95%CI: 0.58–0.94) and 2,4,5-TP (HR:0.39, 95%CI:0.25–0.62) were associated with reduced risk. We observed heterogeneity in ever-use associations by head injury and chemical-resistant glove use for some pesticides, with higher risk among those who reported a history of head injury, or who did not use gloves. PD risk was also elevated for applicators in the highest category of IWLD for dichlorvos, permethrin (animal use), and benomyl. We found evidence of increased PD risk for some pesticides. Our results also suggest higher susceptibility for pesticide-associated PD among individuals with head injury as well as protection with use of chemical resistant gloves, although further research is needed to understand the impact of head injury. Research on current and newer pesticides, including mechanisms relevant to PD, is important given widespread pesticide use.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4,5-T 3aParkinson disease 3aanimals 3adiazinon 3adichlorvos 3agloves 3ahead 3apermethrin 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3aterbufos 3atrifluralin 0aPesticides 0aParkinson's disease 0aAgricultural health study 0aFarmers1 aParks, Christine G.1 aUmbach, David M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7142-28121 aRichards-Barber, Marie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5760-24301 aHofmann, Jonathan N.1 aChen, Honglei1 aBlair, Aaron1 aBeane Freeman, Laura E.1 aSandler, Dale P.0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 Dec., v. 191 p.110186-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1101863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009100161300001600252520150700268592002801775650002701803650002601830650001701856650002301873651001001896653000901906653000901915653000901924653002501933653002301958700001601981700002401997773015502021856008102176852000902257655001202266IND60706168120221121134727.0200807e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070616812DNAL7 a10.18805/ijare.v50i6.66782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSyiem, R.10aInnovative extension practices in East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya: A case study  ap. 589-593.  aThe study was conducted on innovative practices namely Intelligent Advisory System for Farmers (IASF) and Enterprise Facilitation Centres (EFCs) in East Khasi Hills District of Meghalaya with an attempt to identify the innovative agricultural extension practices in the state which are more effective and reachable to the grassroots level. Simple random sampling method was followed in selecting forty farmers from each of the two selected innovative practices launched in Meghalaya. Data was collected using a structured interview schedule. Statistical tools such as mean, standard deviation, frequency and percentage were used for the study. The results showed that out of total respondents selected for the study 80% farmers perceived that IASF had increased their knowledge of agricultural practices, 20% farmers reported cost and time saving and 27% percent farmers reported influence in their decision making ability through ‘Mobile Crop Doctor ’. Similarly, it was found that 60% farmers received capacity building support from EFCs, 33% farmers reported influence in their decision making ability and 27% famers had a better access to credit with the help of EFCs. However, these practices had been introduced recently in the state and are in its nascent stage, therefore more awareness on the benefits of using ICTs should be given to farmers along with better training and capacity building to encourage and enable them to utilise the benefits of ICTs and improve their farming practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural extension 3aagricultural research 3acase studies 3astandard deviation 3aIndia 0aEFCs 0aIASF 0aICTs 0aInnovative practices 0aPerceived benefits1 aMarak, B.R.1 aBandyopadhyay, A.K.0 tIndian journal of agricultural research.g2016 Dec., v. 50, no. 6 p.589-593dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2026x0976-058X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijare.v50i6.66783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245011200169300002000281520167400301592002801975650001402003650001602017650000902033650002402042650002002066650001702086650002802103650001902131650001902150650001902169700002402188700001802212700002402230700002302254773010102277856007502378852000902453655001202462IND60576893620221118210439.0170806e20131223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057689362DNAL7 a10.1021/la403585v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarter Ramirez, Daniel
M.10aChanges in Order Parameters Associated with Ceramide-Mediated Membrane Reorganization Measured Using pTIRFM  ap. 15907-15918.  aThe enzymatic generation of ceramide has significant effects on the biophysical properties of lipid bilayers and can lead to the extensive reorganization of cell membranes. We have synthesized and characterized a headgroup-labeled fluorescent lipid probe (NBD-ceramide, NBD-Cer) and demonstrated that it can be used for polarized total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy experiments to probe changes in membrane order that result from ceramide incorporation. NBD-Cer measures significantly higher order parameters for the liquid-ordered (Lₒ) domains (⟨P₂⟩ = 0.40 ± 0.03) than for the liquid-disordered phase (Ld, fluid, ⟨P₂⟩ = 0.22 ± 0.02) of phase-separated bilayers prepared from egg sphingomyelin, dioleolyphosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol mixtures. The probe also responds to changes in packing induced by the direct incorporation of ceramide or the variation in the ionic strength of the aqueous medium. Order parameter maps obtained after enzyme treatment of bilayers with coexisting Lₒ and Ld phases show two distinct types of behavior. In regions of high enzyme activity, the initial Lₒ/Ld domains are replaced by large, dark features that have high membrane order corroborating previous hypotheses that these are ceramide-enriched regions of the membrane. In areas of low enzyme activity, the size and shape of the Lₒ domains are conserved, but there is an increase in the order parameter for the initial Ld phase (⟨P₂⟩ = 0.30 ± 0.01). This is attributed to the incorporation of ceramide in the Lₒ domains with the concomitant expulsion of cholesterol into the surrounding fluid phase, increasing its order parameter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceramides 3acholesterol 3aeggs 3aenzymatic treatment 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3aionic strength 3alipid bilayers 3asphingomyelins1 aJakubek, Zygmunt J.1 aLu, Zhengfang1 aOgilvie, William W.1 aJohnston, Linda J.0 tLangmuir.g2013 Dec. 23, v. 29, no. 51 p.15907-15918dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla403585v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245013100166300001800297500002000315520128600335592002801621596005501649596002001704650001201724650001301736650001201749650001501761650001801776650001201794650001101806650001801817650001301835650002801848650001101876650001101887700003501898700003701933700001901970700003201989700005802021773015002079856007302229852000902302655001202311IND60643799020221120144732.0190514e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064379902DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.59742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz‐García, Blanca10aBiofiltration of high concentrations of methanol vapors: removal performance, carbon balance and microbial and fly populations  ap. 1925-1936.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Methanol vapors, broadly emitted by industry, can be cost‐effectively treated by biofiltration. However, long‐term operation under high concentrations regularly encountered in the pulp and paper industry (> 5 g m⁻³) has been barely studied. RESULTS: Methanol concentrations between 1.6 and 14 g m⁻³ were treated in a biofilter. Complete methanol removal was obtained for concentrations up to 3.5 g m⁻³, for an empty bed retention time (EBRT) of 60 s. A higher EBRT (160 s) was necessary to eliminate all methanol for concentrations up to 7 g m⁻³. For higher concentrations, a maximum elimination capacity (ECₘₐₓ) of 343.8 g m⁻³ h⁻¹ was achieved. The main challenge encountered during the biofiltration of high methanol concentrations was excessive biomass buildup (with a performance drop due to clogging occurring every 2 weeks). Under high methanol concentrations, 11 bacteria, three fungi, and one yeast prevailed in the biofilm. Flies and fly larvae were detected when no biofilter clogging was observed, regulating biomass excess. CONCLUSIONS: High methanol concentrations trigger biomass growth and clogging. Diptera represent a research opportunity to control such phenomena. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  aUMAR‐CA‐14cSecretaría de Educación Pública  a721610cConacyt 3aDiptera 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3abiofilters 3abiofiltration 3abiomass 3acarbon 3ainsect larvae 3amethanol 3apulp and paper industry 3avapors 3ayeasts1 aGeronimo‐Meza, Andrea Selene1 aMartínez‐Lievana, Concepción1 aArriaga, Sonia1 aHuante‐González, Yolanda1 aAizpuru, Aitor1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9212-65130 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2019 June, v. 94, no. 6 p.1925-1936dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.59743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010100167300001400268500001400282520106100296592002801357650001601385650001401401650001601415650001201431651001201443651001001455651000901465651001101474651001701485653001101502653001901513653002001532653002401552653001701576700001901593700002101612700002101633773009401654856008201748852000901830655001201839IND60699104220221116230349.0210116e20180730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069910422DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.777.267452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamani, Alireza14aThe spider genus Pterotricha in Iran, with the description of a new genus (Araneae, Gnaphosidae)  ap. 17-41.  aNAL-light  aThe spider genus Pterotricha Kulczyński, 1903 (Gnaphosidae) is surveyed in Iran.

Thus, the risk assessment of a high scale release of ZnPT₂ to the natural environment is of increasing importance. The knowledge of the molecular mechanisms related to biological effects of ZnPT₂ and its transformation products is crucial for this assessment and thus for the decision whether pyrithiones are sound or “green” alternatives to organotin antifoulants. A multitude of biological effects of pyrithiones is already known while the underlying molecular mechanisms of action remain obscure. This study presents toxicological data of zinc pyrithione and several structural analogs in rat leukemic cells (IPC-81). The N-hydroxythioamide functional group proved to play a significant role in the molecular mechanisms related to the biological action. Structural analogs, which are deprived of one or more molecular interaction or chemical reaction potentials given by this group (namely pyridine, pyridine 1-oxide and pyridine 2-thione, bis(2-pyridinyl)disulfide, and three methylated metabolites), exhibit far less toxic potential in IPC-81 cells than pyrithiones (i.e., 2-pyridinethione-1-oxides). In particular the trans-metallization products of ZnPT₂, iron (FePT₃) and copper (CuPT₂) pyrithione, and the oxidation product bis(2-pyridinyl)disulfide 1,1′-dioxide (pyrithione disulfide, (PT₂)) have been proven to be as toxic as ZnPT₂ and tributyltin chloride in IPC-81 cells. CuPT₂, FePT₃ and (PT)₂ need to be considered as environmental transformations products of ZnPT₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantifouling agents 3abiocides 3acopper 3adisulfides 3agreen chemistry 3airon 3amechanism of action 3ametabolites 3amethylation 3amoieties 3aoxidation 3apaints 3arats 3arisk assessment 3astructure-activity relationships 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3atri-n-butyltin hydride 3atributyltin 3azinc 3azinc pyrithione1 aRanke, Johannes1 aStock, Frauke1 aBottin-Weber, Ulrike1 aJastorff, Bernd0 tGreen chemistry.g2004 May 4, v. 6, no. 5 p.259-266dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b314753c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245008300214520153000297592002801827650001501855650002901870650001601899650001201915650001201927650001301939650002201952650001001974650001301984650001601997650001302013650002402026650001402050653002302064653003802087653002602125653002802151700005602179700002302235700002202258773011302280856008602393852000902479655001202488IND60716268820221123015734.0210820e20210120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071626882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1248262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHrušovský, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2783-592410aReal-time disruption management approach for intermodal freight transportation  aThe share of intermodal transportation, which is often considered as a sustainable transportation alternative, is rather low compared to road transportation. There are several reasons for this situation, including the increased need for coordination of scheduled transport services and the reduced reliability of intermodal transport chains in case of disruptions. In this regard, developing an advanced algorithmic approach can help to handle real-time data during the execution of transportation and react adequately to detected unexpected events. In this way the reliability of intermodal transport can be increased, which might help to increase its usage and to minimize the negative externalities of freight transportation. This paper proposes a novel real-time decision support system based on a hybrid simulation-optimization approach for intermodal transportation which combines offline planning with online re-planning based on real-time data about unexpected events in the transportation network. For each detected disruption, the affected services and orders are identified and the best re-planning policy is applied. The proposed decision support system is successfully tested on real-life scenarios and is capable of delivering fast and reasonably good solutions in an online environment. This research might be of particular benefit to the transport industry for using advanced solution methodologies and give advice to transportation planners about the optimal policies that can be used in case of disruptions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adecision support systems 3aenvironment 3afreight 3ahybrids 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3apaper 3aplanning 3areliability 3aresearch 3aroad transportation 3asolutions 0aReal-time planning 0aIntermodal freight transportation 0aDisruption management 0aSimulation-optimization1 aDemir, Emrah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4726-25561 aJammernegg, Werner1 aWoensel, Tom van,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 20, v. 280 p.124826-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1248263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245010900178300001400287520088900301592002801190650001101218650002401229650001001253650001301263650004301276650002501319650005201344650002601396653000801422653000701430653000701437653000801444653000801452653000901460653000701469653000901476653000701485653002501492653002601517653002001543653001301563700003701576700004001613700004001653700002701693700004101720700002501761700003601786773011001822856008501932852000902017655001202026IND60592315320221121201004.0180402e20180320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059231532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2018.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Cunha Soares, Taiza10aValidating a probe from GhSERK1 gene for selection of cotton genotypes with somatic embryogenic capacity  ap. 44-50.  aSubstantial progress is being reported in the techniques for plant transformation, but successful regeneration of some genotypes remains a challenging step in the attempts to transform some recalcitrant species. GhSERK1 gene is involved on embryo formation, and its overexpression enhances the embryogenic competence. In this study we validate a short GhSERK1 probe in order to identify embryogenic cotton genotypes using RT-qPCR and blotting assays. Cotton genotypes with contrasting somatic embryogenic capacity were tested using in vitro procedures. High expression of transcripts was found in embryogenic genotypes, and the results were confirmed by the RT-PCR-blotting using a non-radioactive probe. The regeneration ability was confirmed in embryogenic genotypes. We confirmed that GhSERK1 can be used as marker for estimating the somatic embryogenesis ability of cotton plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenotype 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arecalcitrant species 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asomatic embryogenesis 0aACT 0aKT 0aGM 0aLRR 0aNAA 0aPP2A 0aSE 0aSERK 0aZE 0aGossypium hirsutum L 0aSomatic embryogenesis 0aGene expression 0aBlotting1 ada Silva, Carliane Rebeca Coelho1 aChagas Carvalho, Julita Maria Frota1 aCavalcanti, José Jaime Vasconcelos1 ade Lima, Liziane Maria1 ade Albuquerque Melo Filho, Péricles1 aSeverino, Liv Soares1 aSantos, Roseane Cavalcanti dos,0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2018 Mar. 20, v. 270 p.44-50dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2018.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245014000157300001600297520144400313592002801757650001501785650001501800650001301815650001901828650001101847650002201858650001401880650001101894650002001905650001501925650002501940650002601965650000901991650001402000650001502014650001102029650001302040650000702053650001302060700002202073700002002095700001502115700001802130773012202148856007202270852000902342655001202351IND60662224820221118055334.0190904e20040130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066222482DNAL7 a10.1039/b314938m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTezuka, Satoko10aStudies on selective adsorbents for oxo-anions. Nitrate ion-exchange properties of layered double hydroxides with different metal atoms  ap. 104-109.  aLayered double hydroxides (LDHs) with different kinds of metal ions (Mg–Al, Co–Fe, Ni–Fe, and Mg–Fe) in the brucite layers were prepared and their anion exchange properties were studied by measurements of distribution coefficient (Kd) and ion exchange capacity. The basal spacing of LDHs varied depending on the kind of metal ions in the brucite layer. A relatively high Kd value for NO₃⁻ ions was observed on Ni–Fe type LDHs, and a markedly high Kd value for the hydrothermally-treated Ni–Fe type LDHs (Ni–Fe (HT)), prepared at 120 °C. These high Kd values correlated with the basal spacing of 0.81 nm observed for this sample, where the interlayer distance (0.33 nm) is suitable for the stable fixing of NO₃⁻ ions (ionic size = 0.33 nm). A chemical analysis study showed a Cl⁻/NO₃⁻ ion-exchange mechanism for NO₃⁻ adsorption on Ni–Fe (HT). The NO₃⁻ uptake by Ni–Fe (HT) was nearly constant (NO₃/Fe = 0.7) over a pH range between 5 and 10, which also supports the adsorption mechanism of Cl⁻/NO₃⁻ ion exchange. The Ni–Fe (HT) could remove NO₃⁻ ions from seawater effectively (NO₃⁻ uptake = 168 μmol g⁻¹) even though seawater contains an extremely large amount of coexisting anions. This novel adsorbent thus has a NO₃⁻ ion-sieve property and will prove beneficial for the selective removal of NO₃⁻ ions from industrial effluents and seawater to clean the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3aanion exchange 3aanions 3achemical analysis 3achlorides 3acobalt 3agreen chemistry 3ahydroxides 3aindustrial effluents 3aion exchange capacity 3airon 3amagnesium 3ametal ions 3anickel 3anitrates 3apH 3aseawater1 aChitrakar, Ramesh1 aSonoda, Akinari1 aOoi, Kenta1 aTomida, Tahei0 tGreen chemistry.g2004 Jan. 30, v. 6, no. 2 p.104-109dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b314938m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01995naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012400158300002000282520090500302592002801207650004401235650003701279650001501316650002401331650002101355650001501376650001401391650002301405700002401428700002001452773010101472856007501573852000901648655001201657IND60576893920221118205746.0170806e20131223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057689392DNAL7 a10.1021/la40362162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Keith
T.10aFormation of Stable Nitrene Surface Species by the Reaction of Adsorbed Phenyl Isocyanate at the Ge(100)-2 × 1 Surface  ap. 15842-15850.  aThe reaction of phenyl isocyanate (PIC) following adsorption at the Ge(100)-2 × 1 surface has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption, quantum chemical calculations, and molecular dynamics simulations. PIC initially adsorbs by [2 + 2] cycloaddition across the CN bond of the isocyanate, as previously reported, but this initial product converts to a second product on the time scale of minutes at room temperature. The experimental and theoretical results show that the second product formed is phenylnitrene (C₆H₅N) covalently bonded to the germanium surface via a single Ge–N bond. This conclusion is further supported by FTIR spectroscopy experiments and density functional theory calculations using phenyl isocyanate-¹⁵N and phenyl-d₅ isocyanate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3achemical bonding 3adesorption 3agermanium 3amolecular dynamics1 aTanskanen, Jukka T.1 aBent, Stacey F.0 tLangmuir.g2013 Dec. 23, v. 29, no. 51 p.15842-15850dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla40362163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012700165300001600292520155800308592002801866650002701894650002001921650002601941650002601967650002601993650001802019650001202037650001602049650001102065650002402076650002202100650001702122650000902139650001402148650002502162650001702187653002402204653002002228653001902248653002102267700001702288700002002305700001702325773015502342856008102497852000902578655001202587IND60706168620221121134728.0200807e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070616862DNAL7 a10.18805/ijare.v50i6.66802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBagwale, S.B.10aGenetic variability studies for yield, yield contributing and quality traits in okra [Abelmoschus esculentus (L.)

The investigation carried out in the present study revealed that the genotypes 136 Thin, 003163, Kashi Pragati, Kashi Vibhuti and BO 13 showed better performance for traits namely plant height, length of fruit, calcium content, iron content, vitamin C content and fruit yield per hectare. Among the genotypes 136 Thin and 003163 had given highest yield. The high genotypic and phenotypic coefficient of variation was observed for characters namely number of branches, yield per hectare, yield per plot and yield per plant. All these traits indicate additive effect showed response for selection. High heritability estimates were found for characters like number of branches, yield per plot, iron content, yield per plant, plant height, vitamin C content, number of seeds per fruit (dry fruit), fruit bearing node and calcium content indicated good inheritance of these characters. High heritability coupled with high expected genetic advance was observed for characters like plant height, calcium content, yield per plant and yield per hectare, indicated presence of additive gene action and phenotypic selection may become more effective for desired genetic improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3aadditive effect 3aadditive gene effects 3aagricultural colleges 3aagricultural research 3aascorbic acid 3acalcium 3afruit yield 3afruits 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3aokra 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic selection 3aplant height 0aGenetic variability 0aGenetic advance 0aQuality traits 0aYield components1 aJawale, L.N.1 aDeosarkar, D.B.1 aJadhav, R.A.0 tIndian journal of agricultural research.g2016 Dec., v. 50, no. 6 p.614-618dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2026x0976-058X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijare.v50i6.66803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02036naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009900161300001600260500001400276520094300290592002801233650001201261650001301273650001001286650001201296650001001308650001601318651001001334653001001344653002001354653001401374653001501388653001201403700001801415700001801433773009601451856008201547852000901629655001201638IND60699104520221116230940.0210116e20180730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069910452DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.777.260562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHua, Yuan13aAn enigmatic new species of Panorpa Linneaus from the Bashan Mountains (Mecoptera, Panorpidae)  ap. 109-118.  aNAL-light  aA new species of Panorpidae, Panorpa bashanicola sp. n., is described and illustrated from the Bashan Mountains in central China.

For gaining a deeper understanding of hygroscopic behavior, two cellulose nanocrystal films, such as TEMPO oxidized cellulose nanocrystal film (TOCNF) and sulfuric acid treated cellulose nanocrystal film (SACNF) were investigated using dynamic water vapor sorption apparatus. During the water vapor sorption process, the running time, real-time sample mass, target relative humidity (RH), actual RH and real-time temperature were all collected. Through the comparison of these collected data, significant differences in the equilibrium moisture content, sorption hysteresis and sorption kinetics were confirmed. It was important to note that TOCNF and SACNF had equilibrium moisture contents of 28.2% and 22.8, respectively, at a RH of 95%. Then, using parallel exponential kinetics (PEK) model, sorption kinetics data were accurately fitted. Furthermore, two Kelvin-Voigt elements were introduced to interpret the fitting results and calculate the modulus of TOCNF and SACNF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acellulose 3aequilibrium moisture content 3ahygroscopicity 3ahysteresis 3amodels 3ananocrystals 3arelative humidity 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 3awater vapor 0aCellulose nanocrystal 0aRelative humidity 0aSorption kinetics 0aEquilibrium moisture content 0aSorption hysteresis1 aLiu, Liu1 aHu, Yunchu1 aWu, Yiqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3477-21350 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 197 p.524-530dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011900160300001100279520123700290592002801527650002401555650001901579650002701598650002301625650002101648650001301669650004401682650001501726700001601741700001901757700001801776700001401794700001701808700001901825773014801844856008201992852000902074655001202083IND60612671520221117192613.0200228e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061267152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-018-1069-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yi10aFeasibility assessment of up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket treatment of sulfamethoxazole pharmaceutical wastewater  ap. 13.  aTreatment of sulfamethoxazole pharmaceutical wastewater is a big challenge. In this study, a series of anaerobic evaluation tests on pharmaceutical wastewater from different operating units was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using anaerobic digestion, and the results indicated that the key refractory factor for anaerobic treatment of this wastewater was the high sulfate concentration. A laboratory-scale up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was operated for 195 days to investigate the effects of the influent chemical oxygen demand (COD), organic loading rate (OLR), and COD/SO₄²– ratio on the biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole in pharmaceutical wastewater and the process performance. The electron flow indicated that methanogenesis was still the dominant reaction although sulfidogenesis was enhanced with a stepwise decrease in the influent COD/SO₄²– ratio. For the treated sulfamethoxazole pharmaceutical wastewater, a COD of 4983 mg/L (diluted by 50%), OLR of 2.5 kg COD/(m³∙d), and COD/SO₄²– ratio of more than 5 were suitable for practical applications. The recovery performance indicated that the system could resume operation quickly even if production was halted for a few days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradation 3achemical oxygen demand 3amethane production 3asulfamethoxazole 3asulfates 3aupflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 3awastewater1 aHe, Shilong1 aZhou, Mengmeng1 aPan, Tingting1 aXu, Yujia1 aGao, Yingxin1 aWang, Hengkang0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2018 Oct., v. 12, no. 5 p.13-13dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001686x2095-22017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-018-1069-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011900167300001300286520133600299592002801635650002401663650002501687650001101712650002601723650001301749650002501762650001201787650001301799650001601812650001701828650001501845650001301860650001801873650001701891650002101908653002401929653001701953653001601970653001301986653001001999700001502009700001902024700001802043700001502061700001702076700002102093773011302114856008502227852000902312655001202321IND60592315520221117181813.0180402e20180420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059231552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2018.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYun, Eun Ju10aMetabolomic elucidation of the effects of media and carbon sources on fatty acid production by Yarrowia lipolytica  ap. 7-13.  aLipid production by oleaginous Yarrowia lipolytica depends highly on culture environments, such as carbon sources, carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios, types of media, and cellular growth phases. In this study, the effects of media and carbon sources on lipid and metabolite production were investigated by profiling fatty acids and intracellular metabolites of Y. lipolytica grown in various media. The highest total fatty acid yield 114.04 ± 6.23 mg/g dry cell weight was achieved by Y. lipolytica grown in minimal medium with glycerol (SCG) in the exponential phase. The high lipid production by Y. lipolytica in SCG was presumed to be due to the higher C/N ratio in SCG than in the complex media. Moreover, glycerol promoted lipid production better than glucose in both complex and minimal media because glycerol can easily incorporate into the core of triglycerides. Metabolite profiling revealed that levels of long-chain fatty acids, such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, and arachidic acid, increased in SCG medium. Meanwhile, in complex media supplemented with either glucose or glycerol, levels of amino acids, such as cysteine, methionine, and glycine, highly increased. This metabolomic approach could be applied to modulate the global metabolic network of Y. lipolytica for producing lipids and other valuable products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acysteine 3adevelopmental stages 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amethionine 3anitrogen 3apalmitic acid 3astearic acid 3atriacylglycerols 0aYarrowia lipolytica 0aMetabolomics 0aLipogenesis 0aGlycerol 0aMedia1 aLee, James1 aKim, Do Hyoung1 aKim, Jungyeon1 aKim, Sooah1 aJin, Yong-Su1 aKim, Kyoung Heon0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2018 Apr. 20, v. 272-273 p.7-13dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2018.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03594naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002100149245009700170300001600267520260600283592002802889650001102917650001702928650001102945650001102956650001102967650001502978651001002993700002103003700002003024700002303044773009503067856008503162852000903247655001203256IND4466380120221116172310.0141110e20120925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446638012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbetta, Silvia10aEnhancement and comprehensive evaluation of the Rating Curve Model for different river sites  ap. 376-387.  aThis study presents an enhancement of the Rating Curve Model (RCM) proposed by Moramarco et al. (2005) which was initially formulated to assess discharge at a downstream river site where only stage is monitored while the flow is recorded at an upstream section and significant lateral inflow can occur along the river branch. The original model formulation is here of fact extended for upstream discharge estimate by assuming the flow known at a downstream site and stages measured at both ends. In this new configuration, the model can be applied to river reaches with negligible lateral inflow or to river reaches with significant lateral contribution but where a kinematic flow regime holds. The new model formulation is tested by considering two case studies, both selected in the Upper-Middle Tiber River basin, in central Italy. For the first case study, the model is applied to 22 flood events observed along three branches of the Tiber River with accurate rating curves at ends and having the same upstream river site. RCM successfully simulates the discharge hydrographs observed at the upstream section closely capturing both the peak rate and the time to peak, with average absolute errors less than 5% and 0.36h, respectively. The model accuracy is found independent of the intermediate basin area and, hence, of the lateral inflow contribution. The rating curve computed in this upstream section by using the shortest reach is slightly overestimated whereas the ones derived by applying the model to the other two reaches are almost coincident and slightly underestimated, but for all of them the errors are less than 5%. The second case study concerns the estimation of the upstream rating curve at a river site, where discharge measurements are available for very low stages alone, starting from the flow known at two different downstream equipped sections. The RCM application to recorded flood events provides two very similar stage–discharge relationships with a maximum difference, between the reproduced rating curves, of about 5m³/s for the higher stage values. Moreover, the RCM accuracy is shown to be satisfactory for river reaches located in physiographic regions (northern Italy and Slovak Republic) different from the one used for the model development and testing and considered in the two case studies mentioned above. Finally, the model capability to take implicitly account of the unsteady effects (i.e. rating loop) is shown through experimental data recorded by an ultrasonic flowmeter at a gauged site of the Tiber River as well as by considering a numerical test.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acase studies 3afloods 3amodels 3arivers 3awatersheds 3aItaly1 aFranchini, Marco1 aMelone, Florisa1 aMoramarco, Tommaso0 tJournal of hydrology.g2012 Sept. 25, v. 464-465 p.376-387dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.07.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245004400172300001600216520105300232592002801285650001401313650001301327650002001340650001501360650002301375650001701398650002401415650001701439650002901456650001101485650002201496650001701518650000901535650003501544650001101579650001201590650001401602650001301616651001501629653001301644653001101657653001701668653001201685653001701697653002301714653001201737653001201749653001501761700002401776700002701800700002301827773010601850856008501956852000902041655001202050IND60564353420221118094223.0190215e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056435342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2016.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorgerson, Cortni10aWho hunts lemurs and why they hunt them  ap. 124-130.  aThe main threats to lemurs are habitat loss and hunting. Conservation policies often assume that people will decrease lemur hunting if they understand government prohibitions on hunting, are educated and/or involved in ecotourism, have access to affordable meat, and/or are healthy and financially secure. Yet these assumptions are often not well tested where conservation policies are implemented. We interviewed every member of a focal village in one of the most biodiverse places on earth, the Masoala peninsula of Madagascar. The factors that best predicted the decision to hunt lemurs were poverty, poor health, and child malnutrition. Knowledge of laws, level of education, involvement in ecotourism, traditional cultural values, taste preferences, opportunity, and human–wildlife conflict had no impact on lemur hunting. Our results suggest that the welfare of humans and lemurs are linked. The key to discouraging illegal hunting and improving the viability of Endangered lemur populations may be improving rural human health and welfare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLemuridae 3achildren 3acultural values 3aecotourism 3aeducational status 3afood choices 3ahabitat destruction 3ahuman health 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3amalnutrition 3ameat 3anatural resources conservation 3apeople 3apoverty 3aviability 3avillages 3aMadagascar 0aBushmeat 0aLemurs 0aConservation 0aHunting 0aHuman health 0aChild malnutrition 0aPoverty 0aMasoala 0aMadagascar1 aMcKean, Margaret A.1 aSutherland, Michael R.1 aGodfrey, Laurie R.0 tBiological conservation.g2016 May, v. 197 p.124-130dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2016.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04258naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245015500184300001800339520190500357592002802262650001802290650001602308650001002324650001702334650001802351650001202369650002002381650001202401650001702413650000802430650001002438650001502448650002402463650001402487650001602501650001102517650003002528650001102558650000902569650002702578650002502605650002002630650003002650650001202680650001602692650002802708650002402736650001102760650005702771650005402828650003402882650004902916650003202965650006702997650005803064651001303122651001203135651001303147651000903160700002303169700002603192700002603218700002303244700002303267773011903290856008203409852000903491655001203500IND4469595720221118145625.0210820e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446959572DNAL7 a215379842pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-011-2419-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanwan, Penchom10aRapid detection of Opisthorchis viverrini and Strongyloides stercoralis in human fecal samples using a duplex real-time PCR and melting curve analysis  ap. 1593-1601.  aHuman opisthorchiasis caused by the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini is an endemic disease in Southeast Asian countries including the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand. Infection with the soil-transmitted roundworm Strongyloides stercoralis is an important problem worldwide. In some areas, both parasitic infections are reported as co-infections. A duplex real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) PCR merged with melting curve analysis was developed for the rapid detection of O. viverrini and S. stercoralis in human fecal samples. Duplex real-time FRET PCR is based on fluorescence melting curve analysis of a hybrid of amplicons generated from two genera of DNA elements: the 162 bp pOV-A6 DNA sequence specific to O. viverrini and the 244 bp 18S rRNA sequence specific to S. stercoralis, and two pairs of specific fluorophore-labeled probes. Both O. viverrini and S. stercoralis can be differentially detected in infected human fecal samples by this process through their different fluorescence channels and melting temperatures. Detection limit of the method was as little as two O. viverrini eggs and four S. stercoralis larvae in 100 mg of fecal sample. The assay could distinguish the DNA of both parasites from the DNA of negative fecal samples and fecal samples with other parasite materials, as well as from the DNA of human leukocytes and other control parasites. The technique showed 100% sensitivity and specificity. The introduced duplex real-time FRET PCR can reduce labor time and reagent costs and is not prone to carry over contamination. The method is important for simultaneous detection especially in areas where both parasites overlap incidence and is useful as the screening tool in the returning travelers and immigrants to industrialized countries where number of samples in the diagnostic units will become increasing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aribosomal RNA 3aparasitoses 3alabor 3aliver flukes 3amelting point 3amelting 3adetection limit 3ahybrids 3afluorescence 3aDNA 3afeces 3aleukocytes 3adeveloped countries 3ascreening 3aimmigration 3ahumans 3apolymerase chain reaction 3alarvae 3aeggs 3aOpisthorchis viverrini 3anucleotide sequences 3aenergy transfer 3aStrongyloides stercoralis 2aAnimals 2aCoinfection 2aDNA, Helminthxgenetics 2aFecesxparasitology 2aHumans 2aOpisthorchiasisxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxgenetics. 2aOpisthorchisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aStrongyloides stercoralisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aStrongyloidiasisxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxgenetics. 3aThailand 3aVietnam 3aCambodia 3aLaos1 aIntapan, Pewpan M.1 aThanchomnang, Tongjit1 aLulitanond, Viraphong1 aAnamnart, Witthaya1 aMaleewong, Wanchai0 tParasitology research.g2011 Dec., v. 109, no. 6 p.1593-1601dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2419-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245012100135300001400256520131700270592002801587650002301615650002601638650001101664650001301675650001201688650001001700650001401710650001001724650000901734650001801743650001401761650001301775653002301788653001901811653002601830653001801856700001901874773012901893852000902022655001202031IND60477779620221123035149.0160105e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047777962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, P.

Except one or two bracts of the inner whorl of the perianth, under which an active and healthy population of the mite was thriving, the rest of the five or four bracts were removed from a young nut and a suspension of conidia was injected into the thin space between the nut surface and the inner surface of the bract/s by gently lifting the bract/s but leaving it/them intact. The meristematic region of the nut that got exposed after the removal of bracts as well as the retained bract/s were sheathed with a stretched parafilm up to the green portion of the nut in such a manner that there were no gaps. The treated nuts were incubated under ambient conditions. At the end of 96 h, the parafilm was unwound and the bract/s was/were opened to observe infected mites on the inner surface of the bract/s and/or on the nut surface just below the detached bract/s under a stereozoom microscope. The fungus was isolated from the infected mites and upon fresh inoculation it could again produce disease in the mites and exhibit the same microand macro-morphology in culture after the second passage as well, thus satisfying Koch's postulates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAceria guerreronis 3aHirsutella thompsonii 3abracts 3acoconuts 3aconidia 3afungi 3ameristems 3amites 3anuts 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aperianth 0aAceria guerreronis 0acoconut; fungi 0aHirsutella thompsonii 0apathogenicity1 aAnuroop, C.

Hence, to study the influence of methylglycine ligand on biological behavior of metal complexes, two water-soluble platinum (II) complexes with the formula cis-[Pt(NH₃)₂(CH₃-gly)]NO₃ and cis-[Pt(NH₂-CH₃)₂(CH₃-gly)]NO₃ (where CH₃-gly is methylglycine) have been synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic methods, molar conductivity measurements, and elemental analyzes. The anticancer activity of synthesized complexes was tested against human breast adenocarcinoma cell line of MCF7 using MTT assay and results showed excellent anticancer activity with Cc₅₀ values of 126 and 292 μM after 24 h incubation time, for both complexes of cis-[Pt(NH₃)₂(CH₃gly)]NO₃ and cis-[Pt(NH₂-CH₃)₂(CH₃gly)]NO₃, respectively. Also, the interaction between Pt(II) complexes with calf thymus DNA was extensively studied by means of absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence titration spectra displacement with ethidium bromide (EtBr), and circular dichroism studied in Tris-buffer. The obtained spectroscopic results revealed that two complexes can bind to highly polymerized calf thymus DNA cooperatively and denature at micromolar concentrations. The fluorescence data indicate that quenching effect for cis-[Pt(NH₃)₂(CH₃gly)]NO₃ (Kₛᵥ = 9.48 mM⁻¹) was higher than that of cis-[Pt(NH₂-CH₃)₂(CH₃gly)]NO₃ (Kₛᵥ ₌ 1.98 mM⁻¹). These results were also confirmed by circular dichrosim spectra. Consequently, docking data showed that cis-[Pt(NH₃)₂(CH₃gly)]NO₃ with more interaction energy binds on DNA via groove binding which is more compatible with experimental results. Graphical Abstract ᅟ Two anticancer Pt(II) complexes, cis-[Pt(NH₃)₂(CH₃gly)]NO₃ and cis-[Pt(NH₂₋CH₃)₂(CH₃gly)]NO₃, have been synthesized and interacted with calf thymus DNA. Improving solubility of these compounds reduce side effects and increase anticancer activity against human breast cell line. Modes of binding have been studied by electronic absorption, fluorescence, and CD measurements. Results show that both Pt(II) complexes can interact to DNA via groove binding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aabsorption 3aammonia 3aantineoplastic activity 3abreasts 3acalves 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acisplatin 3aenergy 3aethidium 3afluorescence 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aligands 3aneoplasm cells 3anitrates 3aplatinum 3apolymerization 3asarcosines 3athymus gland 3atitration 3awater solubility1 aEslami Moghadam, Mahboube1 aDivsalar, Adeleh1 aAjloo, Davood1 aHosaini Sadr, Moyaed0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2018 Oct., v. 186, no. 2 p.271-291dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-018-2715-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015000167300001200317520182800329592002802157650001602185650001702201650000902218650001502227650001402242650001302256650001602269650002102285650001102306651001202317653001302329653001002342653001202352653000902364653001902373653001102392653001902403653001102422653001502433653001102448700002002459700001802479700001902497700002102516773011002537856008202647852000902729655001202738IND60112704920221120082945.0190415e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011270492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2013.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPersson, Agneta10aSexual life stages and temperature dependent morphological changes allow cryptic occurrence of the Florida red tide dinoflagellate Karenia brevis  ap. 1-9.  aKarenia brevis, the Florida red tide dinoflagellate, has been studied extensively, but very little attention has been paid to its sexual life cycle. We found that the life cycle of K. brevis is heterothallic, most probably not resting cyst-producing, but with life stages of different morphology. The isogamous gametes were slightly smaller than vegetative cells and not as broad and flat. The late zygote was yellow-brown in appearance with a thicker wall and more rounded shape lacking carina. Pellicle cysts of these zygotes closely resembled the few earlier descriptions of “possible cysts” of the species. In addition, temperature-dependent, morphological changes and pellicle-cyst formation were observed. Cells placed in the cold (15°C) formed spherical, thin-walled pellicle cysts that germinated into cells that were round in cross-section and longer than wide – so morphologically different from vegetative cells that they would not be correctly identified if encountered in field samples. Cells grown at 25°C were wider and flatter than cells grown at 20°C. Cells warmed from cold conditions became flat and wide within hours, returning to the typical shape. Also the morphological differences between sexual life stages were large enough to allow misidentification and cryptic occurrence of K. brevis. The cell shape of K. brevis was not fixed, but could vary from very wide and flat to elongate with rounded cross-section in the same culture of clonal cells and in the same cells within a short time (hours).In addition to the culture studies, sediment samples from a Karenia “hot spot” area were concentrated, and the dinoflagellate cyst fraction was investigated for resting cysts. Cysts were not found, and Karenia cells did not germinate from slurry cultures of the concentrated cyst fraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDinophyceae 3aalgal blooms 3acold 3agerm cells 3asediments 3aslurries 3atemperature 3avegetative cells 3azygote 3aFlorida 0aBehavior 0aBloom 0aCryptic 0aCyst 0aDinoflagellate 0aGamete 0aKarenia brevis 0aMating 0aMorphology 0aZygote1 aSmith, Barry C.1 aMorton, Steve1 aShuler, Andrew1 aWikfors, Gary H.0 tHarmful algae.g2013 Dec., v. 30 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2013.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03936naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003200141245011200173520218700285592002802472650002502500650001702525650001202542650001602554650001602570650002002586650001802606650001302624650002502637650000902662650001002671650002402681650002202705650002002727650002002747650002702767650002302794650002302817650002002840650000902860650001702869650001802886650002402904650000702928650001702935650001002952650001602962700003302978700002703011700003803038700003303076700003103109773012103140856007603261852000903337655001203346IND60757606220221122230356.0211125e20211108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075760622DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111131842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrzuna-Orzuna, José Felipe10aGrowth Performance, Meat Quality and Antioxidant Status of Sheep Supplemented with Tannins: A Meta-Analysis  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with tannins (TANs) on productive performance, carcass characteristics, meat quality, oxidative stability, and blood serum antioxidant capacity of sheep through a meta-analysis. Using Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and PubMed databases, a systematic search was performed for studies published in scientific journals that investigated the effects of TANs supplementation on the variables of interest. Only studies with weaned or older sheep were included. The data analyzed were extracted from 53 peer-reviewed publications. The sheep included in the present study were between 2 and 6 months old, and between 12 and 31 kg of body weight. The effects of TANs were analyzed using random-effects statistical models to examine the standardized mean difference (SMD) between treatments with TANs and control (no TANs). Heterogeneity was explored by meta-regression and a subgroup analysis was performed for covariates that were significant. Supplementation with TANs did not affect dry matter intake, pH, color (L* and b*), Warner–Bratzler shear force, cooking loss and meat chemical composition (p > 0.05). Supplementation with TANs increased daily weight gain (SMD = 0.274, p < 0.05), total antioxidant capacity (SMD = 1.120, p < 0.001), glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity (SMD = 0.801, p < 0.001) and catalase (SMD = 0.848, p < 0.001), and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in blood serum (SMD = −0.535, p < 0.05). Supplementation with TANs decreased feed conversion rate (SMD = −0.246, p < 0.05), and the concentration of MDA (SMD = −2.020, p < 0.001) and metmyoglobin (SMD = −0.482, p < 0.05) in meat. However, meat redness (SMD = 0.365), hot carcass yield (SMD = 0.234), cold carcass yield (SMD = 0.510), backfat thickness (SMD = 0.565) and the Longissimus dorsi muscle area (SMD = 0.413) increased in response to TANs supplementation (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the addition of tannins in sheep diets improves productive performance, antioxidant status in blood serum, oxidative stability of meat and some other characteristics related to meat and carcass quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abackfat 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acarcass quality 3acarcass yield 3acatalase 3achemical composition 3acold 3acolor 3adietary supplements 3adry matter intake 3aenzyme activity 3afeed conversion 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrowth performance 3alongissimus muscle 3amalondialdehyde 3ameat 3ameat quality 3ameta-analysis 3aoxidative stability 3apH 3ashear stress 3asheep 3aweight gain1 aDorantes-Iturbide, Griselda 1 aLara-Bueno, Alejandro 1 aMendoza Martínez, Germán David,1 aMiranda-Romero, Luis Alberto1 aLee-Rangel, Héctor Aarón0 tAnimals.g2021 Nov. 08, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111131843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245010100162520170500263592002801968650001901996650001502015650002902030650001302059650001902072650001202091650001802103650002402121700002002145700002002165700002302185700001902208700002402227700002102251773012102272856007602393852000902469655001202478IND60757606320221120154104.0211125e20211108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075760632DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111131852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOstović, Mario 12aA Survey Study of Veterinary Student Opinions and Knowledge about Pet Reptiles and Their Welfare  aExotic pet medicine is rapidly evolving, with reptiles becoming increasingly popular pet animals. Yet, there are only a few literature reports on veterinary perception of reptiles kept as pets. The aim of the study was to assess opinions and knowledge of the Croatian veterinarians-to-be about pet reptiles and their welfare. The questionnaire survey was conducted in the academic year 2019–2020 and included students of all six years of the integrated undergraduate and graduate study at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zagreb. First-year students were surveyed twice, before and after having attended the compulsory course on animal welfare. Questionnaire statements were 5-point Likert scale questions, requiring the students to express their opinions about turtles, lizards and snakes as pets, issues related to their welfare, risks they pose to the health and safety of humans, other animals and the environment, and their self-reported knowledge about pet reptiles. Although expressing higher opinions after having attended the course on animal welfare, first-year student responses remained neutral to most of the statements. Such a trend continued until the end of the study. Student responses revealed that they were uncertain about their knowledge of reptiles as pets, considering different educational areas observed. Study results emphasised the need of alterations in veterinary curriculum and additional student education in reptile medicine. The results obtained have broad implications involving not only the welfare of pet reptiles in clinical practice and elsewhere but also the health and safety of humans and other animals, as well as environmental protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3acurriculum 3aenvironmental protection 3amedicine 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary medicine1 aSabolek, Ivana 1 aPiplica, Aneta 1 aŽaja, Ivona Žura1 aMenčik, Sven 1 aNejedli, Srebrenka 1 aMesić, Željka 0 tAnimals.g2021 Nov. 08, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111131853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002200135245007500157300001600232500002000248520174600268592002802014650001902042650002002061650001502081650002802096650002002124650002602144650002602170650001802196650001102214773009602225852000902321856007102330655001202401IND4371186420221122061402.0170626e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437118642DNAL7 a10.1890/02-07382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagner, Helene H.10aDirect multi‐scale ordination with canonical correspondence analysis  ap. 342-351.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGradient analysis uses ordination methods to study the structure of biotic communities caused by biotic processes operating in a heterogeneous environment. This structure has two spatial components: spatial processes within the community create autocorrelation, and the spatial structure of environmental factors creates spatial dependence. Ordination methods, however, do not make use of spatial information. Spatial alternatives are available in multivariate geostatistics, but are not compatible with important ordination methods used in gradient analysis, correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis (CA, CCA). This paper shows how CA and CCA can be partitioned by distance (indirect and direct multi‐scale ordination) and integrated with geostatistics. A diagnostic tool enables ecologists to partition ordination results by distance, to distinguish between components of spatial dependence and of spatial autocorrelation, and to check assumptions of independent residuals, stationarity, and scale‐invariant correlation. The application is illustrated with a well‐known data set of oribatid mites. Empirical chi‐square variograms of individual species, their pair‐wise cross variograms, and the variogram of the total inertia are defined and summarized in a variogram matrix, which leads to a spatial partitioning of the eigenvalues. The empirical variogram matrix provides a link to coregionalization analysis that may be used to simultaneously model spatial dependence and spatial autocorrelation. This will be useful for answering questions about the organism‐specific scale of response to the environment, the optimal spacing of sampling units, or the scale‐dependent effect of environmental factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSarcoptiformes 3aautocorrelation 3abiocenosis 3acorrespondence analysis 3adata collection 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenvironmental factors 3ageostatistics 3amodels0 tEcology.g2004 Feb., v. 85, no. 2 p.342-351dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-07383Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03242naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014900167300001400316520163900330592002801969650002401997650001702021650001902038650002302057650001202080650001002092650001802102650001602120650001102136650002002147650001302167650001902180650001802199650002102217650002202238650001002260651001402270653002402284653002102308653001502329653001302344653001702357653001902374700002102393700001602414700001802430700001602448700002102464773011202485856008202597852000902679655001202688IND60112705120221122120010.0190415e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011270512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2013.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowling, Lee C.10aEffects of hydrology and river management on the distribution, abundance and persistence of cyanobacterial blooms in the Murray River, Australia  ap. 27-36.  aMajor cyanobacterial blooms (biovolume>4mm3L−1) occurred in the main water reservoirs on the upper Murray River, Australia during February and March 2010. Cyanobacterial-infested water was released and contaminated rivers downstream. River flow velocities were sufficiently high that in-stream bloom development was unlikely. The location has a temperate climate but experienced drought in 2010, causing river flows that were well below the long-term median values. This coupled with very low bed gradients meant turbulence was insufficient to destroy the cyanobacteria in-stream. Blooms in the upper 500km of the Murray and Edward Rivers persisted for 5 weeks, but in the mid and lower Murray blooms were confined to a small package of water that moved progressively downstream for another 650km. Anabaena circinalis was the dominant species present, confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, but other potentially toxic species were also present in smaller amounts. Saxitoxin (sxtA), microcystin (mcyE) and cylindrospermopsin (aoaA) biosynthesis genes were also detected, although water sample analysis rarely detected these toxins. River water temperature and nutrient concentrations were optimal for bloom survival. The operational design of weirs and retention times within weir pools, as well as tributary inflows to and diversions from the Murray River all influenced the distribution and persistence of the blooms. Similar flow, water quality and river regulation factors were underlying causes of another bloom in these rivers in 2009. Global climate change is likely to promote future blooms in this and other lowland rivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabaena circinalis 3abiosynthesis 3aclimate change 3acylindrospermopsin 3adrought 3agenes 3aribosomal RNA 3ariver water 3arivers 3atemperate zones 3atoxicity 3aturbulent flow 3awater quality 3awater reservoirs 3awater temperature 3aweirs 3aAustralia 0aAnabaena circinalis 0aRiver regulation 0aWeir pools 0aToxicity 0aToxigenicity 0aClimate change1 aMerrick, Chester1 aSwann, Judy1 aGreen, Damian1 aSmith, Greg1 aNeilan, Brett A.0 tHarmful algae.g2013 Dec., v. 30 p.27-36dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2013.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100003000186245008700216300001800303506007600321520147700397592002801874506003701902650001801939650001801957650001101975650001801986650002502004650002002029650002302049650001102072650001602083650001402099653001902113653002502132653001602157653001802173700002402191700002102215700002102236700002302257700002002280773017302300856007902473852000902552655001202561IND60178645720221207054852.0150604e20140708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017864572DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13214211112doi7 aPMC41033752pmcid7 a249588662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunter-Cevera, Kristen R.10aDiel size distributions reveal seasonal growth dynamics of a coastal phytoplankter  ap. 9852-9857.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhytoplankton account for roughly half of global primary production; it is vital that we understand the processes that control their abundance. A key process is cell division. We have, however, been unable to estimate division rate in natural populations at the appropriate timescale (hours to days) for extended periods of time (months to years). For phytoplankton, the diel change in cell size distribution is related to division rate, which offers an avenue to obtain estimates from in situ observations. We show that a matrix population model, fit to hourly cell size distributions, accurately estimates division rates of both cultured and natural populations of Synechococcus . Application of the model to Synechococcus at the Martha’s Vineyard Coastal Observatory provides an unprecedented view that reveals a distinct seasonality in division rates. This information allows us to separate the effects of growth and loss quantitatively over an entire seasonal cycle. We find that division and loss processes are tightly coupled throughout the year. The large seasonal changes in cell abundance are the result of periods of time (weeks to months) when there are small systematic differences that favor either net growth or loss. We also find that temperature plays a critical role in limiting division rate during the annual spring bloom. This approach opens a path to quantify the role of Synechococcus in ecological and biogeochemical processes in natural systems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSynechococcus 3acell division 3amodels 3aphytoplankton 3aprimary productivity 3aseasonal growth 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3atemperature 3avineyards 0aflow cytometry 0aphytoplankton blooms 0aFlowCytobot 0acyanobacteria1 aNeubert, Michael G.1 aSolow, Andrew R.1 aOlson, Robert J.1 aShalapyonok, Alexi1 aSosik, Heidi M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 July 8, v. 111, no. 27 p.9852-9857dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13214211113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245009600161520132300257592002801580650001501608650002501623650002701648650001101675650001301686650001901699650001601718650002701734650002401761650001201785651002101797700002001818700001901838700001401857700001601871700002101887700002201908700002001930700001601950773012101966856007602087852000902163655001202172IND60757606420221120160345.0211125e20211108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075760642DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111131862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Eunkyung 12aA First Genome Survey and Genomic SSR Marker Analysis of Trematomus loennbergii Regan, 1913  aTrematomus loennbergii Regan, 1913, is an evolutionarily important marine fish species distributed in the Antarctic Ocean. However, its genome has not been studied to date. In the present study, whole genome sequencing was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to characterize its genome and develop genomic microsatellite markers. The 25-mer frequency distribution was estimated to be the best, and the genome size was predicted to be 815,042,992 bp. The heterozygosity, average rate of read duplication, and sequencing error rates were 0.536%, 0.724%, and 0.292%, respectively. These data were used to analyze microsatellite markers, and a total of 2,264,647 repeat motifs were identified. The most frequent repeat motif was di-nucleotide with 87.00% frequency, followed by tri-nucleotide (10.45%), tetra-nucleotide (1.94%), penta-nucleotide (0.34%), and hexa-nucleotide (0.27%). The AC repeat motif was the most abundant motif among di-nucleotides and among all repeat motifs. Among microsatellite markers, 181 markers were selected and PCR technology was used to validate several markers. A total of 15 markers produced only one band. In summary, these results provide a good basis for further studies, including evolutionary biology studies and population genetics of Antarctic fish species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrematomus 3aevolutionary biology 3afrequency distribution 3agenome 3agenomics 3aheterozygosity 3amarine fish 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation genetics 3asurveys 3aAntarctic region1 aKim, Sŏn-hŭi,1 aLee, Seung Jae1 aJo, Euna 1 aKim, Jinmu 1 aKim, Jeong-Hoon 1 aParker, Steven J.1 aChi, Young-Min 1 aPark, Hyun 0 tAnimals.g2021 Nov. 08, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111131863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011800164520128400282592002801566650001401594650001901608650001601627650001601643650000901659650001401668650001201682650001201694650002301706650001701729650001401746650002101760650002101781650001701802700002201819700002201841700002001863700001901883700002001902700002301922773012001945856007902065852000902144655001202153IND60742608320221120083357.0210624e20210610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074260832DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120605402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagura, Tibor 10aDifferences in Life History Traits in Rural vs. Urban Populations of a Specialist Ground Beetle, Carabus convexus  aUrbanization is increasing worldwide and causes substantial changes in environmental parameters, generating various kinds of stress on arthropods, with several harmful consequences. We examined a forest specialist ground beetle, Carabus convexus, in forested habitats to evaluate the changes in four important life history traits between rural and urban populations. Analyzing beetles from the overwintered cohort in their first breeding season, we found no significant differences in body length or body mass between the rural and urban individuals. Body condition, judged by fat reserve scores, was similarly poor in both habitats, indicating that beetles were not able to accumulate substantial fat reserves at either habitat. Females with ripe eggs in their ovaries were first captured at the same time in both areas. The number of ripe eggs, however, was significantly higher in females of the low-density urban population (6.13 eggs/female) than in those of the high-density rural population (4.14 eggs/female), indicating density-dependent fecundity. Altered environmental and habitat conditions by urbanization, however, seemed to cause high mortality during egg hatching and/or larval development, preventing the growth of the urban population to the level of rural one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarabidae 3abody condition 3abody length 3abody weight 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3aforests 3alarval development 3alife history 3amortality 3arural population 3aurban population 3aurbanization1 aMizser, Szabolcs 1 aHorváth, Roland 1 aNagy, Dávid D.1 aTóth, Mária,1 aCsicsek, Réka 1 aLövei, Gábor L.,0 tInsects.g2021 June 10, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120605403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245016800153300002000321520159300341592002801934650002201962650001701984650001102001650001502012650002302027650002302050650001302073650001102086650003002097650002602127650002102153700001402174700001702188773012302205856007502328852000902403655001202412IND60559286020221120124425.0161205e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055928602DNAL7 a10.1021/jp506869q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Kai10aVersatile Electron-Collecting Interfacial Layer by in Situ Growth of Silver Nanoparticles in Nonconjugated Polyelectrolyte Aqueous Solution for Polymer Solar Cells  ap. 11563-11572.  aNovel PEIE-Ag composites by in situ growth of silver nanoparticles in poly(ethylenimine)-ethoxylated (PEIE) aqueous solution are explored as an efficient interfacial layer for improving inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs) performance. The hybrid PEIE-Ag interfacial material is simple to fabricate only via ultraviolet irradiation with good water-solubility and unique film formation. The generated Ag nanoparticles can anchor in the PEIE polymer chains to form a conductive continuous interpenetrating network structure. Combining of the advantages of PEIE and Ag nanoparticles, the PEIE-Ag shows enhanced charge transport, electron selective and collection, and improved light-harvesting, mainly due to the surface plasmon resonance effect, better energy alignment induced by the formation of ideal dipole layer, as well as the improved conductivity. These distinguished interfacial properties result in the power conversion efficiency of inverted PSCs based on poly[4,8-bis(2-ethyl-hexyl-thiophene-5-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene-2,6-diyl]-alt-[2-(2-ethyl-hexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophen-4,6-diyl] (PBDTTT-C-T) and [6,6]-phenyl C₇₁-butyric acid methyl ester (PC₇₁BM) photoactive layer substantially improved up to 7.66% from 6.11%. Moreover, the device performance is insensitively dependent on the thickness of the PEIE-Ag interfacial layer, broadening the thicknesses selection window for interfacial materials. These results demonstrate that PEIE-Ag is a potential interfacial material compatible with roll-to-roll techniques and suitable for printed electronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3ananosilver 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymers 3asilver 3asurface plasmon resonance 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater solubility1 aChen, Lie1 aChen, Yiwang0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Oct. 02, v. 118, no. 39 p.11563-11572dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp506869q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001400176245011300190300001500303520117500318592002801493650001901521650001501540650001101555650001301566650001401579700001501593700001801608700001401626700001701640773015201657856007001809856010601879990002301985852000902008655001202017IND60608601020221120043753.0190510e20171017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060860102DNAL7 a10.3791/563882doi7 aPMC57524212pmcid7 a291557782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xiang12aA detailed protocol for physiological parameters acquisition and analysis in neurosurgical critical patients  ap. e56388.  aIntracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is now widely used in neurosurgical critical patients. Besides mean ICP value, the ICP derived parameters such as ICP waveform, amplitude of pulse (AMP), the correlation of ICP amplitude and ICP mean (RAP), pressure reactivity index (PRx), ICP and arterial blood pressure (ABP) wave amplitude correlation (IAAC), and so on, can reflect intracranial status, predict prognosis, and can also be used as guidance of proper treatment. However, most of the clinicians focus only on the mean ICP value while ignoring these parameters because of the limitations of the current devices. We have recently developed a multimodality monitoring system to address these drawbacks. This portable, user-friendly system will use a data collecting and storing device to continuously acquire patients' physiological parameters first, i.e., ABP, ICP, and oxygen saturation, and then analyze these physiological parameters. We hope that the multimodality monitoring system will be accepted as a key measure to monitor physiological parameters, to analyze the current clinical status, and to predict the prognosis of the neurosurgical critical patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood pressure 3amonitoring 3aoxygen 3apatients 3aprognosis1 aGao, Guoyi1 aFeng, Junfeng1 aMao, Qing1 aJiang, Jiyao0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Oct. 17, , no. 128 p.e56388-e56388dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/563883Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/56388/a-detailed-protocol-for-physiological-parameters-acquisition-analysis  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245024500158300002000403520142100423592002801844650002301872650001301895650002101908650002101929650001301950650002301963650002401986650002002010650002202030650003702052700002402089700001902113700001702132700001602149700002402165700002002189773012302209856007502332852000902407655001202416IND60559286120221120124509.0161205e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055928612DNAL7 a10.1021/jp507378w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Surajit10aOrganic Additive, 5-Methylsalicylic Acid Induces Spontaneous Structural Transformation of Aqueous Pluronic Triblock Copolymer Solution: A Spectroscopic Investigation of Interaction of Curcumin with Pluronic Micellar and Vesicular Aggregates  ap. 11437-11448.  aThis article presents the interaction of curcumin in the microenvironments provided by aggregation of pluronic triblock copolymer P123 into micellar and vesicular assemblies. The formation of vesicles using triblock copolymer P123 and 5-methylsalicylic acid (5 mS) has been successfully characterized by optical spectroscopy, light scattering measurement, and eventually microscopic techniques. Besides, to make a comparative study between the polymeric micelles, we have also investigated the photophysical changes of curcumin in F127 triblock copolymer micelles having variation in poly(ethylene oxide) (PPO) and poly(propylene oxide) (PEO) unit of polymer chain to that of P123. Time-dependent UV–vis measurement suggests that these polymer micelles are able to stabilize poorly water-soluble curcumin by suppressing the degradation rate in micellar nanocavity. However, experimental observations suggest that P123 micelles are more efficient than F127 to perturb excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT)-related nonradiative decay of curcumin. We also observed that rigid and confined microenvironment of P123/5 mS vesicles enhances emission intensity and lifetime of curcumin more compared to P123 micelles. All the observations suggest that modulation of photophysics of curcumin is responsible due to its interaction with poly(ethylene oxide) or poly(propylene oxide) unit of triblock copolymer.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acurcumin 3aemissions factor 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3aphysical chemistry 3apolyethylene glycol 3apropylene oxide 3aspectral analysis 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aKuchlyan, Jagannath1 aBanik, Debasis1 aKundu, Niloy1 aRoy, Arpita1 aBanerjee, Chiranjib1 aSarkar, Nilmoni0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Oct. 02, v. 118, no. 39 p.11437-11448dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp507378w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04025naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245016400169300001400333520259200347592002802939650002302967650002902990650001103019650002803030650002003058650001403078650001203092650001303104650001503117650001703132650001503149650002303164651001003187653002303197653002603220653002303246653001603269653001503285700001703300700002503317700002103342773009703363856008603460852000903546655001203555IND60535671320221121055836.0190319e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053567132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2014.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNurra, Nicola10aReprint of “Monitoring of a Posidonia oceanica bed (Punta Manara, Eastern Ligurian Sea, Italy) and the associated molluscs twenty years after: What's new?”  ap. 14-21.  aThis research project by the Marine Biology Laboratory at Turin University determined the degree of conservation and measured the size of the Posidonia oceanica bed in the eastern Ligurian Sea off Punta Manara in 1985–1986, a bed that had also been examined in 1973. This project assessed the structure, dynamics, and organization of the foliar stratum malacofauna in relation to the most important space–time variables, the bathymetric gradients, and the seasons. In 2006 the laboratory investigated this bed with methods like the previous ones in order to evaluate the effect of anthropogenic disturbances and to assess any changes in the P. oceanica and mollusc-community dynamics. Our overall project has spanned many years, something unique in P. oceanica studies. Our structural analysis of the meadow found (i) a reduction in shoot density in all the bed's regions, particularly in the shallow and intermediate belts; (ii) a progressive reduction of the lower limit (now considered erosive–regressive). We sampled the foliar stratum molluscs using hand-towed nets, the means we used to collect semi-quantitative data. In 2006, there were 40% fewer specimens and 31.5% more species than in 1985–1986. The core-stock (sensu Russo) has remained the same over the years in terms of both the presence and the abundance of species (8 dominant species belonging to Cerithidae and Rissoidae). As in 1985–1986, Bittium latreillii is the dominant species, whose juveniles exhibited similar settlement dynamics on the foliar strata and whose samples had comparable peaks in reproduction and abundance. The multivariate approach was applied to both the 1985–1986 and the 2006 data set. The present results confirm those obtained through the Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) in 1985–1986. Namely, time (the period or the season) is the main factor of variability, the one that influences the malacological assemblages the most. The composition of the stocks depends closely on the sampling period (ANOSIM, R=0.532, P<0.001) and hence is linked to the biological cycle of the seagrass. The development of P. oceanica affects the malacological assemblages and regulates them quantitatively, something most evident in the reproductive and settlement cycles of the two dominant families, Cerithidae and Rissoidae. Thus the spatial variations (the variations in depths or bathymetric gradient) play a major role in determining the species of the stocks, while the temporal variations – the changes in seasons – play a major role in determining the total number of molluscs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPosidonia oceanica 3aanthropogenic activities 3abotany 3acorrespondence analysis 3adata collection 3ajuveniles 3ameadows 3amolluscs 3amonitoring 3areproduction 3aseagrasses 3atemporal variation 3aItaly 0aPosidonia oceanica 0aHistorical comparison 0aBittium latreillii 0aMalacofauna 0aCore stock1 aBelci, Fabio1 aMussat Sartor, Rocco1 aPessani, Daniela0 tAquatic botany.g2014 Apr., v. 115 p.14-21dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2014.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245011000168300002000278520120100298592002801499650002101527650002101548650001101569650001201580650002301592650002201615650001101637650001701648650001301665700001901678700003001697773012301727856007501850852000901925655001201934IND60559286220221120124452.0161205e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055928622DNAL7 a10.1021/jp507463q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotamarthi, Hema Chandra10aMechanical Unfolding of Ribose Binding Protein and Its Comparison with Other Periplasmic Binding Proteins  ap. 11449-11454.  aFolding and unfolding studies on large, multidomain proteins are still rare despite their high abundance in genomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here, we investigate the unfolding properties of a 271 residue, two-domain ribose binding protein (RBP) from the bacterial periplasm using single-molecule force spectroscopy. We observe that RBP predominately unfolds via a two-state pathway with an unfolding force of ∼80 pN and an unfolding contour length of ∼95 nm. Only a small population (∼15%) of RBP follows three-state pathways. The ligand binding neither increases the mechanical stability nor influences the unfolding flux of RBP through different pathways. The kinetic partitioning between two-state and three-state pathways, which has been reported earlier for other periplasmic proteins, is also observed in RBP, albeit to a lesser extent. These results provide important insights into the mechanical stability and unfolding processes of large two-domain proteins and highlight the contrasting features upon ligand binding. Protein structural topology diagrams are used to explain the differences in the mechanical unfolding behavior of RBP with other periplasmic binding proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenome 3aligands 3aphysical chemistry 3aprokaryotic cells 3aribose 3aspectroscopy 3atopology1 aNarayan, Satya1 aAinavarapu, Sri Rama Koti0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Oct. 02, v. 118, no. 39 p.11449-11454dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp507463q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01690naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245011200162300001400274520062200288592002800910653003300938653001400971653002100985653001801006653001701024700001401041700001401055700001401069700001901083700001601102773014801118856007701266852000901343655001201352IND60522383820221121233959.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052238382DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2011-01072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Changyun10aFabrication and Characterization of LuminescentMultilayer Films Based on Polyoxometalates and Fuchsin Basic  ap. 43-48.  aA luminescent multilayer film has been fabricated from the polyoxometalate anion α- [PMo₁₂O₄₀]³⁻ (α-PMo₁₂) and the cation Fuchsin Basic (FB) through an electrostatic layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly method and characterized by UV/Vis spectra, atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectra.

However, the presence of repetitive sequences and structural variants can lead to false positives in the identification of polymorphic alleles. Here, we describe an analysis strategy that minimizes false positives in allelic detection and present analyses of recently published resequencing data from Arabidopsis meiotic products and individual humans. Our analysis enables the accurate detection of sequencing errors, small insertions and deletions (indels), and structural variants, including large reciprocal indels and copy number variants, from comparisons between the resequenced and reference genomes. We offer an alternative interpretation of the sequencing data of meiotic products, including the number and type of recombination events, to illustrate the potential for mistakes in single-nucleotide polymorphism calling. Using these examples, we propose that the detection of DNA polymorphisms using resequencing data needs to account for nonallelic homologous sequences.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA 3aalleles 3achromosome mapping 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3ameiosis 3arepetitive sequences 3asequence homology 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0astructural variation 0agenotyping 0ainsertions–deletions 0ahigh-throughput sequencing1 aChen, Yamao1 aCopenhaver, Gregory P.1 aMa, Hong0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 July 8, v. 111, no. 27 p.10007-10012dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13218971113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001900176245014500195300001500340500001500355520129900370592002801669650002201697650003101719650001901750650001701769650001001786650001601796650001701812650002101829650001601850650001301866650002001879650003101899650002401930650000901954650001501963650002601978650001702004650001802021650002802039650001702067653001702084700002402101700001802125700001802143700002302161773015202184856007002336856010602406990002302512852000902535655001202544IND60608601120221123044251.0190510e20171108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060860112DNAL7 a10.3791/563892doi7 aPMC57553442pmcid7 a291557662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Pardo, Alba10aAssessment of blood-brain barrier permeability by intravenous infusion of fitc-labeled albumin in a mouse model of neurodegenerative disease  ap. e56389.  a2019-12-06  aDisruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity is a common feature for different neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Although the interplay between perturbed BBB homeostasis and the pathogenesis of brain disorders needs further investigation, the development and validation of a reliable procedure to accurately detect BBB alterations may be crucial and represent a useful tool for potentially predicting disease progression and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Here, we present an easy and efficient procedure for evaluating BBB leakage in a neurodegenerative condition like that occurring in a preclinical mouse model of Huntington disease, in which defects in the permeability of BBB are clearly detectable precociously in the disease. Specifically, the high molecular weight fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled (FITC)-albumin, which is able to cross the BBB only when the latter is impaired, is acutely infused into a mouse jugular vein and its distribution in the vascular or parenchymal districts is then determined by fluorescence microscopy. Accumulation of green fluorescent-albumin in the brain parenchyma functions as an index of aberrant BBB permeability and, when quantitated by using Image J processing software, is reported as Green Fluorescence Intensity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3adisease course 3afluorescence 3abrain 3ahomeostasis 3apathogenesis 3amolecular weight 3afluorescein 3aalbumins 3aisothiocyanates 3aparenchyma (animal tissue) 3ablood-brain barrier 3amice 3aprediction 3aintravenous injection 3ajugular vein 3aanimal models 3afluorescence microscopy 3apermeability 0atherapeutics1 aCastaldo, Salvatore1 aCapocci, Luca1 aAmico, Enrico1 aVittorio, Maglione0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Nov. 08, , no. 129 p.e56389-e56389dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/563893Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/56389/assessment-blood-brain-barrier-permeability-intravenous-infusion-fitc  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245010900210300001400319520152200333592002801855650002501883650002301908650002401931650001901955650000901974650001701983650001002000650002202010650002102032650002402053650001902077650001702096650001902113650001102132650001802143650001002161650001502171650004102186650001702227650003302244650001302277650000902290650001802299650001402317650001202331650002502343650001502368650001302383650002302396650001902419653002402438653001902462653001502481653002902496653001202525700002202537700002502559700002502584773010702609856008602716852000902802655001202811IND60634368420221118235923.0190328e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063436842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashem, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2593-338712aA multiple volatile oil blend prolongs the shelf life of peach fruit and suppresses postharvest spoilage  ap. 48-58.  aProlongation of the shelf life of delicate fruit such as peaches without the application of fungicides is a great challenge facing the horticulture sector. This study aimed to apply Thieves oil blend (six oils in one mixture) to protect peach fruit from spoilage during long-term cold storage. Alternaria alternata, Fusarium oxysporum, Geotrichum candidum and Monilinia laxa were isolated from naturally infected peach fruit showing symptoms of postharvest rot, and their pathogenicity was confirmed on the same fruit. Pathogens were identified by sequencing of their internal transcribed spacer (ITS). The results showed that Thieves oil blend at a concentration of 2.0 mL L−1 completely suppressed fungal growth in vitro. This concentration reduced the disease incidence to 12.0% and the disease severity index to 1.2 after 7 d at 27 °C in vivo. The oil blend prolonged the shelf life of peach fruit up to 30 d under cold storage conditions (4 °C). Electron microscopy confirmed the fungitoxicity of Thieves oil blend, which resulted in complete death of the fungal mycelia. Gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) analysis of the oil blend showed the presence of 25 effective constituents that work synergistically to suppress the disease and its causal pathogens. The study recommends the application of Thieves oil blend for the first time as a safe multiple preparation to protect peaches and other fruit during transportation and cold storage to reduce losses during the marketing process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria alternata 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aGeotrichum candidum 3aMonilinia laxa 3acold 3acold storage 3adeath 3adisease incidence 3adisease severity 3aelectron microscopy 3aessential oils 3afood storage 3afood transport 3afruits 3afungal growth 3afungi 3afungicides 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahorticulture 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amycelium 3aoils 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apeaches 3apostharvest diseases 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 3astorage conditions 3atransportation 0aVolatile oils blend 0aMode of action 0aShelf life 0aScan electron microscopy 0aGC–MS1 aAlamri, Saad A.M.1 aAlqahtani, Maha S.A.1 aAlshehri, Saeed R.Z.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 June 01, v. 251 p.48-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01787naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001200143245013900155300001400294520073200308592002801040653002701068653002801095653003201123653001301155653002301168700001801191700001301209700001701222773014801239856007701387852000901464655001201473IND60522383920221121233954.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052238392DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2011-01082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Kai12aA Three-dimensional Ferric Molybdenum(V) Phosphate Network with Tunnels: Synthesis, Structure, Magnetic and Electrochemical Properties  ap. 49-54.  aA reduced ferric molybdophosphate, (H₂en)₃(Hen)[Feᴵᴵᴵ₃ Moⱽ₁₂O₂₄(OH)₈(HPO₄)₄(PO₄)₄] ·3H₂O (1) has been hydrothermally synthesized and characterized.

At close to room temperature, the nanoconjugate crystallizes as a mesolamellar soft solid with an expanded interlayer spacing of ca. 12 nm and interchain correlation lengths consistent with alkyl tail–tail and PEO–PEO ordering. The soft solid displays a birefringent spherulitic texture and melts at 40 °C to produce a solvent-free liquid protein without loss of enzyme secondary structure. The nanoconjugate melt exhibits a birefringent dendritic texture below the conformation transition temperature (Tc) of glucose oxidase (58 °C) and retains interchain PEO–PEO ordering. Our results indicate that the shape anisotropy of the protein–polymer surfactant globular building block plays a key role in directing mesolamellar formation in the solvent-free solid and suggests that the microstructure observed in the solvent-free liquid protein below Tc is associated with restrictions in the intramolecular motions of the protein core of the nanoconjugate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3amelting 3amicrostructure 3asurfactants 3atexture1 aZhang, Yixiong1 aThomas, Michael R.1 aBrogan, Alex P.

Its remarkably fast expansion across this continent is leading to a growing concern on the extent of negative impacts to the native fauna. To evaluate the interactions of exotic bees with local wild bees, we set up trap nests for above-ground nesting bees on a semi-urban area of north-western Italy. We aimed to investigate the interaction in artificial traps between the exotic and native wild bees and to assess offspring traits accounting for exotic bee fitness: progeny sex ratio and incidence of natural enemies. We found that the tunnels occupied by exotic bees were already cohabited by O. cornuta, and thus the cells of later nesting alien bees may block the native bee emergence for the next year. The progeny sex ratio of M. sculpturalis was strongly unbalanced toward males, indicating a temporary adverse population trend in the local invaded area. In addition, we documented the presence of three native natural enemies affecting the brood of the exotic bee. Our results bring out new insights on how the M. sculpturalis indirectly competes with native species and on its performance in new locations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMegachile sculpturalis 3abees 3afauna 3aindigenous species 3aprogeny 3asex ratio 3aItaly1 aCarisio, Luca 1 aManino, Aulo 1 aBiella, Paolo 1 aPorporato, Marco 0 tInsects.g2021 June 11, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120605453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03770naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245010000155300001600255500002000271520239900291592002802690650001602718650001002734650001502744650001302759650002002772650002202792650002202814650001302836650001302849650001802862650001702880650001102897650002002908650001402928650002002942650001402962650002302976650001902999650001003018651003203028651001803060700002203078773009603100852000903196856007103205655001203276IND4371187820221120231845.0170626e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437118782DNAL7 a10.1890/02-05482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarshall, Matt,10aTerritory size of a migratory songbird in response to caterpillar density and foliage structure  ap. 432-445.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe food value theory of territoriality predicts an inverse relationship between territory size and food density. However, several non‐mutually exclusive hypotheses can explain this relationship. We studied the relationship between foliage density, food density, competitor density, and territory size of the Red‐eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), a canopy‐dwelling, insectivorous songbird, in the Monongahela National Forest, West Virginia, USA, 1995–1998. First, we established the relationship between territory size and the canopy‐tree foliage density. We then utilized the relationship between foliage density and foliage arthropod density (in particular, Lepidoptera larvae) to evaluate whether an inverse correlation between food density and territory size existed and to examine the proximate cues that Red‐eyed Vireos used to adjust territory size. Foliage density in a habitat patch was used by Red‐eyed Vireos as a proximate cue to set the size of a three‐dimensional territory volume that ultimately corresponded to the “average” caterpillar density on those trees during the nestling stage. Territory volumes were smaller where foliage density was greater. Two measures of competitor density were not inversely correlated with territory size. These results support the structural‐cues hypothesis for a species that forages in the structurally complex foliage of deciduous forests, and they are consistent with the food‐value theory of territoriality. Caterpillar density varied widely over the course of the breeding season, among locations and among tree species, reaching a low during the nestling stage of the breeding cycle. Yet, the total territory volume utilized by Red‐eyed Vireos was inversely related to the density of caterpillars during this stage (i.e., when they would be needed as a food source to provision young), consistent with the food‐value theory. Food availability at the time of territory selection was not a reliable cue for future food resources because of spatial and temporal variability in caterpillar density. Instead, a stable structural cue, foliage density, was highly predictive of caterpillar density during the nestling stage of an average, or typical, year. This study suggests that Red‐eyed Vireos can reliably secure food resources for nestlings at the time of territory establishment, using foliage density as a cue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepidoptera 3aVireo 3aarthropods 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3adeciduous forests 3afood availability 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3ainsect larvae 3ainsectivores 3aleaves 3amigratory birds 3anestlings 3anutritive value 3asongbirds 3atemporal variation 3aterritoriality 3atrees 3aMonongahela National Forest 3aWest Virginia1 aCooper, Robert J.0 tEcology.g2004 Feb., v. 85, no. 2 p.432-445dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-05483Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01700naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245006200161300001400223520076100237592002800998653005501026653007801081653002101159700002001180773014801200856007701348852000901425655001201434IND60522384120221121234015.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052238412DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2011-01102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnizek, Jörg10aUnusual Formation of Two New Titanium(IV) Tetraphenolates  ap. 58-64.  aWhen the product of the reaction of 2,6-di-tert.-butylphenol with TiCl₄ in a 3:1 ratio is treated with Na[HBEt₃], the isolated product is not (2,6-tert.-Bu2C6H3O)3Ti(HBEt3) but the isomerized ester (2,4-tert.-Bu₂C₆H₃O)₄Ti with molecular S₄ symmetry.

This test was compared with a tissue culture cytotoxicity assay, which is considered to be the reference standard for the detection of C. difficile toxins. Twenty-seven samples of colonic contents and 23 fecal samples were collected from freshly euthanized neonatal swine with a history of scours. Of the 50 specimens tested, 20 were positive by the EIA test and tissue culture and 24 were negative by both tests, for an overall correlation of 88%. The sensitivity and specificity of the EIA were 91% and 86%, respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values were 84% and 86%, respectively. The EIA test is considered suitable as an aid for the diagnosis of C. difficile enteritis because of the high correlation between EIA results and those of the tissue culture cytotoxicity assay.  aPublisher supplied data 3apiglets 3aenteritis 3aClostridium difficile 3abacterial toxins 3adiagnostic techniques 3aaccuracy 3arapid methods 3adisease diagnosis 3aenzyme immunoassays 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aBacterial Proteins 2aBacterial Toxinsxanalysisximmunology. 2aCHO Cells 2aCell Death 2aClostridioides difficilexpathogenicity. 2aCricetinae 2aCulture Techniques 2aEnterocolitis, Pseudomembranousxdiagnosisximmunologyxveterinary. 2aEnterotoxinsxanalysisximmunology. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethodsxveterinary. 2aReference Values 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxdiagnosisximmunologyxmicrobiology.1 aJost, B.

Not surprisingly, mutations in anchoring proteins have profound effects on membrane excitability. Ca ²⁺-activated K ⁺ channels (K Cₐ2 or SK) have been shown to play critical roles in shaping the cardiac atrial action potential profile. Here, we demonstrate that filamin A, a cytoskeletal protein, augments the trafficking of SK2 channels in cardiac myocytes. The trafficking of SK2 channel is Ca ²⁺-dependent. Further, the Ca ²⁺ dependence relies on another channel-interacting protein, α-actinin2, revealing a tight, yet intriguing, assembly of cytoskeletal proteins that orchestrate membrane expression of SK2 channels in cardiac myocytes. We assert that changes in SK channel trafficking would significantly alter atrial action potential and consequently atrial excitability. Identification of therapeutic targets to manipulate the subcellular localization of SK channels is likely to be clinically efficacious. The findings here may transcend the area of SK2 channel studies and may have implications not only in cardiac myocytes but in other types of excitable cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaction potentials 3acalcium 3acalcium channels 3acardiomyocytes 3acytoskeleton 3afilamin 3amutation 3apotassium channels 0aion channel trafficking 0aatrial myocytes 0aatrial fibrillation1 aZhang, Zheng1 aWoltz, Ryan L.1 aKim, Hyo Jeong1 aMyers, Richard E.1 aLü, Ling,1 aTuteja, Dipika1 aSingapuri, Anil1 aBigdeli, Amir Ali Ziaei1 aHarchache, Sana Ben1 aKnowlton, A.

Here, we investigate how feeding on different plant species affects the survival of the rice armyworm Mythimna separata (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and its successful parasitism by the larval endoparasitoid Cotesia kariyai (Watanabe) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). Survival rate and pupal weight of unparasitised M . separata fed with daikon Raphanus sativus L. var. longipinnatus was lower than with maize Zea mays L. In addition, caterpillars fed with daikon were less susceptible to parasitism by C . kariyai than those fed with maize, and parasitised M . separata larvae fed with daikon had higher survival rates than those fed with maize. These results indicate that while daikon is not an optimal food for unparasitised caterpillars, it may protect the larvae from death by C . kariyai parasitism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApanteles kariyai 3aDiptera 3aMythimna separata 3aRaphanus sativus 3aZea mays 3acorn 3adeath 3aendoparasitoids 3afood plants 3ahost plants 3ainsect larvae 3aparasitic wasps 3aparasitism 3aphytophagous insects 3apupae 3asurvival rate 0aBraconidae 0aCotesia kariyai 0aparasitoid 0aplants–insects interactions 0atritrophic interaction1 aIchiki, Ryoko T.1 aNakamura, Satoshi1 aKainoh, Yooichi0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2016 July 2, v. 26, no. 7 p.1009-1019dTaylor & Francisx1360-04787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2016.11797173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03735naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012600166300001800292500001500310520208600325592002802411650001702439650001702456650001602473650002502489650002502514650002102539650001202560650001502572650001702587650001302604650001602617650001602633650002502649650001802674651002102692653002402713653001502737653001302752653002202765653001302787653001202800653001502812700001802827700002102845700001802866700002102884700001802905700002202923700002002945773010102965856008203066852000903148655001203157IND60112706020221122152639.0190415e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011270602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2013.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Nam Seon10aRed tides in Shiwha Bay, western Korea: A huge dike and tidal power plant established in a semi-enclosed embayment system  ap. S114-S130.  a2019-12-04  aTo investigate red tides in Shiwha Bay, Korea, where a 12.7-km dike with two outlets (at the water gate and tidal power plant) was constructed, we measured physical, chemical, and biological properties at 3 fixed stations inside the dike on a monthly basis from May 2008 to July 2012. During the study period, red tides were present in Shiwha Bay during 33 of 46 (i.e., 72%) sampling events. Clearly, red tides are common in the bay. Red tides occurred 33, 12, and 10 times at Stations 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Restriction of water circulation at Station 1 (in the innermost part of the bay) may cause more frequent red tides due to phototrophic dinoflagellates than at Station 3, where water exchange between the inside and outside of the dike occurs through a water gate. After the world's largest tidal power plant was established in 2011, red-tide causative species switched from phototrophic dinoflagellates such as Gymnodinium aureolum, Heterocapsa rotundata, Heterocapsa triquetra, Karlodinium veneficum, Paragymnodinium shiwhaense, and Prorocentrum minimum to diatoms such as Chaetoceros spp., Skeletonema costatum, and Thalassiosira spp. Exchange of seawater between the inside and outside of the dike through the tidal power plant may have resulted in this change in the causative species. Inorganic nitrogen concentrations for the growth of phototrophic dinoflagellates and small flagellates during red tides were likely unlimited, but inorganic phosphorus concentrations may be limited. Thus, some phototrophic dinoflagellates and flagellates may acquire phosphorus from prey. The maximum grazing coefficients of the heterotrophic dinoflagellates Pfiesteria piscicida, Gyrodiniellum shiwhaense, Gyrodinium dominans/Gyrodinium moestrupii, and Protoperidinium bipes feeding on red-tide causative taxa including cryptophytes, Eutreptiella gymnastica, P. minimum, and S. costatum, were found to be 0.14–0.77h−1. Therefore, heterotrophic protistan grazers in Shiwha Bay may, at times, have considerable grazing impact on populations of co-occurring red-tide organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3aProrocentrum 3aGymnodinium 3aSkeletonema costatum 3ainorganic phosphorus 3anitrogen content 3agrazing 3awater flow 3aEutreptiella 3aseawater 3aChaetoceros 3awater power 3aPfiesteria piscicida 3aThalassiosira 3aKorean Peninsula 0aHarmful algal bloom 0aphosphorus 0aRed tide 0aTidal power plant 0aFood web 0aProtist 0aMixotrophy1 aLee, Kyung Ha1 aChŏng, Hye-jin,1 aYoo, Yeong Du1 aSeong, Kyeong Ah1 aPotvin, Éric1 aHwang, Young Jong1 aYoon, Eun Young0 tHarmful algae.g2013 Dec., v. 30 p.S114-S130dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2013.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02192naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002200165245018600187300001600373520051300389592002800902650001100930650001000941650001100951650001000962650003700972650001201009650001401021650002601035650001201061650002101073650001101094650006101105650003401166650002101200650003101221650003501252650003201287650001001319700002201329700002101351700001901372700001901391700001701410700002301427773013201450852000901582856008301591655001201674IND2328014220221121002416.0181016e200205  cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232801422DNAL7 a120336852pmid7 a10.1177/1040638702014003132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKimura, Kumiko M.10aIn Situ Detection of Cellular and Abnormal Isoforms of Prion Protein in Brains of Cattle with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy and Sheep with Scrapie by Use of a Histoblot Technique  ap. 255-257.  aTo detect prion protein, brains from 5 cattle naturally affected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and 3 sheep naturally affected with scrapie were examined and compared with brains of normal cattle and sheep using a histoblot technique.

From SEM observation, after 10 cycles of treatment, most of the chitosan had been reduced to homogeneous nanofibers measuring tens of nanometers. On the other hand, further mechanical treatment did not show a significant change. Relative crystallinity of chitosan nanofibers gradually decreased as the number of passes increased since high-pressure waterjet treatment damaged the crystalline region of chitosan nanofibers. The transmittance of the chitosan nanofiber slurry increased steeply, as the number of passes increased, indicating that the chitosan fibers were disintegrated effectively. Viscosity of chitosan nanofiber slurry also showed that the chitosan disintegrated well into nanofibers up to 10 passes. Above 10 passes, disintegration efficiency was saturated. The molecular weights of the nanofibers steeply decreased due to the depolymerization of chitosan by mechanical disintegration. The Young's modulus and tensile strength of chitosan nanofiber sheets were improved as the number of treatments increased, but further treatments deteriorated the tensile strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3acrystal structure 3adepolymerization 3amodulus of elasticity 3amolecular weight 3ananofibers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aslurries 3atensile strength 3atransmittance 3aviscosity 0aChitosan 0aNanofiber 0aHigh-Pressure Waterjet System1 aDutta, Ajoy Kumar1 aIzawa, Hironori1 aMorimoto, Minoru1 aSaimoto, Hiroyuki1 aIfuku, Shinsuke0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 Jan., v. 72 p.1191-1195dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.10.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03783naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010100173300001400274520182600288592002802114650002102142650004402163650002202207650001202229650001602241650001302257650002102270650002202291650001702313650001602330650003702346650001102383650002002394650001702414650001802431650001802449650003102467650001902498650002002517650003402537650001102571650001702582650002302599650003002622650001702652650003802669650001902707653003102726653003302757653001302790653001902803653002802822700001402850700002302864700001602887700005902903773008102962856008103043852000903124655001203133IND60570544120221117022539.0170708e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057054412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2017.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Fattah, Wafa I.10aSynthesis of biogenic Ag@Pd Core-shell nanoparticles having anti-cancer/anti-microbial functions  ap. 28-36.  aBiogenic Ag@Pd core-shell nanoparticles were greenly synthesized within two plant extracts aiming at enhanced anticancer/bactericidal functions. These functions were verified for the two Pd@Ag biogenic core-shell nanoparticles (BCSnp) with constant Pd to several Ag contents. BCSnp were synthesized within two extracts of Almond nuts and Black Berry fruits, four samples each, through simple, low cost and echo friendly microwave route. The BCSnp Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) was detected via UV/visible spectrophotometer. Their morphology was assessed using High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope supplemented with EDAX. Particle size/zeta potential of the achieved nanoparticles was measured. The active reducing groups were depicted by FTIR while XRD assessed nanoparticles crystallinity. The enhanced particle size distribution as proved by UV and band gap energies, imparted better functionality by the Almond extract compared to the berry one due to its protein content. Cytotoxicity against human breast cancer (MCF7) and liver cancer (HEPG2) cell lines were followed and compared to the normal Wish cells. The antimicrobial impact against gram-negative (G−veo) E. coli, gram-positive (G+ve) S. aureus bacteria and mycotic strain C. albicans species were verified and compared to antibiotics. A significant inhibition of cancer cell growth of MCF 7 and HEPG2 compared to Wish normal cells and doxorubicin is assessed. A discriminative effect was recorded for G−ve compared to G+ve, along with Mycotic strain C. albicans is achieved. The obtained BCSnp are proposed for cancer therapy and bactericidal applications with improved efficiency applying the nanomedicine approach. Tailorable properties can be obtained by tuning the individual structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalmonds 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abreast neoplasms 3acrystal structure 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahumans 3aliver neoplasms 3ananomedicine 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3aplant extracts 3aprotein content 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asilver 3asmall fruits 3aspectrophotometers 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atherapeutics 3atransmission electron microscopes 3azeta potential 0aBiogenic Ag/Pd core-shells 0aAlmond versus berry extracts 0aBand gap 0aZeta-potential 0aAnticancer/bactericidal1 aEid, M.M.1 aAbd El-Moez, Sh.I.1 aMohamed, E.1 aAli, Ghareib W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4263-068X0 tLife sciences.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 183 p.28-36dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2017.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245005100167506011700218506007600335520147300411592002801884506003701912650002301949650002301972650003401995650002302029650001702052650001002069650001002079650002002089650002202109650000902131650001302140651001002153653001302163653001502176653002002191653002102211653002002232653003502252700001802287773013902305856008302444852000902527655001202536IND60701932220221207110148.0220421e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070193222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaim.2020.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirija, P.L.T.10aAyurvedic treatment of COVID-19: A case report  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis is the first known case of a Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) positive patient treated entirely with Ayurveda. So far in Modern Western Medicine (MWM), no cure has been found which is specific to COVID-19. The only literature relevant to the treatment of Coronavirus disease has surfaced from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM which was extensively used to control the epidemic in China, also consists of herbal medicines similar to Ayurveda. In this case, the patient, who was familiar with the use of Ayurvedic medicines, fully aware that no proven cure exists in MWM, decided to entirely rely on the limited Ayurvedic medicines that he had in his possession at the time of falling ill. Despite the patient presenting with symptoms, namely high fever, severe body pain and severe cough, along with many of the other associated symptoms of COVID-19, the progress of the disease could be arrested within a short period by being exclusively on Ayurvedic medicines. This illustrates that there is a wide scope to explore the variety of pertinent medicines present in Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia which can be used more rationally to suit every stage of the disease. Being the first-of-its-kind it is a valuable contribution to scientific literature from the world of Ayurveda. This should encourage the healthcare policy makers to quickly use Ayurveda to bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control in India, as they seemed to have demonstrated it in China with TCM.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aOrthocoronavirinae 3acase studies 3acough 3afever 3ahealth services 3aissues and policy 3apain 3apatients 3aIndia 0aCOVID-19 0aSARS-Cov-2 0aJanapadodhwamsa 0aSudarsana churna 0aTalisadi churna 0aVata-kaphaja-sannipataja jwara1 aSivan, Nithya0 tJournal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine.g2022 Jan.,  Mar., v. 13, no. 1 p.100329-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27111x0975-94767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2020.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245012600203300002000329520114800349592002801497650001301525650001101538650001601549650001301565650001901578650001101597650002201608650001501630650001001645650001801655650001101673650001501684650001101699653001701710653001101727653003401738653001901772700002401791700002101815700002301836700002601859773015101885856008102036852000902117655001202126IND60752692620221119104344.0211006e20210922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075269262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c038892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrank, Damian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3449-699410aIn-Mouth Volatile Production from Brassica Vegetables (Cauliflower) and Associations with Liking in an Adult/Child Cohort  ap. 11646-11655.  aInteractions between Brassica vegetables and human saliva can affect in-mouth odor development, which in turn may be linked to individual perception and liking. S-Methyl-l-cysteine sulfoxide is a unique substrate present in Brassicas that produces odor-active sulfur volatiles due to the activity of enzymes present in plant tissue and due to bacteria, which may be present to varying extents in an individual’s oral microbiome. Proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry was applied to measure individual differences in sulfur volatile production in real time when fresh human saliva was incubated ex vivo with raw cauliflower for a cohort of child–adult pairs. Large differences in the rate of sulfur volatile production were measured between individuals, but not between age groups. Significant positive relationships were found for volatile production between the adult–child pairs, suggesting a degree of commonality in saliva composition and oral microbiome activity. Furthermore, significant negative relationships were measured between the amount of in-mouth sulfur volatile production and liking for raw cauliflower in children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica 3aadults 3acauliflower 3achildren 3afood chemistry 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3amicrobiome 3aodors 3aplant tissues 3asaliva 3asulfoxides 3asulfur 0aolfactometry 0aPTR-MS 0aS-methyl-l-cysteine sulfoxide 0acysteine lyase1 aPiyasiri, Udayasika1 aArcher, Nicholas1 aHeffernan, Jessica1 aPoelman, Astrid A.

These features are proposed to limit the access of therapies to neoplastic cells and blunt treatment efficacy. Indeed, several agents that target the PDA tumor microenvironment promote concomitant chemotherapy delivery and increased antineoplastic response in murine models of PDA. Prior studies could not determine whether chemotherapy delivery or microenvironment modulation per se were the dominant features in treatment response, and such information could guide the optimal translation of these preclinical findings to patients. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used a chemical inhibitor of cytidine deaminase to stabilize and thereby artificially elevate gemcitabine levels in murine PDA tumors without disrupting the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, we used the FG-3019 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is directed against the pleiotropic matricellular signaling protein connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2). Inhibition of cytidine deaminase raised the levels of activated gemcitabine within PDA tumors without stimulating neoplastic cell killing or decreasing the growth of tumors, whereas FG-3019 increased PDA cell killing and led to a dramatic tumor response without altering gemcitabine delivery. The response to FG-3019 correlated with the decreased expression of a previously described promoter of PDA chemotherapy resistance, the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein. Therefore, alterations in survival cues following targeting of tumor microenvironmental factors may play an important role in treatment responses in animal models, and by extension in PDA patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenocarcinoma 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3acytidine deaminase 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3amice 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneoplasm cells 3apancreatic neoplasms 3apatients 0achemoresistance 0apancreatic tumor stroma 0agenetically engineered mouse models1 aFrese, Kristopher K.1 aBapiro, Tashinga E.1 aNakagawa, Tomoaki1 aSternlicht, Mark D.1 aSeeley, Todd W.1 aPilarsky, Christian1 aJodrell, Duncan I.1 aSpong, Suzanne M.1 aTuveson, David A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 July 23, v. 110, no. 30 p.12325-12330dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13004151103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03348naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245018000164300001600344520176900360592002802129650001502157650001302172650001302185650002002198650001702218650002902235650001502264650002202279650001702301650001102318650001502329650003002344650000902374650002002383650001202403650001402415650002002429651001002449653000902459653003602468653002702504700001702531700002002548700001602568700002002584773013102604856008602735852000902821655001202830IND60791777420221123022017.0220831e20220914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079177742DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2022.21051952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJian, Yu10aEndocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in source water, finished water, and tap water from drinking water treatment plants and its human risk assessment in Chengdu Plain, China  ap. 862-877.  aA study to monitor endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) [including pesticides, phthalate acid esters (PAEs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)] in drinking water treatment plants from water source to consumers tap in Chengdu Plain was undertaken. A total of 37 source water, 37 finished water, and 37 tap water samples were collected during the period from July to August in 2021. Based on the survey results, a human health noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risk assessment was conducted for adults and children. The results showed that the pesticides: atrazine, acetochlor, alachlor, heptachlor, and chlorpyrifos were detected in source, finished, and tap water, the detection rate of heptachlor was the highest in source (29.73%), finished (21.62%), and tap water (29.73%). Hexachlorobenzene and chlorothalonium were not detected in source, finished, and tap water. The concentrations of total PAEs ranged from not detected (nd)—1788.79 ng/L (median = 470.23 ng/L), nd to 3755.13 ng/L (median = 423 ng/L), and nd to 4095.89 ng/L (median = 585.12 ng/L) for source, finished, and tap water, respectively. The ΣPCBs were from nd to 239.65 ng/L (median = 91.03 ng/L), nd to 50.4 ng/L (median = 18.04 ng/L), and nd to 157.96 ng/L (median = 58.13 ng/L) for source, finished, and tap water, respectively. The hazard quotient (HQ) of EDCs in tap water of Chengdu Plain was lower than 1 and the highest value was 1.60E-02, which suggests that EDCs are considered unlikely to pose noncarcinogenic effects to individuals. Carcinogenic risk caused by EDCs for adults (both in median and highest concentration) was much lower than the 1.0E-04 cancer risk level, while the highest risk caused by EDCs for children through tap water was 9.48E-05.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetochlor 3aalachlor 3aatrazine 3acarcinogenicity 3achlorpyrifos 3aenvironmental assessment 3aheptachlor 3ahexachlorobenzene 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aphthalates 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asurveys 3atap water 3awater treatment 3aChina 0aEDCs 0adrinking water treatment plants 0ahealth risk assessment1 aYunting, Xia1 aXianghong, Tian1 aRong, Zhang1 aZhanqiang, Bian0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2022 Sept. 14, v. 28, no. 8 p.862-877dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12198x1549-78607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2022.21051953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009300164300002000257500001100277520138200288592002801670596009901698650001801797650001101815650001401826650001301840650001701853650001501870651001001885700001701895700001801912700001401930700001401944700001501958700001801973773015501991856008302146852000902229655001202238IND60782897120221116160531.0220714e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078289712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-20876-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiuhong10aFrom “blood transfusion” to “hematopoiesis”: watershed eco-compensation in China  ap. 49583-49597.  aReview  aAt present, the number of watershed eco-compensations in China is increasing. And the area covered by a single project is also increasing. Under the current model, governments are the primary source of funding. It is difficult to meet the growing funding gap of subsidies. Researches on watershed eco-compensation need to reform and explore a new model for it, expand the fund source of watershed eco-compensation expense, and establish a sustainable “hematopoietic” model. This paper clarifies the concept of watershed eco-compensation and then compares the design principles of eco-compensation projects, definitions of stakeholders, analysis, and summary of watershed eco-compensation models in different regions. It can be found that the model in which the government dominates is still the mainstream. However, the considerable cost of this model will be a heavy burden for governments. Therefore, it becomes an important option to involve more stakeholders in these projects, and governments should transfer part of the lead to dilute costs. How to reduce the expenditures of governments in watershed eco-compensation projects under the premise of maintaining normal operation of the projects has become an important exploration direction concerning watershed eco-compensation in China, which requires transforming from “blood transfusion” to “hematopoiesis.”  aPublisher supplied data  a2018ZX07111002cMajor Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment 3ahematopoiesis 3amodels 3apollution 3aresearch 3astakeholders 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aWang, Yizhuo1 aYang, Rongjin1 aZhang, Le1 aZhang, Yi1 aLiu, Qiang1 aSong, Zhenwei0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 July, v. 29, no. 33 p.49583-49597dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20876-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245013500159300001800294520156100312592002801873650001501901650001001916650001701926650001201943650001801955650002201973650001401995650001702009650001102026700001602037700001702053700001702070700001602087700001902103700001602122700005602138700005602194773014702250856007702397852000902474655001202483IND60771093020221119160031.0220323e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077109302DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c002162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Huilei10aDesign and Ribosomal Incorporation of Noncanonical Disulfide-Directing Motifs for the Development of Multicyclic Peptide Libraries  ap. 5116-5125.  aThe engineering of naturally occurring disulfide-rich peptides (DRPs) has been significantly hampered by the difficulty of manipulating disulfide pairing. New DRPs that take advantage of fold-directing motifs and noncanonical thiol-bearing amino acids are easy-to-fold with expected disulfide connectivities, representing a new class of scaffolds for the development of peptide ligands and therapeutics. However, the limited diversity of the scaffolds and particularly the use of noncanonical amino acids [e.g., penicillamine (Pen)] that are difficult to be translated by ribosomes greatly hamper the further development and application of these DRPs. Here, we designed and synthesized noncanonical bisthiol motifs bearing sterically obstructed thiol groups analogous to the Pen thiol to direct the folding of peptides into specific bicyclic and tricyclic structures. These bisthiol motifs can be ribosomally incorporated into peptides through a commercially available PURE system integrated with genetic code reprograming, which enables, for the first time, the in vitro expression of bicyclic peptides with two noncanonical and orthogonal disulfide bonds. We further constructed a bicyclic peptide library encoded by mRNA, with which new bicyclic peptide ligands with nanomolar affinity to proteins were successfully selected. Therefore, this study provides a new, general, and robust method for discovering de novo DRPs with new structures and functions not derived from natural peptides, which would greatly benefit the field of peptide drug discovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisulfides 3adrugs 3agenetic code 3aligands 3apenicillamine 3apeptide libraries 3aribosomes 3atherapeutics 3athiols1 aLi, Jinjing1 aLiu, Hongtan1 aLu, Shuaimin1 aWu, JunJie,1 aZhang, Youming1 aYin, Yizhen1 aZhao, Yibing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9349-12131 aWu, Chuanliu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2946-72990 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 144, no. 11 p.5116-5125dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c002163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245010800204300002000312500001900332520155300351592002801904650003001932650001901962650001201981650001401993700001902007700002102026773013802047856008002185852000902265655001202274IND60720233620221122220617.0201210e20201124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072023362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c084482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrena, Barbara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0503-469110aChemical Switching of the Magnetic Coupling in a MnPc Dimer by Means of Chemisorption and Axial Ligands  ap. 27185-27193.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe present an ab initio density functional theory study of the magnetic properties of manganese phthalocyanine dimers, where we focus on the magnetic coupling between the Mn centers and on how it is affected by external factors like chemisorption or atomic axial ligands. We have studied several different configurations for the gas phase dimers, which resulted in ferromagnetic couplings of different magnitudes. For the bare dimer we find a significant ferromagnetic coupling between the Mn centers, which decreases by about 20% when a H atom is adsorbed on one of the Mn atoms and is reduced to about 7% when a Cl atom is adsorbed. The magnetic coupling is almost fully quenched when the dimer, bare or with the H ligand, is deposited on the ferromagnetic substrate Co(001). Our calculations indicate that the coupling between the two Mn atoms principally occurs via a superexchange interaction along two possible paths within a Mn–N–Mn–N four-atom loop. When these electrons get involved in chemical bonding outside the dimer itself, an appreciable alteration of the overlap between Mn and N molecular orbitals along the loop occurs, and consequently, the magnetic interaction between the Mn centers varies. We show that this is reflected by the electronic structure of the dimer in various configurations and is also visible in the structure of the atomic loop. The chemical tuning of the magnetic coupling is highly relevant for the design of nanodevices like molecular spin valves, where the molecules need to be anchored to a support.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3aferromagnetism 3aligands 3amanganese1 aSanyal, Biplab1 aHerper, Heike C.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Nov. 24, v. 124, no. 49 p.27185-27193dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c084483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01789naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013400159300002000293520066000313592002800973650001901001650001701020650002201037650001201059650001801071650001701089650002501106700001501131700001601146700002001162700002001182700001801202773012401220856007401344852000901418655001201427IND60640562120221120163622.0190504e20160407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064056212DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra05238j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuang, Tairong10aEnhanced strength and foamability of high-density polyethylene prepared by pressure-induced flow and low-temperature crosslinking  ap. 34422-34427.  aWe report a high-performance high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with significantly enhanced mechanical strength by means of pressure-induced flow (PIF) and low-temperature crosslinking treatment.

Furthermore, high strength foams of this material could also be produced under supercritical CO₂ batch foaming in solid-state.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acrosslinking 3acrystal structure 3afoaming 3amelting point 3apolyethylene 3astrength (mechanics)1 aChen, Feng1 aFu, Dajiong1 aChang, Lingqian1 aPeng, Xiangfang1 aLee, Ly James0 tRSC advances.g2016 Apr. 07, v. 6, no. 41 p.34422-34427dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra05238j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007200170300001400242520114200256592002801398650002301426650001801449650001801467650002001485650001601505650001601521650001601537650000901553650001501562650002001577650001301597650001901610650002001629650001501649650001501664650001701679700002001696700001701716700002101733700002701754700002001781773010801801856008601909852000901995655001202004IND60558622520221121042523.0190409e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055862252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDyer, Jolon M.10aPhoto-oxidation of whey proteins: Molecular markers of modification  ap. 56-60.  aOxidative damage significantly affects the food industry, with progressive modification of protein foods and ingredients altering structure, shelf-life, digestibility, nutritional value and function. A redox proteomic damage scoring system was applied to profile and track protein primary level photo-oxidative modification in UVB-irradiated bovine milk whey proteins, lactoferrin and β-lactoglobulin. Lactoferrin oxidation increased significantly after ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure, with the redox score increasing from 0.38 in the control to 1.00 in the irradiated sample. β-lactoglobulin oxidation also increased significantly, from a relatively high baseline redox score of 1.07 in the control to 1.67 in the irradiated sample. A potential marker peptides set for tracking photo-oxidation in milk whey proteins was characterised, with six lactoferrin and four β-lactoglobulin peptides identified. This is anticipated to be of significant utility in monitoring and tracking relative levels of modification, and therefore exposure to oxidative insult, in dairy products through processing, storage, and retail and consumer handling.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3adigestibility 3afood industry 3agenetic markers 3aingredients 3airradiation 3alactoferrin 3amilk 3amonitoring 3anutritive value 3apeptides 3aphotooxidation 3aprotein sources 3aproteomics 3ashelf life 3awhey protein1 aClerens, Stefan1 aThomas, Ancy1 aCallaghan, Chris1 aDeb-Choudhury, Santanu1 aHaines, Stephen0 tInternational dairy journal.g2017 Mar., v. 66 p.56-60dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011600168300001600284520122800300536029101528592002801819650005001847650001801897650001601915650002501931650001401956650002601970650002901996650001502025650003102040650001702071650001102088650002402099650000902123650001302132650001902145651001702164653001402181653003302195653001002228700002102238700001702259700002002276700002102296773013102317856008602448852000902534655001202543IND60791777720221122233533.0220831e20220914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079177772DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2022.21104492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlfeus, Anna10aInhalation health risk assessment of ambient PM₂.₅ and associated trace elements in Cape Town, South Africa  ap. 917-929.  aFew human health risk assessment studies of air pollution exist in Africa. This study used the US EPA health risk framework to investigate the human health risks due to inhalation exposure to ambient PM₂.₅ and some of its trace element composition (Cl, Si, and Ti) in Cape Town, South Africa, for 12 months (April 2017 to April 2018). The safe average daily dose was determined using the yearly WHO guideline and South African ambient air quality standard for PM₂.₅ and the US EPA regional screening levels for trace elements. The average yearly PM₂.₅ concentration (13 µg/m³) was above the yearly WHO guideline (5 µg/m³), but below the yearly South African standard (20 µg/m³). The average yearly PM₂.₅ concentration posed a low risk to adults (Hazard Quotient = 0.66) compared to infants (HQ = 2.13) and children (HQ =1.96). Cl posed health risks to all age groups (HQ > 1). The study concludes that PM₂.₅ and its trace element components pose adverse health effects to all population age groups. The toxicity of PM₂.₅ depends on its composition; hence this study recommends a source apportionment study to quantify the source contributions and inform the right abatement strategies.  aThe authors acknowledge the University of Pretoria doctoral bursary, University of Namibia Staff Development office and the AGNES grant office for funding this study.

Access to targeted delivery of nucleic acids is expected to expand the field of nanomedicine beyond most expectations. Both viral and synthetic vectors have advantages and disadvantages. The major advantage of the synthetic vectors is their unlimited synthetic capability. The four-component lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading nonviral vector for mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna in Covid-19 vaccines. Their synthetic capacity inspired us to develop a one-component multifunctional sequence-defined ionizable amphiphilic Janus dendrimer (IAJD) delivery system for mRNA. The first experiments on IAJDs provided, through a rational-library design combined with orthogonal-modular accelerated synthesis and sequence control in their hydrophilic part, some of the most active synthetic vectors for the delivery of mRNA to lung. The second experiments employed a similar strategy, generating, by a less complex hydrophilic structure, a library of IAJDs targeting spleen, liver, and lung. Here, we report preliminary studies designing the hydrophobic region of IAJDs by using dissimilar alkyl lengths and demonstrate the unexpectedly important role of the primary structure of the hydrophobic part of IAJDs by increasing up to 90.2-fold the activity of targeted delivery of mRNA to spleen, lymph nodes, liver, and lung. The principles of the design strategy reported here and in previous publications indicate that IAJDs could have a profound impact on the future of genetic nanomedicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3adendrimers 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alipids 3aliver 3alungs 3alymph 3ananomedicine 3aspleen1 aAtochina-Vasserman, Elena N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7950-70041 aLu, Juncheng1 aMaurya, Devendra S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4488-99271 aXiao, Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6470-04071 aLiu, Matthew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5004-91821 aAdamson, Jasper1 aOna, Nathan1 aReagan, Erin K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3162-46361 aNi, Houping1 aWeissman, Drew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1501-65101 aPercec, Virgil1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5926-04890 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Mar. 09, v. 144, no. 11 p.4746-4753dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c002733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245009900170300001600269520131100285592002801596650001801624650001401642650003101656650001001687650001001697650001201707650000901719650001201728650001501740650002001755650001801775650001601793650002601809650002901835653002001864653001701884653002001901653002201921653002101943653001001964700002201974700001801996700001902014700002002033773011302053856008402166852000902250655001202259IND60622576120221117235629.0190129e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062257612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorohoshi, Akane14aThe ubiquitin ligase subunit β-TrCP in Sertoli cells is essential for spermatogenesis in mice  ap. 178-188.  aβ-TrCP is the substrate recognition subunit of an SCF-type ubiquitin ligase. We recently showed that deletion of the genes for both β-TrCP1 and β-TrCP2 paralogs in germ cells of male mice resulted in accumulation of the transcription factor DMRT1 and spermatogenic failure, whereas systemic β-TrCP1 knockout combined with β-TrCP2 knockdown had previously been shown to lead to disruption of testicular organization and accumulation of the transcription factor SNAIL. Here we investigated β-TrCP function in Sertoli cells by generating mice with targeted deletion of the β-TrCP2 gene in Sertoli cells on a background of whole-body β-TrCP1 knockout. Loss of β-TrCP in Sertoli cells caused infertility due to a reduction in the number of mature sperm. Whereas spermatogonia were not affected, male germ cells entered meiosis prematurely and the number of round spermatids was reduced in the mutant mice. Extracts of Sertoli cells and of the testis from the mutant mice manifested accumulation of SNAIL, and expression of the SNAIL target gene for E-cadherin was down-regulated in Sertoli cells from these animals. Our results indicate that β-TrCP in Sertoli cells regulates Sertoli cell–germ cell interaction through degradation of SNAIL, with such regulation being critical for sperm development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSertoli cells 3acadherins 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amales 3ameiosis 3amice 3amutants 3aspermatids 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatogonia 3aspermatozoa 3atranscription factors 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 0aSpermatogenesis 0aSertoli cell 0aβ-TrCP1 (BTRC) 0aβ-TrCP2 (FBXW11) 0aUbiquitin ligase 0aSNAIL1 aNakagawa, Tadashi1 aNakano, Seiji1 aNagasawa, Yuko1 aNakayama, Keiko0 tDevelopmental biology.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 445, no. 2 p.178-188dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245011000203300002000313500001900333520133200352592002801684650002101712650000901733650002901742650001301771650002301784650002301807773013801830856008001968852000902048655001202057IND60720233820221122220459.0201210e20201111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072023382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c084602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFabris, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7089-517510aGold Nanostars in Biology and Medicine: Understanding Physicochemical Properties to Broaden Applicability  ap. 26540-26553.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOver the past few years, gold nanostars have gained significant relevance in biology and medicine, in particular, in imaging and photothermal therapy, also owing to their biocompatibility. Furthermore, they have improved the sensitivity of diagnostic assays and have been integrated in lab-on-chip platforms for low-cost, field-deployable devices. However, despite their widespread use, they have not found applicability beyond the research laboratories. One of the main reasons for this limitation has been the almost exclusive focus, until recently, on applications alone and not on the understanding of the fundamental properties of these particles, which has hampered reproducibility, stability, and overall reliability. Recently, however, a resurgence in the fundamental research of gold nanostars has dramatically improved our understanding of their synthesis, functionalization, properties, and thus their applicability. In this Perspective, the literature exploring and improving our knowledge of the physicochemical properties of gold nanostars is critically presented and framed within the specific context of biological and clinical applications. Furthermore, on the basis of the most recently reported results, a path forward is proposed, aimed at enabling an effective integration of these particles in the clinic.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3agold 3alab-on-a-chip technology 3amedicine 3aphotothermotherapy 3aphysical chemistry0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Nov. 11, v. 124, no. 49 p.26540-26553dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c084603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014900170520167900319592002801998650001202026650002302038650002302061650001402084650001102098650001502109650002602124650001602150650001502166651001202181653002102193653003202214653002702246700002002273700002102293700001902314700001902333700002502352773010502377856008602482852000902568655001202577IND60746516720221120144640.0211029e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074651672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1267682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhadka, Ambika10aStormflow against streamflow – Can LID-provided storage capacity ensure performance efficiency and maintenance of pre-development flow regime?  aThe goal of Low Impact Development (LID) is to restore and maintain the pre-development flow regime. The static storage capacity, which is often used as a parameter in LID designs, provides the maximum capacity of an LID type and is easily quantifiable already at the design phase. However, the static storage approach does not consider the inter-event recovery of storage capacity by infiltration and evapotranspiration. This study investigated dynamic storage capacities of three stormwater management designs with increasing proportions of LID units on a 1.2 ha urban residential block in Southern Finland, to compare their cost-efficiency, as well as their potential in restoring the pre-development flow regime. The cost-efficiency of LID designs was assessed based on their ability to contribute to water losses, and on the additional construction costs required when comparing them to conventional solutions (e.g. asphalt replaced with permeable pavement). The design with a small storage capacity and a large capture ratio, i.e., the ratio of contributing area to LID area, was the least efficient albeit its small construction cost. The design with an appropriate balance between the capture ratio and the LID provided storage capacity was the most efficient option. In assessing the potential of stormwater designs in restoring the pre-development flow regime, the sum of infiltration and flow in storm sewer networks was more representative of the catchment total runoff than flow alone. Finally, an extensive simulation of a large set of differently placed LID units proved useful in a priori identification of the most influential units in the treatment train.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3acost effectiveness 3aevapotranspiration 3apavements 3astorms 3astormwater 3astormwater management 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3aFinland 0aStorage capacity 0aPre-development flow regime 0aPerformance efficiency1 aKokkonen, Teemu1 aKoivusalo, Harri1 aNiemi, Tero J.1 aLeskinen, Piia1 aKörber, Jan-Hendrik0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Nov., v. 602 p.126768-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1267683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007900169300001600248520123000264536006701494592002801561650002301589650002801612650002201640650001601662650001401678650001301692650001301705653000801718653002701726653001701753700003101770700002001801700002501821700002001846700002001866700003701886700001801923700002101941773011901962856008602081852000902167655001202176IND60774641720221123031028.0220421e20220504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077464172DNAL7 a10.1080/09291016.2020.18715462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalek, Ayyoub10aChanges in brain MRI under different lunar cycles: a cross-sectional study  ap. 823-829.  aPhysiologic changes in mammals, including humans, are known to vary as a function of different lunar cycle phases. Importantly, the structure of the central nervous system (CNS) affects its functional status. A total of 15 healthy volunteers underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in each of the lunar cycles, with each subject undergoing a total of four imaging sessions. Size and volume of structures such as the hippocampus, subarachnoid space, lentiform nucleus, thalamus, and trigon, were measured by expert radiologists. Inter-phase differences in size and volume were determined. There was a significant difference between ventricular volume, whole-brain volume, hippocampal volume, lentiform nuclei volume, and thalamus diameter between the four lunar phases. The new moon had the lowest values than any other lunar phase in any reported structures. Importantly, the difference between the new moon and the third quarter lunar phase was always significant. There was no significant difference in subarachnoid space volume and trigone diameter of the ventricles in different lunar phases. The trigone was the smallest in the third quarter lunar phase. Our results suggest that lunar phases affect brain structures.  aThis work was funded by Tabriz University of Medical Sciences.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological rhythms 3across-sectional studies 3afunctional status 3ahippocampus 3amagnetism 3aresearch 3athalamus 0aMRI 0acentral nervous system 0alunar phases1 aDaghighi, Mohammad Hossein1 aPourisa, Masoud1 aPourmohammadi, Tohid1 aDastgiri, Saeed1 aNezami, Nariman1 aMirza-Aghazadeh-Attari, Mohammad1 aArasteh, Amin1 aZarrintan, Armin0 tBiological rhythm research.g2022 May 04, v. 53, no. 5 p.823-829dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12260x1744-41797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2020.18715463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245012400159300002000283520101200303592002801315650002201343650001701365650001201382650001901394650001001413650001601423650002101439650001501460650000701475650001601482653001201498653002101510653001901531653001501550653002001565700001701585700001301602700001701615700001601632700001901648700001501667700001501682700001501697700001801712700001901730700005501749773015101804856008101955852000902036655001202045IND60752693120221119104449.0211006e20210923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075269312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c043782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Si10aNew Insights into Stress-Induced β-Ocimene Biosynthesis in Tea (Camellia sinensis) Leaves during Oolong Tea Processing  ap. 11656-11664.  aAs the major contributors to the floral odors of tea products, terpenoid volatiles play critical roles in the defense response of plants to multiple stresses. Until now, only a few TPS genes in tea plants (Camellia sinensis) have been functionally validated. In this study, by comparative studies conducted at gene, protein, and metabolite levels during oolong tea processing, we isolated an ocimene synthase gene, CsOCS, which displays a low similarity to previously characterized tea ocimene synthases. Further prokaryotic expression and subcellular localization analysis showed that it is plastid-located and could produce (E)-β-ocimene and (Z)-β-ocimene using GPP as the substrate. The optimum temperature and pH of the enzyme were 30 °C and 7.5, respectively. Treatment with exogenous methyl jasmonate elevated the transcript level of CsOCS and enhanced the emission of ocimene from tea leaves. Collectively, CsOCS is implicated as a key enzyme for β-ocimene synthesis during oolong tea processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3abiosynthesis 3aenzymes 3afood chemistry 3agenes 3ametabolites 3amethyl jasmonate 3aoolong tea 3apH 3atemperature 0aocimene 0aterpene synthase 0atea processing 0ajasmonates 0astress response1 aXie, Peifeng1 aLi, Yeye1 aWang, Xiaxia1 aLiu, Huihui1 aWang, Shanshan1 aHan, Wenbo1 aWu, Ruimei1 aLi, Xinlei1 aGuan, Yuefeng1 aYang, Zhenbiao1 aYu, Xiaomin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8650-67950 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Sept. 23, v. 69, no. 39 p.11656-11664dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c043783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245006900210300001200279500001900291520138700310592002801697650001201725650001701737650001401754650001901768650001101787650001801798650001001816651001101826773013401837856008301971852000902054655001202063IND60695906520221123025347.0200526e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069590652DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-020-08982-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroughton, Paul L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8285-055610aMorphogenesis and microstructure of concrete-derived calthemites  ap. 245.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDistributions of calcareous calthemite deposits have been widely documented, but depositional processes and the architecture of their internal fabrics are not well understood. These concrete degradation products from a case study area in western Canada have external morphologies comparable to calcite speleothems formed in natural limestone caves, but the internal microstructural architecture and mineralogy are markedly different. The mineralogy consists of mostly calcite with secondary halite and minor percentages of trona and portlandite. A novel morphogenetic model explains depositional processes resulting in calcareous crusts that follow fractures of an overlying concrete surface, and how sufficient structural integrity provided by the internal architecture supports attachment areas of tubular soda straws. Interiors of these multi-cm crusts consist of curvilinear calcite laminae arrayed as sub-parallel walls, compartmentalizing water–gas interfaces along variously interconnected conduits and basin-form chambers. Overall porosities of 40–60% or more are prevalent, in contrast to < 1% associated with externally similar drapery-form crusts deposited within natural limestone caves. Several calcite fabrics new to calthemite deposits are described, including dendritic shrubs that coalesce into concentric growth rings along central canals of soda straws.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcite 3acase studies 3alimestone 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3amorphogenesis 3atrona 3aCanada0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2020 May, v. 79, no. 10 p.245-245dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-020-08982-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245006700157300001800224520115000242592002801392650001401420650001301434650001601447650001301463650002001476650002001496650002601516700001401542700002101556700005801577700005601635773014701691856007701838852000901915655001201924IND60771093520221119155742.0220323e20220310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077109352DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c004322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Ning10aReconfiguring Self-Assembly of Photoresponsive Hybrid Colloids  ap. 4754-4758.  aThe reconfigurable self-assembly of colloidal particles allows the bottom-up creation of adaptive materials, yet significant challenges remain. Here, we demonstrate a synthesis of photoresponsive Fe₂O₃/polysiloxane hybrid colloids that perform a dynamically reconfigurable self-assembly. Such self-assembly is due to chemical gradients originating from the decomposition of H₂O₂ by the Fe₂O₃ component under UV irradiation. The morphology of the self-assembly includes chains and flower-structures, where the chains can be transformed in situ into flower-like structures with decreasing UV intensity. The flower-structures can be further switched by applying an external magnetic field, leading to orientationally ordered clusters. This, interestingly, leads to an asymmetrical chemical gradient surrounding the assemblies, and transforms the cluster into a micromotor exhibiting a self-propulsion steerable by the magnetic field. Our findings demonstrate a new possibility to control and reconfigure the self-assembly of colloids, which offers an important pathway for fabrications of adaptive and smart materials at the microscale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmericans 3acolloids 3aexhibitions 3ajournals 3amagnetic fields 3asmart materials 3aultraviolet radiation1 aZhu, Jiao1 aZhang, Xiaoliang1 aWang, Huaguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6553-43351 aZhang, Zexin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4963-50020 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Mar. 10, v. 144, no. 11 p.4754-4758dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c004323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006500146245013000211300002000341500001900361520150000380592002801880650001501908650001201923650001301935650001001948650003001958650001801988650001402006650001302020650001102033650001802044650001202062650001602074650001302090650002502103700002202128700006002150773013802210856008002348852000902428655001202437IND60720234120221122220535.0201210e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072023412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c085452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumawat, Rameshwar L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2210-342810aIndividual Identification of Amino Acids on an Atomically Thin Hydrogen Boride System Using Electronic Transport Calculations  ap. 27194-27202.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecently synthesized two-dimensional hydrogen boride (HB) with a hexagonal boron network offers excellent opportunities for nanoscale electronic device applications. Herein, we have proposed a type of field-effect transistor (FET) nanodevice based on a two-dimensional HB sheet for individual identification of amino acids. Using first-principles consistent-exchange van der Waals density-functional (vdW-DF-cx) calculations, we have studied the effects produced by the adsorption of each amino acid on the electronic properties of the HB-based nanodevice for its detection. The adsorption energies, adsorption heights, and the charge transfer of each amino acid can be deliberated as demonstrative of all 10 amino acids: alanine (Ala), arginine (Arg), aspartic (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), glycine (Gly), histidine (His), lysine (Lys), phenylalanine (Phe), proline (Pro), and tyrosine (Tyr). Furthermore, the electronic transport properties of the HB nanodevice and HB + amino acid setup are studied by the nonequilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) formalism combined with the density functional theory (DFT) approach. Our results show that the adsorption of each amino acid on the HB nanodevice gives Fano resonance in the electronic transmission function. The sensitivity analysis and current–voltage (I–V) characteristic results indicate that selective detection of amino acids is possible. Thus, we believe that the HB-based device may be promising for the prospect of protein sequencing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalanine 3aarginine 3aboron 3adensity functional theory 3aglutamic acid 3ahistidine 3ahydrogen 3alysine 3aphenylalanine 3aproline 3atransistors 3atyrosine 3avan der Waals forces1 aJena, Milan Kumar1 aPathak, Biswarup1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9972-99470 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 124, no. 49 p.27194-27202dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c085453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245016800167300001800335520120400353592002801557650002801585650001201613650002001625650001601645650001101661650003201672650000901704650001501713650001201728650005501740650001701795653001701812653002401829653004301853653002101896653001501917700001301932700001401945700002001959700006001979773014802039856008002187852000902267655001202276IND60604905120221117084243.0180718e20180622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060490512DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b011382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shizhong,10aParapyruvate, an Impurity in Pyruvate Supplements, Induces Senescence in Human Fibroblastic Hs68 Cells via Inhibition of the α-Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase Complex  ap. 7504-7513.  aCommercial dietary supplements of calcium pyruvate claim to be beneficial for losing weight, increasing muscle endurance, and regulating metabolism. Most industrial preparations have some impurities, including parapyruvate. Parapyruvate is an inhibitor of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC). However, the effect and mechanism of parapyruvate on cell senescence and the content of parapyruvate in the dietary supplements of calcium pyruvate are unknown. In this study, we prepared pure parapyruvate with a purity of 99.8 ± 0.1% and investigated its ability to inhibit KGDHC activity and affect fibroblast senescence. Parapyruvate dose-dependently decreased KGDHC activity, with an IC₅₀ of 4.13 mM and induced Hs68 cell senescence. Calcium ions, a KGDHC activator, antagonized the senescent effects of parapyruvate. The parapyruvate content was 1.4 ± 0.1% to 10.6 ± 0.2% in five brands of calcium pyruvate supplements. In this study, we showed that parapyruvate strongly induces Hs68 cell senescence by inhibiting KGDHC activity. Because of its KGDHC inhibition activity, the parapyruvate content should be an important issue for the food safety of calcium pyruvate supplements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-ketoglutaric acid 3acalcium 3acell senescence 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aions 3ametabolism 3amuscles 3aoxoglutarate dehydrogenase (succinyl-transferring) 3apyruvic acid 0aparapyruvate 0acellular senescence 0aα-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex 0acalcium pyruvate 0aHs68 cells1 aLee, Inn1 aTing, Hua1 aChang, Yuan-Jhe1 aYang, Nae-Cherng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5496-53480 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 June 22, v. 66, no. 28 p.7504-7513dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b011383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245011300174300001800287520110200305592002801407650002801435650001301463650001501476650002101491650001801512650001801530650001901548650001601567650000701583650001501590650001801605650001601623650001401639653002301653653002701676653001301703653001601716653001301732700002001745700002201765700002401787773011801811856008601929852000902015655001202024IND60551872920221121060654.0170124e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055187292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.10.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFareez, Ismail M.10aChitosan coated alginate–xanthan gum bead enhanced pH and thermotolerance of Lactobacillus plantarum LAB12  ap. 1419-1428.  aThe vulnerability of probiotics at low pH and high temperature has limited their optimal use as nutraceuticals. This study addressed these issues by adopting a physicochemical driven approach of incorporating Lactobacillus plantarum LAB12 into chitosan (Ch) coated alginate–xanthan gum (Alg–XG) beads. Characterisation of Alg–XG–Ch, which elicited little effect on bead size and polydispersity, demonstrated good miscibility with improved bead surface smoothness and L. plantarum LAB12 entrapment when compared to Alg, Alg–Ch and Alg–XG. Sequential incubation of Alg–XG–Ch in simulated gastric juice and intestinal fluid yielded high survival rate of L. plantarum LAB12 (95%) at pH 1.8 which in turn facilitated sufficient release of probiotics (>7log CFU/g) at pH 6.8 in both time- and pH-dependent manner. Whilst minimising viability loss at 75 and 90°C, Alg–XG–Ch improved storage durability of L. plantarum LAB12 at 4°C. The present results implied the possible use of L. plantarum LAB12 incorporated in Alg–XG–Ch as new functional food ingredient with health claims.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3achitosan 3adurability 3afunctional foods 3agastric juice 3ahealth claims 3aheat tolerance 3aingredients 3apH 3aprobiotics 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 3aviability 0aMicroencapsulation 0aProbiotic lactobacilli 0aAlginate 0aXanthan gum 0aChitosan1 aLim, Siong Meng1 aMishra, Rakesh K.1 aRamasamy, Kalavathy0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 Jan., v. 72 p.1419-1428dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.10.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011800174520159900292592002801891650001101919650002001930650001501950650001601965650001701981650001501998651001302013653001802026653001402044653002502058653001502083653001102098700006002109700001902169700002402188773010502212856008602317852000902403655001202412IND60746517220221120182304.0211029e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074651722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1267732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatgé, Frédéric10aAre gridded precipitation datasets a good option for streamflow simulation across the Juruá river basin, Amazon?  aOver the past few decades, many gridded P-datasets with nearly global coverage have become available. These P-datasets offer an unprecedented opportunity to constrain hydrological modeling in remote region where the gauge network is sparse. However, few studies report on P-datasets reliability for discharge simulations limiting the use of these datasets. This study investigates the reliability of available gridded P-datasets for streamflow simulations for 10 basins of the Juruá watershed, located in the Amazon region. A total of 19 P-datasets including both satellite-based and reanalysis-based precipitation estimates, are considered to provide a comprehensive overview of currently available options. Used as forcing data in two lumped hydrological models (GR4j and HyMOD), some P-datasets led to a more realistic simulation of daily and monthly streamflow than the simulation based on precipitation estimates derived from the gauges network. P-dataset ranking depends on the considered basin and time step (i.e. daily, monthly), suggesting variability in spatial reliability for all considered P-datasets. In addition, the P-dataset reliability increases with the surface area of the considered basins. This can be partially explained by the aggregation of precipitation on larger spatial scales counterbalancing potential spatial inconsistencies at more local scales in the P-dataset, and by the better modeling of smoother hydrographs at the outlets of larger basins. Overall, IMERG-F v.6 and CMORPH-BLD appear to be the most efficient P-datasets for the region under consideration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adata collection 3ahydrograph 3astream flow 3asurface area 3awatersheds 3aAmazonia 0aPrecipitation 0aHydrology 0aStreamflow modelling 0aEvaluation 0aAmazon1 aPillot, Benjamin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3797-13561 aRoig, Henrique1 aBonnet, Marie-Paule0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Nov., v. 602 p.126773-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1267733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245008700215300001400302520096500316592002801281650001301309650001101322650001201333650001101345700002901356700001801385700006101403700001901464700005901483773010801542856008601650852000901736655001201745IND60558623120221121062319.0190409e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055862312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgrawal, Shailesh G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4955-685710aSecondary nucleation studies on alpha lactose monohydrate under stirred conditions  ap. 61-67.  aSecondary nucleation is the dominant source of nuclei at the industrial scale. Traditionally, secondary nucleation has been expressed empirically as a function of stirrer speed and magma density with little or no understanding about the role of individual mechanisms (attrition and contact). This study considers the various mechanisms of secondary nucleation of alpha-lactose monohydrate crystals and link them to either crystal–crystal or crystal-impeller collisions. An agitated system was used to conduct trials at various levels of stirring speed (400 and 550 rpm), seed size (150, 250, 357 and 502 μm) and seed loading (2%, 5% and 10%, v/v) at a constant supersaturation. Crystal-impeller contacts are proposed to be the major source of secondary nucleation. It was found that the kinetic energy and not the collision frequency govern the rate of secondary nucleation with a threshold kinetic energy value below which no secondary nucleation occurs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystals 3aenergy 3alactose 3amixing1 aPaterson, Anthony (Tony)1 aJones, Jim R.1 aMcleod, Jeremy S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0434-95201 aBronlund, John1 aBajpai, Harshit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6811-93610 tInternational dairy journal.g2017 Mar., v. 66 p.61-67dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245009200205300001800297506007600315520123000391592002801621506003701649650002801686650001401714650001501728650001601743650002301759650001701782650001701799650001001816650001601826650003201842650001501874650001301889650001901902650002201921700001701943700002001960700001901980700001601999700001502015700001602030773012002046856008102166852000902247655001202256IND60550459820221207110354.0160911e20150918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055045982DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b017652doi7 aPMC46516272pmcid7 a263179902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZong, Guanghui10aTotal Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Ipomoeassin F and Its Unnatural 11R-Epimer  ap. 9279-9291.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIpomoeassin F, a macrolide glycoresin containing an embedded disaccharide, possesses potent in vitro antitumor activity with an unknown mechanism of function. It inhibits tumor cell growth with single-digit nanomolar IC₅₀ values, superior to many clinical chemotherapeutic drugs. To facilitate translation of its bioactivity into protein function for drug development, we report here a new synthesis for the gram-scale production of ipomoeassin F (3.8% over 17 linear steps) from commercially available starting materials. The conformation-controlled subtle reactivity differences of the hydroxyl groups in carbohydrates were utilized to quickly construct the disaccharide core, which, along with judicial selection of protecting groups, made the current synthesis very efficient. The same strategy was also applied to the smooth preparation of the 11R-epimer of ipomoeassin F for the first time. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated the crucial role of the natural 11S configuration. In addition, cell cycle analyses and apoptosis assays on ipomoeassin F and/or its epimer were conducted. This work has laid a solid foundation for understanding the medicinal potential of the ipomoeassin family of glycolipids in the future.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3acell growth 3achemical reactions 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aglycolipids 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amacrolides 3amoieties 3aneoplasm cells 3aorganic chemistry1 aBarber, Eric1 aAljewari, Hazim1 aZhou, Jianhong1 aHu, Zhijian1 aDu, Yuchun1 aShi, Wei Q.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2015 Sept. 18, v. 80, no. 18 p.9279-9291dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.5b017653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002100190245014900211300001600360506007600376520156300452592002802015506003702043650001602080650002002096650002702116650001202143650001202155650002202167650001702189650002502206650002002231650001802251650002202269650002302291650001102314650001702325650001502342650002002357650002702377653001002404653000802414653001902422653001402441653002202455700001902477700002002496700002202516773011302538856008402651852000902735655001202744IND60622576720221207103145.0190129e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062257672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.11.0052doi7 aPMC66756062pmcid7 a304471802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelu, Jeffrey J.10aCharacterization of ADP-ribosyl cyclase 1-like (ARC1-like) activity and NAADP signaling during slow muscle cell development in zebrafish embryos  ap. 211-225.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe recently demonstrated the requirement of two-pore channel type 2 (TPC2)-mediated Ca2+ release during slow muscle cell differentiation and motor circuit maturation in intact zebrafish embryos. However, the upstream trigger(s) of TPC2/Ca2+ signaling during these developmental processes remains unclear. Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a potent Ca2+ mobilizing messenger, which is suggested to target TPC2 in mediating the release of Ca2+ from acidic vesicles. Here, we report the molecular cloning of the zebrafish ADP ribosyl cyclase (ARC) homolog (i.e., ARC1-like), which is a putative enzyme for generating NAADP. We characterized the expression of the arc1-like transcript and the NAADP levels between ~ 16 h post-fertilization (hpf) and ~ 48 hpf in whole zebrafish embryos. We showed that if ARC1-like (when fused with either EGFP or tdTomato) was overexpressed it localized in the plasma membrane, and associated with intracellular organelles, such as the acidic vesicles, Golgi complex and sarcoplasmic reticulum, in primary muscle cell cultures. Morpholino (MO)-mediated knockdown of arc1-like or pharmacological inhibition of ARC1-like (via treatment with nicotinamide), led to an attenuation of Ca2+ signaling and disruption of slow muscle cell development. In addition, the injection of arc1-like mRNA into ARC1-like morphants partially rescued the Ca2+ signals and slow muscle cell development. Together, our data might suggest a link between ARC1-like, NAADP, TPC2 and Ca2+ signaling during zebrafish myogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aGolgi apparatus 3aN-glycoside hydrolases 3aadenine 3acalcium 3acalcium signaling 3acell culture 3acell differentiation 3aembryo (animal) 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular cloning 3amuscle development 3aniacin 3anicotinamide 3aphosphates 3aplasma membrane 3asarcoplasmic reticulum 0aNAADP 0aARC 0aCa2+ signaling 0aZebrafish 0aSlow muscle cells1 aWebb, Sarah E.1 aGalione, Antony1 aMiller, Andrew L.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 445, no. 2 p.211-225dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04131naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245018300165300001200348520237700360592002802737596007202765650001102837650002602848650002402874650002002898650001802918650001302936650002202949650002302971650002402994650002403018650002303042650002003065650001403085650001903099650002103118650001503139650001903154650003003173650001303203650001403216650002103230650000903251650001703260650002203277650001003299700001903309700001803328700002203346773010503368856008303473852000903556655001203565IND60695907320221123012332.0210921e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069590732DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-020-02399-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEndo, Tomoko10aFast-track breeding system to introduce CTV resistance of trifoliate orange into citrus germplasm, by integrating early flowering transgenic plants with marker-assisted selection  ap. 224.  aBACKGROUND: Global warming will expand the range of new and invasive pathogens in orchards, and subsequently increase the risk of disease epidemics and economic losses. The development of new resistant plant varieties can help to reduce the impact of pathogens, however, the breeding speed can be extremely slow, due to the growth rates of the plants, and the availability of resistance genes. Citrus trees are suffering immense damage from serious diseases such as citrus canker (XCC), huanglongbing (HLB), and citrus tristeza virus (CTV). A fast-track breeding system, that aimed at shortening the duration for disease resistance breeding by incorporating the resistance genes from related species to commercial varieties, has been developed using the integration of precocious transgenic trifoliate orange with the overexpression of CiFT and MAS. It was applied here to incorporate CTV resistance of trifoliate orange into citrus germplasm. RESULTS: One generation of backcrossed breeding, that would normally take at least 5 years, was achieved in a single year by fast-track breeding system. Linkage analysis using the corresponding DNA markers revealed that CTV resistance and T-DNA integrated regions were found in different linkage groups, and they were independently segregated in the BC progenies. The CTV resistant null segregants, in which the T-DNA integrated region was removed from their genome, were feasibly obtained by MAS in each generation of the BC progenies, and their CTV resistance was confirmed by immunological analysis. Several BC₃ null segregants, whose genetic backgrounds had been substituted into citrus germplasm, except for the haplotype block of CTV resistance, were successfully obtained. CGH and NGS analyses revealed that the T-DNA integrated region was safely segregated out in null segregants. CONCLUSION: Fast-track breeding systems are expected to shorten the required breeding time by more than one-fifth in comparison with conventional cross breeding techniques. Using this system, we obtained BC₃–8, whose genetic background was successfully substituted except for the CTV resistance locus, and could be a novel mandarin breeding material. The fast-track breeding system will be useful to introduce important traits from related species to citrus germplasm while also drastically reducing the time required for breeding.  aPublisher supplied data  aGMO-1003cMinistry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan 3aCitrus 3aCitrus tristeza virus 3aPoncirus trifoliata 3abreeding season 3acitrus canker 3acrossing 3adisease outbreaks 3adisease resistance 3afinancial economics 3agene overexpression 3agenetic background 3agenetic markers 3agermplasm 3aglobal warming 3agreening disease 3ahaplotypes 3alinkage groups 3amarker-assisted selection 3aorchards 3apathogens 3aresistance genes 3arisk 3atransfer DNA 3atransgenic plants 3atrees1 aFujii, Hiroshi1 aOmura, Mitsuo1 aShimada, Takehiko0 tBMC plant biology.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.224-224dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-020-02399-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245008800169300001400257520101800271592002801289650001501317650001501332650001301347650001401360650001201374650001001386650001501396650002201411650002301433650002201456650002001478650001801498653001401516653002201530653001001552653001101562653002401573700002301597700006001620700002101680700005901701700003501760700002901795700001901824700006201843700001901905700001901924773011101943856008402054852000902138655001202147IND60622576820221117235551.0181222e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062257682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKikuchi, Mariko10aNovel components of germline sex determination acting downstream of foxl3 in medaka  ap. 80-89.  aGermline sex determination is an essential process for the production of sexually dimorphic gametes. In medaka, Forkhead box L3 (foxl3) was previously identified as a germ cell-intrinsic regulator of sex determination that suppresses the initiation of spermatogenesis in female germ cells. To reveal the molecular mechanism of germline sex determination by foxl3, we conducted the following four analyses: Comparison of transcriptomes between wild-type and foxl3-mutant germ cells; epistatic analysis; identification of the FOXL3-binding motif; and ChIP-qPCR assay using a FOXL3-monoclonal antibody. We identified two candidate genes acting downstream of foxl3: Rec8a and fbxo47. It has been known that Rec8 regulates sister chromatid cohesion and Fbxo47 acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. These functions have not been, however, associated with sexual differentiation in germ cells. Our results uncover novel components acting downstream of foxl3, providing insights into the mechanism of germline sex determination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3achromatids 3acohesion 3aepistasis 3afemales 3agenes 3agerm cells 3asex determination 3asexual development 3asexual dimorphism 3aspermatogenesis 3atranscriptome 0aGerm cell 0aSex determination 0afoxl3 0aMedaka 0aFOXL3-binding motif1 aNishimura, Toshiya1 aSaitō, Daisuke,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3200-579X1 aShigenobu, Shuji1 aTakada, Ritsuko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1615-056X1 aGutierrez-Triana, José Arturo1 aCerdán, Juan Luis Mateo1 aTakada, Shinji1 aWittbrodt, Joachim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8550-73771 aSuyama, Mikita1 aTanaka, Minoru0 tDevelopmental biology.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 445, no. 1 p.80-89dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002400149245014400173300001600317520137000333592002801703650001301731650000901744650001101753650001901764650001501783650002301798700001801821700002001839773009901859856008501958852000902043655001202052IND4469650020221118080308.0141111e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446965002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2012.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrillo, Elizabeth10aEffects of food package information and sensory characteristics on the perception of healthiness and the acceptability of enriched biscuits  ap. 209-216.  aThe aim of the present work was to study the interaction between sensory and non-sensory characteristics that influence the overall acceptance and perceived healthiness of enriched biscuits and/or biscuits with reduced levels of high energy components. Three different scenarios (blind, informed and expected conditions) were analyzed. The participants mapped the samples in Napping® tests and rated the overall acceptance and perceived healthiness of ten biscuits. The results showed that overall acceptance was higher for almost all the biscuits in the blind test, whereas seeing only the package showed a trend towards higher perceived healthiness, suggesting that non-sensory factors could influence the first buy and sensory characteristics could determine loyalty and repeat consumption of certain enriched or reduced-calorie biscuits. It was observed that participants were not willing to compromise sensory characteristics for health even though they considered that some food components were beneficial for the diet. The study showed how sensory and non-sensory cues interact to build consumer perception and how, depending on the particular product, parameters like the brand, category, familiarity with the product, familiarity with the claim or sensory profile can influence product assessment (acceptance and healthiness perception) in different ways.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiscuits 3adiet 3aenergy 3afood packaging 3apurchasing 3asensory properties1 aVarela, Paula1 aFiszman, Susana0 tFood research international.g2012 Aug., v. 48, no. 1 p.209-216dElsevier Ltdx0963-99697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2012.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04738naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245016500162300002000327520152000347592002801867596010101895596009801996596009802094596009802192596009802290596009802388596009802486596009402584596010902678596011402787596011302901650001503014650001003029650001503039650002603054650002403080650001103104650001403115650002703129650001803156650001303174650001103187650002303198650001103221653002803232653002003260653002703280653002203307653000903329653002003338700001803358700001703376700001903393700001903412700002703431700003003458700001703488700001303505700001403518700001503532700005503547700001603602700005803618700001603676700005703692773014303749856007903892852000903971655001203980IND60752693720220921000000.0220921e20210921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075269372DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c064492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yunsheng12aA Co-Doped Fe₃O₄ Nanozyme Shows Enhanced Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species Scavenging Activity and Ameliorates the Deleterious Effects of Ischemic Stroke  ap. 46213-46224.  aAcute ischemic stroke has become the major cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Following ischemic stroke, the reperfusion injury is mainly mediated by the burst of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). Therefore, blocking the excessive production or removing RONS holds great promise as a potential therapeutic strategy. Herein, we developed a Co-doped Fe₃O₄ nanozyme that is capable of scavenging H₂O₂, O₂•–, •NO, and ONOO– in vitro and in vivo and provides neuroprotection against ischemic stroke. In vitro experiments showed that pre-incubation with the Co-Fe₃O₄ nanozyme could prevent neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation induced by H₂O₂ or lipopolysaccharide, respectively, in HT22 cells. After intravenous administration, the Co-Fe₃O₄ nanozyme showed no signs of toxicity in peripheral organs of C57BL/6J mice, even after prolonged delivery for 4 weeks. In permanent photothrombotic stroke model and transient middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model, the Co-Fe₃O₄ nanozyme specifically accumulated in the infarct rim at 72 h post-stroke and was endocytosed by neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells. Importantly, the Co-Fe₃O₄ nanozyme delivery reduced the infarct volume in both stroke models. The observation that the Co-Fe₃O₄ nanozyme was efficacious in two well-characterized ischemic stroke models provides strong evidence that it represents a powerful tool for targeting oxidative and nitrosative stress in the ischemic brain.  aPublisher supplied data  a31950410536cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a81760227cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a81772685cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a81873747cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a81902522cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a82003303cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a82071471cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2019M663104cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002858  a2019A1515010311cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003453  aGJHZ20190820115001765cBasic research projects of Shenzhen Science and Technology Programdhttps://doi.org/NA  aNAcGuangdong Innovation Platform of Translational Research for Cerebrovascular Diseasesdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aastrocytes 3abrain 3ainfarction 3aintravenous injection 3alipopolysaccharides 3amodels 3amortality 3aneuroprotective effect 3aneurotoxicity 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3areperfusion injury 3astroke 0aCo-doped Fe3O4 nanozyme 0aischemic stroke 0aphotothrombotic stroke 0atransparent brain 0aRONS 0aneuroprotection1 aWang, Xiaojun1 aLi, Xiangzhu1 aQiao, Shanshan1 aHuang, Guodong1 aHermann, Dirk Matthias1 aDoeppner, Thorsten Roland1 aZeng, Muling1 aLiu, Wei1 aXu, Gelin1 aRen, Lijie1 aZhang, Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8987-59861 aLiu, Wenlan1 aCasals, Eudald1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2900-72951 aLi, Weiping1 aWang, Ya-Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3709-53680 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Sept. 21, v. 13, no. 39 p.46213-46224dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c064493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245013100199300001600330500002000346520109900366592002801465596018701493650001601680650001601696650004101712650002201753650001901775650001901794650002401813650002101837650001301858650002301871650000901894650001301903650001601916650001601932650001501948700002401963700002501987700002202012700002302034700002102057773013402078856007302212852000902285655001202294IND60676419820221119222947.0191117e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067641982DNAL7 a10.1111/fme.123162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Keeffe, Joanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8552-748210aIndex‐based analysis of climate change impact on streamflow conditions important for Northern Pike, Chub and Atlantic salmon  ap. 474-485.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClimate change is expected to affect the flow regime, cause loss of habitat, change community composition and behavioural habits of fish. This study assessed the impact of climate change on ecologically relevant streamflow conditions for fish migration and spawning in the Vistula and the Odra river basins. Streamflow simulations obtained with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the historical period and two future horizons were driven by nine bias‐corrected EURO‐CORDEX Regional Climate Models under two greenhouse gas concentration trajectories. This study identified a subset of Indicators of Hydrological Alteration (IHA) that are relevant for pike, Esox lucius L., chub, Squalius cephalus (L.), and Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. IHA indicators were calculated and compared for different scenarios. An index‐based framework identified that all considered species will be impacted by climate change, with Atlantic salmon facing the largest impact. The model's uncertainty was addressed through an aggregation method that assessed inconsistencies in the model's response.  aPublisher supplied data  aPol Nor/200799/90/2014cPolish‐Norwegian Research Programme operated by the National Centre for Research and Development (NCBiR) under the Norwegian Financial Mechanism 2009‐2014 3aEsox lucius 3aSalmo salar 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aSqualius cephalus 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acommunity structure 3agreenhouse gases 3ahabitats 3amigratory behavior 3apike 3aspawning 3astream flow 3auncertainty 3awatersheds1 aPiniewski, Mikołaj1 aSzcześniak, Mateusz1 aOglęcki, Paweł,1 aParasiewicz, Piotr1 aOkruszko, Tomasz0 tFisheries management and ecology.g2019 Dec., v. 26, no. 6 p.474-485dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867078x0969-997X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.123163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03790naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100005700154245010900211500001900320520193100339592002802270650001402298650001902312650002602331650001702357650000902374650001802383650000902401650001902410650000902429650001402438650001702452650001302469650001702482650001902499650001902518650001902537650002502556650001302581650002302594650001502617650002502632650002402657650002002681650002102701653001902722653002802741653001702769653001802786653001102804700002002815700001802835700005802853700001202911700001902923773012402942856008903066852000903155655001203164IND60701933420221119123729.0200824e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070193342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.1119602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatai, Ishita1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1698-251510aNear-infrared stimulated hydrogel patch for photothermal therapeutics and thermoresponsive drug delivery  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNanotechnology driven cancer theranostics hold potential as promising future clinical modalities. Currently, there is a strong emphasis on the development of combinational modalities, especially for cancer treatment. In this study, we present a topical hydrogel patch for nanomaterial-assisted photothermal therapeutics as well as for on-demand drug delivery application. The patch was derived from interpenetrating networks (IPNs) of alginate (Alg) and polyacrylamide (PAAm) in weight ratio 8:1 by free radical polymerization. The patch interiors were composed of hybrid nanostructures derived from gold nanorods (AuNRs) anchored onto polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) functionalized graphene oxide (PVP-nGO) to form PVP-nGO@AuNRs hybrids. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images revealed the porous nature of the hybrid hydrogel patch with an average pore size of ~28.60 ± 3.10 μm. Besides, functional characteristics of the hybrid patch, such as mechanical strength, viscoelastic and swelling behavior, were investigated. Under near-infrared (NIR) radiation exposure, the hybrid patch exhibited photothermal properties such as surface temperature rise to 75.16 ± 0.32 °C, sufficient to ablate cancer cells thermally. Besides, the heat generated in the hybrid patch could be transmitted to an underlying hydrogel (mimicking skin tissue) when stacked together without much loss. Under cyclic photothermal heating, the patch could retain its photothermal stability for four cycles. Furthermore, the hybrid patch demonstrated NIR stimulated drug release, which was evaluated using methotrexate (MTX, water-insoluble anticancer drug) and rhodamine B (RhB, water-soluble dye). Taken together, this work provides a new dimension towards the development of externally placed hydrogel patches for thermal destruction of localized solid tumors and tunable delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs at the target site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3acancer therapy 3adrug delivery systems 3adrug therapy 3adyes 3afree radicals 3agold 3agraphene oxide 3aheat 3ahydrogels 3amethotrexate 3ananorods 3aphotobiology 3aphotochemistry 3apolyacrylamide 3apolymerization 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3aporosity 3aprecision medicine 3arhodamines 3astrength (mechanics) 3asurface temperature 3aviscoelasticity 3awater solubility 0aHydrogel patch 0aNear-infrared radiation 0aPhotothermal 0aDrug delivery 0aCancer1 aGurvinder Kaur,1 aSoni, Sanjeev1 aSachdev, Abhay1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2114-87121 aVikas, 1 aMishra, Sunita0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2020 Sept., v. 210 p.111960-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2020.1119603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245012100161300001500282520145600297592002801753650002701781650001201808650000801820650001901828650002001847650001501867650001101882650001401893650001301907650002101920650000901941700001401950700002201964773012701986856007702113852000902190655001202199IND60773682520221118000705.0220615e20220328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077368252DNAL7 a10.17221/42/2021-pps2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPánek, Matěj10aUse of metalaxyl against some soil plant pathogens of the class Peronosporomycetes – A review and two case studies  ap. 92-109.  aUpon its discovery and implementation in plant protection, metalaxyl became one of the most important fungicides against Phytophthora infestans, but its efficiency has also been proven against other soil pathogens of the class Peronosporomycetes. The most important genus – Phytophthora comprises more than 150 plant pathogens, which cause significant losses in crop production or damage to natural plant associations. Many species of related genera Pythium, Phytopythium and Globisporangium have a similar ability as the species of Phytophthora. Those pathogens are able to quickly spread in wet soils by actively movable zoospores or in the air by means of zoosporangia; they are able to persist in an environment for long periods once they are introduced into the locality, having durability from their resting structures (chlamydospores, hyphal swelling and oospores). Metalaxyl has proven to be very efficient against these pathogens. However, shortly after its release, the rapid development of resistance against this compound was recorded in many species of the class Peronosporomycetes. Such easily developed resistance is due to the monogenic nature of the resistance, which also determines any anti-resistant strategies. The solution of this issue rests in the cautious use of metalaxyl, with consideration given to these strategies, and should be based also on precise information about the environment and the present pathogenic agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aPythium 3aair 3achlamydospores 3acrop production 3adurability 3ahyphae 3ametalaxyl 3aoospores 3aplant protection 3asoil1 aAli, Asad1 aHelmer, Štěpán0 tPlant Protection Science.g, v. 58, no. 2 p.92-109dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21418x1212-25807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/42/2021-pps3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02067naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245006000160300001800220520086100238592002801099650001301127650001701140650002901157650001401186650001901200650001301219650001601232650002101248700001901269700002601288700002001314700006101334700006501395773014701460856007701607852000901684655001201693IND60771094120220323000000.0220323e20220309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077109412DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c008202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Yeting10aFluorescence Switching for Temperature Sensing in Water  ap. 4759-4763.  aA water-soluble thermochromic molecular switch with spectrally resolved fluorescence in its two interconvertible states can be assembled in three synthetic steps by integrating a fluorescent coumarin chromophore, a hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) chain, and a switchable oxazole heterocycle in the same covalent skeleton. Measurements of its two emissions in separate detection channels of a fluorescence microscope permit the noninvasive and ratiometric sensing of temperature at the micrometer level with millisecond response in aqueous solutions and within hydrogel matrices. The ratiometric optical output of this fluorescent molecular switch overcomes the limitations of single-wavelength fluorescent probes and enables noninvasive temperature mapping at length scales that are not accessible to conventional thermometers based on physical contact.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoumarin 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopes 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3aoxazoles 3atemperature 3awater solubility1 aMeana, Yasniel1 aMazza, Mercedes M.

This condition can lead to severe heart failure with ascites or/and fluid in the thoracic cavity or/and in the pericardial sac. We describe infective endocarditis and myocarditis in 3 dogs and 4 cats. In all animals, the initial diagnosis was performed on the basis of a focused cardiac ultrasound examination performed by a general practitioner after a training in this technique. The initial findings were confirmed by a board-certified specialist in veterinary cardiology. Post mortem positive microbiological results from valves were obtained in 4 of 7 patients. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was confirmed in 2 cases and Staphylococcus epidermidis was confirmed in 2 cases, one of which included Enterococcus sp. coinfection. Histopathological examination confirmed initial diagnosis in 5 of 7 animals. In the remaining 2 patients, the time elapsed from the onset of clinical symptoms to death was about 1 month and no active inflammation but massive fibrosis was found microscopically. This is, to our best knowledge, the first report of IE and myocarditis diagnosed in small animals using focused cardiac ultrasound examination. Therefore, we conclude that common usage of this technique by trained general veterinarians may increase the rate of diagnosed patients with these conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aanorexia 3aascites 3adeath 3aendocarditis 3afever 3afibrosis 3aheart failure 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amixed infection 3amyocarditis 3apericardium 3athoracic cavity 3aultrasonics1 aStabińska-Smolarz, Marta 1 aCzopowicz, Michał 1 aMoroz, Agata 1 aMickiewicz, Marcin 1 aŁobaczewski, Andrzej 1 aChrobak-Chmiel, Dorota 1 aKizerwetter-Świda, Magdalena 1 aRzewuska, Magdalena 1 aSapierzyński, Rafał 1 aGrzegorczyk, Michał 1 aŚwierk, Anna 1 aFrymus, Tadeusz 0 tAnimals.g2021 Nov. 05, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111131623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002000160245009800180300001800278500000900296500001500305520179600320592002802116650001402144650001402158650002102172650002102193650001402214650002602228650002302254650001302277650001102290650002602301650002002327650001802347653001102365700002102376773012402397852000902521856009702530655001202627IND8114472620221116173726.0191122e198011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND811447262DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1980.00021962007200060043x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWernsman, E.

In this study we tested production regimes utilizing photoperiod−sensitive genotypes to prevent flowering and produce additional upstalk leaves as a substitute for discarded basal leaves. Normal and photoperiod−sensitive (mammoth) versions of four cultivars were grown in field experiments at two locations in 2 years. Apical meristems of mammoth genotypes were removed when plants had produced the same number of leaves as normal cultivars, four leaves more than normal in 1977, and two leaves more than noma1 in 1978. Mammoth genotypes allowed to produce the same leaf number as normal cultivars provided higher yields, with leaf quality equal or superior to the controls. Total alkaloids were lower than in normal cultivars in 1977, but equal in 1978. Reducing sugar contents were equal in both types in 1977, but significantly higher for mammoths in 1978. Permitting mammoth plants to produce four more leaves than normal, with the bottom four leaves removed from the plants and discarded, resulted in yield overcompensation with slight reductions in leaf alkaloids and increases in reducing sugars. Two additional top leaves on mammoth entries did not compensate adequately for yield reductions caused by discarding the bottom four leaves. Leaf alkaloids and sugar contents in the latter production regime did not differ from those of control cultivars. These regimes could reduce the production of downstalk tobaccos without significant yield reductions and would eliminate all premature flowering. The maintenance of apical dominance in mammoths would enhance axillary bud control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana 3aalkaloids 3aapical dominance 3aapical meristems 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3aflue-cured tobacco 3agenotype 3aleaves 3aproduction technology 3areducing sugars 3asugar content 0aplants1 aMatzinger, D.

Incidental findings at necropsy included multiple 3–8-cm unilocular cysts in the liver and lungs. Cysts contained either a clear fluid with or without hydatid sand or a gelatinous substance with foci of mineralization. Light and scanning electron microscopic examination of the hydatid sand revealed free protoscolices as well as intact and ruptured brood capsules with protoscolices attached to the germinal membrane. The protoscolices had 2 rows of 36–38 rostellar hooks with a length of 25–30 μm. The cyst wall consisted of inner germinal, intermediate laminated, and outer adventitial layers. Hydatidosis caused by Echinococcus granulosus was diagnosed based on the unilocular cysts, multiple protoscolices formed in a brood capsule, typical trilayered cyst wall, and herbivorous intermediate host. This is the first reported case of animal hydatidosis in Taiwan. The infection is thought to have been established 12 years ago in South Africa prior to importation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliver 3aechinococcosis 3alungs 3acase studies 3aEchinococcus granulosus 2aAnimals 2aAutopsyxveterinary 2aEchinococcosis, Hepaticxpathologyxveterinary. 2aEchinococcosis, Pulmonaryxpathologyxveterinary. 2aEchinococcusxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aEquidaexparasitology 2aFatal Outcome 2aFibrosisxveterinary 2aMale 2aMyocardiumxpathology 0aTaiwan 0aanatomy and morphology1 aWang, Fun-In1 aChang, Pen H.1 aLiu, Chen-Hsuan1 aJeng, Chian R.1 aCheng, Chiung H.1 aJou, Jiann1 aPang, Victor F.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 13, no. 6 p.534-537dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638701013006153Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02846naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011600173300001600289520135200305592002801657650001301685650003001698650002701728650001601755650002201771650001701793650001101810650000701821650001501828650003301843650001101876650001401887650004401901650001501945650001601960650002001976653002701996653001702023653001602040653001702056653003102073653003302104700002402137773009702161856008502258852000902343655001202352IND60546815120221121212814.0160903e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054681512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.12.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNair, Abhilash T.14aThe reuse of water treatment sludge as a coagulant for post-treatment of UASB reactor treating urban wastewater  ap. 272-281.  aThe feasibility of reusing polyaluminium chloride-based water treatment sludge as a coagulant for the post-treatment of upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating urban wastewater was assessed. Response surface methodology with Box-Behnken design was employed to optimise three variables affecting coagulation/flocculation process namely sludge dose, initial pH and fresh coagulant dose. Results of the modelling study gave the following optimum conditions: sludge dose 15 g/L, initial pH 9 and fresh coagulant dose 4.2 mg Al/L; and predicted 72% COD removal and 88% turbidity removal. Confirmative experiments at the optimum conditions gave COD and turbidity removals of 74% and 89%, respectively, which were in close agreement with the predicted values. Further, at optimum conditions high removals of phosphate (79%), suspended solids (84%), BOD (78%) and total coliforms (99.7%) were obtained. The experiments also showed that a combination of water treatment sludge with fresh coagulant would give a substantially higher contaminant removal compared to the removals obtained by fresh coagulant alone. The study presents a novel reuse alternative for water treatment sludge and the results suggest that reuse of water treatment sludge as a coagulant for the post-treatment of UASB reactor effluent would be an attractive option.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoagulation 3acoliform bacteria 3aflocculation 3amodels 3apH 3aphosphates 3aresponse surface methodology 3asludge 3aturbidity 3aupflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 3awastewater 3awater reuse 3awater treatment 0aWater treatment sludge 0aSludge reuse 0aCoagulation 0aUASB reactor 0aUrban wastewater treatment 0aResponse surface methodology1 aAhammed, M.

We investigated the representation of episodic memory in hippocampal neurons of nine epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial monitoring as they discriminated between recently studied words (targets) and new words (foils) on a recognition test. On average, single units and multiunits exhibited higher spike counts in response to targets relative to foils, and the size of this effect correlated with behavioral performance. Further analyses of the spike-count distributions revealed that (i) a small percentage of recorded neurons responded to any one target and (ii) a small percentage of targets elicited a strong response in any one neuron. These findings are consistent with the idea that in the human hippocampus episodic memory is supported by a sparse distributed neural code.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aepilepsy 3ahippocampus 3ahumans 3amemory 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aneurons 3apatients 0arecognition memory 0aintracranial recording 0aamygdala1 aSquire, Larry R.1 aJang, Yoonhee1 aPapesh, Megan H.1 aGoldinger, Stephen D.1 aKuhn, Joel R.1 aSmith, Kris A.1 aTreiman, David M.1 aSteinmetz, Peter N.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 July 1, v. 111, no. 26 p.9621-9626dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14083651113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010900167300001600276520161100292592002801903650002001931650001301951650001301964650002201977650001601999650002002015650001302035650001902048650000902067650001402076653001802090653001402108653003602122653001802158700001602176773009702192856008502289852000902374655001202383IND60546815220221120023923.0160903e20140315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054681522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.12.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYam, R.C.M.12aA cleaner production of rice husk-blended polypropylene eco-composite by gas-assisted injection moulding  ap. 277-284.  aGas-assisted injection moulding processes are widely applied in the plastics industry to improve moulding quality by using fewer polymers. This process is achieved by hollowing out the internal section of the mould to reduce the usage for conventional polymers and is particularly good for thick, moulded products. The eco-composites polymers, such as rice husk-filled polymers are environmental friendly materials to replace polymers. A cleaner production can be achieved by using rice husk-blended polypropylene RH/PP eco-composite in the gas-assisted injection moulding process. No successful case is reported in literature, as the increased shear viscosity of the non-petrochemical and natural-based polymers make it difficult for the eco-composite to flow inside the moulds. In this study, gas-assisted injection moulding technology was successfully applied to the rice husk-filled polypropylene eco-composites polymers in different compositions.Different stages of injection pressure and delays of gas pressure were applied in order to improve the flow characteristics. In addition, the internal wall surface of the mould must be polished to ‘Mold-Tech’ SPI A2, an industry standard textured finishes. The new approach uses fewer petrochemical polymers with improved moulding quality, especially for thick, moulded parts. The new method is also an environmentally-friendly approach as it uses less injection pressure and clamping force. This has created a good foundation for further research in cleaner production of different kinds of eco-composites material by gas-assisted injection moulding.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3afinishes 3aindustry 3ainjection molding 3amethodology 3amolded products 3aplastics 3apolypropylenes 3arice 3aviscosity 0aEco-composite 0aRice husk 0aGas-assisted injection moulding 0aPolypropylene1 aMak, D.M.T.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2014 Mar. 15, v. 67 p.277-284dElsevier Ltdx0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.12.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013000170520102500300592002801325650001801353650001601371650001601387650001101403650001401414650001301428650001901441650001401460650001801474650000901492650001701501650002101518650002001539650001901559653002601578653003301604653002301637653000801660653000801668653000801676653000801684653001001692653000901702653001401711700001901725700001401744700001301758700001701771773010001788856008701888852000901975655001201984IND60752761920221120143005.0220205e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075276192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1313082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wen-mei10aSimulated in vitro digestion of α-lactalbumin modified by phosphorylation: Detection of digestive products and allergenicity  aThe effects of phosphorylation on the allergenicity of bovine α-lactalbumin (BLA) and digestive products were studied in vitro digestion. Two components with different molecular weight and conformation were obtained from natural and phosphorylated BLA. In vivo and in vitro assessment of allergenicity showed that phosphorylation prior to digestion significantly decreased the IgE/IgG binding capacity and allergic response in KU812 cells, and reduced the levels of IgG, IgE, IL-4 and histamine, with an increase in IFN-γ levels in mouse serum, depending on the changes in BLA structures, producing numerous small peptides. There were four phosphorylated sites (S22, T29, S47 and S70) in the high molecular weight components of phosphorylated BLA after digestion. These phosphorylated sites could mask the linear epitopes of digestive products, resulting in reduced allergic activity. Phosphorylation prior to digestion of dairy products can reduce the risk of anaphylaxis in patients with milk allergy to some extent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergenicity 3aanaphylaxis 3ablood serum 3acattle 3adigestion 3aepitopes 3afood chemistry 3ahistamine 3ainterleukin-4 3amice 3amilk allergy 3amolecular weight 3aphosphorylation 3arisk reduction 0aBovine α-lactalbumin 0aSimulated in vitro digestion 0aDigestive products 0aBLA 0aIgG 0aIgE 0aMWs 0aELISA 0aHPLC 0aHCD-MS/MS1 aShao, Yan-hong1 aWang, Zhi1 aLiu, Jun1 aTu, Zong-cai0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 372 p.131308-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1313083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01470naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245007800163300001800241520056300259592002800822653002000850653001900870653001600889653002700905700002200932773015200954856007701106852000901183655001201192IND60522381120221121234006.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052238112DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2010-08122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChirico, Pietro10aSolvothermal Synthesis of Gallium and Indium Nitrides Using Lithium Amide  ap. 1051-1057.  aResults of the investigation of the reactions of GaCl₃, InCl₃ and InI₃ with LiNH₂ under solvothermal conditions in benzene, which lead to metal nitrides, are reported.

Characterization by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated formation of a uniform nanoparticles coating (about 20 nm in thickness) on the PAN nanofiber backbone. The coating was constructed by well-crystallized cubic phase Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles as examined by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD). The coating doubled the specific surface area of NFs, from 8.4 to 17.8 m² g–¹, as confirmed by nitrogen sorption isotherm analysis. To evaluate the feasibility of Fe₃O₄/PAN composite NFs as a potential adsorbent for antibiotic removal, batch adsorption experiments were conducted using tetracycline (TC) as the model antibiotic molecule. The results showed that Fe₃O₄/PAN composite NFs were effective in removing TC with no impactful loss of Fe in the pH regime of environmental interest (5–8). The adsorption of TC onto Fe₃O₄/PAN composite NFs better fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetics model, and the maximum adsorption capacity calculated from Langmuir isotherm model was 257.07 mg g–¹ at pH 6. The composite NFs also exhibited good regenerability over repeated adsorption/desorption cycles. Surface complexation between TC and the composite NFs contributed most to the adsorption as elucidated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This highly effective and novel adsorbent can be easily modularized and separated, promising its huge potential in drinking and wastewater treatment for antibiotic removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aantibiotics 3acoatings 3adesorption 3airon 3airon oxides 3amodels 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastewater treatment 0aadsorption 0aantibiotic 0aelectrospinning 0ananofiber 0asolvothermal1 aZhong, Lu-Bin1 aZhao, Quan-Bao1 aFrear, Craig1 aZheng, Yu-Ming0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 July 15, v. 7, no. 27 p.14573-14583dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b045983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245005700164520118000221592002801401650001601429650002101445650001001466650002001476650001301496650001101509650001101520650001201531650000901543650001601552650001401568650001101582650002601593650001801619650002001637700002101657700002001678700002101698700002001719773012001739856007901859852000901938655001201947IND60742606020221120215759.0210624e20210603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074260602DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120605192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYokoi, Kakeru 10aReference Transcriptome Data in Silkworm Bombyx mori  aHerein, we performed RNA-seq analysis of ten major tissues/subparts of silkworm larvae. The sequences were mapped onto the reference genome assembly and the reference transcriptome data were successfully constructed. The reference data provided a nearly complete sequence for sericin-1, a major silk gene with a complex structure. We also markedly improved the gene model for other genes. The transcriptomic expression was investigated in each tissue and a number of transcripts were identified that were exclusively expressed in tissues such as the testis. Transcripts strongly expressed in the midgut formed tight genomic clusters, suggesting that they originated from tandem gene duplication. Transcriptional factor genes expressed in specific tissues or the silk gland subparts were also identified. We successfully constructed reference transcriptome data in the silkworm and found that a number of transcripts showed unique expression profiles. These results will facilitate basic studies on the silkworm and accelerate its applications, which will contribute to further advances in lepidopteran and entomological research as well as the practical use of these insects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3agene duplication 3agenes 3agenome assembly 3agenomics 3amidgut 3amodels 3asericin 3asilk 3asilk glands 3asilkworms 3atestes 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aTsubota, Takuya 1 aJouraku, Akiya 1 aSezutsu, Hideki 1 aBono, Hidemasa 0 tInsects.g2021 June 03, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120605193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02027naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006400145245014500209300001800354520059200372592002800964650002200992650002301014650001301037650001501050650003101065650002201096650001301118650002301131650000901154700002201163700001701185700002101202700001901223700006501242700002301307700006601330773013301396856007901529852000901608655001201617IND60627144020221118130240.0190128e20181219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062714402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b024182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArbour, Christine A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6056-296X10aBringing Macrolactamization Full Circle: Self-Cleaving Head-to-Tail Macrocyclization of Unprotected Peptides via Mild N-Acyl Urea Activation  ap. 1035-1041.  aWe establish herein conditions for the cyclization of unprotected N-acyl urea-linked peptides to form macrocyclic peptides mediated by N-terminal cysteine.

For most substrates, hydrolysis and head-to-tail dimer formation are avoided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3achemical structure 3acysteine 3ahydrolysis 3amacrocyclization reactions 3aorganic chemistry 3apeptides 3atrypsin inhibitors 3aurea1 aBelavek, Kayla J.1 aTariq, Rooha1 aMukherjee, Subha1 aTom, Janine K.1 aIsidro-Llobet, Albert1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9108-59161 aKopach, Michael E.1 aStockdill, Jennifer L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4238-65300 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2018 Dec. 19, v. 84, no. 2 p.1035-1041dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.8b024183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01984naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245009100164520107900255592002801334650001401362650001001376650001901386650001201405651001701417700002401434700003001458773012101488856007601609852000901685655001201694IND60757604320221120190608.0211125e20211021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075760432DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111130222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoma-Soto, Franco 10aVisual Signaling in the Semi-Fossorial Lizard Pholidobolus montium (Gymnophthalmidae)  aIt has been suggested that gymnophthalmids, like most semi-fossorial lacertoids, rely more in chemical cues to communicate, in comparison to other groups, like Iguanids, on which communication is mostly based on visual signaling. We present the first description of visual signaling in the Andean lizard Pholidobolusmontium (Gymnophthalmidae) and a complete ethogram based on ex situ observations (34 different types of behaviors including positions and simple movements). Through the design of conspecific stimulus experiments, we were able to recognize leg-waving as a visual signal, as it is only displayed in presence of conspecifics or in presence of a mirror and was one of first and most frequent displays in this context. We also detected other visual displays like neck-arching and tail-undulation which may also be relevant as visual signals. Based on our results, we propose that visual signaling is also possible in semi-fossorial lizards; however, further studies regarding chemical signal recognition and color detection are required to confirm our hypothesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIguanidae 3acolor 3aconspecificity 3alizards 3aAndes region1 aNarváez, Andrea E.1 aRomero-Carvajal, Andrés 0 tAnimals.g2021 Oct. 21, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111130223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245014200161300001600303520085000319592002801169650001301197650002101210650002301231650001501254650001801269650000901287650002201296700001701318700005501335773013101390856007901521852000901600655001201609IND60627144120221118130254.0190128e20181220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062714412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b024222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaw, Mukta10aGold(III)-Catalyzed Glycosylation using Phenylpropiolate Glycosides: Phenylpropiolic Acid, An Easily Separable and Reusable Leaving Group  ap. 589-605.  aAn efficient and operationally simple gold(III)-catalyzed glycosylation protocol was developed using newly synthesized benchtop stable phenylpropiolate glycosyl (PPG) donors.

Differentially protected PPGs reacted well under the optimized reaction conditions. In particular, good anomeric selectivity was observed with mannosyl and rhamnosyl PPG donors.

D.10aSubcellular Partitioning and Analysis of Gd3+-Loaded Ultrashort Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes  ap. 14593-14602.  aMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is of vast clinical utility, with tens of millions of scans performed annually. Chemical contrast agents (CAs) can greatly enhance the diagnostic potential of MRI, and ∼50% of MRI scans use CAs. However, CAs have significant limitations such as low contrast enhancement, lack of specificity, and potential toxicity. Recently developed, Gd³⁺-loaded ultrashort single-walled carbon nanotubes, also referred to as gadonanotubes or GNTs, exhibit ∼40 times the relaxivities of clinical CAs, representing a potential major advance in clinically relevant MRI CA materials. Although initial cytotoxicity and MRI studies have suggested great promise for GNTs, relatively little is known regarding their subcellular interactions, which are crucial for further, safe development of GNTs as CAs. In this work, we administered GNTs to a well-established human cell line (HeLa) and to murine macrophage-like cells (J774A.1). GNTs were not acutely cytotoxic and did not reduce proliferation, except for the highest exposure concentration of 27 μg/mL for J774A.1 macrophages, yet bulk uptake of GNTs occurred in minutes at picogram quantities, or millions of GNTs per cell. J774A.1 macrophages internalized substantially more GNTs than HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner, and Raman imaging of the subcellular distribution of GNTs revealed perinuclear localization. Fluorescence intensity and lifetime imaging demonstrated that GNTs did not grossly alter subcellular compartments, including filamentous-actin structures. Together, these results provide subcellular evidence necessary to establish GNTs as a new MRI CA material.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3afluorescence 3ahuman cell lines 3aimage analysis 3amacrophages 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amice 0aactin 0acarbon nanotubes 0achemical contrast agent 0agadolinium 0agadonanotubes 0amagnetic resonance imaging 0aRaman spectroscopy1 aLaw, Justin J.1 aBoyer, Patrick D.1 aWilson, Lon J.1 aDahl, Kris Noel1 aIslam, Mohammad F.0 tACS applied materials .g2015 July 15, v. 7, no. 27 p.14593-14602dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b048513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014900171300001400320520174600334592002802080650002502108650001902133650002302152650002602175650001502201650001902216650001602235650001502251650003102266650001302297650001302310650001802323650001502341650002002356653001302376653001502389653001402404653001902418653001902437773009702456856008602553852000902639655001202648IND60535669120221121191250.0190319e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053566912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2013.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Jaclyn M.10aInvestigations of growth metrics and δ15N values of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes, (Mart.) Solms-Laub) in relation to biological control  ap. 12-20.  aThe success of biological control for Eichhornia crassipes (Mart) Solms-Laub has been varied, with failure attributed to various factors including increased eutrophication in freshwater systems. Studies have shown that high N-loads are associated with enriched δ15N values of aquatic biota. Stable isotope analyses may help to assess the nutrient status of invaded ecosystems and predict the success of classical biological control. A combination of controlled greenhouse experiments and in situ observations were used to quantify the δ15N equilibration rate of E. crassipes leaf tissue (i.e. the time span of the information on environmental N-loading), confirm the ability of plant tissue to reflect ecosystem N-loading and to compare standard water hyacinth growth metrics with δ15N and C/N ratios to evaluate how well they described eutrophication. Using both δ15N values and C/N ratios, it was possible to clearly distinguish between manure, fertilizer and control regimes and plant tissue provided information on ecosystem N loading over approximately 16 days. Interpretations were complicated by the plant's capacity for N storage. Strong correlations between petiole length of E. crassipes and δ15N suggest petiole length may be linked to N loading. Weaker (or a lack of) correlations between δ15N or C/N ratios and remaining growth metrics suggest that generalisations and/or predictions of eutrophication based on growth metrics should be avoided. A combination approach using plant tissue δ15N and C/N ratios along with maximum petiole length of E. crassipes plants will provide a time integrated assessment of ecosystem eutrophication and identify areas where classical biological control may fail to regulate populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aaquatic plants 3abiological control 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3afertilizers 3afreshwater 3agreenhouse experimentation 3anitrogen 3apetioles 3aplant tissues 3aprediction 3astable isotopes 0aIsotopes 0aC/N ratios 0aN-loading 0aEutrophication 0aPetiole length0 tAquatic botany.g2014 Feb., v. 114 p.12-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2013.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013900170300001400309520167700323592002802000650001602028650002202044650000802066650003002074650001402104650002702118650001302145650002102158651001802179651001502197651001602212653003102228653002602259653002502285653001502310653001602325653000902341700001902350700001902369700001502388700002102403700002302424700001702447773009702464856008202561852000902643655001202652IND60112702820221122063921.0190415e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011270282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2013.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNatsuike, Masafumi10aAbundance and distribution of toxic Alexandrium tamarense resting cysts in the sediments of the Chukchi Sea and the eastern Bering Sea  ap. 52-59.  aAbundance and distribution of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense species complex resting cyst were investigated in the eastern Bering Sea and the Chukchi Sea for the first time. Sediment samples (top 0–3cm depth) were collected from the continental shelf of the eastern Bering Sea (17 stations) and the Chukchi Sea (13 stations) together with a long core sample (top 0–21cm depth) from one station in the Chukchi Sea during 2009–2012. The cysts were enumerated using the primuline staining method. Species identification of the cysts was carried out with multiplex PCR assay and the plate morphology of vegetative cells germinated from cysts in the both areas. Alexandrium cysts were widely detected in the both areas, ranging from not detected (<1cystscm−3) to 835cystscm−3 wet sediment in the eastern Bering Sea and from not detected (<1cystscm−3) to 10,600cystscm−3 in the Chukchi Sea, and all isolated cysts were genetically and morphologically identified as the North American clade A. tamarense. Their cysts were mainly distributed in the shallow continental shelf where the water depth was less than 100m in both areas. The cysts were detected from the deep layer (18–21cm depth of sediment core) of the long core sample. The present study confirmed the abundant existence of A. tamarense with wide range of distribution in these areas. This fact suggests that A. tamarense vegetative cells have appeared in the water column in the both areas. Furthermore, these abundant cyst depositions indicate that this species originally distributed in the Arctic and subarctic regions and well adapted to the environments in the marginal ice zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlexandrium 3acontinental shelf 3aice 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asediments 3aspecies identification 3atoxicity 3avegetative cells 3aArctic region 3aBering Sea 3aChukchi Sea 0aAbundance and distribution 0aAlexandrium tamarense 0aArctic and subarctic 0aBering Sea 0aChukchi Sea 0aCyst1 aNagai, Satoshi1 aMatsuno, Kohei1 aSaito, Rui1 aTsukazaki, Chiko1 aYamaguchi, Atsushi1 aImai, Ichiro0 tHarmful algae.g2013 July, v. 27 p.52-59dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2013.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003200141245018900173520148100362592002801843650001301871650002601884650001101910650001001921650001401931650001101945650001201956650001701968650001001985650001501995650000902010650002202019650002002041650001602061651002002077651001102097700001802108700003102126700002002157773012102177856007602298852000902374655001202383IND60757604520221120190433.0211125e20211105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075760452DNAL7 a10.3390/ani111131682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales Mérida, Alejandra 10aHatching Success Rather Than Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination as the Main Driver of Olive Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) Nesting Activity in the Pacific Coast of Central America  aIn marine turtles, sex is determined during a precise period during incubation: males are produced at lower temperatures and females at higher temperatures, a phenomenon called temperature-dependent sex determination. Nest temperature depends on many factors, including solar radiation. Albedo is the measure of the proportion of reflected solar radiation, and in terms of sand color, black sand absorbs the most energy, while white sand reflects more solar radiation. Based on this observation, darker sand beaches with higher temperatures should produce more females. As marine turtles show a high degree of philopatry, including natal homing, dark beaches should also produce more female hatchlings that return to nest when mature. When sand color is heterogeneous in a region, we hypothesize that darker beaches would have the most nests. Nevertheless, the high incubation temperature on beaches with a low albedo may result in low hatching success. Using Google Earth images and the SWOT database of nesting olive ridleys (Lepidochelys olivacea) in the Pacific coast of Mexico and Central America, we modeled sand color and nesting activity to test the hypothesis that darker beaches host larger concentrations of females because of feminization on darker beaches and female philopatry. We found the opposite result: the lower hatching success at beaches with a lower albedo could be the main driver of nesting activity heterogeneity for olive ridleys in Central America.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aLepidochelys olivacea 3acoasts 3acolor 3adatabases 3aenergy 3afemales 3afeminization 3anests 3aphilopatry 3asand 3asex determination 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3aCentral America 3aMexico1 aHelier, Aude 1 aCortés-Gómez, Adriana A.1 aGirondot, Marc 0 tAnimals.g2021 Nov. 05, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani111131683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008000175300001400255520158900269592002801858650002701886650001401913650002501927650002001952650002501972650001901997650001502016650002002031650001402051650002302065650002302088650001202111650001202123650001102135650002102146650001002167650001902177653001402196653002102210653002902231653002402260700002002284700002702304773009702331856008602428852000902514655001202523IND60535669220221121191254.0190319e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053566922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2013.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFraser, Lauchlan H.10aGermination of 14 freshwater wetland plants as affected by oxygen and light  ap. 29-34.  aOxygen and light are factors that can affect seed germination of wetland plants. We selected seeds from 20 plant species found in temperate eastern North American marsh and wet meadow wetlands, ranging from obligate wetland (OBL), facultative wetland (FAC) and upland (UPL) species. In growth chambers we tested germination success under controlled manipulations of O2 concentration (low [<1%] and atmospheric [∼20%]) and light levels (full light, half light and dark). Our objective was to (1) determine whether oxygen, light and their interaction facilitate germination of wetland seeds; (2) whether timing of germination is affected by oxygen and light; and (3) whether germination is related to wetland functional groups. Six species did not germinate. Of the 14 species that did germinate, a non-native ruderal (Echinochloa crus-galli) had the greatest germination success. However, we found that low O2 reduced germination success of all but three species (Rudbeckia triloba, Sagittaria latifolia and Typha latifolia). Reduction in light levels only reduced germination success of S. latifolia. We conclude that the physiological constraints that control germination operate independently for oxygen and light. It is important to know and anticipate oxygen and light levels when designing a wetland restoration project so that the proper species can be sown that can germinate under the specific conditions. Restoration planners should be aware that anoxic and hypoxic conditions seem to promote the germination of weedy and potentially invasive native and non-native species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinochloa crus-galli 3aRudbeckia 3aSagittaria latifolia 3aTypha latifolia 3aanaerobic conditions 3aaquatic plants 3afreshwater 3agrowth chambers 3ahighlands 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3amarshes 3ameadows 3aoxygen 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3awetland plants 0aAnaerobic 0aSeed germination 0aWetland functional group 0aWetland restoration1 aMulac, Kathleen1 aMoore, Francisco B.-G.0 tAquatic botany.g2014 Feb., v. 114 p.29-34dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2013.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245005600170520114700226592002801373650002501401650001601426650002801442650001101470650001601481650002301497650001001520650001401530650001401544650001501558650001101573650001301584650001301597650001201610651001001622700002001632700001901652773012001671856007901791852000901870655001201879IND60742606420221120231332.0210624e20210605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074260642DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120605232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrummond, Francis A.10aHoney Bee Health in Maine Wild Blueberry Production  aA two-year study was conducted in Maine wild blueberry fields (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton) on the health of migratory honey bee colonies in 2014 and 2015. In each year, three or five colonies were monitored at each of nine wild blueberry field locations during bloom (mid-May until mid-June). Colony health was measured by assessing colony strength during wild blueberry bloom. Potential factors that might affect colony health were queen failure or supersedure; pesticide residues on trapped pollen, wax comb, and bee bread; and parasites and pathogens. We found that Varroa mite and pesticide residues on trapped pollen were significant predictors of colony health measured as the rate of change in the amount of sealed brood during bloom. These two factors explained 71% of the variance in colony health over the two years. Pesticide exposure was different in each year as were pathogen prevalence and incidence. We detected high prevalence and abundance of two recently discovered pathogens and one recently discovered parasite, the trypanosome Lotmaria passim Schwartz, the Sinai virus, and the phorid fly, Apocephalus borealis Brues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApocephalus borealis 3aTrypanosoma 3aVaccinium angustifolium 3aVarroa 3ablueberries 3amigratory behavior 3amites 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apesticides 3apollen 3apropolis 3avariance 3aviruses 3aMaine1 aLund, Jennifer 1 aEitzer, Brian 0 tInsects.g2021 June 05, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120605233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001700165245026900182300001600451500001500467520121100482592002801693650002201721650002101743650002501764650003001789650003801819650002301857650001401880650001001894650001201904650003201916650004301948650005201991650006202043650001102105650003702116650004202153650003202195650001002227650005302237650006702290650001202357653001402369700001502383700002602398700001802424700001502442700001602457700001602473700001502489700001402504700001702518700001702535773013202552852000902684856008302693655001202776IND2327565120221122005521.0181016e200203  cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232756512DNAL7 a119393302pmid7 a10.1177/1040638702014002032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNeilly, F.10aEvaluation of a Porcine Circovirus Type 2–Specific Antigen-Capture Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Postweaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome in Pigs: Comparison with Virus Isolation, Immunohistochemistry, and the Polymerase Chain Reaction  ap. 106-112.  a2019-12-04  aQuantitative virus isolation, immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, and a porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2)-specific antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used for differentiation between clinical and subclinical PCV2 infections of swine. Tissue samples from pigs experimentally infected with PCV2 and field cases of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome and PCV2-associated reproductive disorders were used in this evaluation. In initial studies on 6 PCV2 pools using 3 previously published PCR protocols for PCV2 detection, quantitative virus isolation, and antigen-capture ELISA, substantial differences in sensitivity were identified among these procedures. Examination of tissue samples from diseased and clinically normal pigs indicated that immunohistochemistry, quantitative virus isolation, and antigen-capture ELISA could be used to differentiate between clinical and subclinical PCV2 infections, but the PCR assay could not. Because subclinical infections of pigs with PCV2 are common, the use of nonquantitative PCR as a diagnostic tool for PCV2-related diseases should be discouraged and the PCV2-specific antigen-capture ELISA evaluated further.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisease diagnosis 3awasting syndrome 3aimmunohistochemistry 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aPorcine circovirus 3ainfection 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxanalysis 2aCircovirusximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aDNA, Viralxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxstandardsxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxdiagnosisximmunologyxvirology. 2aWasting Syndromexdiagnosisximmunologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aWeaning 0aisolation1 aMcNair, I.1 aO'Connor,cMr.q(M.),1 aBrockbank, S.1 aGilpin, D.1 aLasagna, C.1 aBoriosi, G.1 aMeehan, B.1 aEllis, J.1 aKrakowka, S.1 aAllan, G.

These organic molecules possess common functionalities and are representative in terms of size and composition of systems routinely studied computationally. They exist as two well-defined conformations which serve as a useful tool to benchmark computational estimates of experimental Gibbs energy differences. We examine the performance of HF theory and a variety of density functionals (B3LYP, B3LYP-D3, CAM-B3LYP, ωB97X-D, M06-2X) against these experimental benchmarks. Surprisingly, despite a strong similarity between the two switch conformations, the average errors (0.4–1.7 kcal·mol–¹) obtained across the data set for all methods are larger than obtained with HF calculations. B3LYP was found to outperform implicitly and explicitly dispersion-corrected functionals, with an average error smaller by 1 kcal·mol–¹. Unsystematic errors in the optimized structures were found to contribute to the relatively poor performance obtained, while quasi-rigid rotor harmonic oscillator thermal contributions are important in improving the accuracy of computed Gibbs energy differences. These results emphasize the challenge of quantitative accuracy in computing solution-phase thermochemistry for flexible systems and caution against the often used (but unstated) assumption of favorable error cancellation in comparing conformers or stereoisomers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemical reactions 3adata collection 3aenergy 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3astereoisomers1 aPaton, Robert S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0104-41660 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2018 Dec. 26, v. 84, no. 2 p.613-621dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.8b024363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009900166300001400265520191300279592002802192650002502220650002502245650003502270650001002305650002002315650001902335650002802354650001502382650001402397650001302411651002202424653001302446653000902459653002302468653002502491653000802516700002602524700002102550700001702571773009702588856008202685852000902767655001202776IND60112703120221120080704.0190415e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011270312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2013.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaho, Nicolás10aAre the mitochondrial cox1 and cob genes suitable markers for species of Dinophysis Ehrenberg?  ap. 64-70.  aThe identification of Dinophysis species with similar morphology but different toxic (Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning, DSP) potential is a crucial task in harmful algae monitoring programmes. The taxonomic assignment of Dinophysis species using molecular markers is a difficult task due to extremely low interspecific variability within their nuclear ribosomal genes and intergenic regions. Mitochondrial cox1 gene has been proposed as a better specific marker for Dinophysis species based on its higher resolution for two morphologically related species (Dinophysis acuminata and Dinophysis ovum) of the “Dinophysis acuminata complex”. In this study, the potential of two mitochondrial genes (mt cox1 and cob) to discriminate among six Dinophysis species (field isolates and cultures) associated with DSP events was explored. Neither mt cox1 nor cob genes provided enough resolution for all species of Dinophysis. The cob gene showed very poor resolution and grouped all Dinophysis spp. in a common clade. In contrast, the cox1 phylogeny distinguished 5 clades in the Dinophysiales – the “acuminata complex”, the “caudata group”, “acuta+norvegica” and Phalacromaspp. However, within the “D. acuminata complex” mtcox1 is so far the unique marker that differentiates D. acuminata from other species: isolates of D. ovum and Dinophysis sacculus had almost identical sequences (only four mismatches), but they were well separated from D. acuminata. D. acuminata and Dinophysis skagii (considered a life cycle stage of the former) showed identical cox1 sequences. Probes towards this gene can be useful in Mediterranean and Western Iberia sites where the co-occurrence of close morphotypes of D. acuminata and D. sacculus pose a problem for monitoring analyses. This is the first report on cultures of D. sacculus and its phylogenetic relation with other species of the D. acuminata complex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDinophysis acuminata 3adevelopmental stages 3adiarrhetic shellfish poisoning 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aintergenic DNA 3ainterspecific variation 3amonitoring 3aphylogeny 3atoxicity 3aIberian Peninsula 0acob gene 0acox1 0aDinophysis species 0aD. acuminata complex 0aDSP1 aRodríguez, Francisco1 aReguera, Beatriz1 aMarín, Irma0 tHarmful algae.g2013 Aug., v. 28 p.64-70dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2013.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245010100213300001200314506007600326520125600402592002801658506003701686650001601723650001701739650001801756650001201774650002201786650002401808650001001832650002101842650001801863650001101881650001901892650000901911650001001920650002201930650001701952650001101969700002101980700001802001700001802019700001802037700001802055700001902073700002002092700001902112773010902131856008202240852000902322655001202331IND60569744720221207124314.0180619e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056974472DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-016-0564-x2doi7 aPMC51142112pmcid7 a283303192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUbaidillah, Mohammad10aRoles of plant hormones and anti-apoptosis genes during drought stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)  ap. 247.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe previously identified the rice (Oryza sativa) senescence-associated gene OsSAP which encodes a highly conserved protein involved in anti-apoptotic activity. This novel Bax suppressor-related gene regulates tolerance to multiple stresses in yeast. Here, we show the effects of drought stress on leaf and root tissues of plants over-expressing OsSAP in relation to the levels of phytohormones, abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA), indole-3-carboxylic acid (ICA), gibberellic acid (GA₃), and zeatin. Results showed that rice plants over-expressing SAP were tolerant to drought stress compared to wild type and the plants over-expressing AtBI-1, which is a homolog of the human Bax inhibitor-1 in Arabidopsis. ABA and JA levels in OsSAP and AtBI-1 transgenic plants consistently increased up to at least 3 days after drought treatment, whereas lower GA₃ levels were recorded during early drought period. Comparison between control and transgenic plants overexpressing anti-apoptosis genes OsSAP and AtBI-1 resulted in different patterns of hormone levels, indicating that these genes are involved in the plant responses to drought stress and present an opportunity for further study on drought stress tolerance in rice and other plant species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aOryza sativa 3aabscisic acid 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agibberellic acid 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaves 3aplant response 3arice 3aroots 3atransgenic plants 3awater stress 3azeatin1 aSafitri, FikaAyu1 aJo, Jun-Hyeon1 aLee, Sang-Kyu1 aHussain, Adil1 aMun, Bong-Gyu1 aChung, IlKyung1 aYun, Byung-Wook1 aKim, Kyung-Min0 t3 Biotech.g2016 Dec., v. 6, no. 2 p.247-247dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-016-0564-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03473naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008400171300001800255520190400273592002802177650002202205650002402227650001102251650001302262650001902275650001602294650003802310650003302348650001902381650001802400650001102418650001502429650004402444650001302488650001302501650002102514653002602535653002302561653001702584653001602601700002002617700002002637700002302657700002802680700002202708773013102730856008502861852000902946655001202955IND60559284520221120134858.0161205e20161205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055928452DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b021372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIşık, Mehmet,10aSustainable Poly(Ionic Liquids) for CO2 Capture Based on Deep Eutectic Monomers  ap. 7200-7208.  aThe design of high performance solid sorbent materials for CO₂ capture is a technology which has been employed to mitigate global warming. However, the covalent incorporation of functionalities into polymeric supports usually involves multistep energy-intensive chemical processes. This fact makes the net CO₂ balance of the materials negative even though they possess good properties as CO₂ sorbents. Here we show a new family of polymers which are based on amines, amidoximes, and natural carboxylic acids and can be obtained using sustainable low energy processes. Thus, deep eutectic monomers based on natural carboxylic acids, amidoximes, and amines have been prepared by just mixing with cholinium type methacrylic ammonium monomer. The formation of deep eutectic monomers was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry measurements. In all cases, the monomers displayed glass transition temperatures well below room temperature. Computational studies revealed that the formation of eutectic complexes lengthens the distance between the cation and the anion causing charge delocalization. The liquid nature of the resulting deep eutectic monomers (DEMs) made it possible to conduct a fast photopolymerization process to obtain the corresponding poly(ionic liquids). Materials were characterized by means of nuclear magnetic resonance, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray diffraction to evaluate the properties of the polymers. The polymers were then used as solid sorbents for CO₂ capture. It has been shown that the polymers prepared with citric acid displayed better performance both experimentally and computationally. The current endeavor showed that sustainable poly(ionic liquids) based on deep eutectic monomers can be easily prepared to produce low-energy-cost alternatives to the materials currently being researched for CO₂ capture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3aamines 3aammonium 3acarbon dioxide 3acitric acid 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aglass transition temperature 3aglobal warming 3aionic liquids 3amixing 3anew family 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3asorbents 3athermogravimetry 0aDeep eutectic solvent 0aPoly(ionic liquid) 0aIonic liquid 0aCO2 capture1 aZulfiqar, Sonia1 aEdhaim, Fatimah1 aRuiperez, Fernando1 aRothenberger, Alexander1 aMecerreyes, David0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 Dec. 05, v. 4, no. 12 p.7200-7208dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b021373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007200167300001400239520109500253592002801348650001601376650002001392650000701412650001601419650001601435650001101451650002601462650002001488653002001508653001501528653001801543653001101561700001701572700002401589700002001613773009701633856008201730852000901812655001201821IND60112703320221120080722.0190415e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011270332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2013.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaminski, Ariel10aDetermination of anatoxin-a stability under certain abiotic factors  ap. 83-87.  aResearch into the effects of physicochemical factors on the stability of anatoxin-a (ANTX-a) has been limited. In the present results the impact of such factors as temperature, high intensity of light, pH and UV irradiation on the stability of ANTX-a were examined. Irradiation at high fluence for 5h had a weak effect on stability of ANTX-a regardless of the pH. The result was similar after red irradiation of an aqueous mixture of ANTX-a and the cyanobacterial photosynthetic pigment phycocyanin C. Under high temperature or high UV-B irradiation, ANTX-a underwent faster degradation (maximum 84% after 1h) in neutral or alkaline conditions. Hydro-ANTX-a and hemiacetyl-ANTX-a were detected amongst the products of this reaction. The results show a significant effect of physical factors on the stability of ANTX-a molecule. Some physical factors occurring in natural conditions can contribute to the accumulation of toxins in environment, whereas the others can be useful to reduce the concentration or total elimination of ANTX-a from raw water in water treatment technology processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3airradiation 3alight intensity 3apH 3aphycocyanin 3atemperature 3atoxins 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater treatment 0aAbiotic factors 0aAnatoxin-a 0aCyanobacteria 0aToxins1 aBober, Beata1 aLechowski, Zbigniew1 aBiałczyk, Jan,0 tHarmful algae.g2013 Aug., v. 28 p.83-87dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2013.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245017300169300001800342520104400360592002801404650001701432650001401449650001701463650001301480650001401493650001101507650001301518650002001531650001101551653002001562653002001582653002501602653002801627653002301655700002401678700002701702700002101729700002301750700002001773700003101793700001901824773013101843856008501974852000902059655001202068IND60559284620171219000000.0161205e20161205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055928462DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b021702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozell, Vadym10aSustainable Approach to Waste-Minimized Sonogashira Cross-Coupling Reaction Based on Recoverable/Reusable Heterogeneous Catalytic/Base System and Acetonitrile Azeotrope  ap. 7209-7216.  aIn this contribution, we present a chemically efficient and sustainable protocol for the palladium-catalyzed copper-free Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction, based on the use of a heterogeneous catalytic system. This consists in the combination of a palladium catalyst on highly cross-linked thiazolidine network on silica and a polystyrene-supported base. The solid catalyst/base system acts as a palladium scavenger avoiding leaching of the metal and consequent product contamination. The reaction can be conducted in safe and easily recoverable acetonitrile/water azeotrope as reaction medium. This proved to be an efficient greener alternative to the classic toxic aprotic media commonly used in cross-coupling reaction, such as DMF and NMP. Acetonitrile/water azeotrope could be easily recovered and reused allowing the minimization of waste production. Our approach, based on the use of both a supported base and a supported catalyst, has proven to be efficient for the waste reduction, as proved by the low E-factor values achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3acatalysts 3acrosslinking 3aleaching 3apalladium 3asilica 3atoxicity 3awaste reduction 3awastes 0aAzeotrope media 0aGreen chemistry 0aSonogashira reaction 0aHeterogeneous catalysis 0aWaste minimization1 aMcLaughlin, Michael1 aStrappaveccia, Giacomo1 aSantoro, Stefano1 aBivona, Lucia Anna1 aAprile, Carmela1 aGruttadauria, Michelangelo1 aVaccaro, Luigi0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 Dec. 05, v. 4, no. 12 p.7209-7216dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b021703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01949naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245015800164300001600322520064900338592002800987650002301015650003601038650001301074650000901087650001101096650002201107650002201129650001101151650001501162650001501177650000901192700002101201700005801222700006401280773013101344856007901475852000901554655001201563IND60627144820221118125727.0190128e20181214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062714482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.8b024692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeda, Shiori10aChiroptical Protocol for the Absolute Configurational Assignment of Alkyl-Substituted Epoxides Using Bis(zinc porphyrin) as a CD-Sensitive Bidentate Host  ap. 645-652.  aThe absolute configurations of simple alkyl-substituted chiral epoxides not bearing other ligating groups are readily determined via the exciton-coupled circular dichroism (ECCD) protocol using bidentate bis(zinc porphyrin) host system BP1 as a CD-sensitive chirality probe.

The Y-tube olfactometer has been widely used to study repellents and attractants, while the high-throughput screening system assay has only been used to study repellents. Whether the high-throughput screening system assay is suitable for evaluating attractants is unknown. We evaluated the responses to four lactic-acid-based mixtures and two non-lactic-acid-based chemical lure candidates using the high-throughput screening system (HITSS) for three mosquito species (laboratory strains and field populations of both Aedes aegypti (L.) and Culex quinquefasciatus Say.; laboratory strain of Anopheles minimus Theobald) under laboratory-controlled conditions. HITSS assay results showed that KU-lure #1 elicited the greatest percent attraction for pyrethroid-resistant and -susceptible Ae. aegypti. KU-lure #6 elicited the strongest attractive response for pyrethroid-susceptible and -resistant Cx. quinquefasciatus and pyrethroid-susceptible An. minimus. The response to the lures from each species was independent of the pyrethroid susceptibility status (Ae. aegypti, p = 0.825; Cx. quinquefasciatus, p = 0.056). However, a significant difference in attraction to KU-lure #6 was observed between diurnal and nocturnal mosquitoes (Cx. quinquefasciatus vs. Ae. aegypti, p = 0.014; An. minimus vs. Ae. aegypti, p = 0.001). The laboratory-level HITSS assay effectively selects potential lure candidates. Because the host-seeking behavior differs between mosquito species, further studies are needed to develop species-specific attractants. Additional studies in semi-field screen houses using commercial traps are necessary to evaluate the accuracy of these laboratory assay results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aAnopheles minimus 3aCulex quinquefasciatus 3ahost seeking 3ainsect attractants 3aolfactometers 3apyrethrins1 aLeepasert, Theerachart 1 aBangs, Michael J.1 aChareonviriyaphap, Theeraphap 0 tInsects.g2021 June 06, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120605283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013700169300001400306520145900320592002801779650001201807650001601819650001501835650001901850650001201869650001901881650001601900650001301916650001501929650002301944650001501967650002601982650001402008650001202022650001602034650001002050650001302060650001902073650001102092650001102103650002002114650001202134650001802146650001102164650002502175653001502200653002402215653001202239653001702251653002902268700002002297700002102317700004502338700001902383700001702402773009602419856008602515852000902601655001202610IND60535669920221121191248.0200711e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053566992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2014.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNawaz, Tahira10aAnatomical and physiological adaptations in aquatic ecotypes of Cyperus alopecuroides Rottb. under saline and waterlogged conditions  ap. 60-68.  aAn experiment was conducted to investigate structural and functional acclimation in two ecotypes of Cyperus alopecuroides Rottb. under saline and waterlogged conditions. A salt sensitive ecotype was collected from fresh river water (FW) and a salt tolerant ecotype from polluted brackish water (BW). The experiment was conducted in a 2-factorial (salinity, ecotyope) completely randomized design with five replications. Three salt regimes were maintained during the experiment, 0 (control, no salt), 150 and 300mM NaCl. Ecotype BW was better adapted to salinity+waterlogging than ecotype FW from fresh water of the River Ravi. Waterlogging was simulated as ecotype BW showed greater root and shoot length, root and shoot fresh and dry biomass, and bract area, higher chlorophyll a and b concentration, net assimilation rate, water use efficiency, turgor potential, root and shoot K⁺ and accumulation of free proline, but lower transpiration rate and shoot Na⁺ uptake than ecotype FW under stressful conditions of salinity/waterlogging. Root lysogenous aerenchyma was more prominent in ecotype FW than in ecotype BW. In addition, ecotype BW had large cortical cells, a thick endodermis barrier, high sclerification and large metaxylem vessels, all contributing to efficient water and solute conduction under combined salinity and waterlogging stress; hence contributing substantially to better survival of this ecotype in harsh stressful environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyperus 3aacclimation 3aaerenchyma 3aaquatic plants 3abiomass 3abrackish water 3achlorophyll 3aecotypes 3aendodermis 3aflooded conditions 3afreshwater 3anet assimilation rate 3apotassium 3aproline 3ariver water 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3ashoots 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asolutes 3atranspiration 3aturgor 3awater use efficiency 0aAerenchyma 0aChlorophyll content 0aProline 0aSclerenchyma 0aStellate parenchyma cell1 aHameed, Mansoor1 aAshraf, Muhammad1 aAhmad, M.

The 2D MoS₂ photodetectors reported in the literature have presented low responsivity compared to silicon based photodetectors. In this study, we assembled atomically thin p-type MoS₂ with graphene to form a MoS₂/graphene Schottky photodetector where photo generated holes travel from graphene to MoS₂ over the Schottky barrier under illumination. We found that the p-type MoS₂ forms a Schottky junction with graphene with a barrier height of 139 meV, which results in high photocurrent and wide spectral range of detection with wavelength selectivity. The fabricated photodetector showed excellent photosensitivity with a maximum photo responsivity of 1.26 AW–¹ and a noise equivalent power of 7.8 × 10–¹² W/√Hz at 1440 nm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adetection limit 3agraphene 3alighting 3aluminescence 3amolybdenum disulfide 3aoptical properties 3aphotosensitivity 3asilicon 3awavelengths 0aatomic layer MoS2 0agraphene 0aSchottky junction 0a2D hybrid materials 0aphotodetector 0aCVD1 aChoudhary, Nitin1 aChowdhury, Al-Amin.1 aSinha, Raju1 aKarabiyik, Mustafa1 aDas, Santanu1 aChoi, Wonbong1 aPala, Nezih0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 July 22, v. 7, no. 28 p.15206-15213dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b008873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007300164300001600237500001500253520148200268592002801750650001101778650001801789650001901807650001401826650002201840650002001862650000901882650001801891650001401909650001201923650002101935650002001956650002301976653001001999653000902009700001902018700002002037700001902057773012002076856004802196852000902244655001202253IND50074352420221123031640.0140329e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007435242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-002-0563-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYildirim, S.10aFractionation of transgenic corn for recovery of recombinant enzymes  ap. 809-814.  a2019-12-06  aTwo germ-separation methods, dry-milling and density separation by flotation, were evaluated for recovering recombinant β-glucuronidase (rGUS) that accumulated primarily in the germ of transgenic corn. The dry-milling process consisted of (i) seed tempering, (ii) degerming with a horizontal-drum degermer/dehuller, (iii) particle size fractionation with standard sieves, (iv) germ and endosperm separation by roller milling and sifting, and (v) removal of hulls by aspiration. Sieves nos. 5, 6, and 7 retained the majority of germ, and subfractions from these sieves were pooled as a germ-rich fraction. Mass balances showed that the germ-rich fraction, which constituted 17% of the total dry-milled corn weight, contained 49% of rGUS activity and 64% of the total recoverable oil. Germ fractionation by flotation was tested as a proof-of-concept method aimed at separating corn fractions based on their difference in specific gravity (sp gr). The process consisted of impact-grinding of corn kernels followed by density separation using 1.15 or 1.3 specific gravity sodium nitrate solution. The oil-containing germ fraction floated, whereas the heavier endosperm fraction sedimented. The flotation method was simpler and resulted in higher enzyme recovery, that is, the germ-rich fraction was 20% (w/w) of the initial corn weight, and accounted for 80% of rGUS activity and 77% of total oil. The sodium nitrate solution did not have an adverse effect on the enzyme activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3asieves 3afractionation 3asodium nitrate 3atempering 3atransgenic plants 3aadverse effects 3acorn 3aparticle size 3aendosperm 3amilling 3aspecific gravity 3aenzyme activity 3abeta-glucuronidase 0aseeds 0agerm1 aFuentes, R.

These products require additional procedures unrelated to the existing biorefinery equipment. In the current study, we proposed successive sulfite treatments to utilize the enzymolysis residues for producing fermentable sugars and lignosulfonates. Two sulfite methods were compared as an initial pretreatment. It was found that the acid bisulfite treatment achieved higher hemicellulose removal (90%), while neutral sulfite resulted in higher lignin removal (50%) and a greater lignosulfonate yield (26.6 g from 100 g raw material). Overall, the acid bisulfite treatment resulted in 66% glucan conversion by enzymatic hydrolysis, whereas it was only 37% for the neutral sulfite method. In addition, the neutral sulfite pretreated wood reached 80% of the maximum sugar yield after 6 h of enzymatic hydrolysis, whereas it was 48 h for the acid bisulfite pretreated wood. The multistep treatment process achieved 84% total sugar conversion and 58% lignin removal with 32.4 g lignosulfonates being produced from 100 g raw materials. The results demonstrate that the multistep treatment process has a potential to maximize the yields of fermentable sugars and lignosulfonates.  aPublisher supplied data  cChina Scholarship Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004543  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aactivated carbon 3ahemicellulose 3aenergy 3asugars 3aequipment 3asulfites 3aglucans 3alignosulfonates 3asoftwood 3abiorefining 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afeedstocks 3alignin 0aSugars 0aNeutral sulfite treatment 0araw materials 0aLignosulfonates 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aAcid bisulfite treatment1 aWang, Jinwu1 aWolcott, Michael

This study empirically demonstrates significant effects on population dynamics from resonance and describes the conditions under which they occur. In a laboratory microcosm experiment with the ciliate protist Colpidium striatum, resources were periodically alternated between high and low concentrations at different frequencies. Resonance raised the mean population density of rapidly fluctuating treatments by 21% compared to a constant control run at the average nutrient concentration, and eventually approximated the mean density of the highest nutrient control. The resonant resource perturbations occurred on a time scale intermediate to the reproduction and starvation rates of the organisms. It is likely that metabolic nonlinearities in these reproductive and starvation responses interacted with the periodic resources fluctuations of intermediate frequency to produce the population boost through the cumulative storage of resources in the cells of the protists. The populations also showed a frequency threshold effect in the translation of environmental variability into population variability. The patterns of population abundance and variability observed in this experiment indicate that resonance between intrinsic and extrinsic processes may be an important factor to consider in population dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarrying capacity 3anutrient content 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3aprotists 3areproduction 3astarvation1 aLawler, Sharon P.0 tEcology.g2004 Jan., v. 85, no. 1 p.150-157dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-03723Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02194naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007500169520103300244592002801277650001801305650002101323650001301344650001301357650001901370650001801389650001101407650001501418650001601433650001301449650001801462653001301480653002501493653001101518653001601529653001501545700002801560773010001588856008701688852000901775655001201784IND60752762820221120183431.0220205e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075276282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1313202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero, Paco10aEthylene-driven changes in epicuticular wax metabolism in citrus fruit  aEpicuticular waxes are important natural compounds that influence cuticle properties and can protect fruit from factors that harm its external quality. We demonstrated that, at a dose that reduces postharvest citrus fruit quality loss (4 d 2 µL L⁻¹), ethylene redirected epicuticular wax metabolism towards the synthesis of primary alcohols, mostly behenyl alcohol, by favouring the acyl-reduction pathway. This treatment also reduced the synthesis of terpenoids by redirecting the mevalonate pathway towards farnesol accumulation to the detriment of the accumulation of most triterpenoids, but not of their precursor squalene. Moreover, the 4 d ethylene treatment sharply increased the synthesis of docosane and lignoceric acid and lowered that of cerotic acid. Longer ethylene exposure (8 d) reversed some of these effects by lowering the contents of most alcohols, lignoceric acid and squalene, while increasing that of its derivative sitosterol. The 8 d ethylene treatment also increased farnesol and docosane contents.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitrus fruits 3aepicuticular wax 3aethylene 3afarnesol 3afood chemistry 3afruit quality 3afruits 3ametabolism 3asitosterols 3asqualene 3atriterpenoids 0aAlcohols 0aCuticle permeability 0aOrange 0aPostharvest 0aTerpenoids1 aLafuente, María Teresa0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 372 p.131320-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1313203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008900172300001400261520154400275592002801819650001501847650001701862650001901879650001101898650001501909650001001924650001201934650001201946650002101958650001201979650001301991650002402004651001602028653001402044653002402058653001302082653001902095700002502114773009602139856008602235852000902321655001202330IND60535670020221121043221.0200711e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053567002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2014.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarrer, Emily C.10aMechanisms and reversibility of the effects of hybrid cattail on a Great Lakes marsh  ap. 35-43.  aInvasive plants compete with natives, and their litter can suppress natives and alter ecosystem function. Understanding the mechanisms of effect of invasive plants and testing whether invader removal reverses these effects is important to guide restoration and management. We addressed these questions in a Great Lakes marsh invaded by Typha x glauca (hybrid cattail), which produces monodominant stands with considerable litter accumulation. We teased apart effects of live T. x glauca versus its litter on the marsh ecosystem with a live/litter transplant experiment, and tested whether effects were reversible by a live/litter removal experiment in a Typha stand. Over two to four years, in both native marsh and Typha stand, the presence of litter decreased light and increased inorganic nitrogen. Live T. x glauca addition to the native marsh increased inorganic nitrogen and soil organic matter, but removal did not reverse these effects. Litter addition decreased native richness and abundance, and litter removal reversed these effects; however, characteristic native marsh sedges and rushes were not restored, but rather terrestrial grasses and forbs recruited. This suggests that litter removal is essential in cattail restoration projects to increase diversity, but that further active management will likely be necessary to restore marsh communities per se. Because many wetland invaders share similar traits with T. x glauca, including litter accumulation, conclusions are broadly applicable to a variety of wetland invasions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyperaceae 3aTypha glauca 3aaquatic plants 3abotany 3aecosystems 3aforbs 3agrasses 3ahybrids 3ainvasive species 3amarshes 3anitrogen 3asoil organic matter 3aGreat Lakes 0aDiversity 0aecosystem processes 0ainvasion 0aTypha x glauca1 aGoldberg, Deborah E.0 tAquatic botany.g2014 May, v. 116 p.35-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2014.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011300161500001900274520222100293592002802514650001602542650001702558650001402575650000902589650001602598650002302614650001502637650001102652650002402663650001402687650001402701650001502715650001002730650001602740650001802756650001302774651001102787700001802798700001902816773012102835856007302956852000903029655001203038IND60715420720221118052230.0201026e20200924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071542072DNAL7 a10.3390/w121026702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbàñez, Carles,10aEnvironmental Flows in the Lower Ebro River and Delta: Current Status and Guidelines for a Holistic Approach  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDeltas are a particular type of estuarine system in which the dependence on river flow (water, sediments and nutrients) is very strong, especially in river-dominated deltas such as the Mediterranean ones, but environmental flow (e-flow) proposals for deltaic systems are scarce. The Ebro Delta is one of the largest wetland areas in the western Mediterranean and one of the most important estuarine systems in Europe. The aim of this paper is to review the state of the art regarding e-flows and to carry out a critical analysis of the proposals for the lower Ebro River and Delta, in order to highlight the possible environmental and socioeconomic impacts arising from the e-flow regime currently approved. Additionally, based on existing scientific information, methods to establish an e-flow regime that allows the maintenance of the main socio-ecological functions and values are discussed; including those functions and values for which not enough information is available. The study concludes that the currently approved e-flows are not suitable for maintaining most functions and values, as they would not prevent the proliferation of alien fish species and macrophytes in the river, the intrusion of the salt wedge in the estuary, the deficit of sediment/nutrient transport and the degradation of riparian habitats or the decline of coastal fisheries. Socioeconomic consequences on coastal fisheries, river navigation, salt water intrusion, sediment deficit, biodiversity, water quality, aquaculture and hydropower are also considered. Other e-flow proposals such as the proposed by the Catalan government would be more suitable to maintain the main socioecological functions and values of the lower Ebro River and Delta. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to validate e-flows in some relevant aspects such as the capacity of the river to transport sediments to the delta to avoid coastal regression and mitigate the effects of sea level rise and subsidence, as well as the capacity of floods to control the spread of macrophytes. The lower Ebro River and delta is among the case studies where more quantitative and qualitative criteria to set e-flows with a holistic approach have been established.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture 3abiodiversity 3aestuaries 3afish 3amacrophytes 3anutrient transport 3ariver flow 3arivers 3asaltwater intrusion 3asea level 3asediments 3asubsidence 3awater 3awater power 3awater quality 3awetlands 3aEurope1 aCaiola, Nuno 1 aBelmar, Oscar 0 tWater.g2020 Sept. 24, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121026703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245024800168300001600416520146800432592002801900650001901928650001701947650001501964650001001979650002401989650001202013650002502025650001402050650001502064650001902079650001602098650001702114650001302131650001902144650001402163650004402177650002602221650003002247650002402277653001502301653000702316653000802323653002002331653001102351653000802362653001702370653002702387700001602414700002502430700002202455700001902477700002602496700001902522700002202541700001902563700002402582773013202606856008502738852000902823655001202832IND60565049720221119071049.0181015e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056504972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2017.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndré, Fanny10aMetabolic rewiring in cancer cells overexpressing the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein (GILZ): Activation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and sensitization to oxidative cell death induced by mitochondrial targeted drugs  ap. 166-174.  aCancer cell metabolism is largely controlled by oncogenic signals and nutrient availability. Here, we highlighted that the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), an intracellular protein influencing many signaling pathways, reprograms cancer cell metabolism to promote proliferation. We provided evidence that GILZ overexpression induced a significant increase of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as evidenced by the augmentation in basal respiration, ATP-linked respiration as well as respiratory capacity. Pharmacological inhibition of glucose, glutamine and fatty acid oxidation reduced the activation of GILZ-induced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. At glycolysis level, GILZ-overexpressing cells enhanced the expression of glucose transporters in their plasmatic membrane and showed higher glycolytic reserve. ¹H NMR metabolites quantification showed an up-regulation of amino acid biosynthesis. The GILZ-induced metabolic reprograming is present in various cancer cell lines regardless of their driver mutations status and is associated with higher proliferation rates persisting under metabolic stress conditions. Interestingly, high levels of OXPHOS made GILZ-overexpressing cells vulnerable to cell death induced by mitochondrial pro-oxidants. Altogether, these data indicate that GILZ reprograms cancer metabolism towards mitochondrial OXPHOS and sensitizes cancer cells to mitochondria-targeted drugs with pro-oxidant activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta oxidation 3abiosynthesis 3acell death 3adrugs 3agene overexpression 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3aglutamine 3aglycolysis 3aleucine zipper 3ametabolites 3amitochondria 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anutrient availability 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3asignal transduction 0aElesclomol 0aHE 0aNAC 0aGlucocorticoids 0aTSC-22 0aROS 0aMitochondria 0aCancer cell metabolism1 aTrinh, Anne1 aBalayssac, Stéphane1 aMaboudou, Patrice1 aDekiouk, Salim1 aMalet-Martino, Myriam1 aQuesnel, Bruno1 aIdziorek, Thierry1 aKluza, Jérome1 aMarchetti, Philippe0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2017 Apr., v. 85 p.166-174dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2017.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245012200152300001800274520135900292592002801651650002001679650001701699650003101716650001501747650001501762650003701777650001301814650002301827650002901850650001001879700001801889700001701907700001901924700001701943700001401960700001801974773012701992856007402119852000902193655001202202IND60656652420221122065939.0190814e20130516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065665242DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay40241j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xue10aDirect analysis of urinary 1-hydroxypyrene using extractive electrospray ionization ion trap tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 2816-2821.  aFast detection (0.5 min) of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) in urine and hydrolyzed urine without pre-treatment has been successfully achieved by using extractive electrospray ionization ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (EESI-MS/MS) under optimized EESI and MS/MS conditions. Experimental results indicated that for MS/MS analysis the operating parameter of activation Q (AQ) was critical for 1-OHP fragmentation in collision induced dissociation (CID) experiments, and in the EESI process the primary ESI solvent was a key factor for extractive ionization of urinary 1-OHP. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.75 and 2.25 μM for both urine and hydrolyzed urine samples. A five-point working curve ranging from 2.29 to 22.91 μM for 1-OHP in urine or hydrolyzed urine was obtained (R² = 0.9941 for urine and R² = 0.9983 for hydrolyzed urine), and the relative standard deviations (RSD, n = 6) were 2.6–9.7% and 1.5–6.4%, respectively. The developed EESI-MS/MS method was validated by detecting 1-OHP in both urine and hydrolyzed urine samples. Recoveries were determined to >50% and 0.5 min was taken for each measurement, indicating that the proposed method is a promising strategy for high throughput analysis of urinary 1-OHP required for health risk assessment of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3adissociation 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahydrolysis 3aionization 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asolvents 3astandard deviation 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine1 aFang, Xiaowei1 aYu, Zhiqiang1 aSheng, Guoying1 aWu, Minghong1 aFu, Jiamo1 aChen, Huanwen0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 May 16, v. 5, no. 11 p.2816-2821dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay40241j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245013200153500001900285520168600304592002801990650001202018650003502030650001602065650002202081650001702103650002602120650001402146650001302160650001602173650001802189651001002207700002002217700001602237700001702253700001702270700001702287700001602304773012002320856007302440852000902513655001202522IND60715420820221118052047.0201026e20201012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071542082DNAL7 a10.3390/w121028332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Si 10aMultivariate Analysis and Geochemical Signatures of Shallow Groundwater in the Main Urban Area of Chongqing, Southwestern China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHydrogeochemical processes and quality assessment for shallow groundwater are pivotal issues to be solved in many regions over the world due to the easy access of shallow groundwater. In this study, eighty-six water samples were collected from shallow aquifers of Chongqing, China, during July–September 2019. Multivariate statistical techniques, major ion ratios, and geochemical modeling were integrated to investigate hydrogeochemical characteristics and controlling factors. Afterwards, groundwater quality in spatial was classified by entropy-weighted water quality index and geographic information system (GIS) spatial analysis. Groundwater samples were alkaline and possessed high total dissolved solids (TDS) values. Two-group samples were distinguished as mix cations-HCO₃-SO₄ (group 1) and Ca-Mg-SO₄ (group 2) facies. Hydrogeochemical compositions of group 1 samples were dominated by silicate dissolution and ion exchange, while sulfate and calcite dissolution were the main factors influencing the hydrogeochemical characteristics of group 2. The overall quality of groundwater samples varied greatly from excellent quality to extremely poor quality. Group 1 samples were found with excellent and good quality and suitable for drinking purposes. Group 2 samples were all unsuitable for direct drinking purposes as the quality varied from medium to extremely poor, but were spatially limited. Groundwaters with relatively poor quality were due to dissolution of sulfate that were locally enriched in the aquifers. The new findings of this study are expected to provide the reference for future management and sustainable exploitation of groundwater in Chongqing.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcite 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3ahydrogeochemistry 3aion exchange 3amultivariate analysis 3asilicates 3asulfates 3aurban areas 3awater quality 3aChina1 aTang, Zhonghua 1 aWang, Jian 1 aWu, Jialing 1 aYang, Chang 1 aKang, Wulue 1 aHuang, Xun 0 tWater.g2020 Oct. 12, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121028333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001100151245013800162300001400300520136600314592002801680650003401708650002001742650002501762650002601787650002201813650002401835650001801859650000901877653000701886653000901893653000901902653000801911653001101919653000901930653000901939653000801948653001801956653000801974653002201982653001802004653002602022653001602048653000902064653001502073700001502088700001402103700001702117700001402134700001902148700002002167700001402187773010902201856008602310852000902396655001202405IND60530585720221120035235.0180905e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053058572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.07.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Lu10aUPLC-Q-TOF-MSE analysis of the constituents of Ding-Zhi-Xiao-Wan, a traditional Chinese antidepressant, in normal and depressive rats  ap. 36-42.  aDing-Zhi-Xiao-Wan (DZXW) is a traditional Chinese medicine widely used for treating depression. To clarify the bioactive constituents of DZXW, a new rapid ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MSᴱ) method was established in this study, with the whole extract of the formula separated into multiple components to facilitate the analytical process. In total, 97 compounds were detected and 88 were identified in DZXW. Based on their exact masses, fragmentation characteristics, and retention times, 85 of the 88 compounds were confirmed either conclusively or tentatively, and three potentially novel compounds were identified. In addition, following a three-day oral administration of DZXW, 60 and 28 compounds were observed in the plasma of normal and depressive rats, respectively. Finally, by combining our data with pharmacological information, 10 compounds were predicted as the likely bioactive constituents of DZXW as an antidepressant agent. Our approach provided a rapid method for characterising the chemical constituents of DZXW, and we were the first to screen for bioactive indexes in the plasma of depressive rats. Furthermore, our results provide useful chemical information that could be employed for further study of the pharmacodynamic material basis of DZXW's antidepressant effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aantidepressants 3achemical composition 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aoral administration 3arapid methods 3arats 0aCE 0aCUMS 0aDZXW 0aHMG 0ap-CREB 0aCORT 0aACTH 0aCRH 0aUPLC-Q-TOF-MS 0aESI 0aDing-Zhi-Xiao-Wan 0aUPLC-Q-TOF-MS 0aChemical constituents 0aMetabolites 0aCUMS 0aDepression1 aMu, Li-Hua1 aPeng, Jie1 aLiu, Wan-Wan1 aTan, Xiao1 aLi, Zhao-Liang1 aWang, Dong-Xiao1 aLiu, Ping0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 July 15, v. 1026 p.36-42dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.07.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001400197245009800211300001800309506007600327520164000403592002802043506003702071650001402108650002202122650002502144650002102169650002102190650001702211650001302228650001002241650002502251650001802276650002002294650001902314650001502333650000902348650001302357650001602370650002302386650001802409650002102427700001602448700001702464700001802481700002102499700001502520773008602535856009002621852000902711655001202720IND60090291520221207090654.0141102e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009029152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.09.0722doi7 aPMC29926122pmcid7 a209701852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Qiang10aNanofibrous architecture of silk fibroin scaffolds prepared with a mild self-assembly process  ap. 1059-1067.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBesides excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, a useful tissue engineering scaffold should provide suitable macropores and nanofibrous structure, similar to extracellular matrix (ECM), to induce desired cellular activities and to guide tissue regeneration. In the present study, a mild process to prepare porous and nanofibrous silk-based scaffolds from aqueous solution is described. Using collagen to control the self-assembly of silk, nanofibrous silk scaffolds were firstly achieved through lyophilization. Water annealing was used to generate insolubility in the silk-based scaffolds, thereby avoiding the use of organic solvents. The nano-fibrils formed in the silk-collagen scaffolds had diameters of 20–100 nm, similar with native collagen in ECM. The silk-collagen scaffolds dissolved slowly in PBS solution, with about a 28% mass lost after 4 weeks. Following the dissolution or degradation, the nanofibrous structure inside the macropore walls emerged and interacted with cells directly. During in vitro cell culture, the nanofibrous silk-collagen scaffolds containing 7.4% collagen demonstrated significantly improved cell compatibility when compared with salt-leached silk scaffolds and silk-collagen scaffolds containing 20% collagen that emerged less nano-fibrils. Therefore, this new process provides useful scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. Furthermore, the process involves all-aqueous, room temperature and pressure processing without the use of toxic chemicals or solvents, offering new green chemistry approaches, as well as options to load bioactive drugs or growth factors into process.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aannealing 3aaqueous solutions 3abioactive properties 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acell culture 3acollagen 3adrugs 3aextracellular matrix 3afreeze drying 3agreen chemistry 3agrowth factors 3amacropores 3asilk 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atissue engineering 3atissue repair 3atoxic substances1 aWang, Xiuli1 aLu, Shenzhou1 aLi, Mingzhong1 aKaplan, David L.1 aZhu, Hesun0 tBiomaterials.g2011 Feb., v. 32, no. 4 p.1059-1067dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.09.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012500170300001600295520123400311592002801545650001401573650001301587650001601600650001901616650002201635650002501657650002601682650002501708653002501733653002101758653002901779653002101808700002001829700001801849700001901867700002101886773010401907856008402011852000902095655001202104IND60602287420221119132719.0180711e20150702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060228742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2015.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeyras, Laurent10aCharacterization of rock discontinuity openings using acoustic wave amplitude — Application to a metamorphic rock mass  ap. 402-411.  aDetermining discontinuities is a key step in studying rock mass stability, as they represent potentially weak planes. The determination and description of discontinuity openings currently rely on qualitative analysis based on visual inspections of drill cores or drilling logs by engineers. The purpose of this research work is to improve the characterization of discontinuities to ensure easier classification and aid classical manual and visual processing. Quantity-based approaches are suggested using acoustic imaging log data. This method will facilitate sorting the discontinuities in a rock mass according to their openings, by quantitative analysis of drilling log data. Here, a method is proposed to determine discontinuity openings by analyzing acoustic wave amplitudes. The method is based on determining two statistical parameters for each discontinuity: the resulting discontinuity amplitude, which provides the average amplitude value as measured on the discontinuity, and the discontinuity amplitude standard deviation, which determines the extent of scattering of the amplitude values on the discontinuity. The method was applied to a metamorphic rock mass of a Canadian dam foundation at each stage of the study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3adrilling 3aengineering 3aimage analysis 3ametamorphic rocks 3aqualitative analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3astatistical analysis 0aRock discontinuities 0aAcoustic imaging 0aRock mass classification 0aBorehole logging1 aRivard, Patrice1 aBreul, Pierre1 aMillet, Adrien1 aBallivy, Gérard0 tEngineering geology.g2015 July 02, v. 193 p.402-411dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2015.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245010000189300001600289520130500305592002801610650001201638650001301650650001501663650001101678650002201689650001001711650001301721650001301734650001301747650002301760650001401783650001901797650002201816650001401838650003501852650001701887650005801904650002201962650004401984773012202028856008202150852000902232655001202241IND50069620220221118131259.0210610e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006962022DNAL7 a239290882pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-013-9990-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Niftrik, Laura10aCell biology of unique anammox bacteria that contain an energy conserving prokaryotic organelle  ap. 489-497.  aAnammox bacteria obtain their energy for growth from the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium with nitrite to dinitrogen gas. This property has made anammox bacteria very valuable for industry where they are applied for the removal of nitrogen compounds from industrial and domestic wastewaters. Anammox bacteria are also important in nature where they contribute significantly to oceanic nitrogen loss. Further, anammox bacteria have similarities to both Archaea and Eukarya, making them extremely interesting from a cell biological perspective. The anammox cell does not conform to the typical prokaryotic cell plan: single bilayer membranes divide the anammox cell into three distinct cellular compartments that possibly also have distinct cellular functions. The innermost and largest compartment, the anammoxosome, is the location of the energy metabolism. The middle compartment, the riboplasm, contains the nucleoid and ribosomes and thus has a genetic, information processing function. Finally, the outermost compartment, the paryphoplasm, has an as yet unknown function. In addition, anammox bacteria are proposed to have an atypical cell wall devoid of both peptidoglycan and a typical outer membrane. Here, I review the current knowledge on the cell biology of this enigmatic group of bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3abacteria 3acell walls 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3agases 3aindustry 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen compounds 3aoxidation 3apeptidoglycans 3aprokaryotic cells 3aribosomes 2aAmmonium Compoundsxmetabolism 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBacteriaxclassificationxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aOrganellesxmetabolismxultrastructure.0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2013 Oct., v. 104, no. 4 p.489-497dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28287x0003-60727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-013-9990-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015000172300001400322520175600336592002802092650001802120650003102138650001002169650001902179650001702198650001202215650000902227650001502236650001702251650004002268653002102308653002302329653001802352653002702370653001202397653002502409653002302434700002102457700002002478700002102498700002102519700002002540700002402560773012902584856008502713852000902798655001202807IND60565049820221119070839.0180904e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056504982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2017.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShalaby, Sally M.10aCombined Wharton’s jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells and nerve guidance conduit: A potential promising therapy for peripheral nerve injuries  ap. 67-76.  aPeripheral nerve injuries represent a clinical problem with insufficient or unsatisfactory treatment options. Functional outcome with nerve guidance conduits was unsatisfactory in nerve defects with increased gap size. So, cell therapy may benefit as a tool for optimizing the regeneration process. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of combination of cell therapy and nerve guidance conduits on the nerve regeneration and on the expression of the factors aiding the regeneration in a rat model of sciatic nerve injury.Sixty Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: Group I: normal control group; Group II: sciatic nerve injury (SNI) with a 10mm long sciatic nerve gap; Group III: SNI with using a nerve conduit (NC) for nerve gap bridging; and Group IV: SNI with using a NC associated with Wharton’s jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs). The results showed that the combination therapy NC+WJ-MSCs caused much better beneficial effects than NC alone evidenced by increasing sciatic nerve index and pin-prick score. The histopathological analysis found that the use of the NC combined with WJ[HYPHEN]MSCs resulted in a structure of the sciatic nerve comparable to the normal one with better nerve regeneration when compared with NC only. There was no differentiation of WJ-MSCs into nerve structure. Lastly, there was an upregulation of expression for netrin-1, ninjurin, BDNF, GDNF, VEGF and angiopoitin-1 rat genes in NC+WJ-MSCs group than NC alone.The addition of WJ-MSCs to the nerve guidance conduits seems to bring significant advantage for nerve regeneration, basically by increasing the expression of neurotrophic and angiogenic factors establishing more favorable environment for nerve regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahistopathology 3anerve tissue 3aneurons 3arats 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aPeripheral nerve 0aNerve regeneration 0aNerve conduit 0aMesenchymal stem cells 0aWJ-MSCs 0aNeurotrophic factors 0aAngiogenic factors1 aEl-Shal, Amal S.1 aAhmed, Faiza E.1 aShaban, Sahar F.1 aWahdan, Rania A.1 aKandel, Wael A.1 aSenger, Mohammed S.0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2017 May, v. 86 p.67-76dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2017.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01629naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006200170300001800232520049800250592002800748650001900776650002500795650002300820650004400843650001000887650002600897650002100923653001900944653001600963653002300979653002101002700001901023700001701042700001301059773011101072856005101183852000901234655001201243IND50075928720221121111127.0140410e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007592872DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2012.7382082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Zhong-Liu12aA new triterpene saponin from the roots of Ilex pubescens  ap. 1343-1347.  aA new triterpene saponin, ilexoside P (1), along with three known triterpene saponins, ilexoside O (2), ilexsaponin B₃ (3) and ilexpublesnin A (4) was isolated from the roots of Ilex pubescens.

However, detailed characterization of interfacial phenomena within such systems is hampered by their optically opaque nature. Motivated by the need to bridge this capability gap, we report low-magnetic-field two-dimensional (2D) ¹H nuclear spin relaxation measurements as a noninvasive probe of adsorbate identity and interfacial dynamics, exploring the relaxation characteristics exhibited by liquid hydrocarbon adsorbates confined to a model mesoporous silica. For the first time, we demonstrate the capacity of this approach in distinguishing functional group-specific relaxation phenomena across a diverse range of alcohols and carboxylic acids employed as solvents, reagents, and liquid hydrogen carriers, with distinct relaxation responses assigned to the alkyl and hydroxyl moieties of each confined liquid. Uniquely, this relaxation behavior is shown to correlate with adsorbate acidity, with the observed relationship rationalized on the basis of surface–adsorbate proton-exchange dynamics. Our results demonstrate that nuclear spin relaxation provides a molecular-level perspective on sorbent/sorbate interactions, motivating the exploration of such measurements as a unique probe of adsorbate identity within optically opaque porous media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3achemical reactions 3ahydrogen 3aliquids 3aporous media 3asilica 3asorbents 0aadsorption 0aNMR relaxation 0aproton exchange 0alow-field NMR1 aMay, Eric F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5472-69211 aJohns, Michael L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7953-05970 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Nov. 06, v. 13, no. 45 p.54476-54485dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c139343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007600165300001300241500001100254520129200265592002801557650001201585650003001597650001901627650001801646650001101664650001901675650002001694650002001714650001501734650001101749650002601760650000701786650001301793650000901806650001901815650002201834650002801856650002701884650000901911651001001920700002101930773009101951856008102042852000902123655001202132IND60574386620221122235206.0170726e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057438662DNAL7 a10.1007/s40003-016-0236-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinhas, P.

The emerging nutrient deficiencies with mining (8–10 million tonnes of NPK annually) along with acidity (pH < 5.5 in 17.93 M ha), salinity (6.73 M ha) and soil contaminants are the most common chemical stresses. Among the physical stresses, severe soil erosivity (water 82.47 M ha and wind 12.40 M ha), shallow soils (26.4 M ha), soil hardening (21.4 M ha) and low water holding capacity (13.75 M ha) threaten the soil productivity. The soils are inherently low in low organic carbon, and climate change is further impacting the farming systems. Conservative estimates show that about two-third losses in agricultural production are caused by these edaphic factors. Therefore, to alleviate the adverse effects of multiple edaphic factors, a holistic approach to build up systems perspectives is urgently required. The new tools emerging especially in the areas of conservation agriculture, precision irrigation technologies, biotechnology and omic sciences etc., are opening up new opportunities for tackling these stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aagricultural productivity 3aagroecosystems 3abiotechnology 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aedaphic factors 3afarming systems 3airrigation 3amining 3anutrient deficiencies 3apH 3asalinity 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3asoil productivity 3asustainable agriculture 3awater holding capacity 3awind 3aIndia1 aObi Reddy, G.

To produce desirable hybrid seedlings, precise seedling discrimination is essential. However, continuous variations in morphological and phenological traits occur across L. gmelinii var. japonica × L. kaempferi and L. gmelinii var. japonica × L. gmelinii var. japonica seedlings. Therefore, we used DNA markers to verify and improve the morphological and phenological discrimination method. We collected seeds from an interspecific seed orchard and, using chloroplast DNA analysis, we showed that the hybridization rates of 1-year-old seedlings were different between years (2004, 23.2 %; 2005, 53.6 %) and between mother trees (2004, 5.8–39.4 %; 2005, 20.0–81.0 %). Discriminant analyses revealed that the root collar diameter of 2-year-old seedlings, number of sylleptic branches of 2-year-old seedlings, and day of terminal bud set in 1- and 2-year-old seedlings are traits that aid in discriminating hybrid seedlings. The proportions of correctly discriminated individuals were found to be 81.7–88.2 % when using improved phenotypic discrimination methods. These methods adopted traits with high discrimination abilities during discriminant analyses and determined the selection intensity according to the hybridization rate estimated from the DNA markers. In contrast, the proportions of correctly discriminated individuals obtained using the current method were lower, 72.7–78.5 %, because this method was based on seedling height and adopted a constant selection intensity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarix gmelinii var. japonica 3aLarix kaempferi 3aafforestation 3abranches 3achloroplast DNA 3agenetic markers 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3aroot crown 3aseed orchards 3aseed trees 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3aselection intensity 3aJapan 0aDNA marker 0aHybridization rate 0aLarch 0aPhenotypic discrimination 0aSeedling1 aUchiyama, Kazuko1 aIchimura, Yasuhiro1 aMoriguchi, Yoshinari1 aTsumura, Yoshihiko1 aKuromaru, Makoto0 tJournal of forest research.g2014 Oct. 1, v. 19, no. 5 p.461-468dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-014-0438-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01841naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013600169300001800305520078400323592002801107650001601135650003301151650001201184650002101196650001401217650001401231650001701245700001901262700001801281700001701299773009301316856008501409852000901494655001201503IND60098401520221118113023.0141104e20120921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009840152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2012.07.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Shao-Yang10aProgranulin compensates for blocked IGF-1 signaling to promote myotube hypertrophy in C2C12 myoblasts via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway  ap. 3485-3492.  aIt is well known that growth hormone (GH)-induced IGF-1 signaling plays a dominant role in postnatal muscle growth. Our previous studies have identified a growth factor, progranulin (PGRN), that is co-induced with IGF-1 upon GH administration. This result prompted us to explore the function of PGRN and its association with IGF-1. In the present study, we demonstrated that, similar to IGF-1, PGRN can promote C2C12 myotube hypertrophy via the PI(3)K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Moreover, PGRN can rescue the muscle atrophy phenotypes in C2C12 myotube when IGF-1 signaling is blocked. This result shows that PGRN can substitute for IGF-1 signaling in the regulation of muscle growth. Our findings provide new insights into IGF-1-modulated complicated networks that regulate muscle growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahypertrophy 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3amyoblasts 3aphenotype 3asomatotropin1 aTai, Chen-Chen1 aLi, Yen-Hsing1 aWu, Jen-Leih0 tFEBS letters.g2012 Sept. 21, v. 586, no. 19 p.3485-3492dElsevier B.V.x0014-57937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2012.07.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245011100204300001600315500002000331520149100351592002801842650002601870650001701896650001301913650000901926650001501935650001901950650001801969650001601987650001902003650001802022650002302040650002002063651000902083700006302092773013002155856007502285852000902360655001202369IND60777617220221118043732.0220518e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077761722DNAL7 a10.1002/jeq2.203472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRathnayake, Sewwandi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0092-112010aIn situ stabilization of arsenic and lead in contaminated soil using iron‐rich water treatment residuals  ap. 425-438.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aArsenic (As) and lead (Pb) are common soil contaminants, environmentally hazardous, and threats to public health. Addition of soluble phosphate is known to be effective for in situ remediation of Pb‐contaminated soils, but phosphate additions displace As from the soil particles and increase As concentration in soil solution. This study examined the dual use of iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P) amendments to soil that was highly contaminated with As and Pb. The test soil originated from a former smelter site in Utah with As and Pb concentrations of 66,400 mg Pb kg–¹ and 7,520 mg As kg–¹. Goethite, ferrihydrite, and Fe‐rich water treatment residuals (Fe‐WTRs) were added to immobilize As, and soluble P was added to reduce Pb lability. The Fe amendments were added in Fe/As molar ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:10, and P was added in P/Pb molar ratios ranging from 0.2:1 to 5:1. Iron‐rich water treatment residuals were found to be the most effective Fe amendment. When Fe‐WTR and P were added simultaneously, the P concentrations required to immobilize Pb resulted in increased mobilization of As, even when Fe‐WTR were added at 10:1 Fe/As. However, when P was added first at 5:1 P/Pb, incubated for 1 wk, and then amended with Fe‐WTR at 10:1 Fe/As, both Pb and As were significantly immobilized. The proposed process is a practical remediation approach to soils co‐contaminated with Pb and As while encouraging re‐use of Fe‐WTR as a sustainable amendment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental quality 3aferrihydrite 3agoethite 3airon 3aphosphorus 3apolluted soils 3apublic health 3aremediation 3asoil pollution 3asoil solution 3asoluble phosphates 3awater treatment 3aUtah1 aSchwab, Arthur Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0702-68230 tJournal of environmental quality.g2022 May, v. 51, no. 3 p.425-438dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.203473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03649naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100002000191245012600211506007600337506003100413520175900444592002802203596008302231506003702314650002102351650001202372650001502384650001202399650001902411650002702430650001502457650002202472650001302494650001002507650002002517650001502537650001102552650001202563650003502575650002402610650001702634650001302651653002402664653001002688653001702698653001602715700002502731700002402756700002302780773010802803856008502911856004502996961000903041852000903050655001203059IND60708062120221215143329.0201023e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070806212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2020.1087312chorus7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2020.1087312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Evan C.14aThe past, present and future impacts of climate and land use change on snowshoe hares along their southern range boundary  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aChanges in land use and climate are among the main drivers of range shifts for multiple species and taxa. While such distributional changes are often observed at broad scales, the processes driving them – colonization and extinction along range boundaries – occur at local scales. There is a need then, to identify whether these local drivers are consistent with patterns at broader scales. Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), an important prey species in northern forest ecosystems, have experienced range contraction along much of their southern boundary. Population declines are linked to climate change via camouflage mismatch, an inability to match seasonal coat color molts with declining snow cover duration. We used data from camera traps to monitor the spatial extent and habitat associations of hares before, during and after an experimental translocation, and multi-season occupancy models to model the effects of habitat and climate on colonization and extinction patterns. We compared our contemporary occupancy models to historical patterns of extirpation and simulated future effects of timber harvest on occupancy. Colonization by hares was strongly associated with distance from source population and patch size of aspen-alder. Historical patterns of extirpation were consistent with contemporary patterns, and simulations revealed that increased frequency and magnitude of aspen harvest increased hare occupancy by creating large patches of early-successional habitat. As global change alters ecological communities, identifying mechanisms that drive range-shifts and targeting landscape features that can be manipulated to buffer those effects can be used to promote the persistence of individual species and ecological communities.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLepus americanus 3acameras 3acamouflage 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecological communities 3aextinction 3aforest ecosystems 3ahabitats 3ahares 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amolting 3anatural resources conservation 3apopulation dynamics 3aprey species 3asnowpack 0aCamouflage mismatch 0aAspen 0aColonization 0aRange shift1 aZuckerberg, Benjamin1 aPeery, M.

PCBHU was synthesized via the condensation polymerization of diisocyanate with carboxybetaine (CB)-based triols. Postpolymerization hydrolysis of triol segments at the interface generates zwitterionic CB functional groups that provide superior antifouling properties via the enhanced hydration capacities of CB groups. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry measurement show the high thermal stability of PCBHU with up to 305 °C degradation temperature. Tunable mechanical properties and water uptakes can be finely tuned by controlling the structure and ratio of CB-based triol cross-linkers. This study presents a new strategy to incorporate CB functional groups into PU without significantly changing the synthetic methods and conditions of PU. It also provides a deeper understanding on structure–property relationships of zwitterionic PUs. Because of its superior antifouling properties than existing PUs and similar cost, mechanical properties, stability, and processability, PCBHU has the great potential to replace current PUs and may open a new avenue to PUs for more challenging biomedical applications in which the existing PUs are limited by calcification and poor antifouling properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantifouling activities 3abiocompatibility 3acalcification 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3ahydrolysis 3amechanical properties 3amoieties 3apolymerization 3apolyurethanes 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3aurethane 3azwitterions 0azwitterionic 0acarboxybetaine 0apolyurethane 0adual function 0aantifouling surface 0aelastomer1 aHu, Yang1 aLynch, Dylan1 aYoung, Megan1 aLi, Shengxi1 aCong, Hongbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5263-66231 aXu, Fu-Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1838-88111 aCheng, Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7170-89680 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Oct. 18, v. 10, no. 43 p.37609-37617dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b104503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011800166300001600284520162200300592002801922650001401950650002601964650001701990650002902007650002502036650001302061650001302074650001702087650004302104650001502147650002502162650001302187650003702200650001902237650001402256650001002270650002302280650001102303650001102314653002702325653002502352653001502377653001402392700001702406700001802423700001702441700006002458700001502518700001902533700002002552773011302572856008602685852000902771655001202780IND50070668220221118102827.0190408e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007066822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2013.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSartor, T.10aSeasonal changes in phenolic compounds and in the biological activities of Baccharis dentata (Vell.) G.M. Barroso  ap. 355-359.  aBaccharis, a large genus of Asteraceae, has been extensively studied because of the medicinal properties of its species. The present study determined the seasonal variation of the levels of total phenolic compounds and flavonoids of Baccharis dentata, and determined the antioxidant and bactericidal potential of the plant extracts. Aerial parts of B. dentata were harvested during the seasons of 1 year. Samples of 0.1g dry mass (DM) were extracted with aqueous methanol (80%; v/v), and used for quantification of phenolic compounds, quercetin-derived flavonoids and antioxidant activity (DPPH). Caffeic acid and the flavonoids rutin, quercetin, apigenin and kaempferol were quantified in methanolic extracts (0.5g DM) by HPLC. The micro-dilution method was applied for the determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of selected bacteria strains. Concentrations of total phenolic compounds and flavonoids showed significant seasonal variation, and the antioxidant potential of extracts was related to the concentration of these compounds. Highest antioxidant activity was detected in the extracts from summer and winter plants. Concentrations of quercetin, kaempferol and apigenin were markedly higher in spring and summer plants when compared to the other seasons. This result may be related to the antibacterial activity of n-butanolic and aqueous fractions against Staphylococcus aureus. This is the first report on seasonal changes of secondary compounds and biological activities on B. dentata and might be useful to prospection of novel molecules with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaccharis 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aaerial parts 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aapigenin 3abacteria 3acaffeic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3akaempferol 3amedicinal properties 3amethanol 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aplant extracts 3aquercetin 3arutin 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aAntioxidant activity 0aFlavonoids 0aQuercetin1 aXavier, V.B.1 aFalcão, M.A.1 aMondin, C.A.1 ados Santos, M.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3915-82141 aCassel, E.1 aAstarita, L.V.1 aSantarém, E.R.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2013 Nov., v. 51 p.355-359dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2013.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245011400177300001400291520120700305592002801512650001601540650002601556650002001582650001601602650002201618650001901640650002101659650001701680650001901697650001401716650001801730650001901748653001701767653003201784653002901816653003001845653002901875653002201904700001901926700002101945700002601966700002301992700002502015700002002040700002202060700002002082773009102102856009002193852000902283655001202292IND60593010420221120122136.0180414e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059301042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.03.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAskes, Sven H.C.10aDynamics of dual-fluorescent polymersomes with durable integrity in living cancer cells and zebrafish embryos  ap. 54-63.  aThe long-term fate of biomedical nanoparticles after endocytosis is often only sparsely addressed in vitro and in vivo, while this is a crucial parameter to conclude on their utility. In this study, dual-fluorescent polyisobutylene-polyethylene glycol (PiB-PEG) polymersomes were studied for several days in vitro and in vivo. In order to optically track the vesicles' integrity, one fluorescent probe was located in the membrane and the other in the aqueous interior compartment. These non-toxic nanovesicles were quickly endocytosed in living A549 lung carcinoma cells but unusually slowly transported to perinuclear lysosomal compartments, where they remained intact and luminescent for at least 90 h without being exocytosed. Fluorescence-assisted flow cytometry indicated that after endocytosis, the nanovesicles were eventually degraded within 7–11 days. In zebrafish embryos, the polymersomes caused no lethality and were quickly taken up by the endothelial cells, where they remained fully intact for as long as 96 h post-injection. This work represents a novel case-study of the remarkable potential of PiB-PEG polymersomes as an in vivo bio-imaging and slow drug delivery platform.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3adrug delivery systems 3aembryo (animal) 3aendocytosis 3aendothelial cells 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescent dyes 3aluminescence 3alung neoplasms 3amortality 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 0aNanovesicles 0aAmphiphilic block copolymer 0aNanoparticle degradation 0aIntracellular trafficking 0aFluorescence bio-imaging 0aZebrafish embryos1 aBossert, Nelli1 aBussmann, Jeroen1 aTalens, Victorio Saez1 aMeijer, Michael S.1 aKieltyka, Roxanne E.1 aKros, Alexander1 aBonnet, Sylvestre1 aHeinrich, Doris0 tBiomaterials.g2018 June, v. 168 p.54-63dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.03.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02006naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245011100155300001600266520078800282592002801070650001801098650001101116650000901127650001001136650004001146650001601186650002901202650001601231650002001247650001601267650002101283653002301304653001801327653000901345653001401354700001601368773013101384856007201515852000901587655001201596IND60706356520221119081235.0200807e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070635652DNAL7 a10.18805/LR-40322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Kuljit10aSolar radiation use efficiency of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.) in relation to crop geometry and varieties  ap. 298-300.  aPulses are integral part of Indians diet so there is significant need to improve the productivity of pulses for their per capita availability.

Similarly, determinate variety AL 15 performed significantly better than indeterminate variety PAU 881 in yield contributing components, yield and radiation use efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCajanus cajan 3acanopy 3adiet 3afarms 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3apigeon peas 3aradiation use efficiency 3arow spacing 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3ayield components 0aCanopy temperature 0aCrop geometry 0aPARI 0aVarieties1 aSaini, K.S.0 tLegume research.g2020 Apr., v. 43, no. 2 p.298-300dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:1999x0976-05717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/LR-40323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245013200177520114500309592002801454650001601482650001801498650001901516650001101535650001201546650001801558650000701576650001801583653001701601653001301618653001101631653001801642653003201660653001601692700001901708773011801727856008601845852000901931655001201940IND60777205720221118055142.0220726e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077720572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1150842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFitzgerald, Carter L.10aContinuous recovery of high-purity Kraft lignin from black liquor via simultaneous, liquid-phase acidification and purification  aA key advantage of the Sequential Liquid-Lignin Recovery and Purification (SLRP) process for the recovery of lignin from Kraft black liquor is the precipitation of a solvated, “liquid-lignin” phase (vs. the typical solid) during the CO₂ acidification step. Here, we have discovered that this lignin can also be maintained in a solvated state during the H₂SO₄ acidification step if aqueous acetic acid from the Aqueous Lignin Purification with Hot Agents (ALPHA) process is incorporated into the H₂SO₄ solution. As the liquid-lignin is converted from its salt form at pH = 9.5 to its acid form at pH = 2.5, the lignin initially solvated with water becomes solvated and thus liquefied with the acetic acid–water solution. Maintaining the lignin in a solvated liquid state has two advantages: (1) the entire SLRP + ALPHA process, from starting black liquor to final lignin product, can be operated continuously; and (2) mass transfer of metals impurities out of the liquid-lignin phase is significantly enhanced, resulting in both a cleaner Kraft lignin product (∼2000 ppm Na and 0.5–1.0% ash) and reduced water washing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aacidification 3acarbon dioxide 3alignin 3aliquids 3amass transfer 3apH 3awaste liquors 0aBlack liquor 0aRecovery 0aLignin 0aLiquid-lignin 0aLiquid–liquid equilibrium 0aAcetic acid1 aThies, Mark C.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 184 p.115084-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1150843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010600156300001800262500002000280500001500300520125600315592002801571650002001599650001001619650001401629650001101643650001301654650003101667650002401698650001701722650001201739650001601751650003301767650001801800650002001818650002001838650001801858653001701876700001801893700001701911700001801928700001601946700001601962773013001978856007302108852000902181655001202190IND60521963020221122073158.0160531e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052196302DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.75082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chong10aEffects of recombinant lipoxygenase on the rheological properties of dough and the quality of noodles  ap. 3249-3255.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: The effects of purified recombinant lipoxygenase (ana‐rLOX) on the rheological properties of dough and the quality of noodles made from wheat flour with low protein content (Yanmai 15) were studied. RESULTS: The addition of ana‐rLOX increased dough stability time, decreased the degree of softening within 12 min, enhanced the resistance to extension, and increased the extensibility with 135 min of resting time. The mechanical spectra of the dough showed an increase in both storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) with increasing ana‐rLOX levels. The L* values of the noodle sheets increased by 2.34 compared with the control after storing for 1 h at room temperature. The textural parameters of noodles improved after ana‐rLOX addition, including hardness, gumminess, chewiness and springiness. The wheat flour treated with the ana‐rLOX had a higher cooking yield and lower cooking loss for the resulting noodles. The scanning electron microscopy results revealed that gluten was formed in the noodle samples that were treated with ana‐rLOX. CONCLUSION: In this study, ana‐rLOX was applied to noodles during the noodle‐making process, and both dough rheological characteristics and noodle quality were improved.   aPublisher supplied data 3astorage modulus 3adough 3achewiness 3agluten 3ahardness 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aambient temperature 3aloss modulus 3anoodles 3awheat flour 3ascanning electron microscopy 3adough quality 3aprotein content 3acooking quality 3aextensibility 0alipoxygenase1 aZhang, Shuang1 aBie, Xiaomei1 aZhao, Haizhen1 aLu, Fengxia1 aLu, Zhaoxin0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2016 July, v. 96, no. 9 p.3249-3255dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.75083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02021naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007400165300001600239500001100255520100900266592002801275650002001303650001901323650002001342650002201362650001801384650001401402650001301416700001401429700002101443773012901464856008101593852000901674655001201683IND60574387120221122121446.0170726e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057438712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-016-2317-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Michael10aMolecular mechanisms involved in dendritic cell dysfunction in cancer  ap. 761-776.  aReview  aDendritic cells (DC) play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment (TME). As the primary antigen-presenting cells in the tumor, DCs modulate anti-tumor responses by regulating the magnitude and duration of infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses. Unfortunately, due to the immunosuppressive nature of the TME, as well as the inherent plasticity of DCs, tumor DCs are often dysfunctional, a phenomenon that contributes to immune evasion. Recent progresses in our understanding of tumor DC biology have revealed potential molecular targets that allow us to improve tumor DC immunogenicity and cancer immunotherapy. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms that drive tumor DC dysfunction. We discuss recent advances in our understanding of tumor DC ontogeny, tumor DC subset heterogeneity, and factors in the tumor microenvironment that affect DC recruitment, differentiation, and function. Finally, we describe potential strategies to optimize tumor DC function in the context of cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3adendritic cells 3aimmune evasion 3aimmune response 3aimmunosuppression 3aimmunotherapy 3aneoplasms 3aontogeny1 aDiao, Jun1 aCattral, Mark S.0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2017 Mar., v. 74, no. 5 p.761-776dSpringer International Publishingx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-016-2317-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02134naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010000168300001600268520115600284592002801440650001101468650001201479650001301491650001501504650001401519650001901533650003001552650001701582650001201599651001001611773008501621856008101706852000901787655001201796IND60081493120221119110006.0150217e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008149312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10708-013-9514-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanle, Augustine10aAssessing livelihood status of migrants from northern Ghana resident in the Obuasi Municipality  ap. 577-590.  aIn Ghana, studies on migration and livelihoods are mostly limited to migrants’ places of origin. This paper therefore assesses livelihood status of permanent migrants resident in the Obuasi Municipality who hail from the northern parts of Ghana. The instrument used was a survey questionnaire and the respondents were both migrants and indigenes aged 18 years and above. The findings showed no significant differences between migrants and indigenes in ownership of assets and consumer durable goods and housing quality. However, the indigenes earned relatively higher than the migrants due to access to various forms of capital and the influence of institutional structures and processes. But to the migrants, their livelihood status has improved since they have built houses, educated their children, remitted relations at home and have acquired some consumer durable goods. Improvement in the livelihood status of migrants could induce further north–south migration. There is therefore the need for government and other stakeholders to bridge the gap of unequal socio-economic development between the northern and southern parts of the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3acapital 3achildren 3alivelihood 3aownership 3aquestionnaires 3asocioeconomic development 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3aGhana0 tGeoJournal.g2014 Oct., v. 79, no. 5 p.577-590dSpringer-Verlagx0343-25217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-013-9514-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04310naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001300148245011800161300001300279520273400292592002803026650001603054650001303070650003103083650001003114650001703124650002003141650002203161650002603183650001403209650001203223650001503235650002203250650001303272650001203285650001303297650001703310650002203327650002503349650001503374650001003389650001203399650001803411650001503429650001603444650001003460650001303470700001603483700001703499700001603516700001203532773009503544856008403639852000903723655001203732IND4472796920221120213929.0141111e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447279692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2012.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, B.10aChanges in vegetative communities and water table dynamics following timber harvesting in small headwater streams  ap. 1-11.  aIn order to better understand the relationship between vegetation communities and water table in the uppermost portions (ephemeral–intermittent streams) of headwater systems, seasonal plot-based field characterizations of vegetation were used in conjunction with monthly water table measurements. Vegetation, soils, and water table data were examined to determine potential indicator species of near-surface water that could be used in rapid delineation of Streamside Management Zones (SMZs) by forest managers. Twelve watersheds were instrumented with three hundred screened wells, installed in grids of 25 per sub-watershed. Well locations were used to monitor water table and vegetation communities. Species were classified according to their wetland indicator status for Region 2; communities were evaluated using a prevalence index (PI). As part of a larger study, the uppermost reaches of the headwater systems were treated one of four treatments: (1) removal of all merchantable stems leaving understory intact with minimum surface soil disturbance (BMP1), (2) the same as treatment BMP1with the addition of logging debris in the drainage channel (BMP2), (3) total harvest with no BMPs applied (clearcut) and (4) no harvest (reference). Post-harvest increases in water table ranged from 1.6cm in BMP1 to 28.2cm in clearcut treatments during 2008, from 10.5cm in BMP1 to 54.2cm in BMP2 during 2009. PI differed significantly between channel and hillslope positions and represent distinctive vegetation communities. Forest clearcutting affected vegetation communities through combined direct and indirect disturbances. PI in the clearcut did not respond directly to changes in water table. In the two treatments where BMPs were employed, changes in vegetative communities corresponded to both changes in water table and changes in the microclimate as a result of harvesting intensity and changing stand heterogeneity. A vegetative indicator analysis, based on the presence of saturated soil conditions and water table elevation, was used to determine potential indicators of the true hydrologic boundaries of the headwater streams. Three potential indicator species (Viola blanda, Ludwigia glandulosa, and Arundinaria gigantean Ssp. Tecta) were more prevalent within “wet” channel positions but exhibited less total frequency of occurrence across the study areas than the fern species Polystichum acrostichoides, which is locally used for rapid estimation of intermittent stream extent). The combined use of the strong indicator species identified in this study and the “fern line” used by local industry foresters provides a means for rapid assessment of hydrologically functional SMZs in these headwater streams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArundinaria 3aLudwigia 3aPolystichum acrostichoides 3aViola 3aclearcutting 3adisturbed soils 3adrainage channels 3aferns and fern allies 3aforesters 3aforests 3aharvesting 3aindicator species 3aindustry 3alogging 3amanagers 3amicroclimate 3aplant communities 3asaturated conditions 3asoil water 3astems 3astreams 3asubwatersheds 3aunderstory 3awater table 3awells 3awetlands1 aDewey, J.C.1 aHatten, J.A.1 aEzell, A.W.1 aFan, Z.0 tForest ecology and management.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 281 p.1-11dElsevier B.V.x0378-11277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2012.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011900166300002000285520158600305592002801891596006701919650001501986650001502001650001502016650002502031650001702056650001402073650001102087650001402098650001302112650002302125650001302148700001802161700001702179700001502196700002802211773015402239856008302393852000902476655001202485IND60765710720221118163637.0220319e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076571072DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14937-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Po-Hsun10aShape stable poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels with immobilized metal hexacyanoferrates for cesium removal from waters  ap. 12427-12433.  aThe metal hexacyanoferrates with transition metal ions to replace ferric ions in the face center cubic structure of Prussian blue (PB) crystals are candidate adsorbents for radioactive cesium ions in waters. This study for the first time synthesized the shape stable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels with immobilized metal hexacynoferrate (PB analogue) that can be stored at dry and can efficiently adsorb cesium ions from waters after rewetting. A total of eight PB analogue particles in two families M₃[Fe(III)(CN)₆]₂ (MFe(III)) or M₄[Fe(II)(CN)₆]₂ (MFe(II)) with M=Zn, Ni, Cu, or Co were synthesized and were immobilized in the PVA hydrogels following boric acid and sulfate crosslinking. The produced PVA-PB analogue hydrogels are all stable in shape after dry and rewet, and the rewet hydrogels can adsorb cesium ions from waters at much higher rates. As predicted by the diffusion-reaction model, the apparent reaction constants for cesium ion adsorption are 4.2×10⁻⁴ 1/s, 3.4×10⁻⁴ 1/s, 3.9×10⁻⁴ 1/s, 4.1×10⁻⁴ 1/s, 4.1×10⁻⁴ 1/s, 3.8×10⁻⁴ 1/s, 1.1×10⁻³ 1/s, and 9.6×10⁻⁴ 1/s, for ZnFe(III), ZnFe(II), NiFe(III), NiFe(II), CuFe(III), CuFe(II), CoFe(III), and CoFe(II), respectively. The corresponding maximum adsorption capacities based on Langmuir isotherm model at 25 °C are 232.6 mg/g, 389.0 mg/g, 193.9 mg/g, 256.8 mg/g, 388.2 mg/g, 395.1 mg/g, 297.3 mg/g, and 391.2 mg/g, respectively. The use of PVA-CoFe(III) is the candidate for enhanced Cs removal from waters comparing the use of other PB analogues as adsorbent.  aPublisher supplied data  a106-2221-E-002-236cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aboric acid 3acesium radioisotopes 3acrosslinking 3ahydrogels 3amodels 3apollution 3aresearch 3asorption isotherms 3asulfates1 aChang, Yin-Ru1 aChen, Man-Li1 aLo, Yu-Kuo1 aLee, D.

Missense mutation (L98P) of proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 2 (Pstpip2) in mice leads to a disease that is phenotypically similar to CRMO called chronic multifocal osteomyelitis (cmo). Here we show that deficiency of IL-1RI in cmo mice resulted in a significant reduction in the time to onset of disease as well as the degree of bone pathology. Additionally, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β, but not IL-1α, played a critical role in the pathology observed in cmo mice. In contrast, disease in cmo mice was found to be independent of the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome as well as caspase-1. Neutrophils, but not bone marrow-derived macrophages, from cmo mice secreted increased IL-1β in response to ATP, silica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared with neutrophils from WT mice. This aberrant neutrophil response was sensitive to inhibition by serine protease inhibitors. These results demonstrate an inflammasome-independent role for IL-1β in disease progression of cmo and implicate neutrophils and neutrophil serine proteases in disease pathogenesis. These data provide a rationale for directly targeting IL-1RI or IL-1β as a therapeutic strategy in CRMO.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acaspase-1 3adisease course 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-1alpha 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amacrophages 3amice 3amissense mutation 3aneutrophils 3aosteomyelitis 3apathogenesis 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aserine proteinases 3asilica 0achronic osteomyelitis 0ainnate immunity1 aJanczy, John R.1 aBing, Xinyu1 aWilson, Shruti P.1 aOlivier, Alicia K.1 aOtero, Jesse E.1 aIwakura, Yoichiro1 aShayakhmetov, Dmitry M.1 aBassuk, Alexander G.1 aAbu-Amer, Yousef1 aBrogden, Kim A.1 aBurns, Trudy L.1 aSutterwala, Fayyaz S.1 aFerguson, Polly J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Jan. 21, v. 111, no. 3 p.1072-1077dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13186851113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009900161300001600260520175000276592002802026650001202054650002302066650000802089650001002097650001402107650001602121650001902137650001502156650001202171650001802183650002502201650002202226651001102248653001302259653002302272653001502295653000902310653002502319653001102344700001602355700001502371700001702386773009902403856008102502852000902583655001202592IND60563190320221119104225.0170719e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056319032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2015.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, H.10aLake ice phenology from AVHRR data for European lakes: An automated two-step extraction method  ap. 329-340.  aSeveral lake ice phenology studies from satellite data have been undertaken. However, the availability of long-term lake freeze-thaw-cycles, required to understand this proxy for climate variability and change, is scarce for European lakes. Long time series from space observations are limited to few satellite sensors. Data of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) are used in account of their unique potential as they offer each day global coverage from the early 1980s expectedly until 2022. An automatic two-step extraction was developed, which makes use of near-infrared reflectance values and thermal infrared derived lake surface water temperatures to extract lake ice phenology dates. In contrast to other studies utilizing thermal infrared, the thresholds are derived from the data itself, making it unnecessary to define arbitrary or lake specific thresholds. Two lakes in the Baltic region and a steppe lake on the Austrian–Hungarian border were selected. The later one was used to test the applicability of the approach to another climatic region for the time period 1990 to 2012. A comparison of the extracted event dates with in situ data provided good agreements of about 10d mean absolute error. The two-step extraction was found to be applicable for European lakes in different climate regions and could fill existing data gaps in future applications. The extension of the time series to the full AVHRR record length (early 1980 until today) with adequate length for trend estimations would be of interest to assess climate variability and change. Furthermore, the two-step extraction itself is not sensor-specific and could be applied to other sensors with equivalent near- and thermal infrared spectral bands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3aice 3alakes 3aphenology 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asteppes 3asurface water 3atime series analysis 3awater temperature 3aEurope 0aLake ice 0aLake ice phenology 0aAVHRR data 0aLSWT 0aNIR and TIR approach 0aEurope1 aRiffler, M.1 aNõges, T.1 aWunderle, S.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 174 p.329-340dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013200167520177900299592002802078650001902106650002102125650001202146650001902158650002302177650001202200650001302212650002302225650002002248650001502268650002202283650001902305650002002324650002002344650003302364650001802397650001702415650001902432650001402451650000902465653001202474653002602486653002102512653001802533653001702551700002202568700001402590700001602604700001802620700001802638700002202656700002102678700001702699700001702716773010602733856008502839852000902924655001202933IND60777206020221118054958.0220614e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077720602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.1045262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBastos, A.C.10aScreening the habitat function of biochar-amended vineyard soils at field plot-scale, based on invertebrate avoidance behaviour  aThere is an urge for rapid, cost-effective and ecologically representative tools that inform on possible changes in habitat function of biochar-amended soils, at representative spatial and temporal scales. We employed a battery of invertebrate avoidance behaviour tests to screen and biomonitor a vineyard soil amended with a premium grade mixed-wood chip biochar (applied alone or mixed with compost) at plot–scale, at 4 or 40 t ha⁻¹, over 12 months. The assays combined representative organisms with complementary ecological functions in agroecosystems, i.e. earthworms (Eisenia andrei), collembolans (Folsomia candida) and isopods (Porcellionides pruinosus). In all treatments, soil habitat function was within the recommended limits for the selected invertebrate groups, by the corresponding soil quality guideline or protocol. However, collembolans exhibited significant avoidance behaviour from 6-month aged biochar treatments, coinciding with a strong peak in soil electrical conductivity (EC), suggestive of osmotic stress. Earthworms responded less sensitively than collembolans, with isopods being the least sensitive group to biochar amendments. Further, there was a preference by isopods for freshly-amended soil, whereas earthworms and collembolans preferred 12-month aged biochar amended soil, both of which can be explained, at least partly, by nutrient inputs. Overall, results show that invertebrate avoidance behaviour, based on multiple test groups, can be used to screen and complement site-specific biochar risk assessment strategies, for early decision-making and management. For screening batteries of mixed wood biochars, this study further supports the combined use of collembolans and earthworms, with isopods as a complementary test group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEisenia andrei 3aFolsomia candida 3aIsopoda 3aagroecosystems 3aavoidance behavior 3abiochar 3acomposts 3acost effectiveness 3adecision making 3aguidelines 3aindicator species 3aosmotic stress 3arisk assessment 3asoil amendments 3asoil electrical conductivity 3asoil habitats 3asoil quality 3avineyard soils 3avineyards 3awood 0aBiochar 0aEdaphic invertebrates 0aAvoidance assays 0aBiomonitoring 0aSoil quality1 aVerheijen, F.G.A.1 aAmaro, A.1 aProdana, M.1 aCardoso, D.N.1 aMorgado, R.G.1 aSantos, Miguel J.1 aSoares, A.M.V.M.1 aKeizer, J.J.1 aLoureiro, S.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2022 Sept., v. 177 p.104526-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.1045263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245009200131300001600223520207600239592002802315650001802343650002702361650001402388650000902402650000902411650001002420650002402430650001502454650002302469650001102492650002502503650002002528650001302548651001302561653002902574653001602603653002002619653001902639653001002658653002702668653002102695700002102716700002202737773011402759852000902873655001202882IND60613669320221120234153.0180914e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061366932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalb, David M.10aDietary resource use and competition between white-tailed deer and introduced sika deer  ap. 457-472.  aContent. Native communities of herbivores have evolved fundamental dietary niches that avoid or minimise competition; the introduction of exotic species can change dietary niches, cause overlap in resource use, and result in competition for resources. Aims. We compared niche breadth, overlap in diet, and quality of diet between introduced sika deer and native white-tailed deer in Maryland, USA. We investigated these changes in free-ranging populations where both species are allopatric as well as when they are sympatric. Methods. We used microhistological analysis of faecal samples to determine the percentage of resources used by sika deer and white-tailed deer, as measured between geographical areas of similar habitat quality. We compared resource use specifically by controlling for harvest pressure and resource availability, which are known to alter resource use other than the presence of an additional deer species. Key results. We observed a significant resource overlap (range 63–88%) between species. In the presence of sika deer, white-tailed deer displayed an increased niche breadth (108%) and a lower diet quality (17%). Sika deer consumed the same resources that comprised 78% of white-tailed deer diet. Unlike other native ungulates that have dietary overlap with white-tailed deer, sika deer is neither temporally nor geographically segregated in habitat use. Conclusions. Resource overlap and changes in niche breadth and diet quality during sympatry strongly denote dietary competition between sika deer and white-tailed deer. This competition results in white-tailed deer altering the dietary selection, thereby consuming lower-quality forage. Implications. White-tailed deer are concentrate selectors and require higher diet quality than do sika deer, which can tolerate diets higher in fibre, consistent with their classification as intermediate feeders. A decrease in the nutritional quality of resources used by white-tailed deer could contribute to the decline of white-tailed deer over time and allow the continued spread of sika deer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus nippon 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aallopatry 3adeer 3adiet 3afeces 3ahabitat preferences 3aherbivores 3aintroduced species 3aniches 3anutritional adequacy 3anutritive value 3asympatry 3aMaryland 0aCervus nippon yakushimae 0acompetition 0adietary overlap 0aexotic species 0aniche 0aOdocoileus virginianus 0aresource quality1 aBowman, Jacob L.1 aDeYoung, Randy W.0 tWildlife research.g2018 Sept., v. 45, no. 5 p.457-472dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957321x1448-54947nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245017300206300001800379500001900397520134100416592002801757596004501785596005701830650002501887650001201912650001501924650001101939650001401950650001701964650001901981651001402000651002202014700002102036700001902057700001902076700002102095700002002116773010802136856008202244852000902326655001202335IND60714692020221118023323.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071469202DNAL7 a10.1007/s13157-020-01307-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnight, Ian A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2231-134710aInvestigating Plant Phenotype, Salinity, and Infestation by the Roseau Cane Scale as Factors in the Die-Back of Phragmites australis in the Mississippi River Delta, USA  ap. 1327-1337.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDie-back of Phragmites australis in the Mississippi River Delta (MRD), Louisiana, USA, is associated with large populations of nonnative Roseau Cane Scale (RCS), Nipponaclerda biwakoensis. Initial observations suggested different P. australis phenotypes displayed different susceptibilities to scale infestation and die-back, but the role of scale infestation on die-back was unknown. To understand the effect of RCS on P. australis, paired stands of Delta and European phenotypes in the MRD were monitored for stem heights, densities, and scale infestation over two years. A mesocosm experiment was conducted to assess whether RCS abundance and P. australis growth were dependent on water salinity and phenotype. Three Phragmites australis phenotypes were grown in small pools under fresh or mesohaline conditions, and RCS infestated or non-infested treatments. Scale densities were up to 7 times greater on the Delta compared to the European phenotype. Scale infestation resulted in 22%–39% reductions in the proportion of stems with green leaf tissue for all phenotypes, and 12% reduction in stem heights for Delta-type. Salinity was detrimental to all phenotypes, reducing stem heights by 20% compared to freshwater. Our results provide evidence that the RCS can result in die-back symptoms similar to what is observed in the MRD.  aPublisher supplied data  aDMS-1516833cNational Science Foundation  aLAB94095cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aPhragmites australis 3adieback 3afreshwater 3aleaves 3aphenotype 3ariver deltas 3awater salinity 3aLouisiana 3aMississippi River1 aCronin, James T.1 aGill, Madeline1 aNyman, John A.1 aWilson, Blake E.1 aDíaz, Rodrigo,0 tWetlands.g2020 Oct., v. 40, no. 5 p.1327-1337dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl57834x0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-020-01307-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013700169300001600306520146600322592002801788650001501816650001101831650002301842650001901865650001501884650003001899653002001929653003201949653002901981653002902010653003302039653002802072653001902100700001902119700001902138773009902157856008102256852000902337655001202346IND60563190420221119104310.0170719e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056319042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2015.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoner, Prabhat K.10aHybrid cloud and error masking to improve the quality of deterministic satellite sea surface temperature retrieval and data coverage  ap. 266-278.  aIn the infrared region, the quality of sea surface temperature (SST) retrievals critically depends on the cloud detection scheme. More than 5 million matchups, where the surface and top of atmosphere measurements are available, have been carefully analyzed to understand clouds related errors and to develop the advanced cloud detection scheme for improvement of satellite SST quality. The effectiveness of a Bayesian cloud detection (BCD) scheme, operationally implemented at the NOAA Office of Satellite Product Operations (OSPO) for the GOES-Imager, has been examined using an experimental filter and it is found that this scheme is not optimal. Thus, a new algorithm for cloud and error masking (CEM) scheme is proposed for physical SST retrievals. This is based on a quasi-deterministic approach combined with an approximated radiative transfer model and the functional spectral differences at pixel level. Although, traditionally the validation of cloud detection algorithms have often been reported qualitatively using visual inspection of imagery, we have made a quantitative validation of the cloud algorithm for its intended purpose by determining the quality of satellite SST retrievals against in situ data. Results show that CEM can reduce the root mean square error in SST by an average of 22% while increasing the data coverage by an average of 38% compared to the operationally implemented BCD at OSPO, as assessed over a period of fifty months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3amodels 3aradiative transfer 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asurface water temperature 0aCloud detection 0aSpectral differences method 0aRadiative transfer model 0aBayesian cloud detection 0aModified total least squares 0aSea surface temperature 0aGOES-13 imager1 aHarris, Andrew1 aMaturi, Eileen0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 174 p.266-278dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012600170300001800296520074500314592002801059650001401087650002001101650001701121650001101138650002901149650002601178650003101204700001901235700001701254700001701271700001901288700001801307700001501325700001901340700001701359700001901376700001801395773009301413856008501506852000901591655001201600IND60098402220221118113132.0141104e20120921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009840222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2012.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Sung-Won10aRegulation of human growth and differentiation factor 3 gene expression by NANOG in human embryonic carcinoma NCCIT cells  ap. 3529-3535.  aWe investigated transactivation by NANOG in regulating growth and differentiation factor 3 (GDF3) expression in NCCIT cells. GDF3 expression was affected by shRNA-mediated downregulation and by exogenous overexpression of NANOG specifically, as well as by retinoic acid-mediated differentiation. GDF3 transcription was activated by NANOG, and the upstream region (−183 to −1) was sufficient to induce minimal transcriptional activity. Moreover, NANOG binds to the GDF3 minimal promoter in vivo and the transcriptional activity is mediated by NANOG transactivation domain. This study provides the first evidence that NANOG is a transcriptional activator of the expression of the oncogenic growth factor GDF3 in embryonic carcinoma cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinoma 3agene expression 3ahuman growth 3ahumans 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation1 aLim, Hye-Young1 aDo, Hyun-Jin1 aSung, BoReum1 aHuh, Sun-Hyung1 aUhm, Sang-Jun1 aSong, Hyuk1 aChung, Hak-Jae1 aKim, Jin-Hoi1 aKim, Nam-Hyung1 aKim, Jae-Hwan0 tFEBS letters.g2012 Sept. 21, v. 586, no. 19 p.3529-3535dElsevier B.V.x0014-57937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2012.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03881naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245015700133300001600290520244600306592002802752650001502780650002902795650002602824650001802850650000902868650001202877650001002889650002402899650001002923650001202933650001202945650001502957650001502972650001202987650001302999650002503012650002203037650001003059650003203069653001003101653000903111653001003120653001803130653001203148653001603160653001603176700001703192700001903209773011403228852000903342655001203351IND60613669420221120224415.0180914e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061366942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonsalves, Leroy10aExperimental evaluation of the initial effects of large-scale thinning on structure and biodiversity of river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) forests  ap. 397-410.  aContext. Multi-use management of global forests has seen even-aged, high-stem density regrowth represent >50% of the world’s forest cover. Large areas of river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) forests have declined in ecological condition. Thinning has been promoted as a tool to reduce competition in dense, young stands of E. camaldulensis regrowth, yet responses of forest structure and fauna to large-scale thinning are largely unclear. Aims. To establish a before-after-control-impact experiment to assess responses of forest structure and fauna to large-scale (compartment-level; ∼440 ha) silvicultural thinning. Methods. We measured immediate (<2 yrs) responses of forest structural components (living, dead and hollow-bearing stem densities, coarse woody debris (CWD) density and volumes and ground cover) and components of biodiversity (bats, birds, volant insects and non-volant mammals) before and after thinning within five control and three impact compartments. Key results. Thinning reduced stem density by approximately two-thirds and was associated with a substantial increase in activity and richness of bats and a change in bat species composition. There was no change in richness for birds and non-volant mammals, nor insect biomass in relation to thinning. However, thinning affected composition of non-volant mammals, with the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) less active post-thinning at impact plots relative to control plots. Thinning reduced the density of dead stems, though these were predominantly small (∼13 cm diameter at breast height over bark, or dbhob) and mostly lacked hollows. Hollow-bearing tree density was not affected by thinning. Although thinning increased CWD densities, volume of CWD did not change, indicating that thinning contributed small-sized CWD. Thinning did not affect densities of hollow- and fissure-bearing CWD or ground cover, which was low (<7%) in control and impact plots. There were no other negative effects on biodiversity detected. Conclusions. Short-term fauna responses to thinning were generally neutral or positive. Implications. Ongoing monitoring is required to detect long-term changes that may result from colonisation or altered breeding success after thinning. We recommend that some unthinned stands should be retained throughout the landscape to provide a mosaic forest structure suitable for a diverse fauna.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aEucalyptus camaldulensis 3aTrichosurus vulpecula 3aVulpes vulpes 3abark 3abiomass 3abirds 3acoarse woody debris 3afauna 3aforests 3ainsects 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3apossums 3aregrowth 3areproductive success 3aspecies diversity 3astems 3atree and stand measurements 0aFauna 0aBats 0aBirds 0aInvertebrates 0aMammals 0aRestoration 0aDisturbance1 aLaw, Bradley1 aBlakey, Rachel0 tWildlife research.g2018 Sept., v. 45, no. 5 p.397-410dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957321x1448-54947nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010500168300002000273520166600293592002801959596011001987650002102097650002902118650001102147650001402158650001302172650002002185650001102205650002302216651001102239700001802250700005702268773015402325856008302479852000902562655001202571IND60765711020221118163316.0220319e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076571102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-15137-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdhikari, Saroj10aWidespread nickel contamination in drinking water supplies of elementary schools in Taichung, Taiwan  ap. 12531-12539.  aOwing to the limited information regarding potential sources of nickel (Ni) in drinking water, incidences of Ni contamination have not been well elucidated in the literature. However, in recent decades, Ni-containing plumbing materials such as stainless steel pipes, brass fittings, and chrome faucets have gained popularity in drinking water distribution systems. As a result of increased use of such materials, Ni levels in drinking water are expected to rise over time, posing long-term exposure risks to consumers. For the first time, this study employed an intensive sequential sampling, from October 2019 to July 2020, to assess Ni levels in drinking water samples collected from dispensers of elementary schools in Taichung, Taiwan. Of the total 580 sequential samples collected from 58 elementary schools, 45 samples from 17 schools exceeded the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) standard value of 20 μg/L for Ni. Total Ni concentration in 1 L sample, an average of the total Ni concentrations in 10 sequential samples, exceeded in 4 schools. This finding suggests minor Ni contamination in drinking water supplies across the city. The highest Ni concentration was measured in the 1st sequential sample reaching 154 μg/L. Weekend and summer samples exhibited a higher tendency to exceed the standard. Older schools with age above 50 years and schools with a higher student population (≥ 500) were more likely to have Ni contamination. This study showed that drinking water is a potential source of Ni. However, the identification of Ni source, whether within the dispenser or in the distribution system, warrants further research.  aPublisher supplied data  aMOST-107-2221-E-324-002-MY2 and MOST-109-2221-E-324-009–MY3cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan 3achronic exposure 3aenvironmental protection 3anickel 3apollution 3aresearch 3astainless steel 3asummer 3awater distribution 3aTaiwan1 aYanuar, Emsal1 aNg, Ding-Quan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5301-07100 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 9 p.12531-12539dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15137-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245013100152500002000283520167800303592002801981650001802009650001702027650002002044650003102064650001702095650001402112650002002126650001602146650001402162650001502176650001702191650003002208650001502238650001102253650002002264650002102284650001102305650001802316650002202334700001602356700001502372700001602387700001702403700001402420700001402434700005702448773012602505856007502631852000902706655001202715IND60777617920221118043703.0220518e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077761792DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.140112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRui, Ze10aPterostilbene exert an anti‐arthritic effect by attenuating inflammation, oxidative stress, and alteration of gut microbiota  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPterostilbene is a revesterol analog with a long bioavailability and having potent anti‐inflammatory activity in animal studies. In this study, we tried to scrutinize the anti‐arthritic effect of pterostilbene against complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)‐induced arthritis model in rats. CFA was used for induction of the RA, and rats were divided into groups depending on different doses of pterostilbene given. Hepatic, antioxidant, rheumatoid factor (RF), myeloperoxidase (MPO), inflammatory cytokines, anti‐collagen(C)II‐Ig, inflammatory mediators, and gut microbiota were estimated. Pterostilbene significantly (p < .001) decreased the paw swelling, arthritic score, and increased the body weight. Besides altered the antioxidant, inflammatory mediators, anti‐collagen (C)II Ig, and inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, pterostilbene treatment helps to restore the ecosystem of gut microbiota in rats by reducing the relative abundance of Helicobacter, Desulfovibrio, Lachnospiraceae, and Mucispirillium. Based on the findings, we can say that pterostilbene has an anti‐arthritic effect via suppressing inflammatory responses and altering intestinal bacteria. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Arthritis is the painful disease and affected most of the people worldwide. In this experimental study, we estimated the anti‐arthritic effect of pterostilbene against CFA‐induced arthritis in rats. Pterostilbene noticeably suppressed the paw thickness, arthritic score, and organ index. Pterostilbene substantially altered the oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction. Pterostilbene considerably modulated the gut microbiota, suggesting the anti‐arthritic effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfovibrio 3aHelicobacter 3aLachnospiraceae 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3aarthritis 3abioavailability 3abody weight 3acytokines 3aecosystems 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amodels 3amyeloperoxidase 3aoxidative stress 3apeople 3apterostilbene 3avaccine adjuvants1 aZhang, Ling1 aLi, Xuefei1 aHan, Jinxue1 aYuan, Yufeng1 aDing, Hui1 aLiu, Yang1 aDing, Xiaolin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0390-85000 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2022 May, v. 46, no. 5 p.e14011-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.140113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010700163300002000270520110600290592002801396596011001424596011001534650001501644650001501659650002301674650002201697650001101719650001501730650001401745650001301759650001601772650001501788700001401803700001701817700001301834700001601847700001601863700001801879773015401897856008302051852000902134655001202143IND60765711120221118163312.0220319e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076571112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-15126-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Junxiu10aFixed-bed column dynamics of ultrasound and Na-functionalized diatomite to remove phosphate from water  ap. 12441-12449.  aA continuous fixed-bed column study was used to evaluate phosphate adsorption performance of U-D-Na which was functionalized by the cheap NaCl reagent after simple ultrasonic purification of diatomite. In this work, various effect factors, including flow rate, initial phosphate concentration, and the bed height, on breakthrough performance of fixed column were investigated. Experimental results demonstrated that the breakthrough time declined with the increase of inlet phosphate concentration and feed rate, whereas the increase of bed height turned out to significantly extend the breakthrough time. The dynamic adsorption process could be well fitted by the Thomas model, with a correlation coefficient R² > 0.9000 under main operating conditions. A thrice loop of effective regeneration was achieved with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid eluent and deionized water. The maximum removal rate for phosphate was more than 95% in the column adsorption process. The results proved that U-D-Na could be used as a better alternative phosphate adsorbent for wastewater in a continuous column sorption process.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant No. 2020J0329cthe Science Research Fund Projects of Department of Education of Yunnan Province  aGrant No. 2020J0327cthe Science Research Fund Projects of Department of Education of Yunnan Province 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3adiatomaceous earth 3ahydrochloric acid 3amodels 3aphosphates 3apollution 3aresearch 3aultrasonics 3awastewater1 aYang, Min1 aDing, Xuemei1 aTan, Wei1 aLi, Guizhen1 aFang, Shuju1 aWang, Hongbin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 9 p.12441-12449dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15126-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01913naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015400168520071400322592002801036650002301064650001201087650001401099650001301113650001801126650003501144650001201179650001801191650001301209650002401222651001001246653002501256653003501281653002201316773010701338856008501445852000901530655001201539IND60708062620221122064409.0201025e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070806262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2020.1087562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Mingqing10aChanges of China's regulatory regime on commercial artificial breeding of terrestrial wildlife in time of COVID-19 outbreak and impacts on the future  aThe basic attitude of Chinese law towards wildlife resources is differentiated protection plus rational utilizations.

Young fish (28-day posthatch) of 51.6 ± 0.9 mg (mean ± SE) were stocked at 2, 5, 8, and 11 fish/L in 31 L tanks in RAS with triplicate groups for 16 weeks. Cannibalism was a major problem in the study, which increased with increasing initial stocking density, affecting survival negatively. Survival decreased (P < 0.03) with increasing initial stocking density and culture period. At the end of the trial, the 2, 5, 8 and 11 fish/L initial stocking density reduced to 1.66, 1.42, 0.86, and 0.74 fish/L respectively. A significant linear relationship existed between the initial stocking density and weight (y = 0.077x + 2.3; R² = 0.8; P = 0.003), whereas an inverse relationship occurred between initial stocking density and survival parameters (y = −9.43x + 97.4; R² = 0.89; P < 0.001). From the trial, the optimum density for culturing young of Gulf killifish in RAS appears to be around two fish/L.  aThis work was supported by the Southern Regional Aquaculture Center, USA.  aPublisher supplied data  a-cSouthern Regional Aquaculture Center 3aFundulus grandis 3abaitfish 3acannibalism 3aponds 3arearing 3arecirculating aquaculture systems 3astocking rate 3atanks 0aBaitfish 0acannibalism 0aoptimum density 0apond studies 0arecirculating technology 0atechniques1 aNunoo, Francis K.

Cathepsin V contains two predicted N-glycosylation sites, but it has not been reported whether cathepsin V is glycosylated or not. In this study, we clarified the role of N-glycosylation of cathepsin V for its functions. We demonstrated that cathepsin V is N-glycosylated at both Asn²²¹ and Asn²⁹² using mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis. N-glycosylation of cathepsin V was important for transportation to lysosome, secretion, and activity in HT1080 cells. These data demonstrated that functions of cathepsin V are controlled by N-glycosylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathepsin V 3aglycosylation 3alysosomes 3amass spectrometry 3ametastasis 3asecretion 3asite-directed mutagenesis1 aSuzuki, Takehiro1 aDohmae, Naoshi1 aUmezawa, Kazuo1 aSimizu, Siro0 tFEBS letters.g2012 Oct. 19, v. 586, no. 20 p.3601-3607dElsevier B.V.x0014-57937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2012.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245015600170300001400326520134200340592002801682650002001710650002301730650001601753650005001769650001901819650001501838650002401853650002301877650002501900650002101925651002501946651001101971653002301982653001602005653000802021653000802029653001002037653001502047653002002062700005902082700002102141700002202162700001602184773009702200856008102297852000902378655001202387IND60563190720221119104209.0170719e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056319072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2015.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinacapilli, Mario12aA time domain triangle method approach to estimate actual evapotranspiration: Application in a Mediterranean region using MODIS and MSG-SEVIRI products  ap. 10-23.  aIn this study, spatially distributed estimates of regional actual evapotranspiration (ET) were obtained using a revised procedure of the so called “triangle method” to parameterize the Priestley–Taylor ϕ coefficient. In the procedure herein proposed, named Time-Domain Triangle Method (TDTM), the triangular feature space was parameterized considering pairs of Ts–VI values obtained by exploring, for each pixel, only their temporal dynamics. This new method was developed using time series products provided by MODIS and MSG-SEVIRI sensors. Moreover the proposed procedure does not depend on ancillary data, and it is only based on remotely sensed vegetation indices and day–night time land surface temperature differences.Two different test areas located in Sicily were selected for testing and validating the approach. Satellite ET rates were validated versus directly measured fluxes of mass (ET) obtained by eddy covariance (EC) towers during the observation period 2010–2012.The proposed approach predicts daily ET rates with an acceptable level of accuracy for practical purposes; therefore, the TDTM can be considered as a simple and effective tool to easily estimate, at regional scale, spatial and temporal changes of this key-variable related to water resource management, agriculture, ecology and climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeddy covariance 3aevapotranspiration 3amethodology 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asurface temperature 3atemporal variation 3atime series analysis 3avegetation index 3aMediterranean region 3aSicily 0aEvapotranspiration 0aTime series 0aLST 0aEVI 0aMODIS 0aMSG-SEVIRI 0aEddy covariance1 aConsoli, Simona1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1100-654X1 aVanella, Daniela1 aCiraolo, Giuseppe1 aMotisi, A.,0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 174 p.10-23dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007700164300001600241500001100257520104600268592002801314650001501342650001301357650002401370650002201394650001701416650001801433650001801451650002101469650002301490650001401513650001401527650001701541650002001558650001101578650001601589700002201605700002201627773012901649856008101778852000901859655001201868IND60574387820221122121518.0170726e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057438782DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-016-2366-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuast, Isaak10aRegulation of antibody effector functions through IgG Fc N-glycosylation  ap. 837-847.  aReview  aImmunoglobulin gamma (IgG) antibodies are key effector proteins of the immune system. They recognize antigens with high specificity and are indispensable for immunological memory following pathogen exposure or vaccination. The constant, crystallizable fragment (Fc) of IgG molecules mediates antibody effector functions such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis. These functions are regulated by a single N-linked, biantennary glycan of the heavy chain, which resides just below the hinge region, and the presence of specific sugar moieties on the glycan has profound implications on IgG effector functions. Emerging knowledge of how Fc glycans contribute to IgG structure and functions has opened new avenues for the therapeutic exploitation of defined antibody glycoforms in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Here, we review recent advances in understanding proinflammatory IgG effector functions and their regulation by Fc glycans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aautoimmune diseases 3achemical elements 3acytotoxicity 3aglycosylation 3aimmune system 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunologic memory 3aneoplasms 3apathogens 3aphagocytosis 3apolysaccharides 3asugars 3avaccination1 aPeschke, Benjamin1 aLünemann, Jan D.0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2017 Mar., v. 74, no. 5 p.837-847dSpringer International Publishingx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-016-2366-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012800164300001600292520142100308592002801729650001501757650001501772650001301787650001401800650001201814650001101826650001001837650002201847650002301869651001201892700001501904700001801919700001801937773009001955856008102045852000902126655001202135IND60081493820221119105839.0150217e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008149382DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-014-0347-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtsus, Merit10aClonal ability, height and growth form explain species’ response to habitat deterioration in Fennoscandian wooded meadows  ap. 953-962.  aFennoscandian calcareous wooded meadows have high conservation value due to very high diversity which has been maintained by consistent mowing, but undergo species loss when this management is abandoned. We compared species richness and composition of regularly mown and abandoned wooded meadows in Estonia and established species groups with respect to their response to abandonment. These meadows were very species rich with a maximum of 43 species per 0.25 m². Species whose populations are maintained by mowing constituted >60 % of the floristic diversity of the mown wooded meadows. Abandonment suppressed species with a preference for dry infertile open habitats. Response to abandonment was related to clonality, height and growth form. The greatest negative response was associated with low graminoids, short-lived and non-clonal species, rosette and semi-rosette growth form. Weak competitors with low height and light seeds exhibited a slow decline; perennial life span and clonality enable a delay in local extinction of these species. Response groups had similar persistence at a national level, revealing that earlier assessment of species dynamics at larger spatial scales could underestimate the number of threatened species. Application of restoration measures could avoid local extinctions of many mowing-supported species, whereas some of the mowing-dependent species likely need reintroduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aextinction 3agraminoids 3ahabitats 3alongevity 3ameadows 3amowing 3aseeds 3aspecies diversity 3athreatened species 3aEstonia1 aKukk, Dora1 aKattai, Kaili1 aSammul, Marek0 tPlant ecology.g2014 Sept., v. 215, no. 9 p.953-962dSpringer-Verlagx1385-02377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-014-0347-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01590naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245007600164300001800240520060700258592002800865650001400893650001700907650001000924650001100934650001300945700001600958700001700974700001700991700001701008700001201025700001701037773009201054856008501146852000901231655001201240IND60098402620221119135816.0141104e20121019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009840262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2012.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yi10aMiR-136 promotes apoptosis of glioma cells by targeting AEG-1 and Bcl-2  ap. 3608-3612.  aMicroRNAs have the capacity to coordinately repress multiple target genes and interfere with biological functions of the cell, such as proliferation and apoptosis.

Two anti-apoptotic genes, AEG-1 and Bcl-2, are identified as targets of miR-136, and restoration of AEG-1 or Bcl-2 expression suppresses miR-136-enhanced apoptosis. Therefore, miR-136 might play a tumor-suppressive role in human glioma and thereby might represent a potential therapeutic strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3adrug therapy 3agenes 3ahumans 3amicroRNA1 aWu, Jueheng1 aGuan, Hongyu1 aCai, Junchao1 aFang, Lishan1 aLi, Jun1 aLi, Mengfeng0 tFEBS letters.g2012 Oct. 19, v. 586, no. 20 p.3608-3612dElsevier B.V.x0014-57937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2012.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03746naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245012400174300001600298520183200314592002802146650001002174650001902184650002402203650002302227650002002250650002202270650001202292650002502304650001302329650001302342650001002355650001102365650001502376650001502391650001902406650001502425650002202440650001202462650001202474651001202486653001702498653001702515653001702532653001002549653002102559653003602580653003602616653001902652653001402671653002202685653002602707700002002733700002102753700001902774700003502793700001902828700001702847700001902864773009902883856008102982852000903063655001203072IND60563190820221119104335.0170719e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056319082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2015.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallis, Christine I.B.10aContrasting performance of Lidar and optical texture models in predicting avian diversity in a tropical mountain forest  ap. 223-232.  aEcosystems worldwide are threatened by the increasing impact of land use and climate change. To protect their diversity and functionality, spatially explicit monitoring systems are needed. In remote areas, monitoring is difficult and recurrent field surveys are costly. By using Lidar or the more cost-effective and repetitive optical satellite data, remote sensing could provide proxies for habitat structure supporting measures for the conservation of biodiversity. Here we compared the explanatory power of both, airborne Lidar and optical satellite data in modeling the spatial distribution of biodiversity of birds across a complex tropical mountain forest ecosystem in southeastern Ecuador. We used data from field surveys of birds and chose three measures as proxies for different aspects of diversity: (i) Shannon diversity as a measure of α-diversity that also includes the relative abundance of species, (ii) phylodiversity as a first proxy for functional diversity, and (iii) community composition as a proxy for combined α- and β-diversity. We modeled these diversity estimates using partial least-square regression of Lidar and optical texture metrics separately and compared the models using a leave-one-out validated R2 and root mean square error. Bird community information was best predicted by both remote sensing datasets, followed by Shannon diversity and phylodiversity. Our findings reveal a high potential of optical texture metrics for predicting Shannon diversity and a measure of community composition, but not for modeling phylodiversity. Generalizing from the investigated tropical mountain ecosystem, we conclude that texture information retrieved from multispectral data of operational satellite systems could replace costly airborne laser-scanning for modeling certain aspects of biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3acost effectiveness 3adata collection 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3afunctional diversity 3ahabitats 3aland use 3alidar 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3atexture 3aEcuador 0aΑ-diversity 0aβ-diversity 0aBiodiversity 0aBirds 0aEcuadorian Andes 0aGray level co-occurrence matrix 0aPartial least-square regression 0aPhylodiversity 0aQuickbird 0aShannon diversity 0aCommunity composition1 aPaulsch, Detlev1 aZeilinger, Jörg1 aSilva, Brenner1 aCuratola Fernández, Giulia F.1 aBrandl, Roland1 aFarwig, Nina1 aBendix, Jörg,0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 174 p.223-232dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008400172300001600256520170800272592002801980650001702008650001202025650001502037650001202052650001102064650001302075650002602088650002102114650003702135650001502172650001402187650001502201650000902216650001302225650000902238650001902247650002702266650001002293650002702303650001402330651001102344651001302355700003102368700002202399700001502421700002002436700003602456700002802492773009002520856008102610852000902691655001202700IND60081493920221119105939.0150217e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008149392DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-014-0348-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVourlitis, George L.10aNutrient resorption in tropical savanna forests and woodlands of central Brazil  ap. 963-975.  aNutrient limitation in Brazilian savanna (known as cerrado) presumably causes trees to maximize nutrient resorption from senesced leaves to reduce their dependence on nutrient availability. To assess patterns between nutrient resorption and soil fertility, we measured community-level nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) concentrations in mature and senesced leaves and soil fertility in the upper 50 cm soil layer in structurally diverse cerrado ecosystems in the Cuiaba Basin (CB) and Pantanal (PAN) of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Foliar nutrient concentration data were used to estimate resorption efficiency and proficiency, and correlation was used to determine whether resorption efficiency and proficiency varied across soil fertility gradients. We found that N and P resorption proficiency (NRP and PRP, respectively) and P resorption efficiency (PRE) increased significantly as total soil N (NRP) and extractable P (PRP and PRE) declined. In contrast, K resorption efficiency (KRE) declined as soil sand content and bulk density increased, which was likely due to a reduction in soil water-holding capacity. Leaf N/P ratios indicate potential N limitation and/or N + P co-limitation for ecosystems in the PAN and P limitation and/or N + P co-limitation for ecosystems in the CB, while trends in leaf N/K ratios indicate possible K or K + P co-limitation for the CB only. Our results illustrate that cerrado forests and woodlands have highly variable nutrient resorption capacities that vary predictably across soil fertility or textural gradients and indicate that cerrado communities have flexible nutrient resorption that can reduce their dependence on soil nutrient availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3acerrado 3aecosystems 3aforests 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrient content 3anutrient resorption (physiology) 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aresorption 3asand 3asavannas 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3atrees 3awater holding capacity 3awoodlands 3aBrazil 3aPantanal1 ade Almeida Lobo, Francisco1 aLawrence, Shelley1 aHolt, Kali1 aZappia, Anthony1 aPinto, Osvaldo Borges, Jr.cJr.1 ade Souza Nogueira, Jose0 tPlant ecology.g2014 Sept., v. 215, no. 9 p.963-975dSpringer-Verlagx1385-02377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-014-0348-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01331naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245010900166300001800275520039400293592002800687650001200715650001200727650002300739650002300762650001200785700001500797700001800812773010500830856008500935852000901020655001201029IND60579026920221120160406.0170815e20150306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057902692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b001052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Xinjun10aCadmium Iodide Mediated Allenylation of Terminal Alkynes for the Synthesis of Methyl-Substituted Allenes  ap. 1176-1179.  aA cadmium iodide mediated tandem reaction involving amine and two molecules of terminal alkynes for the synthesis of trisubstituted allenes has been developed.

Charge is collected by the direct injection of electrons into the Au electrode and the transport of holes through a redox couple to liquid eutectic gallium–indium (EGaIn) electrodes that are confined to microfluidic pseudochannels by arrays of posts. The pseudochannels are defined in a single fabrication step that leverages the non-Newtonian rheology of EGaIn. This strategy is extended to the fabrication of reticulated electrodes that are inherently stretchable. A simple shadow evaporation technique is used to increase the surface area of the Au electrodes by a factor of approximately 10⁶ compared to planar electrodes. The power conversion efficiency of the biophotovoltaic devices decreases over time, presumably as the PSI complexes denature and/or detach from the Au electrodes. However, by circulating a solution of active PSI complexes the devices self-regenerate by mass action/self-assembly. These devices leverage simple fabrication techniques to produce complex function and prove that photovoltaic devices comprising PSI can retain the ability to regenerate, one of the most important functions of photosynthetic organisms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautotrophs 3aelectric current 3aelectrodes 3aelectrons 3aevaporation 3agold 3aliquids 3amaterials science 3aphotosystem I 3aphotovoltaic cells 3arheology 3asurface area 0aphotosystem I 0aself-assembly 0aEGaIn 0amicrofluidics 0acofabrication 0astretchable photovoltaics1 aCastañeda Ocampo, Olga1 ade Vries, Hendrik W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9307-90151 avan Putten, Maikel1 aLoznik, Mark1 aHerrmann, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8886-08941 aChiechi, Ryan C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0895-20950 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Oct. 08, v. 10, no. 43 p.37625-37633dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b111153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04086naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002200165245021200187300001800399500001500417520205900432592002802491650002002519650001002539650001902549650002102568650002302589650001102612650001102623650001502634650001502649650001302664650002602677650001102703650002202714650001102736650005302747650001802800650002902818650005902847650002402906650001102930650002902941650002102970650002002991650008603011650005603097650001703153651001503170651001503185700001703200700002203217700001703239773012503256856008203381852000903463655001203472IND4491824220221120160108.0141111e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449182422DNAL7 a227048982pmid7 a10.1016/j.jand.2012.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruemmer, Barbara10aEnergy, Saturated Fat, and Sodium Were Lower in Entrées at Chain Restaurants at 18 Months Compared with 6 Months Following the Implementation of Mandatory Menu Labeling Regulation in King County, Washington  ap. 1169-1176.  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Policies on menu labeling have been proposed as a method to improve the food environment. However, there is little information on the nutrient content of chain restaurant menu items and changes over time. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the energy, saturated fat, and sodium content of entrées 6 and 18 months post-implementation of restaurant menu labeling in King County of Washington State for items that were on the menu at both time periods, and across all items at 6 and 18 months and to compare energy content to recommendations provided by the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. SETTING: Eligible restaurants included sit-down and quick-service chains (eg, burgers, pizza, sandwiches/subs, and Tex-Mex) subject to King County regulations with four or more establishments. One establishment per chain was audited at each time period. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Hypothesis one examined entrées that were on the menu at both time periods using a paired t test and hypothesis two compared quartiles at 6 months to the distribution at 18 months using a Mantel-Haentzel odds ratios and 95% CIs, and a Cochrane-Armitage test for trend. The content of entrées at 18 months was compared with one-third (assuming three meals per day) of the nutrient intake recommendations for adults provided by the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. RESULTS: The audit included 37 eligible chains of 92 regulated chains. Energy contents were lower (all chains −41, sit down −73, and quick service −19; paired t tests P<0.0001) for entrées that were on the menu at both time periods. There was a significant trend across quartiles for a decrease in energy, saturated fat, and sodium for all entrées at sit-down chains only. At 18 months entrées not designated for children exceeded 56%, 77%, and 89% of the energy, saturated fat, and sodium guidelines, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Modest improvements in the nutrient content of sit-down and quick-service restaurant entrées occurred but overall levels for energy, saturated fat, and sodium are excessive.  aPublisher supplied data 3anutrient intake 3apizza 3aenergy content 3anutrient content 3aDietary Guidelines 3aenergy 3at-test 3aguidelines 3aodds ratio 3achildren 3afast food restaurants 3asodium 3aissues and policy 3aadults 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aEnergy Intake 2aFood Analysisxstandards 2aFood Labelingxstandardsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aGuideline Adherence 2aHumans 2aMenu Planningxstandards 2aNutrition Policy 2aNutritive Value 2aRestaurantsxlegislation & jurisprudencexstandardsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aSodium, Dietaryxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aTime Factors 0aWashington 0aWashington1 aKrieger, Jim1 aSaelens, Brian E.1 aChan, Nadine0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2012 Aug., v. 112, no. 8 p.1169-1176dElsevier Inc.x2212-26727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2012.04.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245009300181300001800274500001900292500001100311520092300322592002801245596010101273650002501374650002501399650000901424650001701433650002801450650001101478650002301489650001501512650001601527650002501543650001001568700002501578700002601603700007101629700003801700700003901738700004001777773013301817856008201950852000902032655001202041IND60714692620221118023416.0201024e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071469262DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-020-04453-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVargas-Madriz, Ángel Félix10aPhenolic profile and antioxidant capacity of Pithecellobium dulce (Roxb) Benth: a review  ap. 4316-4336.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aPithecellobium dulce (Roxb) Benth (P. dulce), known as “guamúchil”, is a tree native to the American continent. Various parts of the tree are used in traditional medicine, primarily for treating gastrointestinal disorders. The phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity of this plant are largely responsible for the beneficial health effects attributed to it. A number of authors have studied the antioxidant capacity and phenolic compounds of the aril, seed, leaf and root of P. dulce using various methodologies, which can differ considerably in variables such as environmental factors, type of drying, temperature, the way the sample is stored, and the use of different solvents in the various extraction methods. Even methods of quantification by HPLC vary tremendously. This paper summarizes the existing research carried out to date on determining the phenolic profile and antioxidant capacity of P. dulce.  aPublisher supplied data  aFOFI-UAQ: FNN-2018-08cFund for Strengthening Research at the Autonomous University of Queretaro 3aPithecellobium dulce 3aantioxidant activity 3aaril 3afood science 3agastrointestinal system 3aleaves 3aphenolic compounds 3atechnology 3atemperature 3atraditional medicine 3atrees1 aKuri-García, Aarón1 aVargas-Madriz, Haidel1 aChávez-Servín, Jorge Luis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5866-48251 aFerriz-Martínez, Roberto Augusto1 aHernández Sandoval, Luis Gerardo,1 aGuzmán-Maldonado, Salvador Horacio0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2020 Dec., v. 57, no. 12 p.4316-4336dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-020-04453-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100002800197245011900225300001800344506007600362520136500438592002801803506003701831650001801868650002501886650001401911650001001925650002501935650002201960650001601982650002501998650000902023650001102032650001802043650001502061650003102076650002302107650002602130650001502156650000902171650001302180650004002193700002202233700002302255700002502278700002902303700001802332700002202350700001902372700003402391773008602425856009002511852000902601655001202610IND60090288920221207093739.0141102e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009028892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.10.0052doi7 aPMC68051452pmcid7 a210351822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKraehenbuehl, Thomas P.10aHuman embryonic stem cell-derived microvascular grafts for cardiac tissue preservation after myocardial infarction  ap. 1102-1109.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe present use of a synthetic, injectable matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)- responsive, bioactive hydrogel as an in situ forming scaffold to deliver thymosin β4 (Tβ4), a pro-angiogenic and pro-survival factor, along with vascular cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) in ischemic injuries to the heart in a rat model. The gel was found to substitute the degrading extracellular matrix in the infarcted myocardium of rats and to promote structural organization of native endothelial cells, while some of the delivered hESC-derived vascular cells formed de novo capillaries in the infarct zone. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the microvascular grafts effectively preserved contractile performance 3 d and 6 wk after myocardial infarction, attenuated left ventricular dilation, and decreased infarct size as compared to infarcted rats treated with PBS injection as a control (3 d ejection fraction, + ∼7%, P < 0.001; 6 wk ejection faction, + ∼12%, P < 0.001). Elevation in vessel density was observed in response to treatment, which may be due in part to elevations in human (donor)-derived cytokines EGF, VEGF and HGF (1 d). Thus, a clinically relevant matrix for dual delivery of vascular cells and drugs may be useful in engineering sustained tissue preservation and potentially regenerating ischemic cardiac tissue.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3abioactive properties 3acytokines 3adrugs 3aembryonic stem cells 3aendothelial cells 3aengineering 3aextracellular matrix 3agels 3ahumans 3ahydrocolloids 3ainfarction 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3ametalloproteinases 3amyocardial infarction 3amyocardium 3arats 3athymosin 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aFerreira, Lino S.1 aHayward, Alison M.1 aNahrendorf, Matthias1 avan der Vlies, André J.1 aVasile, Eliza1 aWeissleder, Ralph1 aLanger, Robert1 aHubbell, J.

This study aims to fill the evidence gap regarding the most effective FoPL among the Portuguese population. In total, 1059 Portuguese participants were recruited through a web panel provider and asked to declare their intended food choices and to rank three sets of products (pizza, cakes and breakfast cereals) according to their nutritional quality, first in the absence of any labelling, and then with a FoPL displayed on-pack (five FoPLs tested). Finally, participants were asked to answer nine statements related to perceptions of FoPLs. Results showed that participants improved their food choices, depending on the FoPL and the food category. All FoPLs led to a higher percentage of correct responses on the ranking task compared to the no label condition. The Nutri-Score was among the FoPLs producing the greatest improvement across all food categories compared to the reference intakes (OR = 6.45 [4.43–9.39], p-value < 0.0001) and facilitating the highest percentage to correctly rank products according to nutritional quality. This study suggests that, among the available options, Nutri-Score is the most efficient FoPL to inform Portuguese consumers of the nutritional quality of foods and help them identify healthier options in mock purchasing situations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreakfast 3anutrition labeling 3anutritive value 3apizza1 aCruz-e-Silva, David 1 aNobre-da-Costa, Catarina 1 aNunes, Alexandre Morais1 aFialon, Morgane 1 aEgnell, Manon 1 aGalan, P.q(Pilar),1 aJulia, Chantal 1 aTalati, Zenobia 1 aPettigrew, Simone 1 aDarzi, Ara 1 aAraújo, Fernando,1 aHercberg, Serge 0 tNutrients.g2021 Nov. 30, v. 13, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131243353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245009600167300002000263520120100283592002801484650001401512650002101526650001301547650001701560650001801577650001301595650001701608650001301625650001701638650001301655650001901668650001301687650002601700650001901726653001601745653001001761653001301771653002101784653001301805700002101818700002601839700001901865700002101884700002001905700002001925773012601945856008002071852000902151655001202160IND60565347320170710000000.0170323e20170322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056534732DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b132182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcFadden, Peter D.10aUV Fluorescent Epoxy Adhesives from Noncovalent and Covalent Incorporation of Coumarin Dyes  ap. 10061-10068.  aEpoxies are commonly used in art conservation as adhesives for artifact reconstruction and repair. However, with the development of colorless epoxies, it has become more difficult to detect repair work. Fluorescent epoxies would allow for easy detection of the epoxy joints by simple visual inspection under UV light while remaining unnoticeable under normal display lighting. Coumarins are natural dyes that can be added in very small amounts to make thermosets fluoresce. Depending on the functionality of the coumarin used, the dye may be physically encapsulated in the cross-linked polymer or it may be bound to the polymer through covalent bonds. In this paper, we examine the efficacy of coumarin (1) and coumarin 480 (2) as physically encapsulated dyes and 7-hydroxycoumarin (3) and 7-glycidyloxycoumarin (4) as covalently bound dyes in a commercial epoxy thermoset, Epo-Tek 301. All four dyes could be used to make the epoxy fluorescent, but coumarins 1 and 2 slightly reduced the lap shear strength of the thermoset and could be extracted with solvent. In contrast, coumarins 3 and 4 had little effect on the mechanical properties of the epoxy and only minute amounts could be extracted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesives 3achemical bonding 3acoumarin 3acrosslinking 3aencapsulation 3aepoxides 3afluorescence 3alighting 3anatural dyes 3apolymers 3ashear strength 3asolvents 3aultraviolet radiation 3aumbelliferones 0afluorescent 0aepoxy 0aadhesive 0aart conservation 0acoumarin1 aFrederick, Kevin1 aArgüello, Liliana A.1 aZhang, Yizheng1 aVandiver, Pamela1 aOdegaard, Nancy1 aLoy, Douglas A.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 22, v. 9, no. 11 p.10061-10068dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b132183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002300156245011100179300001800290520112300308592002801431650000801459650002201467650003001489650001401519650002101533650001301554650001001567650001301577650000901590650001101599650002701610650001801637650001901655650002101674650001101695700003401706700003501740700002101775700002501796700002801821700002801849700002901877700002701906773008601933856009002019852000902109655001202118IND60090289120221123004836.0141102e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009028912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.10.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkovic, Zoran M.10aIn vitro comparison of the photothermal anticancer activity of graphene nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes  ap. 1121-1129.  aThe present study compared the photothermal anticancer activity of near-infrared (NIR)-excited graphene nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes (CNT). Despite lower NIR-absorbing capacity, suspension of polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated graphene sheets exposed to NIR radiation (808nm, 2W/cm²) generated more heat than DNA or sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate-solubilized single-wall CNT under the same conditions. Accordingly, graphene nanoparticles performed significantly better than CNT in inducing photothermal death of U251 human glioma cells in vitro. The superior photothermal sensitivity of graphene sheets could be largely explained by their better dispersivity, which has been supported by a simple calculation taking into account thermodynamic, optical and geometrical properties of the two type of carbon nanoparticles. The mechanisms of graphene-mediated photothermal killing of cancer cells apparently involved oxidative stress and mitochondrial membrane depolarization resulting in mixed apoptotic and necrotic cell death characterized by caspase activation/DNA fragmentation and cell membrane damage, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aapoptosis 3acarbon nanotubes 3acaspases 3adeath 3agraphene 3aheat 3ahumans 3amitochondrial membrane 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxidative stress 3asodium1 aHarhaji-Trajkovic, Ljubica M.1 aTodorovic-Markovic, Biljana M.1 aKepić, Dejan P.1 aArsikin, Katarina M.1 aJovanović, Svetlana P.1 aPantovic, Aleksandar C.1 aDramićanin, Miroslav D.1 aTrajkovic, Vladimir S.0 tBiomaterials.g2011 Feb., v. 32, no. 4 p.1121-1129dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.10.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245013500176300001600311520190000327592002802227650001602255650001202271650001102283650001302294650001502307650002202322653002702344653001702371653001702388653001802405653002302423653002202446700002002468700002402488773011902512856008402631852000902715655001202724IND60602284620221119132102.0180711e20150702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060228462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2015.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanco Martín, Laura10aLong-term modeling of the thermal–hydraulic–mechanical response of a generic salt repository for heat-generating nuclear waste  ap. 198-211.  aA modeling effort has been undertaken to investigate the long-term response of a generic salt repository for heat-generating nuclear waste, including processes that could affect the geological (natural salt host rock) and geotechnical (backfill) barriers. For this purpose, the TOUGH-FLAC sequential simulator for coupled thermal–hydraulic–mechanical processes modeling has recently been provided with a capability for large strains and creep. The responses of the saliferous host rock and the crushed salt backfill are modeled using dedicated constitutive relationships. Similarly, the coupling between the geomechanics and the flow sub-problems is performed on the basis of theoretical and experimental studies. The repository investigated in this work considers in-drift emplacement of the waste packages and subsequent backfill of the drifts with run-of-mine salt. Using the updated TOUGH-FLAC, the compaction of the backfill and the evolution of its properties as porosity decreases can be modeled. Additionally, different processes that may influence the initial tightness of the host rock can be investigated. On the basis of state-of-the-art phenomenological models, our simulation results show that, in order to evaluate the barriers integrity, it is necessary to consider full coupling between thermal, hydraulic and mechanical processes. A base case scenario that accounts for these coupled processes is presented and compared to a case in which the mechanical processes are disregarded. Also, we investigate the sensitivity of the coupled numerical predictions to two factors: the initial saturation within the host rock and the capillary forces. Although the outcome of these simulations is preliminary and will be improved as the understanding of relevant processes moves forward, the numerical tools required to perform the target predictions have been significantly improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3ageology 3amodels 3aporosity 3aprediction 3aradioactive waste 0aNuclear waste disposal 0aNatural salt 0aCrushed salt 0aLarge strains 0aNumerical modeling 0aCoupled processes1 aRutqvist, Jonny1 aBirkholzer, Jens T.0 tEngineering geology.g2015 July 02, v. 193 p.198-211dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2015.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02122naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024002200120024001900142040001800161100002400179245005000203300001800253500002000271506007600291520098100367592002801348506003701376650002501413650001601438650002201454650002201476650001501498700002001513700002301533773012301556856007201679852000901751655001201760IND60580727220221207123414.0170927e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058072722DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.39302doi7 aPMC61450792pmcid7 a289459432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrander, Susanne M.14aThe Role of Epigenomics in Aquatic Toxicology  ap. 2565-2573.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOver the past decade, the field of molecular biology has rapidly incorporated epigenetic studies to evaluate organism–environment interactions that can result in chronic effects. Such responses arise from early life stage stress, the utilization of genetic information over an individual's life time, and transgenerational inheritance. Knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms provides the potential for a comprehensive evaluation of multigenerational and heritable effects from environmental stressors, such as contaminants. Focused studies have provided a greater understanding of how many responses to environmental stressors are driven by epigenetic modifiers. We discuss the promise of epigenetics and suggest future research directions within the field of aquatic toxicology, with a particular focus on the potential for identifying key heritable marks with consequential impacts at the organism and population levels.

Despite a concerted global response for prevention and treatment, the virus persists. Thus, urgent public health action, utilizing novel interventions, is needed to prevent future transmission events, critical to eliminating HIV. For public health planning to prove effective and successful, we need to understand the dynamics of regional epidemics and to intervene appropriately. HIV molecular epidemiology tools as implemented in phylogenetic, phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses have proven to be powerful tools in public health planning across many studies. Numerous applications with HIV suggest that molecular methods alone or in combination with mathematical modelling can provide inferences about the transmission dynamics, critical epidemiological parameters (prevalence, incidence, effective number of infections, Re, generation times, time between infection and diagnosis), or the spatiotemporal characteristics of epidemics. Molecular tools have been used to assess the impact of an intervention and outbreak investigation which are of great public health relevance. In some settings, molecular sequence data may be more readily available than HIV surveillance data, and can therefore allow for molecular analyses to be conducted more easily. Nonetheless, classic methods have an integral role in monitoring and evaluation of public health programmes, and should supplement emerging techniques from the field of molecular epidemiology.Importantly, molecular epidemiology remains a promising approach in responding to viral diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3ahumans 3amathematical models 3amolecular epidemiology 3amonitoring 3aoutbreak investigation 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3aplanning 3apublic health 3aviruses 0aAIDS 0aART 0aBDM 0aCRFs 0aFSU 0aHCV 0aHSV-2 0aHPD 0aLTNs 0aMSM 0aNGS 0aPHI 0aPR 0aPrEP 0aPWIDs 0aR0 0aRe 0aRT 0aSIR 0aTaSP 0atMRCA 0aURFs 0aWHO 0aHIV-1 0aMolecular epidemiology 0aPublic health1 aNikolopoulos, G.K.1 aMagiorkinis, G.1 aHodges-Mameletzis, I.1 aHatzakis, A.0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2016 Dec., v. 46 p.159-168dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014400157300001800301520143900319592002801758650001201786650001701798650001901815650001801834650002201852650001501874650000901889650001101898650002101909650002201930650001301952650001101965650001701976650001301993650001302006650001602019650001602035700001502051700001702066700001702083700001402100700001602114700002802130700001802158700001502176773014102191856007402332852000902406655001202415IND60682662120221119020627.0200130e20200128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068266212DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta11721k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Kaijie10aHollow spherical SiO₂ micro-container encapsulation of LiCl for high-performance simultaneous heat reallocation and seawater desalination  ap. 1887-1895.  aEnergy & fresh water have both become scarce resources in the modern era of human society. Sorption-based technology is environmentally friendly and energy-efficient and can be driven by low-grade energy to transfer energy and produce fresh water. Here, we report a solid sorbent fabricated by encapsulating a hygroscopic salt, lithium chloride (LiCl), inside micro-sized hollow-structured SiO₂. This composite sorbent (LiCl@HS) exhibits 6 times faster water vapor sorption kinetics than pure LiCl and a water vapor sorption capacity of 1.7 kg kg⁻¹ at a relative humidity (RH) of 50%, which is the highest ever reported for any solid sorbent in the literature. The low regeneration temperature (<80 °C) and good cycling stability ensure the feasibility of the composite sorbent for use in practical applications. The thermodynamic calculations reveal that the sorbent is able to continuously supply 20 °C temperature lift with a maximum coefficient of performance (COP) for cooling of 0.97 and COP for heating of 1.89 while simultaneously producing 9.05 kg potable water per kilogram sorbent daily using seawater as the source water and solar energy as the sole energy source. A homemade system is developed and its practical performance in providing seasonally switchable heating and cooling along with clean water production from source water with an impaired quality is successfully verified, indicating its great potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3adesalination 3adrinking water 3aencapsulation 3aenergy efficiency 3afreshwater 3aheat 3ahumans 3alithium chloride 3arelative humidity 3aseawater 3asilica 3asolar energy 3asorbents 3asorption 3atemperature 3awater vapor1 aShi, Yusuf1 aWu, Mengchun1 aWang, Wenbin1 aJin, Yong1 aLi, Renyuan1 aShahzad, Muhammad Wakil1 aNg, Kim Choon1 aWang, Peng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Jan. 28, v. 8, no. 4 p.1887-1895dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta11721k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04899naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147242193000168245012502098300001802223520159902241592002803840596006303868650001303931650002003944650001103964650002803975650001504003650002404018650001504042650001704057650002404074650002204098650002504120650001804145651001604163700002904179700001804208700001904226773012904245856008204374852000904456655001204465IND60609049920221119162559.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060904992DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-018-1739-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Sang Yong10aAnalyses des séries chronologiques de variations des paramètres hydrologiques et leurs corrélations dans la zone côtière de Busan, Corée du Sud Análisis de series temporales de las variaciones de los parámetros hidrológicos y sus correlaciones en una zona costera en Busan, Corea del Sur تحلیل السلاسل الزمنیة لتغیرات المعاملات الھیدرولوجیة وارتباطاتها في احدى المناطق الساحلیة في کوریا الجنوبیة.بوسان، বুসান, দক্ষিণ কোরিয়া একটি উপকূলীয় অঞ্চলে সময় সিরিজ সম্পর্কিত জলবাহী প্যারামিটার বৈচিত্র এবং তাদের পারস্পরিক সম্পর্কের বিশ্লেষণ 韩国南部Busan沿海地区水文参数时序分析及相关性 दक्षिण कोरिया के बुसान, में तटीय इलाके में हाइड्रोलॉजिकल पैरामीटर विविधताओं और उनके सहसंबंधों का समय श्रृंखला का विश्लेषण किया गया है 韓国釜山の海岸域における水文パラメーターの変動および相関の時系列分析 대한민국 부산의 해안지역에서 수문인자들의 변동과 상관성에 대한 시계열분석 Análise de series temporais das variações de parâmetros hidrológicos e suas correlações em uma área costeira em Busan, Coréia do Sul Güney Kore, Busan sahilindeki bir alanda hidrolojik parametre değişkenlikleri ve korelasyonlarının zaman serisi analizleri Phân tích chuỗi thời gian về sự thay đổi tham số thủy văn và tương quan của chúng tại một vùng ven biển ở Busan, Hàn Quốc10aTime series analyses of hydrological parameter variations and their correlations at a coastal area in Busan, South Korea  ap. 1875-1885.  aMonitoring and time-series analysis of the hydrological parameters electrical conductivity (EC), water pressure, precipitation and tide were carried out, to understand the characteristics of the parameter variations and their correlations at a coastal area in Busan, South Korea. The monitoring data were collected at a sharp interface between freshwater and saline water at the depth of 25 m below ground. Two well-logging profiles showed that seawater intrusion has largely expanded (progressed inland), and has greatly affected the groundwater quality in a coastal aquifer of tuffaceous sedimentary rock over a 9-year period. According to the time series analyses, the periodograms of the hydrological parameters present very similar trends to the power spectral densities (PSD) of the hydrological parameters. Autocorrelation functions (ACF) and partial autocorrelation functions (PACF) of the hydrological parameters were produced to evaluate their self-correlations. The ACFs of all hydrologic parameters showed very good correlation over the entire time lag, but the PACF revealed that the correlations were good only at time lag 1. Crosscorrelation functions (CCF) were used to evaluate the correlations between the hydrological parameters and the characteristics of seawater intrusion in the coastal aquifer system. The CCFs showed that EC had a close relationship with water pressure and precipitation rather than tide. The CCFs of water pressure with tide and precipitation were in inverse proportion, and the CCF of water pressure with precipitation was larger than that with tide.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016R1D1A3B03934558cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aaquifers 3aautocorrelation 3acoasts 3aelectrical conductivity 3afreshwater 3ageophysical logging 3amonitoring 3asaline water 3asaltwater intrusion 3asedimentary rocks 3atime series analysis 3awater quality 3aSouth Korea1 aSenapathi, Venkatramanan1 aSekar, Selvam1 aKim, Tae Hyung0 tHydrogeology journal.g2018 Sept., v. 26, no. 6 p.1875-1885dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-018-1739-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009800161500001900259520189900278592002802177650002102205650001502226650001402241650001902255650001402274650001402288650001002302650001702312650001902329650001502348650002502363650002602388650001602414700002202430700002502452700002102477773012002498856007302618852000902691655001202700IND60715418620221122032333.0201026e20201010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071541862DNAL7 a10.3390/w121028112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlrousan, Dheaya 10aOrganic Degradation Potential of Real Greywater Using TiO2-Based Advanced Oxidation Processes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn keeping with the circular economy approach, reclaiming greywater (GW) is considered a sustainable approach to local reuse of wastewater and a viable option to reduce household demand for freshwater. This study investigated the mineralization of total organic carbon (TOC) in GW using TiO₂-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in a custom-built stirred tank reactor. The combinations of H₂O₂, O₃, and immobilized TiO₂ under either dark or UVA irradiation conditions were systematically evaluated—namely TiO₂/dark, O₃/dark (ozonation), H₂O₂/dark (peroxidation), TiO₂/UVA (photocatalysis), O₃/UVA (Ozone photolysis), H₂O₂/UVA (photo-peroxidation), O₃/TiO₂/dark (catalytic ozonation), O₃/TiO₂/UVA (photocatalytic ozonation), H₂O₂/TiO₂/dark, H₂O₂/TiO₂/UVA, H₂O₂/O₃/dark (peroxonation), H₂O₂/O₃/UVA (photo-peroxonation), H₂O₂/O₃/TiO₂/dark (catalytic peroxonation), and H₂O₂/O₃/TiO₂/UVA (photocatalytic peroxonation). It was found that combining different treatment methods with UVA irradiation dramatically enhanced the organic mineralization efficiency. The optimum TiO₂ loading in this study was observed to be 0.96 mg/cm² with the highest TOC removal (54%) achieved using photocatalytic peroxonation under optimal conditions (0.96 mg TiO₂/cm², 25 mg O₃/min, and 0.7 H₂O₂/O₃ molar ratio). In peroxonation and photo-peroxonation, the optimal H₂O₂/O₃ molar ratio was identified to be a critical efficiency parameter maximizing the production of reactive radical species. Increasing ozone flow rate or H₂O₂ dosage was observed to cause an efficiency inhibition effect. This lab-based study demonstrates the potential for combined TiO₂-AOP treatments to significantly reduce the organic fraction of real GW, offering potential for the development of low-cost systems permitting safe GW reuse.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular economy 3afreshwater 3agreywater 3amineralization 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3aozone 3aperoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3atotal organic carbon 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater reuse1 aAfkhami, Arsalan 1 aBani-Melhem, Khalid 1 aDunlop, Patrick 0 tWater.g2020 Oct. 10, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121028113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03882naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245016100157300001800318520246100336592002802797650001902825650001902844650001102863650001202874650002302886650000902909650001802918650001502936650001502951650002102966650001902987650002403006650001403030650002403044650005803068650002503126700001503151700001603166700001903182700001403201773012603215856007403341852000903415655001203424IND60656650320221122042946.0190814e20130502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065665032DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay40202a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaojie10aDesign and performance evaluation of ionic liquid-based microwave-assisted simultaneous extraction of kaempferol and quercetin from Chinese medicinal plants  ap. 2591-2601.  aAn ionic liquid-based microwave-assisted extraction (IL-MAE) technique has been successfully developed for the simultaneous effective extraction of quercetin and kaempferol from Toona sinensis and Rosa chinensis which are Chinese medicinal plants. Twenty different types of ionic liquids (ILs) with different cations and anions have been synthesized and investigated. Several significant operating parameters of IL-MAE were optimized by a series of single factor experiments and orthogonal design L₉ (3⁴) experiments, respectively. Compared with ionic liquid-based maceration extraction (IL-ME), ionic liquid-based heat extraction (IL-HE) and ionic liquid-based ultrasound-assisted extraction (IL-UAE), the optimized approach was demonstrated as the optimal technique with the highest extraction efficiency and the shortest extraction time. Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with ultraviolet-detection (UV-DAD) was employed for the simultaneous analysis of kaempferol and quercetin. The results indicated that the extraction amounts of quercetin from Toona sinensis extracted using [Bmim]Br and from Rosa chinensis extracted using [Omim]Br were 176.5 mg g⁻¹ with RSD 1.2% and 134.3 mg g⁻¹ with RSD 0.63%. And the extraction amounts of kaempferol from Toona sinensis extracted using [Bmim]Br and from Rosa chinensis extracted using [Omim]Br were 16.12 mg g⁻¹ with RSD 0.24% and 9.070 mg g⁻¹ with RSD 0.15%. The developed approach for analyzing quercetin was linear between the concentrations of 32.10 mg L⁻¹ to 233.3 mg L⁻¹ in Toona sinensis and 25.70 mg L⁻¹ to 160.5 mg L⁻¹ in Rosa chinensis with the regression coefficients (R) of 0.9998 and 0.9999, respectively. And for kaempferol, the developed approach was linear between the concentrations of 0.73 mg L⁻¹ to 23.20 mg L⁻¹ in Toona sinensis and 0.19 mg L⁻¹ to 15.00 mg L⁻¹ in Rosa chinensis with the regression coefficients (R) of 0.9993 and 0.9996, respectively.

Carrier tests were performed against SARS-CoV-2 at − 20 °C for the four cryogenic disinfectants developed and qRT-PCR was used to test the virus RNA. Peracetic acid, chlorine disinfectants (two different concentrations), and quaternary ammonium disinfectant with their antifreeze can all inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in 5 min at − 20 °C. However, after 2–3 h of exposure, only chlorine disinfectant could destroy SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The viruses treated with peracetic acid and quaternary disinfectants showed positive Ct values even after 3 h detected with qRT-PCR. The conclusion was that the cold-chain disinfectants we tested could inactivate SARS-CoV-2 quickly and effectively, but only chlorine disinfectants could destroy nucleic acids in 3 h. Our study also illustrated that using qRT-PCR detection of viral nucleic acids to assess disinfection was inappropriate.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018ZX10734401-006cNational Major Science and Technology Projects of China  aCXTDB2017012cJiangsu Provincial Commission of Health and Family Planning  aLGY2019074cJiangsu Provincial Commission of Health and Family Planning  aK2019008cJiangsu Provincial Commission of Health and Family Planning  aZDA2020015cJiangsu Provincial Commission of Health  a91743205cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aBE2018745cJiangsu Social Development Project 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3achlorine 3acold chain 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3aperacetic acid 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3atemperature 3atransportation 3avirology 3aviruses 3aChina1 aChen, Yin1 aWang, Ling1 aGuo, Xiling1 aCui, Lunbiao1 aShen, Yiming1 aLi, Fang1 aSun, Hong1 aZhang, Liubo1 aShen, Jin1 aXu, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6485-36490 tFood and environmental virology.g2022 Mar., v. 14, no. 1 p.101-104dSpringer USwJournal:21446x1867-03347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12560-022-09509-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245016300170300001600333520116800349592002801517650001601545650001101561650002501572650001001597650001301607650001301620650001101633650002501644650001401669651001201683653002401695653002701719653003001746653001901776653001801795653001201813700002801825700001801853700002401871700002001895773011601915856008502031852000902116655001202125IND60530583220221122015613.0190412e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053058322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2016.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomoto, Satoshi10aWhole genomic analysis of human and bovine G8P[1] rotavirus strains isolated in Nigeria provides evidence for direct bovine-to-human interspecies transmission  ap. 424-433.  aBovine group A rotavirus (RVA) G8P[1] strains have been rarely detected in humans. Two Nigerian G8P[1] strains, HMG035 (RVA/Human-tc/NGA/HMG035/1999/G8P[1]) and NGRBg8 (RVA/Cow-tc/NGA/NGRBg8/1998/G8P[1]), were previously suggested to have the VP7, VP4, and NSP1 genes of bovine origin. In order to obtain precise information on the origin and evolution of these G8P[1] strains, the complete nucleotide sequences of the whole genomes of strains HMG035 and NGRBg8 were determined and analyzed in the present study. On whole genomic analysis, strains HMG035 and NGRBg8 were found to be very closely related to each other in all the 11 segments, and were found to have a bovine RVA-like genotype constellation (G8-P[1]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A11-N2-T6-E2-H3). Furthermore, on phylogenetic analysis, each of the 11 genes of strains HMG035 and NGRBg8 appeared to be of bovine origin. Thus, strains HMG035 and NGRBg8 were suggested to be derived from a common origin, and strain NGRBg8 was assumed to represent an example of bovine RVA strains that were transmitted to humans. Our findings provide clear evidence for direct bovine-to-human interspecies transmission of RVA strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotavirus A 3acattle 3adisease transmission 3agenes 3agenomics 3agenotype 3ahumans 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aNigeria 0aGroup A rotaviruses 0aWhole genomic analysis 0aInterspecies transmission 0aG8P[1] strains 0aBovine origin 0aNigeria1 aAdah, Mohammed Ignatius1 aIde, Tomihiko1 aYoshikawa, Tetsushi1 aTaniguchi, Koki0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2016 Sept., v. 43 p.424-433dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245008200185300001600267520165900283592002801942650003201970650002102002650001302023650001002036650002002046650003102066650002502097650001402122650001802136650001302154650004002167650003302207650002302240650002002263650002202283650002802305650001402333650002402347700001702371700002102388773009902409856004802508852000902556655001202565IND50069620020221118131241.0130929e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006962002DNAL7 a239041872pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-013-9980-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBondoso, Joana10arpoB gene as a novel molecular marker to infer phylogeny in Planctomycetales   ap. 477-488.  aThe 16S rRNA gene has been used in the last decades as a gold standard for determining the phylogenetic position of bacteria and their taxonomy. It is a well conserved gene, with some variations, present in all bacteria and allows the reconstruction of genealogies of microorganisms. Nevertheless, this gene has its limitations when inferring phylogenetic relationships between closely related isolates. To overcome this problem, DNA-DNA hybridization appeared as a solution to clarify interspecies relationships when the sequence similarity of the 16S rRNA gene is above 97 %. However, this technique is time consuming, expensive and laborious and so, researchers developed other molecular markers such as sequencing of housekeeping or functional genes for accurate determination of bacterial phylogeny. One of these genes that have been used successfully, particularly in clinical microbiology, codes for the beta subunit of the RNA polymerase (rpoB). The rpoB gene is sufficiently conserved to be used as a molecular clock, it is present in all bacteria and it is a mono-copy gene. In this study, rpoB gene sequencing was applied to the phylum Planctomycetes. Based on the genomes of 19 planctomycetes it was possible to determine the correlation between the rpoB gene sequence and the phylogenetic position of the organisms at a 95-96 % sequence similarity threshold for a novel species. A 1200-bp fragment of the rpoB gene was amplified from several new planctomycetal isolates and their intra and inter-species relationships to other members of this group were determined based on a 96.3 % species border and 98.2 % for intraspecies resolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aPlanctomycetales 3abacteria 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3ataxonomy 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Amplification 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetic Variation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16S1 aHarder, Jens1 aLage, Olga Maria0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2013 Oct., v. 104, no. 4 p.477-488dSpringer-Verlagx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-013-9980-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010500162300001400267520141200281592002801693650001701721650001901738650001101757650002601768650001101794650001201805650001001817650001901827650001901846650002001865650001701885653002201902653004001924653002701964653002001991700001202011700001902023700001202042700001602054700001702070700001202087700001802099700001602117700001902133773010002152856008302252852000902335655001202344IND60758303320221121064145.0220214e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075830332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2021.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Hui10aNovel cerium-based MOFs photocatalyst for photocarrier collaborative performance under visible light  ap. 74-83.  aA novel cerium-based metal–organic framework crystal (Ce-TBAPy) was developed via a one-pot solvothermal method. Interestingly, the Ce-TBAPy photocatalyst material demonstrated an enhanced collaborative photoredox performance in terms of acetaldehyde degradation and water reduction, and the photoreaction rates of Ce-TBAPy shown about 5.06-times and 3.94-times higher, respectively, than those when untreated H₄TBAPy was used. A significant finding is that the apparent quantum efficiency value of Ce-TBAPy for CO₂ generation from CH₃CHO decomposition performs 5.12% at 420 nm. The accumulation of abundant separated holes on the pyrene macrocycles could oxidize CH₃CHO to CO₂ easily. Meanwhile, cerium integration with TBAPy⁴⁻ ligands to form a π-conjugated construction further resulted in sufficient photoinduced electrons and exhibited effective interfacial charge separation, which harvesting the reduction of H₂O to H₂ efficiently. The electronic localization influence arising from the formation of –COO-Ce functional groups in Ce-TBAPy and the direction of electron migration in the photocatalytic system were further confirmed by DFT calculation. This work provides an effective strategy to obtain rare earth-based MOF photocatalysts with dual redox functions and holds promise for advancing the prospect of using MOF materials to convert solar energy into chemical energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaldehyde 3acarbon dioxide 3acerium 3acoordination polymers 3aenergy 3aligands 3alight 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aredox reactions 3asolar energy 0aCerium-based MOFs 0aEnhanced charge-transfer efficiency 0aAcetaldehyde oxidation 0aWater reduction1 aJia, Lu1 aZhang, Zhipeng1 aXu, Bin1 aLiu, Zailun1 aZhang, Qitao1 aCao, Yu1 aNan, Zhaodong1 aZhang, Ming1 aOhno, Teruhisa0 tJournal of catalysis.g2022 Jan., v. 405 p.74-83dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2021.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001500156245008400171300001800255520092100273592002801194650001401222650001701236650003801253650000901291650002201300650001801322650000901340650001301349650001401362650003101376650001101407650001501418650001701433700001401450700001801464700001701482700001701499700001501516700001401531700001601545700001901561700001501580700001601595773008601611856009001697852000901787655001201796IND60090289320221122165253.0141102e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009028932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.09.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Weiwei10aAu@Pt nanostructures as oxidase and peroxidase mimetics for use in immunoassays  ap. 1139-1147.  aIn this paper, we demonstrated that Au nanorods coated with a shell composed of Pt nanodots (Au@Pt nanostructures) exhibited intrinsic oxidase-like, peroxidase-like and catalase-like activity, catalyzing oxygen and hydrogen peroxide reduction and the dismutation decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to produce oxygen.

Risk‐based prioritization approaches, employing models to derive exposure concentrations, are commonly used, but the reliability of these models is unclear. The present study evaluated the accuracy of exposure models commonly used for pharmaceutical prioritization. Targeted monitoring was conducted for 95 pharmaceuticals in the Rivers Foss and Ouse in the City of York (UK). Predicted environmental concentration (PEC) ranges were estimated based on localized prescription, hydrological data, reported metabolism, and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) removal rates, and were compared with measured environmental concentrations (MECs). For the River Foss, PECs, obtained using highest metabolism and lowest WWTP removal, were similar to MECs. In contrast, this trend was not observed for the River Ouse, possibly because of pharmaceutical inputs unaccounted for by our modeling. Pharmaceuticals were ranked by risk based on either MECs or PECs. With 2 exceptions (dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine), risk ranking based on both MECs and PECs produced similar results in the River Foss. Overall, these findings indicate that PECs may well be appropriate for prioritization of pharmaceuticals in the environment when robust and local data on the system of interest are available and reflective of most source inputs.

We aimed to assess the efficacy of supplementing calcium-containing Eggshell Powder (ESP) on F absorption using urine F excretion and on fluorosis symptoms. In total, 82 women (41 Intervention Group, IG; 41 Control Group, CG) were recruited; overall, 39 in each group completed the trial. Morning spot urine was collected before (baseline, BL) and after (endline, EL) the intervention that was 6-months daily supplementation with 2.4 g ESP (providing ~1000 mg of calcium). Dental, skeletal, and non-skeletal fluorosis assessments was carried out at BL and, except for dental, at EL. Relative risk (RR) and linear generalized estimating equation were used to compare outcomes between groups. At BL, urinary F excretion in the IG and CG groups was similar, ~10 mg/L. At EL, urinary F excretion in IG women was six-fold lower (β = −6.1 (95% CI: −7.1, −5.1)) compared to CG. The risk of developing skeletal and non-skeletal fluorosis were significantly (p < 0.001) reduced in the intervention group. A significant reduction in urinary F excretion and reduction in many fluorosis symptoms were observed among women supplemented with calcium-containing ESP, thus providing evidence for using this dietary calcium source for mitigation of fluorosis.

The feasibility and performance of this unique system were demonstrated by enzyme pretreatment of Cnidium monnieri, used as the model sample. To investigate enzymatic pretreatment assisted by infrared energy, experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects that enzyme type, pH and the concentration of the enzyme solution, incubation time and temperature have upon the enzymatic activity. Statistical treatment of the results revealed that the selected parameters were all significant. The optimum parameters were obtained as follows: 0.2 mg ml⁻¹ pectinase solution, and incubated at pH 6.0 for 2 min at 35 °C. At optimized conditions, the extraction yields of osthole and imperatorin were 18.11 mg g⁻¹ and 7.27 mg g⁻¹ in pectinase treated sample, increased by 10.2% and 7.9%, respectively, compared with those in the control group. The results also showed that using infrared radiation as an energy source, the efficiency of enzyme pretreatment was significantly enhanced compared with conventional water bath assisted enzymatic pretreatment (p < 0.05), and the extraction rates of osthole and imperatorin by infrared-assisted extraction were significantly higher than those obtained with ultrasound-assisted extraction (p < 0.05). More importantly, the enzymatic pretreatment time was significantly shortened to 2 min of infrared assisted enzymatic pretreatment from 1 h of traditional water bath assisted enzymatic pretreatment. With the advantage of environment-friendliness, low cost, easy operation and high efficiency, the present enzyme pretreatment setup will find wide applications in enzyme pretreatment for natural product extraction in large scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCnidium monnieri 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aanalytical methods 3abioactive compounds 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3ainfrared radiation 3amodels 3apH 3apolygalacturonase 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment1 aNing, Suli1 aLi, Yan1 aYu, Yingjia1 aDuan, Gengli0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Sept. 26, v. 5, no. 20 p.5669-5676dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay40204e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245011700159300001800276520117400294592002801468650001501496650001601511650001701527650001501544650002301559650001501582650002101597653003701618653003101655653001901686653003001705653002101735700001301756700001501769700001601784700001601800700001901816773012401835856008001959852000902039655001202048IND60565347620221120231835.0170323e20170322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056534762DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b141472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Lei10aNiobium-Doped (001)-Dominated Anatase TiO2 Nanosheets as Photoelectrode for Efficient Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells  ap. 9576-9583.  aTiO₂ nanocrystals with different reactive facets have attracted extensive interest since they were first synthesized. The anatase TiO₂ nanocrystals with (001) or (100) dominate facets were considered to be excellent electrode materials to enhance the cell performance of dye-sensitized solar cells. However, which reactive facet presents the best surface for benefiting photovoltaic effect is still unknown. We report a systematic study of various anatase TiO₂ surfaces interacting with N719 dye by means of density functional theory calculations in combination with microscopic techniques. The (001) surface interacting with N719 would have the lowest work function, leading to the best photovoltaic performances. To further increase the efficiency, Nb dopant was incorporated into the anatase TiO₂ nanocrystals. Based on the theoretical prediction, we proposed and demonstrated novel Nb-doped (001)-dominated anatase TiO₂ nanosheets as photoelectrode in a dye-sensitized solar cell to further enhance the open-circuit voltage. And a power conversion efficiency of 10% was achieved, which was 22% higher than that of the undoped device (P25 as an electrode).  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrodes 3amethodology 3ananocrystals 3ananosheets 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aprediction 3atitanium dioxide 0aniobium-doped titania nanosheets 0adye-sensitized solar cells 0awork functions 0adensity functional theory 0afirst-principles1 aSun, Lei1 aYang, Dong1 aZhang, Jian1 aLi, Ya-Juan1 aDeng, Wei-Qiao0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 22, v. 9, no. 11 p.9576-9583dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b141473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03696naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245015200164520227100316592002802587650002302615650002102638650001502659650001602674650002002690650002802710650002002738650004102758650002502799650002302824650004002847650001002887650001202897650001702909700002402926700003702950700002202987700002103009700002503030773012303055856007503178852000903253655001203262IND60760774120221117160730.0211223e20211130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076077412DNAL7 a10.3390/nu131243392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurawska, Karolina 10aRelationship between Serum Angiopoietin-like Proteins 3 and 8 and Atherogenic Lipid Biomarkers in Non-Diabetic Adults Depends on Gender and Obesity  aHypertriglyceridemia is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays an essential role in the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs). Angiopoietin-like proteins ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 are shown to be important regulators of LPL activity. Increased concentrations of these proteins may reflect cardiovascular risk, and the treatment of patients with dyslipidemia with ANGPTLs inhibitors may decrease this risk. We assessed the gender-specific relationships of serum ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 with atherogenic lipid biomarkers and obesity in non-diabetic adults. The study comprised 238 participants aged 25–74 [122 with triglycerides (TG) <150 mg/dL (<1.7 mmol/L) and 116 with hypertriglyceridemia]. Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, TG, C-reactive protein (CRP), glycated hemoglobin, apolipoprotein B, small dense LDL-C (sd-LDL-C), ANGPTL3, and ANGPTL8 were measured. Non-HDL-cholesterol, remnant cholesterol (remnant-C) concentrations, and body mass index (BMI) were calculated. Results: Women and men did not differ in terms of age, CRP levels, the percentage of obese subjects, and concentrations of atherogenic lipid biomarkers, except higher TG in males and higher ANGPTL3 concentrations in females. Positive correlations of both ANGPTLs with TG, remnant-C, and sdLDL-C levels were found in females. In males, only ANGPTL3 correlated positively with atherogenic biomarkers, but there were no correlations with ANGPTL8. Concentrations of ANGPTL3 were higher in obese men, whereas ANGPTL8 levels were higher in obese women. In women alone, ANGPTL8 showed very good discrimination power to identify subjects with hypertriglyceridemia (AUC = 0.83). Contrary to this, ANGPTL3 was a better discriminator of hypertriglyceridemia (AUC = 0.78) in male subjects. Regression models, adjusted for age, sex, and BMI showed a weak but significant effect of ANGPTL8 to increase the risk of hypertriglyceridemia. Conclusions: In females, ANGPTL8 is more strongly associated with TRLs metabolism, whereas in males, ANGPTL3 plays a more important role. We suggest sex differences be taken into consideration when applying new therapies with angiopoietin-like proteins inhibitors in the treatment of dyslipidemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aapolipoprotein B 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3acoronary artery disease 3aglycohemoglobin 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahypertriglyceridemia 3alipoprotein lipase 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amales 3aobesity 3arisk factors1 aKrintus, Magdalena 1 aKuligowska-Prusinska, Magdalena 1 aSzternel, Lukasz 1 aStefanska, Anna 1 aSypniewska, Grazyna 0 tNutrients.g2021 Nov. 30, v. 13, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131243393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147242052000168245012600688300001800814520173700832592002802569650001302597650001302610650001802623650002702641650001502668650001402683650001702697650001702714651001002731700001802741700002202759773012902781856008202910852000902992655001203001IND60609050020221120073446.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060905002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-018-1722-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiswal, Sabinaya10aCaractérisation hydrogéologique et hydraulique des formations aquifères et non aquifères des terrains latéritiques (Bengale occidental, Inde) Caracterización hidrogeológica e hidráulica de capas acuíferas y no acuíferas en un terreno laterítico (Bengala occidental, India) 红土地区含水层和非含水层的水文地质和水力特性(西孟加拉邦,印度) Caracterização hidrogeológica e hidráulica de camadas aquíferas e não aquíferas em um terreno laterítico (Bengala Ocidental, Índia)10aHydrogeologic and hydraulic characterization of aquifer and nonaquifer layers in a lateritic terrain (West Bengal, India)  ap. 1947-1973.  aThe hydrogeologic and hydraulic characteristics of a lateritic terrain in West Bengal, India, were investigated. Test drilling was conducted at ten sites and grain-size distribution curves (GSDCs) were prepared for 275 geologic samples. Performance evaluation of eight grain-size-analysis (GSA) methods was carried out to estimate the hydraulic conductivity (K) of subsurface formations. Finally, the GSA results were validated against pumping-test data. The GSDCs indicated that shallow aquifer layers are coarser than the deeper aquifer layers (uniformity coefficient 0.19–11.4). Stratigraphy analysis revealed that both shallow and deep aquifers of varying thickness exist at depths 9–40 and 40–79 m, respectively. The mean K estimates by the GSA methods are 3.62–292.86 m/day for shallow aquifer layers and 0.97–209.93 m/day for the deeper aquifer layers, suggesting significant aquifer heterogeneity. Pumping-test data indicated that the deeper aquifers are leaky confined with transmissivity 122.69–693.79 m²/day, storage coefficient 1.01 × 10⁻⁷–2.13 × 10⁻⁴ and leakance 2.01 × 10⁻⁷–34.56 × 10⁻² day⁻¹. Although the K values yielded by the GSA methods are generally larger than those obtained from the pumping tests, the Slichter, Harleman and US Bureau Reclamation (USBR) GSA methods yielded reasonable values at most of the sites (1–3 times higher than K estimates by the pumping-test method). In conclusion, more reliable aquifers exist at deeper depths that can be tapped for dependable water supply. GSA methods such as Slichter, Harleman and USBR can be used for the preliminary assessment of K in lateritic terrains in the absence of reliable field methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adrilling 3afield methods 3ahydraulic conductivity 3alandscapes 3alaterites 3astratigraphy 3awater supply 3aIndia1 aJha, Madan K.1 aSharma, Shashi P.0 tHydrogeology journal.g2018 Sept., v. 26, no. 6 p.1947-1973dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-018-1722-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015300164300001600317520148700333592002801820650002501848650002701873650001501900650002501915650003601940650001001976650001501986650001002001650001502011650001102026650001202037650001202049650002902061650001802090650001102108650002402119650002402143650001202167650001202179651001002191700001102201700001702212700001602229700001802245700001602263700001802279773010902297856008102406852000902487655001202496IND60586685920221121054907.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058668592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-017-0396-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Luhong10aShrub-encroachment induced alterations in input chemistry and soil microbial community affect topsoil organic carbon in an Inner Mongolian grassland  ap. 311-324.  aShrub encroachment frequently occurs in arid and semi-arid grasslands worldwide and affects the regional carbon balance. Many previous studies have revealed the effects of shrub encroachment on bulk carbon content of grasslands, but molecular evidence is surprisingly lacking. In this study, we examined the chemical composition of plant tissues and soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil microbial communities to identify the effects of shrub (Caragana microphylla) encroachment on SOC storage in the top layer (0–10 cm) along a gradient of natural shrub cover in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. We found that SOC in the shrub patches was derived mainly from leaves, whereas SOC in the grassy matrix was composed of a mixture of fresh root- and leaf-derived compounds. Compared with pure grassland, the SOC decreased by 29% in the shrub-encroached grasslands (SEGs), and this decrease was enhanced by increasing shrub cover. We also found that free lipids and lignin-derived phenols increased while the ratios of ω-C₁₈/∑C₁₈ and suberin/cutin decreased with increasing shrub cover. In addition, the ratios of fungal to bacterial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and gram-negative to gram-positive bacterial PLFAs decreased with increasing shrub cover. These results indicate that the encroachment of nitrogen-rich legume shrubs can lead to carbon loss by altering the chemical composition of plant inputs as well as the soil microbial community in grassland ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaragana microphylla 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aarid lands 3acarbon sequestration 3achemical constituents of plants 3acutin 3aecosystems 3afungi 3agrasslands 3aleaves 3alegumes 3aphenols 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aplant tissues 3ashrubs 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil organic carbon 3asuberin 3atopsoil 3aChina1 aLi, He1 aShen, Haihua1 aXu, Yunping1 aWang, Yinghui1 aXing, Aijun1 aFang, Jingyun0 tBiogeochemistry.g2017 Dec., v. 136, no. 3 p.311-324dSpringer International Publishingx0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-017-0396-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245008500156300001800241500002000259520166800279592002801947650001801975650001201993650002102005650002602026650001502052650001202067650002202079650001102101650002202112650001702134650001402151650000902165700001902174773012302193856007202316852000902388655001202397IND60580727620221117162842.0170927e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058072762DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.38302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez, Edgar,10aChronic toxicity of binary‐metal mixtures of cadmium and zinc to Daphnia magna  ap. 2739-2749.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe present study characterized the chronic effect of binary‐metal mixtures of cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) on Daphnia magna. The titration design was chosen to characterize the 21‐d chronic effects of the binary‐metal mixtures on survival, growth, reproduction, and metal accumulation in D. magna. Using this design, increasing concentrations of Zn (10, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 μg/L) were titrated against a constant concentration of 1.5 μg/L Cd. The results demonstrated that Cd was highly toxic to D. magna. In a mixture with Cd and Zn, sublethal concentrations of 10 and 20 μg/L Zn were insufficient to protect D. magna from chronic Cd toxicity, whereas mixtures containing 40, 80, and 120 μg/L Zn provided strong protective effects to D. magna at all endpoints and resulted in less‐than‐additive effects. At higher Zn concentrations, such as 160 and 200 μg/L, Zn appeared to contribute to the toxicity. The less‐than‐additive effects observed in the Cd–Zn mixture can be explained by the decrease in body Cd concentration when the Zn concentration was increased in the exposure media. Embryos analyzed for morphological alterations in the Cd–Zn mixtures demonstrated severe developmental defects. The effect of Cd on undeveloped embryos while both Zn and Cd are present in the organisms raises a question of whether the competitive binding mechanism of Zn and Cd is still happening at the cellular level in the organisms. The results of the present study are useful for development of the biotic ligand model and environmental quality guidelines for metal mixtures.

The study aimed at evaluating changes in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) metabolism and biosynthesis of the lipid mediators N-acylethanolamines (NAE), as indices of nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α activation. The observational study was performed on 35 subjects (27 female, 8 male) with obesity, undergoing bariatric surgery. We assessed plasma FA and NAE profiles by LC-MS/MS, clinical parameters and anthropometric measures before and 1 and 6 months after bariatric surgery. One month after bariatric surgery, as body weight and clinical parameters improved significantly, we found higher plasma levels of N-oleoylethanolamine, arachidonic and a 22:6-n3/20:5-n3 ratio as evidence of PPAR-α activation. These changes corresponded to higher circulating levels of NEFA and a steep reduction of the fat mass. After 6 months 22:6-n3/20:5-n3 remained elevated and fat mass was further reduced. Our data suggest that the massive release of NEFA from adipose tissue at 1-Post, possibly by inducing PPAR-α, may enhance FA metabolism contributing to fat depot reduction and improved metabolic parameters in the early stage. However, PUFA metabolic changes favor n6 PUFA biosynthesis, requiring a nutritional strategy aimed at reducing the n6/n3 PUFA ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3abariatric surgery 3abiosynthesis 3afatty acid metabolism 3afemales 3amales 3aobesity 3aobservational studies1 aPintus, Stefano 1 aMurru, Elisabetta 1 aFantola, Giovanni 1 aVincis, Michela 1 aBatetta, Barbara 1 aMoroni, Enrico 1 aCarta, Gianfranca 1 aBanni, Sebastiano 0 tNutrients.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 13, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131243403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04191naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245014300169520195100312592002802263650002002291650005302311650001602364650002002380650001302400650001402413650001802427650001602445650001602461650001902477650001102496650001702507650001102524650001902535650001502554650001102569650001502580650001202595650002402607650000902631653000902640653001002649653001102659653001002670653001002680653001002690653001002700653001202710653001202722653001202734653001202746653001002758653000702768653000702775653000802782653000802790653000902798653000802807653000802815653000902823653000802832653000802840653001102848653003002859653003802889653001702927653001102944653003902955700001202994700001703006700001403023700001903037700001803056700001603074700001903090773011903109856008803228852000903316655001203325IND60732739020221122015401.0220103e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073273902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1465632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Zhengyu10aSerum lipids mediate the relationship of multiple polyaromatic hydrocarbons on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: A population-based study  aPolyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are recognized as organic pollutants with liver toxicity. However, the relationship between PAHs and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is unclear in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of PAHs in the US population and their association with the risk of NAFLD. We investigated urinary levels of nine PAHs in 2436 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2005 and 2012, including 1-Hydroxynapthalene (1-OHN), 2-Hydroxynapthalene (2-OHN), 3-Hydroxyfluorene (3-OHF), 2-Hydroxyfluorene (2-OHF), 3-Hydroxyphenanthrene (3-OHPhe), 1-Hydroxyphenanthrene (1-OHPhe), 2-Hydroxyphenanthrene (2-OHPhe), 1-Hydroxypyrene (1-OHPyr), 9-Hydroxyfluorene (9-OHF). Logistic regression models were used to estimate the relationship between single PAH and NAFLD. Assessment of the overall effect of multiple PAH mixtures on NAFLD using Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) model. There were 698 participants diagnosed with NAFLD in the study group. After adjusting for related covariates such as sex, age, race, education, marital status, poverty income ratio (PIR), body mass index (BMI), total energy intake, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes, logistic regression analysis showed that compared to the low tertile (T1), the odds ratio of the high tertile (T3) was 1.70 (95%CI: 1.26–2.29, p = 0.001) for total PAHs, 1.50 (95%CI: 1.11–2.03, p = 0.008) for 2-OHN, 1.75 (95%CI: 1.31–2.34, p < 0.001) for 2-OHPhe, 1.59 (95%CI: 1.18–2.14, p = 0.002) for 9-OHF and 0.63 (95%CI: 0.46–0.87, p = 0.004) for 3-OHF. In the BKMR model, we found that the overall effect of the nine PAH mixtures was positively associated with the risk of NAFLD. Mediation analysis showed that HDL and TG mediated the association between PAHs and NAFLD. Our study suggests that multiple PAHs mixtures exposure may induce NAFLD by mediating serum lipids in human metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3adiabetes 3aeducation 3aenergy intake 3aenvironment 3afatty liver 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahumans 3ahypertension 3aincome 3amarital status 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aodds ratio 3apoverty 3aregression analysis 3arisk 0aPAHs 0aNAFLD 0aNHANES 0a1-OHN 0a2-OHN 0a3-OHF 0a2-OHF 0a3-OHPhe 0a1-OHPhe 0a2-OHPhe 0a1-OHPyr 0a9-OHF 0aTC 0aTG 0aHDL 0aLDL 0aBKMR 0aPIR 0aBMI 0aNASH 0aHBV 0aHCV 0aUS-FLI 0aPolyaromatic hydrocarbons 0aNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease 0aSerum lipids 0aNHANES 0aBayesian kernel machine regression1 aLi, Yan1 aYang, Yuexin1 aYu, Weidi1 aXie, Wangcheng1 aSong, Guodong1 aQian, Yaqin1 aSong, Zhenshun0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 780 p.146563-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1465633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011400159300001800273520114700291592002801438650001101466650001201477650001601489650002501505650002401530700001501554700002001569700001501589700001701604700001101621700001701632700001501649700001901664773014101683856007401824852000901898655001201907IND60682662720221119020834.0200130e20200128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068266272DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta11901a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Longquan10aDiscovery of low-temperature GeTe-based thermoelectric alloys with high performance competing with Bi₂Te₃  ap. 1660-1667.  aMuch effort has recently been put into developing high-performance low-temperature thermoelectric materials for waste-heat recovery and thermoelectric cooling. Here, we report an unusual enhancement of low-temperature figure of merit (ZT) in quenched p-type GeTe-based alloys. The average ZT within the low-temperature range (300–473 K) for the as-synthesized quenched GeTe-based alloys can reach 1.1, which is even better than that of the state-of-the-art commercial Bi₀.₅Sb₁.₅Te₃ ingots. Moreover, the as-synthesized samples also show superior thermoelectric performance in the mid-temperature range, demonstrating great promise for thermoelectric applications in a broad temperature range. The Ge-vacancy arrays can serve as high-speed channels with low effective mass for carrier transport but obstacles for phonon transport, resulting in increased carrier mobility and reduced lattice thermal conductivity simultaneously for high ZT in the as-synthesized quenched GeTe-based alloys. These findings provide an intriguing way to enhance ZT and to develop low-temperature thermoelectric materials beyond Bi₂Te₃-based alloys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acooling 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 3awaste heat recovery1 aLi, Junqin1 aZhang, Chunxiao1 aDing, Teng1 aXie, Yucheng1 aLi, Yu1 aLiu, Fusheng1 aAo, Weiqin1 aZhang, Chaohua0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Jan. 28, v. 8, no. 4 p.1660-1667dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta11901a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008700169300001600256500001500272520165700287592002801944650002301972650003101995650001102026650001302037650001102050650002002061650002102081650001502102650002302117650001502140650000902155650002902164650001902193650001502212650002002227650002002247650001302267650001102280651003102291653001302322700002102335700002302356700001802379700002002397700002002417700001602437700002302453700002002476700001802496773010902514856008102623852000902704655001202713IND60586686020221121054834.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058668602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-017-0394-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajidzadeh, Hamed10aExtreme flooding mobilized dissolved organic matter from coastal forested wetlands  ap. 293-309.  a2019-12-06  aTwo intense rainfalls [Hurricane Joaquin (2015) and Hurricane Matthew (2016)], one year apart, provided a unique opportunity to examine changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics in coastal blackwater rivers under extreme flooding conditions in the southeastern United States. Two sites along Waccamaw River (a coastal blackwater river) and the outflow of 18 sub-basins of Yadkin-Pee Dee Basin were sampled during and after the flooding events. The peaks of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations were observed 18 and 23 days after peak discharge in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Moreover, DOM aromaticity and abundance of humic substances significantly increased during the same period. Separation of discharge hydrograph into surface runoff and subsurface flow suggested that temporal changes were mainly due to contributions from subsurface flow flushing organic matter from wetlands and organic-rich riparian zones. The spatial analysis highlighted the key role of the forested wetlands as the only land use that significantly correlated with both DOM quantity (DOC and DON load) and DOM composition (i.e., aromaticity). The Yadkin-Pee Dee River basin alone exported more than 474 million kg DOC into the ocean during high-flow conditions from the 2016 event, indicating that such extreme short-term events mobilized enormous amounts of organic carbon and nitrogen to the ocean. Considering the predicted increase in frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events in the eastern U.S., the results of this study can shed light on changes in DOM dynamics that may occur under such conditions in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemporal variation 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3abasins 3awetlands 3arivers 3asubsurface flow 3ahumic substances 3ahydrograph 3aflooded conditions 3awatersheds 3arain 3adissolved organic carbon 3ariparian areas 3ahurricanes 3abiogeochemistry 3alowland forests 3aland use 3arunoff 3aSoutheastern United States 0anitrogen1 aUzun, Habibullah1 aRuecker, Alexander1 aMiller, David1 aVernon, Jeffery1 aZhang, Hongyuan1 aBao, Shaowu1 aTsui, Martin T.

Based on ewe specific CE peak, we developed a method for ewe milk quantification in ovine/bovine skimmed milk mixtures, which showed good linearity, precision and accuracy, and a minimum amount of detectable fraudulent cow milk equal to 5%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulterated products 3ablood 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acattle 3achromatography 3aewe milk 3aewes 3afraud 3ahumans 3amilk proteins 3aprotein composition 3askim milk 3aurine 0aCapillary electrophoresis 0aMilk adulteration 0aMilk proteins1 aMorittu, Valeria Maria1 aCicino, Caterina1 aPalmieri, Camillo1 aBritti, Domenico0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2017.08.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011200153300001800265520123300283592002801516650002801544650001301572650002101585650001701606650001101623650001301634650003001647650001301677700001401690700001401704700002201718773012701740856007401867852000901941655001201950IND60656650820221122042920.0190814e20130314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065665082DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay40213d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz, C.10aAffinity analysis between immobilized l-arginine and plasmid isoforms provided by surface plasmon resonance  ap. 1682-1686.  aA strategy for studying the binding mode of plasmid isoforms to an immobilized amino acid as a model support has been developed using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The binding of l-arginine to plasmid isoforms of pGL101, pUC19 and pVAX1-LacZ (supercoiled, open-circular and linear) is examined by measuring the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD). l-Arginine was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip and bound to plasmid isoforms with similar SPR binding profiles (square-shaped) and binding affinities ranging between 10⁻⁴ and 10⁻⁹ M. There are significant differences in the apparent affinity that is correlated with the three plasmids (2.39, 2.69 and 6.05 kbp). pGL101 shows the highest binding on the arginine surface followed by pVAX1-LacZ, while pUC19 shows the lowest binding. For the three plasmid isoforms, the supercoiled ones have the higher binding affinity to the arginine surface. Different buffer environments affect the interaction strength with an increase in response for Tris–HCl and a marked decrease for high salt concentrations. The knowledge of the affinity parameters is expected to provide further insights into the effect of plasmid topology on the purification by affinity chromatography.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffinity chromatography 3aarginine 3abinding capacity 3adissociation 3amodels 3aplasmids 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atopology1 aSousa, A.1 aSousa, F.1 aQueiroz, João A.0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Mar. 14, v. 5, no. 7 p.1682-1686dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay40213d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04050naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245011200172520200100284592002802285650002402313650001402337650001702351650002002368650002102388650002302409650001802432650001702450650001702467650001902484650001502503650001602518650001602534650001902550650001502569650001802584653001802602653001402620653001102634653001602645653000902661653001202670653000802682653000802690653000802698653000802706653001002714653000902724653000702733653000702740653000902747653001202756653001202768653000702780653000702787653000702794653000802801653000802809653000702817653000802824653000802832653000702840653000902847653000802856653000802864653000802872653000802880653000902888653000802897653000802905653000902913700002002922700002102942700001702963773011902980856008803099852000903187655001203196IND60732739320221122015120.0220103e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073273932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1465692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMbachu, Oluchi14aThe rise of artificial soil carbon inputs: Reviewing microplastic pollution effects in the soil environment  aThe surge in the use of plastic materials, its poor handling and disposal have led to an increase in microplastic pollution in terrestrial environments. Microplastic pollution in soils is of concern due to potential influences on soil properties which play a critical role in plant growth and soil fertility. Moreover, the soil environment is a key nexus linking the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and lithosphere, and thus represents a crucial conduit for pollutant migration from the anthroposphere. In this review we evaluate the effects of microplastics in the soil environment with a specific focus on physical properties and biological function in the rhizosphere. Our review reveals that agricultural sources, particularly plastic mulches and waste applications, represent the main source of soil microplastic inputs. Once in the soil environment, microplastic effects on soil properties are highly variable depending mainly on soil type and microplastic characteristics. Soil properties relating to erosion-risk (i.e., bulk density), structural integrity (i.e., aggregate stability, particularly micro-aggregate stability), and water-storage capacity (i.e., evaporation rate, desiccation) are generally adversely impacted by soil microplastic inputs. Soil microplastic effects on rhizosphere function (i.e., plant health and microbial activity) are remarkably varied with some studies revealing positive impacts, such as enhanced plant-symbiotic fungi associations, from soil plastic additions. However, all identified publications reported at least one detrimental MP-induced impact on plant responses. Finally, our review revealed associations between microplastic properties and soil functional parameters – in particular, polymer size and morphology control soil water-holding properties whereas polymer type influences plant response. These associations will be helpful in targeting future research directions on this important topic that intersects all of the Earth's spheres.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggregate stability 3abiosphere 3abulk density 3aedaphic factors 3aevaporation rate 3amicrobial activity 3amicroplastics 3aplant growth 3aplant health 3aplant response 3apollutants 3arhizosphere 3asoil carbon 3asoil fertility 3asoil types 3awater storage 0aMicroplastics 0aPollution 0aPlants 0aRhizosphere 0aSoil 0aChl-a/b 0aDOC 0aDOM 0aDON 0aDOP 0aFDAse 0aHDPE 0aHC 0aMP 0aNH4+ 0aNO3−N 0aNO2−N 0aOM 0aPA 0aPE 0aPES 0aPLA 0aPS 0aPET 0aPVC 0aPP 0aPMMA 0aPMF 0aTDN 0aTDP 0aURE 0asBio 0aSOM 0aWHC 0aWEOM1 aJenkins, Graham1 aKaparaju, Prasad1 aPratt, Chris0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 780 p.146569-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1465693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245012300179520107700302592002801379650001701407650001301424650001101437650002301448650001501471650002401486650002501510650001401535653002101549653001501570653002801585653002301613653001501636700003901651700002701690700003801717700002001755773012501775856008501900852000901985655001201994IND60678405020221120201821.0200103e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067840502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2019.1051402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos Costa, Daniel10aIRIS-GRAPE: An approach for prediction of quality attributes in vineyard grapes inspired by iris biometric recognition  aThe determination of the period of harvest is essential in the vineyard. For that, attributes of quality such as Total Soluble Solids (TSS) and phenolic compounds are constantly monitored along the maturation. This work proposes a new non-destructive approach for prediction of TSS, total anthocyanins and yellow flavonoids using RGB images, called IRIS-GRAPE. It is inspired by the process of biometric recognition using the iris. In order to validate the proposed approach, a study comparing its performance with the traditional method was performed, using the average of RGB pixel values of the region of interest (ROI) as input variables for a multiple linear regression. The study used two performance evaluation metrics: the correlation coefficient (rP) and the mean square error (MSE). In order to compare the performance differences between the proposed approach, IRIS-GRAPE, and the traditional approach, hypothesis tests were done. The results show that the proposed approach has a superior performance than the traditional method with a confidence level of 95%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3abiometry 3agrapes 3aphenolic compounds 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3atotal soluble solids 3avineyards 0aIris recognition 0aRGB images 0aNon-destructive methods 0aQuality attributes 0aRegression1 ade Oliveira Neto, Rosalvo Ferreira1 aRamos, Rodrigo Pereira1 ada Silva Oliveira, Victor Gustavo1 aTeruel, Barbara0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2020 Jan., v. 168 p.105140-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2019.1051403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012700156300001800283520119500301592002801496650001201524650002001536650001801556650001601574650004301590650001201633650005301645650002001698650000701718650002401725650001601749650001101765650002701776650001301803700001701816700001601833700001201849700001801861773012801879856007402007852000902081655001202090IND60656650920221122053359.0190814e20130613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065665092DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay40214b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qian10aDetermination of trans-resveratrol in grape seed by coupling liquid extraction with micellar electrokinetic chromatography  ap. 3418-3421.  aA new method for the determination of trans-resveratrol in grape seed was developed by coupling liquid extraction (LE) and micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). LE was employed for sample preparation and MEKC for analytical separation. The solvent used for LE was ethyl acetate and the buffer for MEKC consisted of 25 mM borate containing 25 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 2.5 mM sodium salt sulfated-β-cyclodextrin at pH 9.0. The limit of detection (S/N = 3) was found to be 4.62 × 10⁻⁷ g ml⁻¹. Linear regression of peak area versus concentration of resveratrol was checked with the r squared being greater than 0.99 for resveratrol at a concentration range of 9.25 × 10⁻⁶ g ml⁻¹ to 4.63 × 10⁻² g ml⁻¹. The recoveries were over 90% for the determination of resveratrol in grape seed samples. The method developed can be an attractive alternative to the HPLC methods reported in the literature for the determination of resveratrol in grape seed with the advantages of a reduction of analysis time and operation cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the determination of resveratrol in grape seed based on coupling LE and MEKC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aborates 3adetection limit 3aethyl acetate 3agrape seeds 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aliquids 3amicellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography 3aoperating costs 3apH 3aregression analysis 3aresveratrol 3asodium 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asolvents1 aQian, Xuede,1 aHe, Hai-Bo.1 aAn, Yan1 aWang, Tianlin0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 June 13, v. 5, no. 13 p.3418-3421dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay40214b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011000167300001600277500001100293500001500304520110300319592002801422650001801450650001301468650001801481650001901499650001301518650002001531650002401551650000901575650001701584650001201601650001501613650001301628650001301641650002001654650002001674650001501694650001201709653001901721700001701740700002801757773010901785856008101894852000901975655001201984IND60586686220221121063925.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058668622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-017-0378-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKramer, Marc G.10aDepth trends of soil organic matter C:N and 15N natural abundance controlled by association with minerals  ap. 237-248.  aLetter  a2019-12-06  aPlant residues show carbon:nitrogen (C:N) decreases, ¹⁵N isotopic enrichment and preferential loss of labile substrates during microbial decay. In soil profiles, strikingly similar patterns of decreasing C:N and ¹⁵N isotopic enrichment with increasing depth are well documented. The parallel trend in organic matter composition with soil depth and during plant residue decay has been used as evidence to suggest that organic products accumulate or develop in the subsoil due to increasing intensity of microbially-driven processing, although no studies to date have verified this. Here, by applying sequential density fractionation, specific surface area, oxalate extractable Fe and Al, C:N and δ¹⁵N measures with depth to soils with relatively uniform soil mineralogy (Oxisols), climates and vegetation we show that changes in organo-mineral associations drive subsoil C:N and δ¹⁵N and C:N depth patterns more than in situ organic matter decay. Our results provide the first direct evidence that soil depth trends could be driven by mineral association instead of in situ processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil profiles 3aoxalates 3afractionation 3aplant residues 3anitrogen 3asoil mineralogy 3asoil organic matter 3airon 3asurface area 3aOxisols 3asoil depth 3aaluminum 3aminerals 3abiogeochemistry 3astable isotopes 3avegetation 3aclimate 0aorganic matter1 aLajtha, Kate1 aAufdenkampe, Anthony K.0 tBiogeochemistry.g2017 Dec., v. 136, no. 3 p.237-248dSpringer International Publishingx0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-017-0378-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009600168300001600264520181400280592002802094650001602122650001202138650002402150650001402174653001902188653002302207653002402230653003502254653002002289700001702309773010402326856008402430852000902514655001202523IND60602285520221119132056.0180711e20150702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060228552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2015.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Songfeng10aNumerical study on progressive failure of hard rock samples with an unfilled undulate joint  ap. 173-182.  aRoughness is one of the most important parameters of unfilled joint. In this study, a series of numerical tests have been carried out on the progressive failure of rock masses with varied undulate joints. The numerical model reproduced the stress–strain relations obtained in lab tests on the marble samples with smooth joint under the confinement of σ3/σc=0.013 and 0.27; meanwhile, the results of the numerical model on rock mass with rough joint indicated that with the increase of confining stress, the failure of rock mass presents as sliding along the rock joint (Type I), shearing partly through asperity and the joint (Type II) and mostly shearing through the rock block initiated by joint (Type III) respectively. To describe the progressive failure of hard rock samples with an unfilled undulate joint, an index of stress concentration factor (SCF) is presented as the ratio of σ1–σ3 (the localized principal stress difference of one point in the rock sample) to (σ1–σ3)o (the principal stress difference applied onto the rock sample) to denote the degree of heterogeneous stress induced by the undulate joint. It has been found that the progressive failure behavior is largely dependent on the joint roughness and the confining stress, which can be classified into 4 modes as: slipping plastic failure, slipping–shearing brittle failure, shearing brittle failure and shearing plastic failure. For the rock mass with rough joint, the crack initiation and propagation resulted from localized stress concentration at the turning point of rough joint during compression plays an important role in the progressive failure. For the rock mass with the same rough joint, SCFm decreases as the confining pressure increases because the confinement can weaken the heterogeneity of the rock mass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3ageology 3amathematical models 3aroughness 0aUndulate joint 0aRock mass strength 0aProgressive failure 0aLocalized stress concentration 0aNumerical tests1 aQi, Shengwen0 tEngineering geology.g2015 July 02, v. 193 p.173-182dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2015.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009800174300001800272520137200290592002801662650002001690650001301710650001101723650002401734650002201758650002501780650001101805650003701816650001301853650002101866653003401887653001101921653001401932653000901946653002501955700002201980700001902002700001702021773011502038856008602153852000902239655001202248IND60560530520221119202435.0180831e20170120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056053052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCesaro, Alessandra10aEffectiveness of WEEE mechanical treatment: Separation yields and recovered material toxicity  ap. 2656-2662.  aWaste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is one of the fastest growing waste flow in developed countries. Although it is being regarded as an urban stock due to its composition in terms of valuable materials, the presence of hazardous substances raises great concern for their possible adverse effects on both human and environmental health. This work focuses on assessing the distribution of toxic materials after WEEE mechanical processing. Both input waste and output flows were sampled at a full-scale plant and characterised by their chemical-physical composition and toxicological response. The NOAEL concentrations were also estimated for each analysed flow. Experimental results showed that the mechanical selection process was efficient in removing the plastics from the metallic scraps, mainly aluminium and copper. However the latter output fractions were characterised by a higher potential toxicity than the input waste. This outcome suggests the need for further improvement of separation yields, in order to reduce the interactions among the hazardous substances affecting the toxic response of recovered materials. The content of these substances in electrical devices should also be lowered, so that the identification of NOAEL concentrations, evaluated in the present study as a first attempt in this direction, could be a suitable strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aaluminum 3acopper 3adeveloped countries 3aelectronic wastes 3aenvironmental health 3ahumans 3ano observed adverse effect level 3aplastics 3atoxic substances 0aElectric and electronic waste 0aHazard 0aRecycling 0aRisk 0aSelection efficiency1 aMarra, Alessandra1 aBelgiorno, V.,1 aGuida, Marco0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Jan. 20, v. 142 p.2656-2662dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009200160500001900252520156700271592002801838650001401866650001401880650001101894650004301905650001201948650002501960700003001985700002402015700002002039700002902059773012202088856007402210852000902284655001202293IND60735238420221117054503.0210423e20210330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073523842DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130411382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahmood, Lubna 14aThe Influence of Parental Dietary Behaviors and Practices on Children’s Eating Habits  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPoor dietary habits established during childhood might persist into adulthood, increasing the risk of developing obesity and obesity-related complications such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. It has been found that early modifications in eating habits, especially during childhood, might promote health and decrease the risk of developing diseases during later life. Various studies found a great influence of parental dietary habits on dietary behaviors of their children regardless of demographic characteristics such as gender, age, socioeconomic status and country; however, the exact mechanism is still not clear. Therefore, in this review, we aimed to investigate both parents’ and children’s dietary behaviors, and to provide evidence for the potential influence of parents’ dietary behaviors and practices on certain children’s eating habits. Family meals were found to contribute the most in modeling children’s dietary habits as they represent an important moment of control and interaction between parents and their children. The parental practices that influenced their children most were role modeling and moderate restriction, suggesting that the increase of parental encouragement and decrease of excessive pressure could have a positive impact in their children’s dietary behaviors. This narrative review highlights that parental child-feeding behaviors should receive more attention in research studies as modifiable risk factors, which could help to design future dietary interventions and policies to prevent dietary-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulthood 3achildhood 3agender 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3asocioeconomic status1 aFlores-Barrantes, Paloma 1 aMoreno Aznar, Luis,1 aManios, Yannis 1 aGonzalez-Gil, Esther  M.0 tNutrients.g2021 Mar. 30, v. 13, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130411383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008100156300001800237520121500255592002801470650002301498650001501521650002001536650000901556650001701565650001101582650001701593650001201610650001101622650002001633700001201653700002001665700001801685700001701703700001301720700001801733773012701751856007401878852000901952655001201961IND60656651020221120034645.0190814e20130418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065665102DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay40217g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Yinghui10aGlioma markers detection and assessment based on a photonic suspension array  ap. 2292-2297.  aA new multiplex glioma marker immunoassay was developed based on a photonic suspension array. The micro-carriers of this array were silica colloidal crystal beads (SCCBs). As the code of the micro-carriers is the characteristic reflection peak originating from the stop-band of the colloid photonic crystal, they could effectively avoid photo-bleaching, the potential interference of encoding fluorescence with analyte-detection fluorescence and chemical instability. Meanwhile, the fluorescence background of the SCCBs is very low, because no dyes or materials with related fluorescence are included. The proposed suspension array was used for simultaneous multiplex detection of three glioma markers in one test tube by forming a sandwich immunocomplex on the SCCBs. The results showed that the three markers, Bcl-2 protein, cyclinD1 and p21, could be assayed in the ranges of 10–180 ng ml⁻¹, 0.1–13.5 ng ml⁻¹, 0.053–0.9 ng ml⁻¹, with limits of detection of 1 ng, 0.1 ng, 0.053 ng at 3σ, respectively. The proposed array has also shown storage stability and accuracy for sample detection. This technique provides a new strategy for low cost, automated, and simultaneous multiplex immunoassay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aautomation 3adetection limit 3adyes 3afluorescence 3aglioma 3aimmunoassays 3aphotons 3asilica 3astorage quality1 aHe, Jie1 aTian, Xiaoqiang1 aChang, Ligong1 aCai, Yunlang1 aLiu, Fen1 aHuang, Peilin0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Apr. 18, v. 5, no. 9 p.2292-2297dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay40217g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013100157300001800288520138500306592002801691650002101719650001601740650001801756650001501774650001101789650001801800650003101818650001501849650002501864650001601889650001101905650001901916650001101935650001501946650001301961650001401974650001801988650001102006700001402017700001702031700001502048700001802063700002302081700001802104700001802122773014102140856007402281852000902355655001202364IND60682663120221116191214.0200130e20200128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068266312DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta11942f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Xueying10aFlexible coaxial fiber-shaped asymmetric supercapacitors based on manganese, nickel co-substituted cobalt carbonate hydroxides  ap. 1837-1848.  aFlexible electronic devices constitute a rapidly rising industry since they can potentially renovate the way humans communicate and interact with external environments. Recently, flexible fiber-shaped supercapacitors have shown great potential in wearable and portable electronics. Herein, a new type of flexible coaxial fiber-shaped asymmetric supercapacitor (FASC) is successfully constructed utilizing a well-aligned Mn, Ni co-substituted Co carbonate hydroxide nanoneedle array on a carbon fiber (MnNiCo-CH/CF) as the positive electrode and an activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode. Impressively, the MnNiCo-CH/CF electrode with a hierarchical nanostructure exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1440.52 F g⁻¹ at 1 A g⁻¹ and superb cycling stability (90.78%), while the as-fabricated coaxial FASC exhibits a large specific capacitance of 96.13 F g⁻¹ (1 A g⁻¹) and a high energy density of 30.04 W h kg⁻¹ at a power density of 749.97 W kg⁻¹. Moreover, the integration of a few FASCs in series or in parallel is demonstrated to meet the energy and power needs in various practical applications, such as powering shunt-wound LEDs or stitching into cotton fabrics to charge LED electronic displays. Therefore, the successful fabrication of practicable and ultra-flexible FASCs may realize broad applications in future flexible energy storage devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3acapacitance 3acarbon fibers 3acarbonates 3acobalt 3acotton fabric 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrodes 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3ahumans 3ahydroxides 3aindustry 3amanganese 3ananomaterials 3anickel1 aLiu, Ying1 aZhong, Yuxue1 aCui, Liang1 aZhang, Aitang1 aRazal, Joselito M.1 aYang, Wenrong1 aLiu, Jingquan0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Jan. 28, v. 8, no. 4 p.1837-1848dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta11942f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03694naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245015500170506011700325506007600442520201200518592002802530506003702558650002302595650001302618650001602631650001202647650002002659650001602679650001102695650001502706650001302721650001702734650001202751651001102763653002202774653002202796653004102818653002302859653005002882700001902932700002802951700001702979773011902996856008803115852000903203655001203212IND60732739520221207093032.0220906e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073273952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1465712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsai, I-Chun10aCharacterization of the vehicle emissions in the Greater Taipei Area through vision-based traffic analysis system and its impacts on urban air quality  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn recent years, many surveillance cameras have been installed in the Greater Taipei Area, Taiwan; traffic data obtained from these surveillance cameras could be useful for the development of roadway-based emissions inventories. In this study, web-based traffic information covering the Greater Taipei Area was obtained using a vision-based traffic analysis system. Web-based traffic data were normalized and applied to the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to study the impact of vehicle emissions on air quality in the Greater Taipei Area. According to an analysis of the obtained traffic data, sedans were the most common vehicles in the Greater Taipei Area, followed by motorcycles. Moderate traffic conditions with an average speed of 30–50 km/h were most prominent during weekdays, whereas traffic flow with an average speed of 50–70 km/h was most common during weekends. The proportion of traffic flows in free-flow conditions (>70 km/h) was higher on weekends than on weekdays. Two peaks of traffic flow were observed during the morning and afternoon peak hours on weekdays. On the weekends, this morning peak was not observed, and the variation in vehicle numbers was lower than on weekdays. The simulation results suggested that the addition of real-time traffic data improved the CMAQ model's performance, especially for the carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) concentrations. According to sensitivity tests for total and vehicle emissions in the Greater Taipei Area, vehicle emissions contributed to >90% of CO, 80% of nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), and approximately 50% of PM₂.₅ in the downtown areas of Taipei. The vehicle emissions contribution was affected by both vehicle emissions and meteorological conditions. The connection between the surveillance camera data, vehicle emissions, and regional air quality models in this study can also be used to explore the impact of special events (e.g., long weekends and COVID-19 lockdowns) on air quality.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aInternet 3aair quality 3acameras 3acarbon monoxide 3aenvironment 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3aparticulates 3atraffic 3aTaiwan 0aVehicle emissions 0aUrban air quality 0aVision-based traffic analysis system 0aYou Only Look Once 0aCommunity Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model1 aLee, Chen-Ying1 aLung, Shih-Chun Candice1 aSu, Chih-Wen0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 782 p.146571-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1465713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002000136245013900156300001600295520169300311592002802004650001302032650002002045650002402065650001202089650001402101650001402115650001602129650001902145650002602164650002002190650002302210650001002233650001602243650002502259650002002284650002002304650001302324650002202337653001902359653002102378653001802399653001402417700002102431700002302452700002002475773011902495856007402614961001302688852000902701655001202710IND4427945320221120183712.0151126e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442794532DNAL7 a10.2111/08-068.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoder, Kathy J.10aDietary Selection by Domestic Grazing Ruminants in Temperate Pastures: Current State of Knowledge, Methodologies, and Future Direction  ap. 389-398.  aRuminants grazing mixed-species pastures face many choices, including when and where to graze and how much herbage to consume. These choices affect not only the nutritional status of the animal, but also sward composition and nutritive value through selective defoliation. Limited research has been conducted in the area of dietary selection and preference, most of which has been limited to simple model systems often involving a choice between only two herbage species. Although these studies have provided a vital tool to allow understanding of the fundamental principles of foraging behavior, in reality, grazing ruminants are faced with more complex situations. Understanding and managing animal preferences in mixed swards and thereby altering dietary selection can result in greater primary (plant) and secondary (animal) productivity. Key issues to improve this understanding include a better linking of behavioral and nutritional studies, a better understanding of the genetic factors influencing diet selection, and the development of more explicit spatial models of foraging behavior that incorporate multiple scales of decision making. This article, as part of a set of synthesis articles, reviews the current state of knowledge and research methodologies related to diet selection of grazing domestic ruminants with particular reference to improved temperate grazing environments, including how well we understand each part of the complex decision-making process a grazing ruminant faces, the links with primary and secondary productivity, and developments in methodologies. Finally, we identify key areas where knowledge is lacking and further research is urgently required.  aPublisher supplied data 3apastures 3atemperate zones 3afeeding preferences 3agrazing 3alivestock 3aruminants 3afeed intake 3apasture plants 3abotanical composition 3anutritive value 3anutritional status 3asward 3adefoliation 3aprimary productivity 3aliveweight gain 3aanimal behavior 3aforaging 3aspatial variation 0adiet selection 0agrazing behavior 0amethodologies 0aruminants1 aGregorini, Pablo1 aScaglia, Guillermo1 aRook, Andrew J.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2009 Sept., v. 62, no. 5 p.389-398dSociety for Range Managementx1551-50287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111%2F08-068.13Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245007400174520110000248592002801348650001501376650001201391650002401403650001101427650001001438650001801448653002401466653002701490653001701517653001601534653001901550700003001569700002201599700002401621700002901645700003101674773012501705856008501830852000901915655001201924IND60678405220221120033722.0200103e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067840522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2019.1051522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPamornnak, Burawich12aA microwave reflectometer technique for classifying a rubber cup lump  aRubber cup lumps, the product from rubber trees (which is a global economic plant), are usually graded by human inspectors for two classes, wet or dry, for selling in a rubber yard market. Grading rubber cup lumps using human inspection is unreliable and doubtful for the rubber sellers. In this paper, we, therefore, propose a technique to classify rubber cup lumps using a microwave reflectometer operating at 2.45 GHz which is more robust and reliable. Since the moisture content in a rubber cup lump is related to the magnitude of the reflected microwave from the cup lump, automatic classifying based on the reflection coefficient is proposed. A probe sensor based on a circular waveguide was designed and implemented. The sensor is optimum for rubber cup lump sizes of 500–1500 cm³. A classification algorithm was developed with the magnitude function of the reflection coefficients formulated by measuring 100 samples of the two classes of rubber. To validate the algorithm and the sensor, 300 rubber cup lumps were tested and the proposed technique achieved 88.67% overall accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3amarkets 3amicrowave radiation 3arubber 3atrees 3awater content 0aMicrowave technique 0aReflection coefficient 0aProbe sensor 0aMeasurement 0aClassification1 aPipitsunthornsan, Prontep1 aSomwong, Sahapong1 aWounchoum, Phairote1 aWongsopanakul, Kiattisak1 aChongcheawchamnan, Mitchai0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2020 Jan., v. 168 p.105152-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2019.1051523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245008900209300001400298520100900312592002801321650002201349650002301371650001801394650001101412650001601423650001601439650001901455650001201474653002901486653002501515653002201540653001901562653001801581653001201599653001201611653002201623653002601645700001901671700005901690700002101749700002001770700002701790773010001817856008301917852000902000655001202009IND60758304120221121043342.0220214e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075830412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2021.11.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBretzler, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2653-060310aSelective synthesis of tungsten carbide phases W2C and WC as hydrogenation catalysts  ap. 60-73.  aTungsten carbides are possible low-cost replacements for noble metal catalysts, but the role of different carbide stoichiometries (W₂C, WC) and their polymorphs for catalytic behavior is poorly understood. We develop a “dynamic, isothermal” carburization of WO₃ in a mixture of CH₄ and H₂ to control phase composition and catalytic properties. A design-of-experiments approach reveals that the key parameters are synthesis temperature (670 to 775 °C) and addition of silica as stabilizer (0 or 70 mol%). X-ray diffraction shows that the composition can be adjusted from 14 to 99 wt% W₂C, complemented by WC and a small fraction of W metal. Crystalline domain sizes for W₂C are smaller than those of WC (≥10 nm), affording thermodynamic stabilization of W₂C in agreement with computational predictions (Shrestha et al., Chem. Mater. 2021, 33, 4606–4620). The amount of CO adsorbed scales with W₂C content, and so does the performance in butyraldehyde or toluene hydrogenation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrogenation 3asilica 3astabilizers 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3atoluene 0aTransition metal carbide 0aSolid-state reaction 0aHigh surface area 0aSurface energy 0aPhase control 0aButanal 0aButanol 0aMethylcyclohexane 0aDesign of experiments1 aHuber, Michael1 aRane, Aditya A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1882-36091 aJentoft, Rolf E.1 aKöhler, Klaus,1 aJentoft, Friederike C.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2022 Jan., v. 405 p.60-73dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2021.11.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009800162500001900260520185600279592002802135650002402163650002002187650002202207650001402229650002002243650001202263650002702275650001302302650002902315650001302344650002502357650001102382650001602393651001102409700002702420700002002447700002502467700002502492773012202517856007402639852000902713655001202722IND60735238520221117054001.0210423e20210330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073523852DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130411402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStelle, Isabella 14aThe IHAT-GUT Iron Supplementation Trial in Rural Gambia: Barriers, Facilitators, and Benefits  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIntroduction: In most sub-Saharan African countries iron deficiency anaemia remains highly prevalent in children and this has not changed in the last 25 years. Supplementation with iron hydroxide adipate tartrate (IHAT) was being investigated in anaemic children in a phase two clinical trial (termed IHAT-GUT), conducted at the Medical Research Council Unit the Gambia at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) (abbreviated as MRCG hereof). This qualitative study aimed to explore the personal perceptions of the trial staff in relation to conducting a clinical trial in such settings in order to highlight the health system specific needs and strengths in the rural, resource-poor setting of the Upper River Region in the Gambia. Methods: Individual interviews (n = 17) were conducted with local trial staff of the IHAT-GUT trial. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Potential barriers and facilitators to conducting this clinical trial were identified at the patient, staff, and trial management levels. Several challenges, such as the rural location and cultural context, were identified but noted as not being long-term inhibitors. Participants believed the facilitators and benefits outnumbered the barriers, and included the impact on education and healthcare, the ambitious and knowledgeable locally recruited staff, and the local partnership. Conclusions: While facilitators and barriers were identified to conducting this clinical trial in a rural, resource-poor setting, the overall impact was perceived as beneficial, and this study is a useful example of community involvement and partnership for further health improvement programs. To effectively implement a nutrition intervention, the local health systems and context must be carefully considered through qualitative research beforehand.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomedical research 3aclinical trials 3acommunity service 3aeducation 3ahealth services 3ahygiene 3airon deficiency anemia 3amedicine 3anutritional intervention 3apatients 3aqualitative analysis 3arivers 3arural areas 3aGambia1 aMcDonagh, Lorraine  K.1 aHossain, Ilias 1 aKalea, Anastasia  Z.1 aPereira, Dora  I.

Globally circulating HIV-1 viruses are classified into distinct phylogenetic strains (subtypes, sub-subtypes) and several recombinant forms. Here we describe the characteristics and evolution of European HIV-1 epidemic over time through a review of published literature and updated queries of existing HIV-1 sequence databases. HIV-1 in Western and Central Europe was introduced in the early-1980s in the form of subtype B, which is still the predominant clade. However, in Eastern Europe (Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries and Russia) the predominant strain, introduced into Ukraine in the mid-1990s, is subtype A (AFSU) with transmission mostly occurring in People Who Inject Drugs (PWID). In recent years, the epidemic is evolving towards a complex tapestry with an increase in the prevalence of non-B subtypes and recombinants in Western and Central Europe. Non-B epidemics are mainly associated with immigrants, heterosexuals and females but more recently, non-B clades have also spread amongst groups where non-B strains were previously absent - non-immigrant European populations and amongst men having sex with men (MSM). In some countries, non-B clades have spread amongst the native population, for example subtype G in Portugal and subtype A in Greece, Albania and Cyprus. Romania provides a unique case where sub-subtype F1 has predominated throughout the epidemic. In contrast, HIV-1 epidemic in FSU countries remains more homogeneous with AFSU clade predominating in all countries. The differences between the evolution of the Western epidemic and the Eastern epidemic may be attributable to differences in transmission risk behaviours, lifestyle and the patterns of human mobility. The study of HIV-1 epidemic diversity provides a useful tool by which we can understand the history of the pandemic in addition to allowing us to monitor the spread and growth of the epidemic over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3adatabases 3adrugs 3afemales 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3aimmigration 3alifestyle 3amen 3amolecular epidemiology 3apandemic 3aphylogeny 3arisk behavior 3aviruses 3aAlbania 3aCentral European region 3aCyprus 3aEastern European region 3aGreece 3aPortugal 3aRomania 3aRussia 3aUSSR 3aUkraine 0aAIDS 0aCRF 0aDRC 0aEU 0aEEA 0aECDC 0aESAR 0aHIV 0aMSM 0aMSW 0aPR 0aPWID 0aRT 0aSIV 0aSPREAD 0atMRCA 0aURF 0aWHO 0aHIV-1 0aSubtypes 0aMolecular epidemiology 0aEuropean HIV-1 epidemic 0aPhylogeny 0aGenetic diversity1 aPsarris, Alexandros1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9570-39691 aGiannelou, Polina1 aKostaki, Evangelia1 aHatzakis, Angelos1 aParaskevis, Dimitrios1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6167-71520 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2016 Dec., v. 46 p.180-189dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.06.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245015100175500002200326520176900348592002802117650001602145650002102161650003002182650001902212650002002231650001702251650001602268650001102284650001502295650002002310650002402330650000702354650002102361650001302382650003102395650001002426653003002436653002002466653002102486653003002507653002802537700001902565773007102584856008402655852000902739655001202748IND60581410420221119181514.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058141042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2017.08.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPantůčková, Pavla10aIn-line coupling of supported liquid membrane extraction to capillary electrophoresis for simultaneous analysis of basic and acidic drugs in urine  aPre-press version  aSimultaneous extraction of basic and acidic drugs across thin supported liquid membrane (SLM) and direct injection of the extracted drugs from SLM surface into capillary electrophoresis (CE) were demonstrated. A microextraction device compatible with injection system of commercial CE instrument was filled with 20μL of sample and 10μL of acceptor solution, which were interspaced by the SLM impregnated with 5μL of organic solvent. Extractions of three basic drugs (nortriptyline, haloperidol and loperamide) and two acidic drugs (ketoprofen and naproxen) were achieved at optimized conditions including 1-ethyl-2-nitrobenzene as SLM solvent, natural pH of sample solution, 2.5mM NaOH acceptor solution and 30min extraction time. The extracted drugs were directly injected into CE for separation and quantification in a background electrolyte solution consisting of 30mM ammonium acetate adjusted to pH 4.2 with acetic acid. The entire analytical procedure including drugs extraction, injection, separation and quantification was automated in the CE instrument and the only manual procedures were SLM impregnation and filling the microextraction device with sample and acceptor solutions. The analytical method was suitable for simultaneous determination of basic and acidic drugs in undiluted human urine samples and was used for direct determination of naproxen in urine after oral administration of Nalgesin S tablet. Efficient elimination of sample matrix and selective transfer of basic and acidic drugs were achieved and the hyphenated SLM-CE method was characterized by repeatability of peak areas ranging from 3.7 to 13.4%, linear relationship between peak areas and concentrations (r2=0.994–0.999) and limits of detection between 0.05 and 1.5μg/mL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aammonium acetate 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achromatography 3adetection limit 3aelectrolytes 3ahaloperidol 3ahumans 3aketoprofen 3amicroextraction 3aoral administration 3apH 3asodium hydroxide 3asolvents 3asupported liquid membranes 3aurine 0aCapillary electrophoresis 0aComplex samples 0aSample treatment 0aSupported liquid membrane 0aSimultaneous extraction1 aKubáň, Pavel0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2017.08.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245009500176300001400271520178600285592002802071650003702099650001502136650001302151650001102164650003802175650001002213650001002223650001002233650001402243650001202257650003502269651001102304651001902315651001102334651002202345651001202367653001002379653001902389653002602408700002902434700002802463700002402491700001902515773011302534856008502647852000902732655001202741IND60530584320221122033235.0190412e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053058432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2016.06.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin-Alonso, Aarón10aEmerging rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) at the gates of the African continent  ap. 46-50.  aUntil the beginning of this decade, the genetic characterization of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) from Iberian Peninsula had revealed the existence of two genogroups, G1 and sporadically G6. In 2010, the new emerging rabbit haemorrhagic disease variant, RHDV2 or RHDVb, was described in France, from where it has rapidly spread throughout Europe, including Iberian Peninsula countries. Nevertheless, although cases of rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) have been reported in the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago located 100km off the coast of Morocco, no genetic characterization of RHDV had been carried out. Consequently, in order to identify the circulating RHDV strains in this archipelago, liver samples of six farm rabbits and fifteen wild rabbits were collected from several areas of the largest island, Tenerife, and analyzed for the presence of RHDV by antigen capture double antibody sandwich ELISA. In case of positive ELISA result, we amplified and sequenced two fragments of the vp60 gene, which were concatenated for phylogenetic purposes. The sequences analysis revealed the presence of RHDV2 in both farm and wild rabbits from several areas of Tenerife. This result constitutes the first finding of RHDV2 in the Canary Islands. These RHDV2 strains found in Tenerife shared two exclusive SNPs that have not been observed in the rest of RHDV2 strains. The identification of RHDV2 and the absence of classic RHDV strains in this study suggest that RHDV2 may be replacing classic strains in Tenerife, as has been also proposed in Iberian Peninsula, France and Azores. Given the proximity of the Canary Islands to the African continent, this result should raise awareness about a possible dispersal of RHDV2 from the Canary Islands to the North of Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3acoasts 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afarms 3agenes 3aliver 3aphylogeny 3arabbits 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aAzores 3aCanary Islands 3aFrance 3aIberian Peninsula 3aMorocco 0aRHDV2 0aCanary Islands 0aOryctolagus cuniculus1 aMartin-Carrillo, Natalia1 aGarcia-Livia, Katherine1 aValladares, Basilio1 aForonda, Pilar0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2016 Oct., v. 44 p.46-50dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.06.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006500140245016100205300001600366500002000382520149500402592002801897650002101925650001001946650001901956650001901975650000901994650001602003650001202019650002602031650001602057650001602073650003302089650001702122650001502139700006202154700006602216700006202282700005902344773013102403856007502534852000902609655001202618IND60777615520221118043927.0220518e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077761552DNAL7 a10.1002/jeq2.203302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Dener M.

Here, a 47‐d incubation study was conducted to track the decomposition process and evaluate GHG emissions and its drivers and to calculate the C costs of residue‐derived N released following the addition of residues from cover crops (pigeon pea, cowpea, lablab bean, vetch, and black oat) and maize under two water‐filled pore space (WFPS) levels (40 and 70%). For both WFPS levels, the increase in cumulative CO₂ fluxes in plots that received residues is mainly related with the increment of potentially mineralizable C. Crop residues increased the global warming potential (GWP) under both WFPS levels, with CO₂ emissions accounting for ≥98% of the GWP at 40% WFPS. At 70% WFPS, the GPW increment was driven by a notable increase in N₂O emissions. The contribution of CH₄ in the GWP emissions was negligible for all the crop residues evaluated. Principal component analysis highlighted that the optimal conditions for production and release are specific for each GHG. The cleaner N source was cowpea at 40% WFPS, which produced only 17.7 kg CO₂‐eq kg–¹ N mineralized, compared with vetch residues, which produced 233 kg CO₂‐eq kg–¹ N mineralized. To integrate agronomic and climate change mitigation perspectives, we suggest considering the C costs of the residue‐N released when choosing a cover crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLablab purpureus 3aVicia 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acover crops 3acowpeas 3aenvironmental quality 3agreenhouses 3apigeon peas 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoil quality 3asoil water1 aPimentel, Laisa G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0502-81791 aBarreto, Matheus S.

Here we show that in low-density epithelial and endothelial cells PMCA4b localized mostly in intracellular compartments and its plasma membrane localization was enhanced upon increasing density of cells. In good correlation with the enhanced plasma membrane localization a significantly more efficient Ca²⁺ clearance was observed in confluent versus non-confluent HeLa cell cultures expressing mCherry-PMCA4b. We analyzed the subcellular localization and function of various C-terminally truncated PMCA4b variants and found that a truncated mutant PMCA4b-ct24 was mostly intracellular while another mutant, PMCA4b-ct48, localized more to the plasma membrane, indicating that a protein sequence corresponding to amino acid residues 1158–1181 contained a signal responsible for the intracellular retention of PMCA4b in non-confluent cultures. Alteration of three leucines to alanines at positions 1167–1169 resulted in enhanced cell surface expression and an appropriate Ca²⁺ transport activity of both wild type and truncated pumps, suggesting that the di-leucine-like motif ¹¹⁶⁷LLL was crucial in targeting PMCA4b. Furthermore, upon loss of cell–cell contact by extracellular Ca²⁺ removal, the wild-type pump was translocated to the early endosomal compartment. Targeting PMCA4b to early endosomes was diminished by the L¹¹⁶⁷–⁶⁹A mutation, and the mutant pump accumulated in long tubular cytosolic structures. In summary, we report a di-leucine-like internalization signal at the C-tail of PMCA4b and suggest an internalization-mediated loss of function of the pump upon low degree of cell–cell contact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aamino acids 3acalcium 3acell culture 3aendosomes 3aendothelial cells 3amutants 3amutation 3aplasma membrane1 aPászty, Katalin1 aVarga, Karolina1 aHegedűs, Luca1 aEnyedi, Ágnes1 aPadányi, Rita0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

Crosses using the highly sexual Kentucky bluegrass cultivar, ‘Warren's A-20,’ and selections, Warren's A-25 and Warren's A-26, produced a very high frequency of hybrids. Many of these hybrids showed considerable first year vigor with more abundant panicle production than generally found in Kentucky bluegrass. However, these particular plants produced a very few or no viable seeds. Cytological studies indicated that these mostly sterile hybrids originated from the fertilization of reduced female gametes by reduced male gametes. The 54 interspecific hybrids produced using highly apomictic ‘Belturf’ Kentucky bluegrass as the female parent showed moderate to good floret fertility, acceptable seedling vigor, and some produced rather attractive turf. Cytological studies indicated that these fertile hybrids originated from the fertilization of unreduced eggs by reduced male gametes. These “triploid” F₁ hybrids are moderately to highly apomictic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoa pratensis 3acultivars 3afemales 3aflorets 3ainterspecific hybridization 3alawns and turf 3amales 3apanicles 3aseedlings 3avigor 3aCanada1 aAhmed, M.

The rise of cAMP was accompanied by rapid and reversible cessation of ruffling, by inhibition of focal adhesion turnover and by prominent loss of paxillin from focal adhesions. All these phenomena develop rapidly suggesting that cAMP effectors have a direct influence on the cellular migratory apparatus. The role of two primary cAMP effectors, exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC) and protein kinase A (PKA), in cAMP-mediated inhibition of PDAC cell migration and migration-associated processes was investigated. Experiments with selective activators of EPAC and PKA demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of cAMP on migration, ruffling, focal adhesion dynamics and paxillin localisation is mediated by PKA, whilst EPAC potentiates migration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3aadhesion 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3acell movement1 aConant, Alan1 aHaynes, Lee1 aZhang, Jin1 aJalink, Kees1 aSutton, Robert1 aNeoptolemos, John1 aCostello, Eithne1 aTepikin, Alexei0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

The composition, property, and structure of Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@Se were characterized by spectral and microscopic techniques. The key parameters affecting the removal were evaluated and optimized. The concentration of residual Hg (II) ions in the solution was measured using a cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometer. At pH = 3.0, Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@Se was capable to remove Hg (II) ions ranged from 100 μg L⁻¹ to 10 mg L⁻¹ within 20 min with the efficiency of approximately 99% in a way that residual concentration levels matched international standards. This level of removal efficiency was well maintained up to salinity of 25 g L⁻¹. Kinetic investigations revealed compliance with a second-order kinetic model. The linear regression coefficient suggested the adsorption of Hg (II) ions by the adsorbent followed the Langmuir isotherm model (R² > 0.997). The maximum capacity of the adsorbent obtained through investigating the isotherms was 70.42 mg g⁻¹. The Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@Se adsorbent effectively removed the Hg (II) ions spiked to different samples, including tap water, river water, seawater, and industrial wastewater. Therefore, this nano-adsorbent can be used as a good alternative for Hg (II) removal, in practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acold 3acompliance 3aenvironmental management 3aindustrial wastewater 3akinetics 3amagnetism 3amercury 3ananocomposites 3apH 3aregression analysis 3ariver water 3asalinity 3aseawater 3aselenium 3asorption isotherms 3atap water 3avapors 0aMagnetic-selenium nanocomposite 0aHg (II) removal 0aAqueous sample 0aThermodynamic & kinetic models1 aGhanemi, Kamal1 aBuazar, Foad0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 276 p.111263-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1112633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002100169245010900190300001800299520092900317592002801246650002401274650002201298650001001320650002201330650003101352650001001383650001201393650001201405650001901417650001301436650002001449650001801469650001101487650001801498650002001516650002401536650001201560650003701572650001801609650002101627650001101648650003001659650001701689650001801706650004301724650004201767650002601809650002801835650003201863650002701895700001901922700001901941700002301960700001301983700001701996773010302013856008602116852000902202655001202211IND4462020820221123002631.0141110e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446202082DNAL7 a217877832pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDixit, Rajnikant10aSalivary gland transcriptome analysis in response to sugar feeding in malaria vector Anopheles stephensi  ap. 1399-1406.  aIn this study, we analyzed a small scale transcriptome of salivary glands in sugar fed female mosquitoes. Thirty five percent of the transcripts could not be assigned a function. Some of them may code for salivary gland specific products involved in sugar feeding. We identified and characterized two new putative cDNAs encoding a sugar transporter and a cAMP generating DAPIT (Diabetes-Associated proteins in insulin sensitive tissues). Down regulation of these two cDNAs in response to blood feeding suggest that both AsST and AsDAPIT salivary genes may specifically be involved in the facilitation of sugar metabolism and energy production. The inability to absorb or digest sugar may cause organ failure, improper functioning of nervous system, behavioral disorder and death. Further functional characterization of theses putative transcripts is under investigation to examine their role in the mosquito salivary glands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnopheles stephensi 3acomplementary DNA 3adeath 3aenergy metabolism 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainsulin 3amalaria 3anervous system 3aproteins 3asalivary glands 3asugar feeding 3asugars 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCarbohydrates 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Insect 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aInsect Vectorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMalariaxtransmission 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSalivary Glandsxmetabolism 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aRawat, Manmeet1 aKumar, Sanjeev1 aPandey, Kailash C.1 aAdak, T.1 aSharma, Arun0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2011 Oct., v. 57, no. 10 p.1399-1406dElsevier Ltdx0022-19107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245006400176300001600240500001100256520185700267592002802124650001502152650002202167650001602189650001402205650001402219650001502233650002302248650002502271650001602296650001902312650002702331650001302358700002102371773011402392852000902506856008902515655001202604IND2327398620221118230008.0210417e200205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232739862DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1469-8137.2002.00398.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCairney, John W. G.10aBiology of mycorrhizal associations of epacrids (Ericaceae)  ap. 305-326.  aREVIEW  aEpacrids, a group of southern hemisphere plants formerly considered members of the separate family Epacridaceae, are in fact most closely allied to the Vaccinioid tribe (Ericaceae). Epacrids and other extant ericoid mycorrhiza‐forming plants appear to have a monophyletic origin. In common with many Ericaceae they form ericoid mycorrhizas. ITS sequence data indicate that the fungi forming ericoid mycorrhizas with epacrids and other extant Ericaceae are broadly similar, belonging to a poorly defined group of ascomycetes with phylogenetic affinities to Helotiales. The basic development and structure of ericoid mycorrhizal infections in epacrids is similar to other Ericaceae. However, data are limited on the structure and physiology of both hair roots and ericoid mycorrhizas for all Ericaceae. Relatively little is known about the functional significance of ericoid mycorrhizas in epacrids in southern hemisphere habitats that are often poor in organic matter accumulation. However the abilities of fungal endophytes of epacrids to utilize organic N and P substrates equal those of endophytes from northern hemisphere heathland plant hosts. Investigations using ¹⁵N/¹³C‐labelled organic N substrates suggest that mycorrhizal endophytes are important, at least, to the N nutrition of their epacrid hosts in some habitats.

An accurate and high throughput method involving slurry sampling electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS) was developed to detect trace Cd content in geological samples. After sonication of the sample with 0.5% v/v HNO₃ and 0.5% v/v Triton X-100 solution, the slurry was directly introduced into a graphite atomizer and detected by AAS. This simple method was shown to take 80% less time, and resulted in 90% less reagent waste than the conventional acid digestion method. Under optimized conditions (sample size ≤ 75 μm, sonication time: 20 min, pyrolysis temperature: 450 °C, and atomization temperature: 1600 °C), the characteristic mass and limit of detection for Cd were 0.8 pg and 0.002 μg g⁻¹, respectively. The proposed method was applied to the determination of Cd in 86 soil, sediment, and rock standard reference materials (SRMs). The results for 78 of these materials were in good agreement with the reference values. The Cd levels in five limestone SRMs (GUI-1, GUI-2, DIAN-1, DIAN-2, and DIAN-3) and one clay SRM (GBW03103) were reported for the first time. The proposed method shows great potential for the direct determination of trace Cd in various geological samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aatomization 3acadmium 3aclay 3adetection limit 3agraphene 3alimestone 3anitric acid 3anormal values 3aoctoxynol 3apollution 3apyrolysis 3asediments 3aslurries 3asoil 3asonication 3atemperature 3awastes 3awet digestion method1 aGuo, Wei1 aCheng, Mengting1 aZhang, Ping1 aJin, Lanlan1 aGuo, Qinghai1 aHu, Shenghong0 tAnalytical methods.g2015 Oct. 8, v. 7, no. 20 p.8970-8976dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay01719j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002500168245010100193300001600294500001900310500000900329520153300338592002801871650001701899650002001916650002201936650001101958650001501969650001401984650000901998650001602007700001802023700001802041773012102059852000902180856009802189655001202287991593749760742620221117035517.0191122e197511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7690107662DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1975.0011183X001500060019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatanothai, Soontree10aComparison of Different Hill-plot Designs for Evaluating Quantitative Response to Oat Crown Rust  ap. 803-806.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aFour hill-plot field designs and a rod-row design (plan 5) were compared for evaluation of the quantitative responses of five oat (Avena sativa L.) cultivars to two races of crown rust (Puccinia coronata Cda.) each at two levels of infection. In hill-plot plan 1, test hills were planted in rows in a solid block. In plan 2, test hills were planted in rows alternating with rows of susceptible rust-spreader hills. In plan 3, test hills were surrounded by barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) hills. In plan 4, single oat plants were grown in barley hills. Evaluation of response to rust was based on how the performance of rusted plots compared with the performance of corresponding unrusted control plots. Rust severity was highest in plan 1; intermediate in plans 2, 3, and 5; lowest in plan 4. A combined analysis of data from plans 1, 2, and 3 showed that cultivars, plans, rows, and levels of infection all significantly affected both yield and seed weight in terms of reduction due to rust infection. The plan ✕ cultivar interaction was significant for reduction in seed weight, but not for reduction in yield. However, in the four hill-plot plans and the rod-row plots, the cultivars ranked the same in order of reduction in seed weight. All correlation coefficients among the different plans for yield and seedweight reductions were significant. Coefficients of variation for these traits were lowest for the rod-row plots; intermediate for plans 1, 2, and 3; and highest for plan 4. Plan 1 was most desirable for general use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aHordeum vulgare 3aPuccinia coronata 3abarley 3acrown rust 3acultivars 3aoats 3aseed weight1 aMichel, L.

We investigated whether fish assemblages supported by borrow-pit lakes resembled those in oxbow lakes to help place the ecological relevance of borrow-pit lakes in context with that of natural floodplain lakes. In all, we collected 75 fish species, including 65 species in eight borrow-pit lakes, 52 species in four riverside oxbow lakes, and 44 species in eight landside oxbow lakes. Significant differences in several species richness metrics were evident between borrow-pit lakes and landside oxbow lakes but not between borrow-pit lakes and riverside oxbow lakes. All three lake types differed in fish assemblage composition. Borrow-pit lakes and riverside oxbow lakes tended to include a greater representation of fish species that require access to diverse environments, including lentic, lotic, and palustrine habitats; fish assemblages in landside oxbow lakes included a higher representation of lacustrine species. None of the fish species collected in borrow-pit lakes was federally listed as threatened or endangered, but several were listed as species of special concern by state governments in the region, suggesting that borrow-pit lakes provide habitat for sensitive riverine and wetland fish species. Differences in fish assemblages among borrow-pit lakes were linked to engineered morphologic features, suggesting that diversity in engineering can contribute to diversity in fish assemblages; however, more research is needed to match engineering designs with fish assemblage structures that best meet conservation needs.  aPublisher supplied data 3afish 3afloodplains 3ahabitats 3alentic systems 3alotic systems 3aoxbow lakes 3aspecies diversity 3awetlands 3aMississippi River1 aKillgore, K.

Revision of French feed unit systems in 2018 has proposed the reassessment of energy requirements through a between-experiment approach expressing metabolizable energy supply as a function of the energy expenditures for maintenance and production, with these expenditures that reflect homeorhetic regulations. Based on the same approach, LA and ALA intake can be related to animal characteristics (i.e., BW) reflecting maintenance expenditures and secretion characteristics (i.e., milk yield, milk fat content and contents of LA and ALA in milk fat). Therefore, the objective of this work was to analyse the between-experiment relationships between ingested, duodenal, or absorbed flows of LA and ALA, BW and milk LA and ALA secretion by meta-analysis in mid-lactation dairy cows. These relationships were analysed using LA and ALA subsets of 96 and 99 experiments, respectively. Between-experiment regressions of daily flows of ingested, duodenal or absorbed LA and ALA on BW and milk LA and ALA flows were studied, with statistical unit defined as the mean of within-experiment treatments. For LA, the BW-associated coefficient was 0.019 (± 0.0034) g absorbed LA/d per kg BW and milk LA secretion-associated coefficient was 0.70 (± 0.081) g absorbed LA/g of LA secreted into milk. For ALA, the BW-associated coefficient was 0.0058 (± 0.00093) g absorbed ALA/d per kg BW and milk ALA secretion-associated coefficient was 0.57 (± 0.097) g absorbed ALA/g of ALA secreted into milk. When coding the diets as either control or milk fat depression diets, the BW-associated coefficient for LA was 0.017 (± 0.0032) g absorbed LA/d per kg BW for both diets. For milk fat depression diets, milk LA secretion-associated coefficient was 1.02 (± 0.119) g absorbed LA/g of LA secreted into milk, whereas it was 0.70 (± 0.075) g absorbed LA/g of LA secreted into milk for control diets. Significant BW and milk performance coefficients were obtained in all LA and ALA equations, allowing the calculation of ingested and intestinal flows of LA and ALA based on measured BW, milk fat yield and milk fat content of LA and ALA. The relationships between ingested or intestinal flows of LA and ALA, BW and milk performance obtained in the present work could be integrated into renewed feed unit systems for energy and protein in dairy cows.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3abody weight 3aenergy 3afeeds 3aintestines 3alinoleic acid 3alipid content 3ameta-analysis 3ametabolizable energy 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk fat yield 3aruminants 3asecretion 0aruminant 0aessential fatty acid 0alactation 0ametabolism1 aFerlay, A.1 aNozière, P.1 aGerard, C.1 aSchmidely, P.0 tAnimal.g2022 Sept. 26,  p.100661-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3938811x1751-73117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.animal.2022.100661  aDNAL 7aarticle03919naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245017000172500001900342520223100361592002802592650002102620650001102641650002302652650001902675650002302694650002902717650001002746650001302756650001502769650002502784650002402809650001402833650001102847650001002858650002002868651001902888653002402907653003002931653001402961653002202975653002602997700002403023700002203047700002103069700002303090700002403113700002703137773011803164856008603282852000903368655001203377IND60709423220221120170202.0201230e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070942322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1112682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMensah, Sylvanus10aRevisiting biotic and abiotic drivers of seedling establishment, natural enemies and survival in a tropical tree species in a West Africa semi-arid biosphere reserve  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiotic and abiotic drivers of seedling establishment and survival are fundamental not only for elucidating processes occurring at plant early life stages, but also for assisting species natural regeneration. Keystone, multipurpose and economically important tree species such as Afzelia africana Sm. are reportedly facing recruitment constraints, yet little is known about how abiotic and biotic factors shape the species seedling dynamics. Here, we monitored the species seedlings over one year across three seasons in West Africa savannahs to determine how conspecific and heterospecific biotic neighborhood and habitat heterogeneity correlate with initial seedling density, leaves’ fungal infection and herbivory and how all these factors combined, influence the species seedling survival.Seedling densities increased with increasing conspecific adult densities, and were highest in tree savannahs and on sandy-silt soils. Leaves’ fungal infection and herbivory were also positively associated with conspecific adult density, but were more abundantly observed in tree savannahs than in shrub savannahs. Seedling survival was constrained on higher slope, and negatively affected by conspecific adult density, especially in shrub savannahs.There was a strong evidence for negative density-dependence effects of conspecific adults on seedling survival, which operated through negative effects of herbivory and fungal infection. Habitat heterogeneity was also an important driver, which modulated biotic factors’ effects on seedling survival: tree savannahs promote positive conspecific density-dependence of seedling fungal infection and herbivory more than shrub savannahs. Nonetheless, seedlings were more sensitive to natural enemies in shrub savannahs, suggesting increased negative conspecific density-dependence effects on seedling survival in less dense vegetation, possibly as a result of enhanced specialization of predators and pathogens on a limited set of species. The study brings important insights into the mechanisms that drive the establishment and survival of the species seedling, which should be considered in the design of management activities aiming at the conservation of this endangered species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfzelia africana 3aadults 3aconservation areas 3aconspecificity 3aendangered species 3aenvironmental management 3afungi 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3anatural regeneration 3aplant establishment 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3atrees 3atropical plants 3aWestern Africa 0aBiotic neighborhood 0aConspecific adult density 0aPhylogeny 0aSeedling survival 0aSemi-arid environment1 aNoulèkoun, Florent1 aDimobe, Kangbéni1 aAtanasso, Justin1 aSalako, Valère K.1 aAssogbadjo, Achille1 aGlèlè Kakaï, Romain0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 276 p.111268-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1112683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015000156300001800306520157700324592002801901650001601929650004401945650001501989650000902004650002102013650002302034650002002057650002002077650001102097650004302108650001102151650001102162650002502173650001302198650003302211650002702244650001302271650001302284650003702297650001602334650001202350700001702362700001702379773012902396856007502525852000902600655001202609IND60657893020221119030551.0190823e20150924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065789302DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ay01721a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Haochi10aMolecularly imprinted polymers coated on carbon nanotubes for matrix solid phase dispersion extraction of camptothecin from Camptotheca acuminate  ap. 8100-8108.  aA molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) method for the extraction of camptothecin from Camptotheca acuminate was developed. MIPs were synthesized by a surface imprinting technique using carbon nanotubes as a support, camptothecin as a template, methacrylic acid as a functional monomer, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as a crosslinker. The MIPs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy. Isothermal adsorption, dynamic adsorption and selectivity adsorption experiments were also carried out in this study. The MIP-MSPD method coupled with high performance liquid chromatography was applied for the determination of camptothecin in Camptotheca acuminate fruit, bark and leaf. Factors affecting the extraction yield such as the sorbent/sample ratio, dispersion time, and washing and elution solvents were investigated. Under optimized conditions, a good linearity of camptothecin was obtained in a range of 1–200 μg mL⁻¹, and the detection limit of the method was 0.13 μg mL⁻¹. The extraction yields of camptothecin obtained were 0.1055%, 0.0628% and 0.0930% for Camptotheca acuminate fruit, bark and leaf, respectively. The recovery of camptothecin was in the range of 96.1–103.3%. The results showed that this method is fast, selective, cost-effective and environmentally friendly compared with other extraction methods such as stirring extraction, ultrasonic extraction and Soxhlet extraction used for the extraction of camptothecin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamptotheca 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3abark 3acarbon nanotubes 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3aethylene glycol 3afruits 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3amixing 3amolecular imprinting 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asorbents 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrasonics 3awashing1 aHong, Yansuo1 aChen, Ligang0 tAnalytical methods.g2015 Sept. 24, v. 7, no. 19 p.8100-8108dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay01721a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006900147245014400216300001400360520075100374592002801125650001601153650000901169650001801178650001301196650000901209650001501218651001001233653002701243653001201270653002101282653002201303653001901325653002101344700002801365700002501393700002201418700001501440773012401455856008101579852000901660655001201669IND60604449520221118032017.0180717e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060444952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2015.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-González, Rebeca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1035-665510aDietary inferences through dental microwear and isotope analyses of the Lower Magdalenian individual from El Mirón Cave (Cantabria, Spain)  ap. 28-38.  aDietary habits are inferred from dental microwear and isotope analyses of the Magdalenian human individual from the site of El Mirón, dated to 15,460 ± 40 BP.

The results obtained through analysis of different surfaces are consistent and indicate a mixed diet for this Lower Magdalenian individual, including meat, aquatic resources and vegetables. These results are in agreement with those obtained through isotope analysis. This implies a generalized exploitation of the environment as has been previously established in other Late Upper Palaeolithic specimens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3adiet 3aeating habits 3aisotopes 3ameat 3avegetables 3aSpain 0aHunter–gatherer diet 0aHominin 0aDental microwear 0aUpper Paleolithic 0aEl Mirón Cave 0aCantabrian Spain1 aCarretero, José Miguel1 aRichards, Michael P.1 aRodriguez, Laura,1 aQuam, Rolf0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2015 Aug., v. 60 p.28-38dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2015.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245006700165300001800232500001500250520164200265592002801907650002601935650002201961650002201983650001102005650001202016650001602028650002702044650002102071650003402092650001202126650001002138650001202148650000902160653001302169700001302182700001402195773013202209856008402341990002302425852000902448655001202457IND60090096920221120053229.0141110e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009009692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorenz, S.10aCa²⁺-binding protein expression in primary human thyrocytes  ap. 2703-2713.  a2019-12-06  aWe recently identified several Ca²⁺-binding proteins (CaBP) from the S100 and annexin family to be regulated by TSH in FRTL-5 cells. Here, we study the regulation of S100A4, S100A6 and ANXA2 in primary human thyrocytes (PHT) derived from surrounding tissues (ST), cold benign thyroid nodules (CTN) and autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTN). We investigated the expression and regulation of CaBP and the effect of their expression on Ca²⁺ and TSHR signaling. We used an approach that accounts for the potential of an individual PHT culture to proliferate or to express thyroid differentiation features by assessing the expression of FOS and TPO. We found a strong correlation between the regulation of CaBP and the proliferation-associated transcription factor gene FOS. PKA and MEK1/2 were regulators of ANXA2 expression, while PI3-K and triiodothyronine were additionally involved in S100 regulation. The modulated expression of CaBP was reflected by changes in ATP-elicited Ca²⁺ signaling in PHT. S100A4 increased the ratio of subsequent Ca²⁺ responses and showed a Ca²⁺ buffering effect, while ANXA2 affected the first Ca²⁺ response to ATP. Overexpression of S100A4 led to a reduced activation of NFAT by TSH. Using S100A4 E33Q, D63N, F72Q and Y75K mutants we found that the effects of S100A4 expression on Ca²⁺ signaling are mediated by protein interaction. We present evidence that TSH has the ability to fine-tune Ca²⁺ signals through the regulation of CaBP expression. This represents a novel putative cross-regulating mechanism in thyrocytes that could affect thyrocyte signaling and physiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3aprotein synthesis 3acalcium signaling 3ahumans 3acalcium 3athyrotropin 3aadenosine triphosphate 3atriiodothyronine 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3atissues 3agenes 3amutants 3acold 0aproteins1 aAust, G.1 aKrohn, K.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

These hierarchical materials comprise ∼3 nm pores within the silica network, which are confined to a ∼20 nm shell of a hollow sphere (with diameters in the range ∼190–640 nm). The multiple length scales involved in HS spheres affect the ice nucleation mechanism. We find homogeneous nucleation inside the water filled capsules, whereas heterogeneous nucleation prevails in the surrounding dispersion medium. We validate our findings for a series of hollow sphere sizes and demonstrate the absence of homogeneous nucleation in the case of polystyrene–silica core–shell particles. The present findings shed new light on the interplay between homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation of ice with possible implications in undercooled reactions and the storage of reactive or biologically active substances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3adiameter 3aice 3aice nucleation 3asilica1 aRuckdeschel, Pia1 aGraf, Robert1 aButt, Hans-Jürgen,1 aRetsch, Markus1 aFloudas, George0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Jan. 12, v. 121, no. 1 p.306-313dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b110533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03442naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245007700174300001400251500001500265520202300280592002802303650001202331650002302343650001102366650001602377650001102393650001202404650002402416650001102440650001202451650002302463650002002486650001402506650001702520650002002537650002102557650001202578651001402590653002202604653001402626653001202640653001802652653001202670653001302682700002902695773011002724856008102834852000902915655001202924IND60573131420221117231755.0180620e20170627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057313142DNAL7 a10.1515/botlit-2017-00022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGudžinskas, Zigmantas,10aDistribution, state and conservation of Equisetum telmateia in Lithuania  ap. 17-32.  a2019-12-06  aConservation of endangered plant species requires a thorough knowledge about the present state of their populations and habitats as well as identification of current and potential threats. The aim of this research was to evaluate current distribution, state of habitats and the size of populations of Equisetum telmateia (Equisetaceae) in Lithuania as well as to reveal the main threats and requirement for the conservation of this species. Analysis of all available information revealed that E. telmateia currently occurs in seven localities in Lithuania, mainly in the southern part of the country. One formerly recorded population in the south-western part of Lithuania has become extinct. Two reported localities in the environs of Druskininkai (southern Lithuania) are doubtful, because the reports have been based on misidentified specimens. Locality of E. telmateia in the western part of the country probably has been provided erroneously and one locality in the south-eastern region of Lithuania should be verified and the identity of the species requires confirmation. Total area occupied by the stands of E. telmateia in Lithuania is 2.41 ha. Most frequently this species grows in river valleys or close to rivers and occupies alluvial forest habitats, which frequently creates complexes with habitats of mineral-rich springs or springs with tufa formations. Occasionally it grows in the habitats of forests of slopes, tall herb fringe communities and hay meadows. Sporulation of E. telmateia in Lithuania is poor: no fertile shoots were registered in two studied populations, whereas in other localities few fertile shoots were recorded. Evaluation of the status of E. telmateia in Lithuania applying the IUCN criteria resulted in its categorization as a vulnerable species. The main threats for E. telmateia are forest logging and changes in habitat hydrological regime, though wild animals, human activities and invasive plant species also have certain negative impact on the populations of this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3alogging 3aendangered species 3arivers 3asporulation 3ahumans 3ameadows 3aEquisetum telmateia 3ashoots 3avalleys 3avulnerable species 3aplants (botany) 3ahydrology 3awild animals 3aforest habitats 3ainvasive species 3aforests 3aLithuania 0aprotected species 0avariation 0athreats 0aIUCN criteria 0areports 0ahabitats1 aRasimavičius, Mindaugas0 tBotanica Lithuanica.g2017 June 27, v. 23, no. 1 p.17-32dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23146x2029-932X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/botlit-2017-00023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03824naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245009400159300001600253520219000269592002802459650003002487650002202517650004802539650002502587650000902612650001102621650001002632650003002642650002802672650001202700650001402712650002702726650002102753650004302774650001802817650001402835650001402849650001002863650001702873650001402890653002502904653003202929653002202961653005402983700001803037700001503055700001403070773011203084856007703196852000903273655001203282IND60516449020221119064906.0160325e20140603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051644902DNAL7 a10.1139/cjm-2014-00812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Sheng10aBidirectional promoter trapping T-DNA for insertional mutagenesis in Verticillium dahliae  ap. 445-454.  aTransfer DNA (T-DNA)-based random insertional mutagenesis is a universal forward genetic approach for gene identification and cloning in many phytopathogenic fungi. In a large number of randomly selected transformants, screening for mutants with a specific phenotype is laborious, especially for pathogenicity-defective mutants. To accelerate mutant screening and gene identification, a bidirectional promoter-trapping Ti binary vector, 1300-bisGFP-hyg, was constructed and deployed in this study. More than 6000 Verticillium dahliae transformants were obtained by the mediation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying the vector. One thousand randomly selected transformants were cultured on Czapek–Dox and on Czapek–Dox plus cotton root extract media plates. The cultured transformants with green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression or changes in phenotype were selected and used in virulence or promoter-trapping assays. Based on the virulence assay of 60 transformants, the pathogenicity of 17 of these mutants was compromised. Ten pathogenicity-defective mutants were found with GFP expression, and 6 with expression in Czapek–Dox plus cotton root extract media specifically. Using TAIL-PCR (thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction), the T-DNA insertion sites were identified in 8 GFP-expressing transformants, including 5 pathogenicity-defective mutants and 3 unaffected transformants. Promoters of 6 genes were successfully trapped using the T-DNA method in this study. The nonpathogenic transformant 24C9 was the subject of additional investigation. It displayed strong GFP expression on water agar medium supplemented with cotton root extracts and on cotton seedling stems. The results obtained by Southern blot and quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that the transcription level of VdUGPU (encoding UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase) was significantly reduced owing to T-DNA insertion in the gene promoter region. These results indicate that the bidirectional promoter-trapping Ti vector, combined with induction medium that contains root exudates, can be useful for identification of pathogenicity-related and functional genes in V. dahliae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aSouthern blotting 3aUTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase 3aVerticillium dahliae 3aagar 3acotton 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apromoter regions 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aroot exudates 3ascreening 3aseedlings 3astems 3atransfer DNA 3avirulence 0aVerticillium dahliae 0apathogenicity-related genes 0apromoter trapping 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation1 aWang, Cai-yue1 aZhang, Xin1 aLin, Ling0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2014 June 3, v. 60, no. 7 p.445-454dNRC Research Pressx1480-32757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2014-00813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245008700159300001400246520101600260592002801276650002101304650001701325650001101342650001501353650002001368650002601388650001501414650001601429650001201445650001401457700001801471700001601489700001701505700002101522700001801543700001801561773013401579856008101713852000901794655001201803IND60574047320221120230540.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057404732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10295-016-1870-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hua10aMetabolic engineering of Escherichia coli W3110 for the production of L-methionine  ap. 75-88.  aIn this study, we constructed an L-methionine-producing recombinant strain from wild-type Escherichia coli W3110 by metabolic engineering. To enhance the carbon flux to methionine and derepression met regulon, thrBC, lysA, and metJ were deleted in turn. Methionine biosynthesis obstacles were overcome by overexpression of metA Fᵇʳ (Fbr, Feedback resistance), metB, and malY under control of promoter pN25. Recombinant strain growth and methionine production were further improved by attenuation of metK gene expression through replacing native promoter by metK84p. Blocking the threonine pathway by deletion of thrBC or thrC was compared. Deletion of thrC showed faster growth rate and higher methionine production. Finally, metE, metF, and metH were overexpressed to enhance methylation efficiency. Compared with the original strain E. coli W3110, the finally obtained Me05 (pETMAFᵇʳ-B-Y/pKKmetH) improved methionine production from 0 to 0.65 and 5.62 g/L in a flask and a 15-L fermenter, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3afermenters 3agene expression 3ametabolic engineering 3amethionine 3amethylation 3aregulon 3athreonine1 aWang, Bao Shi1 aLi, You Ran1 aZhang, Liang1 aDing, Zhong Yang1 aGu, Zheng Hua1 aShi, Gui Yang0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2017 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.75-88dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1367-54357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-016-1870-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245011000170500001900280520133700299592002801636650001801664650002201682650001301704650001501717650002401732650001401756650001001770650001601780650000901796650002001805650001701825650001001842651001101852700003001863700002201893773012201915856008002037852000902117655001202126IND60729162220221122072047.0210228e20210203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072916222DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110202832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPankou, Chrysanthi 10aEffect of Irrigation on Intercropping Systems of Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with Pea (Pisum sativum L.)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIntercropping is an old and commonly used agricultural practice and involves the cultivation of two or more crops in the same area of land at the same time and may improve yield, the use of the environmental resources, product quality, and soil health. The objective of the present study was to study the effect of water availability of wheat-pea intercrops using agronomic and physiological characteristics. The experiment was conducted at the farm of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece during two growing seasons 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 using two different cultivars from pea (Isard and Olympos) and wheat (Yecora E and Elissavet) and two irrigation regimes. The availability of water increased grain yield and affected most of the characteristics that were studied. In terms of total Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) there was a yield advantage of intercrops over monocrops, which indicates the efficiency of intercropping for using the environmental resources. Both wheat cultivars, the pea cultivar Olympos and their intercrops indicated high adaptation capacity to rainfed conditions, whereas Isard and its intercrops performed better under irrigation. Therefore, the intercropping of wheat with pea uses the water resources of the environment more efficiently and can be used in dry land conditions for higher yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPisum sativum 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomy 3aarid lands 3acontinuous cropping 3acultivars 3afarms 3agrain yield 3apeas 3aproduct quality 3asoil quality 3awheat 3aGreece1 aLithourgidis, Anastasios 1 aDordas, Christos 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Feb. 03, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110202833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245012300163300001600286500002000302520107500322592002801397596008401425596007801509650002601587650001201613650002101625650003201646650001501678650002001693650001101713650004301724650001501767650002101782650001401803650000701817650003901824650001701863650001301880650001601893700001901909700005601928773013001984856007802114852000902192655001202201IND60614878120221120144846.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061487812DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2018001292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehta, Akshita10aPurification of lipase from Aspergillus fumigatus using Octyl Sepharose column chromatography and its characterization  ap. 857-866.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLipases are ubiquitous biological macromolecules which have many industrial and environmental applications. The purpose of this study was to purify lipase from Aspergillus fumigatus by using Octyl Sepharose column chromatography. The enzyme was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and hydrophobic interaction chromatography which resulted in sevenfold purification. The molecular weight of protein using Native‐PAGE was found to be 70 kDa. The apparent molecular weight by SDS–PAGE was found to be 35 kDa which indicated that the enzyme was homodimer. The optimum temperature and pH for activity of the enzyme was found to be 40 °C and 9.0, respectively. The kinetic parameters Vₘₐₓ and Kₘ of the purified lipase were 10.42 µmol min⁻¹ mg⁻¹ and 9.89 mM, respectively. Detergents Tween‐20 and Triton X‐100 inhibited enzyme activity. However, there was minimal loss of enzyme activity with SDS and Tween‐80. All metal ions inhibited the enzyme activity. Among solvents, maximum loss (65%) in the enzyme activity was in hexane.  aPublisher supplied data  cDepartment of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Govt. of India  cDEST (Department of Environment, Science and Technology) Himachal Pradesh 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aagarose 3aammonium sulfate 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3adetergents 3aenzyme activity 3ahexane 3ahydrophobic interaction chromatography 3ametal ions 3amolecular weight 3aoctoxynol 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolysorbates 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aGrover, Chetna1 aGupta, Reena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0320-16600 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2018 Oct., v. 58, no. 10 p.857-866dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39022x0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2018001293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04267naa a2200901 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001300154245012800167300001600295520206800311592002802379650001802407650002302425650001202448650001602460650001702476650001202493650001002505650001702515650001302532650001002545650001802555650000902573650001802582650001302600650001102613650001902624650001002643650001002653650003002663650001202693650001502705650001502720650001202735650001202747650001702759653000902776653000802785653000902793653000702802653000702809653000702816653000702823653000702830653000702837653000802844653001102852653000802863653000802871653001002879653000902889653000802898653000802906653000702914653000702921653000702928653000802935653001002943653000802953653001702961653001802978653002302996653002203019653002203041653001903063700001303082700001503095700001203110700001503122773011803137856008903255852000903344655001203353IND60585446420221122002230.0190403e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058544642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2017.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Y.T.10aEffect of organic acids and essential oils on performance, intestinal health and digestive enzyme activities of weaned pigs  ap. 110-119.  aThis experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of organic acid (OA) and essential oil (EO) used individually or combination on performance, fecal microbiota, intestinal morphology and digestive enzymes of weaned pigs. A total of 210 weaned piglets [Duroc×(Landrace×Yorkshire)] with initial body weight (8.64±0.33kg) were randomly allocated to 1 of 5 treatments with 7 replicate pens (3 barrows and 3 gilts per pen) per treatment according to sex and weight in randomized complete block design. The treatments consist of NC (negative control, corn-soybean meal basal diet), PC (positive control, NC+15mg/kg Colistin sulfate, 2mg/kg Nosiheptide and 50mg/kg Olaquindox), OA (NC+1.5g/kg OA), EO diet (NC+30mg/kg EO), OA+EO diet (NC+1.5g/kg OA+30mg/kg EO). The experiment lasted 28 d (d 0–14 as for early period and d 14–28 as for later period). From d 0 to 14, EO had greater (P<0.05) average daily gain (ADG) compared with NC, EO and OA+EO had a trend to improve ADG compared with PC. From d 14 to 28, OA improved (P<0.05) ADG compared with NC and OA+EO had a trend to improve ADG compared with PC. From d 0 to 28, supplementation of OA or EO individually increased (P<0.05) ADG compared with NC and OA+EO had a trend to increase ADG compared with PC. EO improved apparent digestibility of dry matter, calcium, phosphorus, crude protein and gross energy (P<0.05). OA improved digestibility of calcium, phosphorus and crude protein (P<0.05). Compared with NC, OA tended to decrease (P<0.10) fecal score from d 0 to 7. OA, EO and OA+EO had greater Lactobacilli counts of feces (P<0.05) than PC. OA and EO increased villous height of duodenum and OA increased villous height of jejunum (P<0.05). OA increased butyric acid concentration of cecum and valeric acid concentration of colon (P<0.05). Trypsin and chymotrypsin activities of jejunum were improved (P<0.05) by EO supplementation. Overall, OA and EO had no interactive effects, but it improved performance by the different positive effects on intestinal health and digestive enzymes of weaned pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3aaverage daily gain 3abarrows 3abody weight 3abutyric acid 3acalcium 3acecum 3achymotrypsin 3acolistin 3acolon 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aduodenum 3aenergy 3aessential oils 3afeces 3agilts 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ajejunum 3aolaquindox 3aphosphorus 3apiglets 3atrypsin 3avaleric acid 0aADFI 0aADG 0aATTD 0aBW 0aCP 0aDM 0aEE 0aEO 0aGE 0aG:F 0aGSH-PX 0aIgA 0aIgG 0aIGF-I 0aIL-1 0aIgM 0aMDA 0aNC 0aOA 0aPC 0aSOD 0aT-AOC 0aVFA 0aOrganic acid 0aEssential oil 0aGrowth performance 0aIntestinal health 0aDigestive enzymes 0aWeaned piglets1 aLiu, Li,1 aLong, S.F.1 aPan, L.1 aPiao, X.S.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2018 Jan., v. 235 p.110-119dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2017.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245008500165300001600250500002000266520112900286592002801415596005201443650002001495650002401515650001601539650001201555650001401567650001201581650001001593650001001603650003301613650001901646650001301665650002001678650001601698650001401714650001801728650002201746650002501768700002201793700002901815700002501844700002201869700002601891700006401917773013001981856007802111852000902189655001202198IND60614878220221120144722.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061487822DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2018000662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlov, Ivan Yu.10aScytalidium candidum 3C is a new name for the Geotrichum candidum Link 3C strain  ap. 883-891.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the 1970s, the strain Geotrichum candidum Link 3C was isolated from rotting rope and since then has been extensively studied as a source of cellulose and xylan‐degrading enzymes. The original identification of the strain was based only on morphological characters of the fungal mycelium in culture. Recent comparison of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) fragments derived from the draft genome published in 2015 did not show its similarity to G. candidum species. Given the value of the strain 3C in lignocellulosic biomass degradation, we performed morphological and molecular studies to find the appropriate taxonomic placement for this fungal strain within the Ascomycota phylum. ITS, 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA sequences, and RPB2 encoding genes were used to construct phylogenetic trees with Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. Based on sequence comparison and multiple gene sequencing, we conclude that the fungal strain designated as Geotrichum candidum Link 3C should be placed into the genus Scytalidium (Pezizomycotina, Leotiomycetes) and is redescribed herein as Scytalidium candidum 3C comb. nov.  aPublisher supplied data  a16‐14‐00109cThe Russian Science Foundation 3aBayesian theory 3aGeotrichum candidum 3aScytalidium 3abiomass 3acellulose 3aenzymes 3afungi 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alignocellulose 3amycelium 3anew combination 3anomen novum 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3astatistical analysis1 aBobrov, Kirill S.1 aSumacheva, Anastasiya D.1 aMasharsky, Alexey E.1 aPolev, Dmitrii E.1 aZhurishkina, Elena V.1 aKulminskaya, Anna A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3481-00070 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2018 Oct., v. 58, no. 10 p.883-891dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39022x0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2018000663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245020200160300001600362520183600378592002802214650001602242650001902258650001602277650001502293650000902308650001202317650001302329650002002342650001402362650001102376650003102387650001502418650001202433650002102445650002602466650001302492650001102505650001502516650000902531650002002540700002702560700002502587700002602612700002002638700001302658700001702671700001302688700001702701700001602718700003202734773011102766856004802877852000902925655001202934IND4481986420221120101057.0130322e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448198642DNAL7 a10.1007/s12603-012-0072-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDufour, B.10aGlomerular filtration rate estimated by Cockcroft-Gault formula better predicts anti-Xa levels than modification of the diet in renal disease equation in older patients with prophylactic enoxaparin  ap. 647-652.  aOBJECTIVES: Older people have an increased risk of Low Molecular Weight Heparin accumulation leading to an increased bleeding risk. The objective of this study was to assess whether reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault or Modification of the Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equations, indicates drug accumulation by increased anti-Xa levels in older subjects receiving prophylactic enoxaparin treatment. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Acute geriatric units in Nancy Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-two consenting consecutive patients, 65 and older, confined to bed for an acute medical condition requiring enoxaparin for prevention of venous thromboembolism, and hospitalized for at least six days were enrolled. MEASUREMENTS: Serum creatinine and peak plasma anti-Xa levels 3 to 4 hours after the daily injection of enoxaparin were measured at days 3, 6, 9 and 12 (first dose of enoxaparin at day one). Analyses of variance for repeated measures were used to evaluate significant predictors of peak anti-Xa activity in univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A significant correlation was observed between anti-Xa activity and GFR estimated with the Cockcroft formula r=0.43. Following univariate analysis, the three factors associated with higher anti-Xa levels were a lower Cockcroft-Gault GFR (p=0.0002), female gender (p=0.0003) and a lower bodyweight (p<.0001). No significant association between anti-Xa levels and MDRD GFR (p=0.33) was observed. Following multivariate analysis, female gender (p=0.02), bodyweight (p=0.04) and Cockcroft GFR (p=0.05) remained independent determinants of anti-Xa levels. CONCLUSION: In hospitalized patients older than 65 years old, the Cockcroft-Gault equation, in contrast to the MDRD equation, is able to predict the risk of higher anti-Xa levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3acohort studies 3acorrelation 3acreatinine 3adiet 3aelderly 3aembolism 3aenzyme activity 3aequations 3agender 3aglomerular filtration rate 3ahemorrhage 3aheparin 3amolecular weight 3amultivariate analysis 3apatients 3apeople 3aprediction 3arisk 3arisk assessment1 aToussaint-Hacquard, M.1 aKearney-Schwartz, A.1 aManckoundia, M.

Genetic variants that determine flowering time can provide insights into optimizing flowering time for higher yields and other beneficial traits in tomato crops. Here, we examined a collection of flowering time variants to assess their effects on biomass and total tomato yields. Five late flowering (lf), thirteen large plant (lp), and seven floral homeotic (fh) mutants were identified as flowering time variants that could be rearranged according to leaf production in the primary shoot meristem (PSM). A flowering time continuum of mutants was translated into a positive continuum of biomass yield with more leaves, branches, and floral organs. The flowering time continuum showed an optimal curve of fruit yield, indicating a certain late flowering time as optimal for fruit yield, with the yield gradually decreasing in both directions with earlier or later flowering times. We isolated lf1, lf10, lp22, and fh13 as high-yielding genotypes with optimal flowering time, showing a new balance between the vegetative and flowering phases of tomato. Additionally, lp8, fh8, and fh15 produced extremely high biomass in leaves, axillary shoots, and floral organs due to late flowering in shoot apices with additional production of floral organs and lateral shoot. Our new late-flowering variants provide new genetic resources that can be used to optimize crop yield by fine-tuning flowering time, and future molecular studies could be conducted by revisiting our yield model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3abiomass production 3afruit yield 3alate flowering 3aleaves 3amodels 3aplant growth 3ashoot meristems 3atomatoes1 aHeo, Jung 1 aKim, Yŏng-jun,1 aKim, Dae  Heon1 aKo, Kisung 1 aLee, Young  Koung1 aOh, Seok  Kwi1 aKim, Ch'ŏl-min,1 aBae, Jong  Hyang1 aPark, Soon  Ju0 tAgronomy.g2021 Feb. 04, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110202853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014400164300001400308520123800322592002801560650002301588650002501611650002001636650002101656650004301677650001101720650001801731650001201749650001301761650001701774650001901791650001301810650001301823650003301836650002001869700001801889700001801907700001701925700001901942700001501961700001601976773009901992856008102091852000902172655001202181IND60574047520221120230604.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057404752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-016-3190-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Ruixian10aPreparation of a Polymer Monolithic Column Using Ionic Liquid as Porogen and Its Application in Separations of Proteins and Small Molecules  ap. 23-30.  aA polymer-based monolithic column was prepared for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), using ionic liquids as porogen within the confines of a stainless steel column (50 × 4.6 mm i.d.). In the process, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and dodecyl alcohol were used as bi-porogens, vinyl ester resin as the monomer, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate as the crosslinker, CCl₄ as the initiator, and FeCl₂ as the catalytic agent to prepare the polymer-based monolithic column. Scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption–desorption instrument, and mercury intrusion porosimetry were used to assay the characteristics of the monolith, respectively. The optimized monolith showed uniform structure and good permeability. Then, the column was used as the stationary phase of HPLC to separate standard proteins and human plasma with gradient elution. Besides, the monolith was used to separate aromatic compounds from the mixture. The results showed that the addition of IL could effectively improve the structure of monoliths prepared by atom transfer radical polymerization technique. The results also suggested that this kind of monolith could be used as a simple, cheap and effective stationary phase for HPLC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbon tetrachloride 3aethylene glycol 3aferrous chloride 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aionic liquids 3amercury 3anitrogen 3apermeability 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aproteins 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astainless steel1 aZhang, Doudou1 aZhu, Xianghui1 aTang, Liying1 aZhang, Xuemeng1 aBai, Ligai1 aLiu, Haiyan0 tChromatographia.g2017 Jan., v. 80, no. 1 p.23-30dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-016-3190-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245018500172520192200357592002802279650001902307650002102326650002802347650001902375650001602394650002402410650002002434650001102454650001002465653003002475653001902505653003102524653001602555700003002571700002802601773011802629856005202747852000902799655001202808IND60793906020221116184848.0220921e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079390602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1162772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkeirytė, Agnė14aThe differences of climate change perception, responsibility and climate-friendly behavior among generations and the main determinants of youth's climate-friendly actions in the EU  aThe role of society to mitigate climate change is particularly important. However, generations, different age cohorts are differently related to and concerned about climate change. The main criticism of the young generation is that they talk about climate change a lot but do not behave in a climate-friendly manner. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyze the difference of climate change perception, responsibility and climate-friendly behavior among Baby Boomer generation, Generations X, Y and Z in all European Union (EU) countries. After applying the Chi-square test, the results showed that younger people in the EU tend to have the perception of climate change more often than their older counterparts. Moreover, people from younger generations tend to place responsibility of solving climate change on the business/industrial sectors and environmental groups more often than the preceding generations do. Furthermore, more of young people assumed personal responsibility, used environmentally friendly alternatives to personal cars, and considered carbon footprint before purchasing a product, as opposed to older generations. However, the youth separated waste and decreased the use of disposable items less comparing with older generations. Applying binary logistic regression, the results showed that climate change perception and placement of responsibility on environmental groups positively and statistically significantly influenced all climate-friendly actions of the youth. Personal responsibility statistically significantly decreased probability of all climate-friendly actions. Responsibility placement on the government and business/industrial sectors reduced the probability to carry out waste reduction behavior. Thus, this study revealed that young people are not always climate-friendly, and this study provides the insights into how to promote climate-friendly behavior among youths.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acarbon footprint 3achi-square distribution 3aclimate change 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3awaste reduction 3awastes 3ayouth 0aClimate change perception 0aResponsibility 0aPro-environmental behavior 0aGenerations1 aKrikštolaitis, Ričardas1 aLiobikienė, Genovaitė0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 323 p.116277-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116277  aDNAL 7aarticle02100naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245009000171500001900261520114400280592002801424650001701452650001301469650001801482650001301500650001801513700002801531700002801559773012201587856008001709852000901789655001201798IND60729162520221122200432.0210228e20210204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072916252DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110202862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOvechkin, Danila  V.14aThe Impact of Intellectual Capital on the Profitability of Russian Agricultural Firms  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEconomic efficiency is a function of two types of resources: those that are presented in financial statements and those that are not. Non-balance sheet resources are referred as to intellectual capital (IC). The purpose of the paper is to investigate the relationship between IC, its components and the level of financial profitability. To conduct the analysis, we used the system generalized method of moments for a broad sample of Russian firms that operate in the agribusiness industry. We employed two financial approaches to IC estimation. The first one is the Value Added Intellectual Coefficient (VAIC). The second one is own-created approach that is supposed to respond the criticism regarding VAIC. Comparison between VAIC and own-created approach to IC estimation revealed that the latter is more appropriate due to its advantages. Our approach unlike VAIC allows measuring both efficiency ratios and the stocks of IC. The results showed that the efficiency of structural capital usage and the stock of human capital have the biggest impact on the profitability level of the agricultural businesses among employed measures of IC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagribusiness 3aagronomy 3ahuman capital 3aindustry 3aprofitability1 aRomashkina, Gulnara  F.1 aDavydenko, Vladimir  A.0 tAgronomy.g2021 Feb. 04, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110202863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005400139245010700193300001600300500002000316500001500336520149000351592002801841650002801869650001301897650001301910650001201923650002001935650001901955650001701974650001301991650002502004650002602029650004502055650002202100650002602122650001102148653002402159700001402183700001802197700001302215700001702228700005102245700001302296700001502309773014602324856007402470852000902544655001202553IND60588362120221117081445.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058836212DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.85462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Chaofan1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2707-461910aOmics‐prediction of bioactive peptides from the edible cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis proteome  ap. 984-990.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Bioinformatics approaches are widely used to evaluate the prospects of novel protein sources in bioactive peptide research. Edible cyanobacteria are considered as potential protein precursors. However, the abundance of unicellular cyanobacterial proteins is largely unknown and highly dynamic according to the cultivation conditions, which need to be considered in this research field. The objective of this work was to evaluate the protein abundance of Arthrospira platensis, as well as to map the bioactive peptide sequences from the high‐abundance proteins of the A. platensis proteome. RESULTS: The high‐abundance proteins of the A. platensis proteome were identified with a high‐performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry‐based method. A total of 593 proteins were detected and quantified. The occurrence frequency of the bioactive peptides in A. platensis proteome was calculated according to the amino acid sequences via the bioinformatics approaches. Further in silico digested by trypsin, pepsin and chymotrypsin, these proteins liberated 78, 99, and 96 bioactive peptides, respectively. In each case, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors were enriched. CONCLUSION: This work will help rationally design the protocols for cyanobacterial cultivation, protein pre‐treatment and peptide separation, and further produce more peptides with specific functions. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3adipeptidyl-peptidase IV 3aproteins 3aproteome 3atrypsin 3aprotein sources 3abioinformatics 3achymotrypsin 3apeptides 3aamino acid sequences 3aArthrospira platensis 3aangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 3amass spectrometry 3aliquid chromatography 3apepsin 0aSpirulina platensis1 aHan, Jing1 aZhang, Jingbo1 aHu, Jing1 aFu, Yinghuan1 aQi, Hang1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1805-43251 aSun, Yue1 aYu, Chenxu0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Feb., v. 98, no. 3 p.984-990dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.85463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04436naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245012600207300001100333500001100344520261800355592002802973650001203001650001403013650002303027650002403050650001103074650002203085650001803107650001403125650002203139650000903161650002403170650002403194650002203218650001003240700002603250700001903276700003403295700001703329700002203346700002203368700002003390700001903410700001803429700002303447700001503470700001503485700002603500700002203526700002303548700002403571773015903595856008303754852000903837655001203846IND60772661620221119085108.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077266162DNAL7 a10.1186/s12966-022-01258-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuzik, Nicholas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5259-861X10aSchool-related sedentary behaviours and indicators of health and well-being among children and youth: a systematic review  ap. 40.  aReview  aBACKGROUND: The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the associations between school-related sedentary behaviours and indicators of health and well-being in children and youth (~ 5–18 years) attending school. METHODS: This review was conducted to inform the development of School-Related Sedentary Behaviour Recommendations. Peer-reviewed, published, or in-press articles in English were included. Reviews, meta-analyses, and case studies were excluded; all other study designs were eligible. Further, articles had to meet the a priori study criteria for population, intervention, comparator (PROSPERO ID: CRD42021227600). Embase, MEDLINE® ALL, and PsycINFO were searched. Risk of bias was assessed for individual experimental studies using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool, and in observational studies based on the GRADE framework and in line with previous systematic reviews examining sedentary behaviours in children. Overall quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE framework for each outcome category and study design. Results were synthesized narratively, grouped by study design and outcome category. Further, several high-level summaries were conducted to help interpret results. RESULTS: Evidence was synthesized from 116 reports, including 1,385,038 participants and 1173 extracted associations. More school-related sedentary behaviour was favourably associated with nearly one-third of extracted associations for cognitive (33%) and social-emotional (32%) indicators (e.g., less anxiety), but unfavourably associated with other movement behaviours (e.g., less physical activity) (35%). Active lessons were favourable (72%), compared to more school-related sedentary behaviours, when examining associations for all health and well-being indicators. More homework was favourable across all health and well-being indicators in 4% of extracted associations for primary school children, and 25% of extracted associations for secondary school children. However, ≥2 h/day of homework appeared to be unfavourable for health and well-being. Limitations for synthesized studies included generally low quality of evidence and a lack of studies in South American, African, or low-middle income countries. CONCLUSIONS: Findings can help inform policy makers, schools, and teachers, regarding the amount of homework assigned and the introduction of active lessons into the classroom to enhance health and well-being of children. More research is needed examining school-related sedentary behaviours and indicators of health and well-being in low- and middle-income countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3acognition 3aelementary schools 3aexperimental design 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3ameta-analysis 3anutrition 3aphysical activity 3arisk 3asecondary education 3asedentary lifestyle 3asystematic review 3ayouth1 ada Costa, Bruno G.

In this study, the bioavailability and transitions in chemical speciation occurring during the aging process are demonstrated to be key factors causing ceMoS₂ to affect aquatic organisms. The lower survival rate of embryonic zebrafish with aged (i.e., sunlight-irradiated and dark-ambient-aged) ceMoS₂, compared to that with freshly prepared ceMoS₂, was due to the release of ionic aging products (mainly acidic Mo species) throughout the oxidative dissolution of ceMoS₂. The released soluble molybdenum interacted with natural organic matter (NOM) depending on their functionality, and this attenuated the toxicity caused by ceMoS₂ to different degrees. Toxicity triggered by aged ceMoS₂ under both dark and irradiated conditions was significantly reduced by Suwannee River NOM due to the formation of complexes with ionic Mo species, which was established by Mo K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The findings provide useful insights for comprehending the impacts of ceMoS₂ on aquatic organisms and guidance for the prevention measures necessary in the applications of MoS₂ nanosheets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aaquatic environment 3abioavailability 3achemical speciation 3aenvironmental management 3airradiation 3amolybdenum 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananosheets 3aorganic matter 3aphase transition 3arivers 3asolar radiation 3asurvival rate 3atoxicity 0aTransition metal dichalcogenides 0aOxidative dissolution 0aEnvironmental risks 0aIonic Mo species1 aLai, Yu-Heng1 aChen, Jeng-Lung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0223-55381 aChen, Chiaying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3865-626X0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Dec. 15, v. 324 p.116278-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1162783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245013400209500001900343520198400362592002802346650001502374650002402389650001502413650001702428650001702445650002902462650002202491650001102513650001602524650001102540650001802551650001502569650002102584650001502605650001302620650001002633651001102643653001502654653001602669653002202685653002002707653001302727700002102740700002102761773010402782856008502886852000902971655001202980IND60712977420221119205237.0210415e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071297742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1102812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuindroit, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0387-241310aEstimating human exposure to pyrethroids’ mixtures from biomonitoring data using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHuman biomonitoring data provide evidence to exposure of environmental chemicals. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling together with an adequate exposure scenario allows to transpose measured concentrations of chemicals or their metabolites into exposure levels, as daily intakes. In France, high levels of urinary pyrethroids metabolites have been measured in populations. Our work aims at estimating the exposure of the French ENNS cohort to mixtures of four pyrethroids (deltamethrin, permethrin, cypermethrin, and cyfluthrin) from the urinary concentrations of five pyrethroids' metabolites commonly measured in biomonitoring studies. We developed a modelling approach based on a global toxicokinetic model that accounts for the cumulative exposure to pyrethroids as some of the metabolites can be shared by several parent compounds and for human inter-individual variability in metabolism. The median of the individual daily intakes was estimated to 8.1 ng/kg bw/day for permethrin, 17.7 ng/kg bw/day for cypermethrin, 20.4 ng/kg bw/day for cyfluthrin and 34.3 ng/kg bw/day for deltamethrin leading to similar weights for the pair permethrin and cypermethrin (36%), cyfluthrin (31%) and deltamethrin (33%) to the cumulative exposure. Accounting for human variability enabled to explain some of the variations in the metabolites' levels within the cohort. The cumulative exposure was then weighted by their toxicities towards three neurotoxic effects to calculate margins of exposure (MOE). Low MOE values were always associated with high measured concentrations of metabolites in urine and the lowest MOEs were observed for the autonomic division. No risks associated with reconstructed mixtures of pyrethroids were expected for the ENNS cohort. Our approach is an asset to analyse the biomarkers of exposure to pyrethroids simultaneously and could be easily adapted to any local or national specificities in pyrethroids’ exposure or populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acumulative exposure 3acyfluthrin 3acypermethrin 3adeltamethrin 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aexposure scenario 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3amodels 3aneurotoxicity 3apermethrin 3apharmacokinetics 3apyrethrins 3aresearch 3aurine 3aFrance 0aPBPK model 0aPyrethroids 0aReverse dosimetry 0aCumulative risk 0aMixtures1 aCrépet, Amélie1 aBrochot, Céline0 tEnvironmental research.g2021 Jan., v. 192 p.110281-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1102813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245012700171300001400298520120800312592002801520650001201548650001001560650002501570650002201595650000901617650001201626650003401638650001601672651001801688653001701706653002501723653003401748653001201782700002401794700002201818700002201840700002101862773010001883856008701983852000902070655001202079IND60531538920221118002137.0170719e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053153892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.02.2052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeck, Liam E.10aPersistent organic pollutant and mercury concentrations in eggs of ground-nesting marine birds in the Canadian high Arctic  ap. 80-88.  aWe collected eggs of eight marine bird species from several colony sites in the Canadian high Arctic located at approximately 76°N and analyzed them for concentrations of legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and mercury. We provide the first report on concentrations of POPs in eggs of three Arctic species (Thayer's gull Larus thayeri, Sabine's gull Xema sabini, Ross's Gull Rhodostethia rosea), and we found significant differences in each of the POP profiles among the five species with sufficient data for statistical comparisons (Thayer's gull, black guillemot Cepphus grylle, Sabine's gull, Arctic tern Sterna paradisaea and common eider Somateria mollissima borealis). The Ross's Gull had unexpectedly high POP concentrations relative to the other species examined, although this was based on a single egg, while glaucous gull Larus hyperboreus eggs from our sampling location had very low POPs. Sabine's gulls had the lowest Hg of the eggs studied, consistent with their low trophic position, but concentrations of their legacy POPs were higher than expected. We also noted that total hexachlorocyclohexanes were higher than reported elsewhere in the circumpolar Arctic in three species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlcidae 3aLarus 3aSomateria mollissima 3aSterna paradisaea 3aeggs 3amercury 3apersistent organic pollutants 3awater birds 3aArctic region 0aMarine birds 0aCanadian High Arctic 0aPersistent organic pollutants 0aMercury1 aGilchrist, H.

Thermostable enzymes have many advantages for industrial exploitation, including high substrate solubilities as well as reduced risk of process contamination. RESULTS: Enzymatic synthesis of lactulose employing a transgalactosylation reaction by a recombinant thermostable glycoside hydrolase (GH1) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Caldivirga maquilingensis IC‐167 was investigated. The optimal pH for lactulose production was found to be 4.5, while the optimal temperature was 85 °C, before it dropped moderately to 83% at 90 °C. However, the relative activity for lactulose synthesis dropped sharply to 35% at 95 °C. At optimal reaction conditions of 70% (w/w) initial sugar substrates with molar ratio of lactose to fructose of 1:4, 15 U mL⁻¹ enzyme concentration and 85 °C, the time course reaction produced a maximum lactulose concentration of 108 g L⁻¹ at 4 h, corresponding to a lactulose yield of 14% and 27 g L⁻¹ h⁻¹ productivity with 84% lactose conversion. The transgalactosylation reaction for lactulose synthesis was greatly influenced by the ratio of galactose donor to acceptor. CONCLUSION: This novel GH1 may be useful for process applications owing to its high activity in very concentrated substrate reaction media and promising thermostability. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzymes 3afructose 3agalactose 3aglycosides 3alactose 3alactulose 3apH 3arisk reduction 3asolubility 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aHassanin, Hinawi AM1 aKoko, Marwa YF1 aZhang, Tao1 aJiang, Bo1 aMu, Wanmeng1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6597-527X0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Feb., v. 98, no. 3 p.928-937dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.85393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01280naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008900159300001400248506002800262520023200290592002800522506003700550650002300587650002200610650001600632650001600648653002400664653002300688653002700711773013200738856007500870852000900945655001200954IND60785294620221207121909.0090701e197308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078529462DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha711602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNEGRUTIU, Ioan12aA comparative study of the fertility in di-and tetraploid red clover of Transylvania  ap. 61-65.  aResource is Open Access  aData on the fertility potential and the selfcompatibility degree of di-and tetraploids are presented undercross and self-, free-and artificial pollination conditions in certain developmental stages to 30 days after pollination.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTrifolium pratense 3acomparative study 3apollination 3atetraploidy 0afertility potential 0adi-and tetraploids 0aartificial pollination0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g1973 Aug., v. 7, no. 1 p.61-65dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha711603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03900naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011700172300001600289520212900305592002802434650002302462650001202485650004302497650001302540650001902553650002202572650001502594650001902609650001502628650002702643650002702670650000902697650001002706650002702716650002502743650001402768653001902782653001702801653001602818653002502834653002002859653001402879700002302893700001802916700002402934700002002958700002202978700002103000700002303021700003403044700002803078773011003106856008503216852000903301655001203310IND50060496520221118231733.0190415e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006049652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2012.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarcaccia, Gianni10aMolecular analysis of genetic diversity, population structure and inbreeding level of the Italian Lipizzan horse  ap. 124-133.  aIn this study, we examine the population structure and inbreeding level of the Italian Lipizzan horse breed by means of AFLP fingerprinting and SSR genotyping. A total of 245 AFLP marker alleles were scored across all horses (n=140) living in the Italian Lipizzan stud in 2007, and microsatellite analysis was performed on all mares (n=42) and stallions (n=7) by genotyping at 30 SSR marker loci. A total of 53 (21.6%) AFLP marker alleles were scored as polymorphic among the animals, with a mean frequency of 0.722. Based on this subset of markers, 123 animals were assigned to three distinct subgroups of 44, 41 and 38 animals, respectively, each one showing a within-subgroup mean Dice's genetic similarity around 86% (standard error<0.3%), whereas the remaining 17 animals that displayed an admixed ancestry (membership<45%) were clustered apart, with a between-subgroup genetic similarity spanning from 80% to 83%. All animals could be discriminated from each other on the basis of multi-locus DNA fingerprints. However, only 6% of the genetic variation was found among subgroups, as supported by the low fixation index Fst=0.058. In the mares and stallions, a total number of 146 marker alleles were detected across the assayed SSR loci, with a mean marker allele frequency of 0.485 and an observed and effective number of alleles per locus of 4.710 and 2.921, respectively. The Nei's unbiased heterozygosity for the Italian Lipizzan horse breed was equal to H=63.5% and the Wright's inbreeding coefficient had an average value of Fis=−0.133, suggesting an excess of heterozygosity. Significant (P<0.01) pair-wise linkage disequilibria between AFLP marker alleles as well as between SSR marker alleles were found in the whole Lipizzan population. It was found that mating plan optimization could reduce the average relatedness to 0.619, a lower value than that obtained by casual unions between stallions and mares (0.740). The findings described here will be useful for the indirect selection of animals based on markers linked to traits of interest and for the assessment of conservation priorities and strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aalleles 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aancestry 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3aheterozygosity 3ainbreeding 3ainbreeding coefficient 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3amares 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3astallions 0aLipizzan horse 0aAFLP markers 0aSSR markers 0aPopulation structure 0aMarker-assisted 0aSelection1 aFelicetti, Michela1 aGalla, Giulio1 aCapomaccio, Stefano1 aCappelli, Katia1 aAlbertini, Emidio1 aButtazzoni, Luca1 aPieramati, Camillo1 aSilvestrelli, M.q(Maurizio),1 aVerini Supplizi, Andrea0 tLivestock science.g2013 Feb., v. 151, no. 2-3 p.124-133dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2012.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03181naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245022000176300001600396520175100412592002802163650001402191650001802205650002302223650002502246650002202271653001302293653000802306653000702314653000702321653000802328653000802336653000902344653002802353653000802381653001902389653000802408653003302416700002202449700002402471700006302495773007402558856008202632852000902714655001202723IND60585446920221122021123.0171109e20180130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058544692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2017.10.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFandilolu, Prayagraj M.10aConformational preferences and structural analysis of hypermodified nucleoside, peroxywybutosine (o2yW) found at 37th position in anticodon loop of tRNAPhe and its role in modulating UUC codon-anticodon interactions  ap. 310-325.  aHypermodified bases present at 3′-adjacent (37th) position in anticodon loop of tRNAPhe are well known for their contribution in modulating codon-anticodon interactions. Peroxywybutosine (o2yW), a wyosine family member, is one of such tricyclic modified bases observed at the 37th position in tRNAPhe. Conformational preferences and three-dimensional structural analysis of peroxywybutosine have not been investigated in detail at atomic level. Hence, in the present study quantum chemical semi-empirical RM1 and multiple molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to study structural significance of peroxywybutosine in tRNAPhe. Full geometry optimizations over the peroxywybutosine base have also been performed using ab-initio HF-SCF (6-31G**), DFT (B3LYP/6-31G**) and semi-empirical PM6 method to compare the salient properties. RM1 predicted most stable structure shows that the amino-carboxy-propyl side chain of o2yW remains ‘distal’ to the five membered imidazole ring of tricyclic guanosine. MD simulation trajectory of the isolated peroxy base showed restricted periodical fluctuations of peroxywybutosine side chain which might be helpful to maintain proper anticodon loop structure and mRNA reading frame during protein biosynthesis process. Another comparative MD simulation study of the anticodon stem loop with codon UUC showed various properties, which justify the functional implications of peroxywybutosine at 37th position along with other modified bases present in ASL of tRNAPhe. Thus, this study presents an atomic view into the structural properties of peroxywybutosine, which can be useful to determine its role in the anticodon stem loop in context of codon-anticodon interactions and frame shift mutations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aguanosine 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular dynamics 3anucleotide sequences 3aprotein synthesis 0aO2yW PBG 0aASL 0aMD 0aHF 0aDFT 0aRM1 0atRNA 0aPeroxywybutosine (o2yW) 0aRM1 0aMD simulations 0aASL 0aCodon-anticodon interactions1 aKamble, Asmita S.1 aSambhare, Susmit B.1 aSonawane, Kailas D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0156-74660 tGene.g2018 Jan. 30, v. 641 p.310-325dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2017.10.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245011900160300001600279520111500295592002801410650001801438650002101456650001301477650001901490650001101509650001601520650001701536650001701553650001801570650001601588650001501604650001801619650002501637650001501662650001801677650002201695650000901717650001901726651001001745653001901755653001601774653002201790653002201812653001401834700001501848700002001863700001901883773011201902856007702014852000902091655001202100IND60516449820221119064801.0160325e20140708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051644982DNAL7 a10.1139/cjm-2014-01042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Zhaoxia10aBiodegradation of type II pyrethroids and major degraded products by a newly isolated Acinetobacter sp. strain JN8  ap. 541-545.  aA Gram-negative aerobic bacterium, designated as JN8, was isolated from activated sludge and soil in a pesticides factory in China. It was found that JN8 had a high capacity for degrading a broad range of type II pyrethroids and utilizing these pyrethroids as the sole carbon source for cell growth. The degradation rates of a 100 mg·L⁻¹ concentration of β-cypermethrin, cypermethrin, fenpropathrin, fenvalerate, and deltamethrin by JN8 in mineral salt medium were 74.1%, 64.9%, 57.9%, 48.1% and 34.9%, respectively. Strain JN8 was identified as a species of Acinetobacter based on its biochemical properties and 16S rRNA sequence analysis. β-Cypermethrin was degraded by JN8 through hydrolysis of the carboxylester linkage to form 3-phenoxybenzoic acid and 3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid, both of which could be further degraded by JN8. JN8 is the first strain of an Acinetobacter species in which pyrethoid-degrading activity has been detected, and such a feature makes it a potential resource for disposal of waste and effluent from pyrethroid manufacturing facilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aactivated sludge 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3acell growth 3acypermethrin 3adeltamethrin 3afenpropathrin 3afenvalerate 3ahydrolysis 3amanufacturing 3anucleotide sequences 3apyrethrins 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asoil 3awaste disposal 3aChina 0abiodegradation 0apyrethroids 0aAcinetobacter sp. 0adegraded products 0aisolation1 aGuo, Qiong1 aZhang, Zongshen1 aYan, Tongshuai0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2014 July 8, v. 60, no. 8 p.541-545dNRC Research Pressx1480-32757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2014-01043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245014300161300001400304520141900318592002801737650003401765650002101799650001601820650001501836650004301851650001901894650001901913650002201932650002501954650004401979650001202023650001302035700001602048700001702064700001402081700002002095700001302115700001302128700001402141700001702155700001802172700001602190700001902206773009902225856008102324852000902405655001202414IND60574048120221122093111.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057404812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-016-3218-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Fan10aExploratory Purification of Compounds from Aqueous Extracts of Pinus massoniana Lamb. by Two-Dimensional Preparative Liquid Chromatography  ap. 39-43.  aAn off-line orthogonal two-dimensional preparative liquid chromatography method was developed for isolation of high-purity compounds from aqueous extracts of Pinus massoniana Lamb., which has efficient therapeutic properties in recipes of traditional Chinese medicines. A polar-enhanced reversed-phase (RP) column, XAqua C18 was selected for the first-dimensional separation. A HILIC column and a hydrophobic RP column were both explored in the second dimension. The preparation results indicated hydrophilic RP × HILIC mode would provide better separation efficiency for polar complexes, i.e., the second-dimensional separation was finished in less than 30 min and high-purity compounds were obtained. In this work, 16 fractions were collected efficiently in the first dimension with a recovery up to 96%, and six compounds with high purity and enough quantity were identified by NMR and high resolution mass spectrometry, including epicatechin, betuloside, taxifolin-3-O-xyloside, cedrusin-4-O-glucoside, massonianoside C and massonianoside D, and five are glycosides, including flavonoid glycosides, lignanoid glycosides and an arylbutanoid glycoside. Betuloside was first reported in the preparation of Pinus massoniana Lamb. This work demonstrated a flexible strategy of compromise in between time and resolution for selecting solvent and column to enhance preparative efficiency of polar complex systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aPinus massoniana 3aepicatechin 3aglycosides 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amass spectrometry 3amedicinal properties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arecipes 3asolvents1 aZhao, Manxi1 aZhang, Xiuli1 aLi, Qiang1 aXiao, Yuansheng1 aKe, Xiao1 aHe, Jian1 aYe, Liang1 aFeng, Jiatao1 aHao, Xiaofeng1 aKe, Zunhong1 aLiang, Xinmiao0 tChromatographia.g2017 Jan., v. 80, no. 1 p.39-43dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-016-3218-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03810naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245013700207520217700344592002802521650002002549650001702569650002302586650002002609650001102629650001302640650001602653650002802669650000902697650001302706650001902719650001602738650001202754651001502766653001102781653002102792653002202813653002602835653000802861653000802869653000802877653000802885653000802893653000802901653000802909700001602917700006002933700002102993700001603014700001603030773010403046856008503150852000903235655001203244IND60712977820221119205530.0211206e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071297782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1102852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkter, Rokeya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4765-949710aClimate variability, socio-ecological factors and dengue transmission in tropical Queensland, Australia: A Bayesian spatial analysis  aDengue is a wide-spread mosquito-borne disease globally with a likelihood of becoming endemic in tropical Queensland, Australia. The aim of this study was to analyse the spatial variation of dengue notifications in relation to climate variability and socio-ecological factors in the tropical climate zone of Queensland, Australia.Data on the number of dengue cases and climate variables including minimum temperature, maximum temperature and rainfall for the period of January 1ˢᵗ, 2010 to December 31ˢᵗ, 2015 were obtained for each Statistical Local Area (SLA) from Queensland Health and Australian Bureau of Meteorology, respectively. Socio-ecological data including estimated resident population, percentage of Indigenous population, housing structure (specifically terrace house), socio-economic index and land use types for each SLA were obtained from Australian Bureau of Statistics, and Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, respectively. To quantify the relationship between dengue, climate and socio-ecological factors, multivariate Poisson regression models in a Bayesian framework were developed with a conditional autoregressive prior structure. Posterior parameters were estimated using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation with Gibbs sampling.In the tropical climate zone of Queensland, the estimated number of dengue cases was predicted to increase by 85% [95% Credible Interval (CrI): 25%, 186%] and 7% (95% CrI: 0.1%, 14%) for a 1-mm increase in average annual rainfall and 1% increase in the proportion of terrace houses, respectively. The estimated spatial variation (structured random effects) was small compared to the remaining unstructured variation, suggesting that the inclusion of covariates resulted in no residual spatial autocorrelation in dengue data.Climate and socio-ecological factors explained much of the heterogeneity of dengue transmission dynamics in the tropical climate zone of Queensland. Results will help to further understand the risk factors of dengue transmission and will provide scientific evidence in designing effective local dengue control programs in the most needed areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMarkov chain 3aMonte Carlo method 3aautocorrelation 3adengue 3aland use 3ameteorology 3amosquito-borne diseases 3arain 3aresearch 3asocioeconomics 3atemperature 3atropics 3aQueensland 0aDengue 0aSpatial analysis 0aBayesian analysis 0aTropical climate zone 0aABS 0aBOM 0aCAR 0aCrI 0aDIC 0aGIS 0aSLA1 aHu, Wenbiao1 aGatton, Michelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1188-609X1 aBambrick, Hilary1 aCheng, Jian1 aTong, Shilu0 tEnvironmental research.g2021 Apr., v. 195 p.110285-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1102853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245010300158500001400261520131300275592002801588650001201616650001001628650001801638650001401656650001001670650001001680650001301690650000901703650003101712650001301743650004401756650002801800650001501828650001801843650001001861700002201871773012001893856007502013852000902088655001202097IND60729163120221120163348.0210228e20210129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072916312DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110203432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavery, Anna10aProxy Measures and Novel Strategies for Estimating Nitrogen Utilisation Efficiency in Dairy Cattle  aNAL-light  aThe efficiency with which dairy cows convert dietary nitrogen (N) to milk N is generally low (typically 25%). As a result, much of the N consumed is excreted in manure, from which N can be lost to the environment. Therefore there is increasing pressure to reduce N excretion and improve N use efficiency (NUE) on dairy farms. However, assessing N excretion and NUE on farms is difficult, thus the need to develop proximate measures that can provide accurate estimates of nitrogen utilisation. This review examines a number of these proximate measures. While a strong relationship exists between blood urea N and urinary N excretion, blood sampling is an invasive technique unsuitable for regular herd monitoring. Milk urea N (MUN) can be measured non-invasively, and while strong relationships exist between dietary crude protein and MUN, and MUN and urinary N excretion, the technique has limitations. Direct prediction of NUE using mid-infrared analysis of milk has real potential, while techniques such as near-infrared spectroscopy analysis of faeces and manure have received little attention. Similarly, techniques such as nitrogen isotope analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of urine, and breath ammonia analysis may all offer potential in the future, but much research is still required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3ablood 3acrude protein 3aexcretion 3afeces 3aherds 3aisotopes 3amilk 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anutrient use efficiency 3aprediction 3aurea nitrogen 3aurine1 aFerris, Conrad P.0 tAnimals.g2021 Jan. 29, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110203433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245004700166520128200213592002801495650001401523650001401537650002401551653003601575653004401611653002101655653003601676700001501712700001901727700001101746700002001757773011401777856008601891852000901977655001201986IND60697844720221119032642.0220426e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069784472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1230782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jinlan10aOriented oxidation of all alkanes in soils  aIn order to investigate the mechanism of the oriented oxidation of all alkanes by regulating organic functional groups, Fenton oxidation was performed in two soils (S1 and S2: total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) are 26,281 mg/kg and 12,668 mg/kg). The higher the proportion of hydroxyl radicals (OH) transferred (41 %–58 %), the more the number of oriented oxidation of alkanes, which realized the oriented oxidation of all alkanes. Meanwhile, high oriented oxidation of long alkanes and short alkanes (58 %: 3405 mg/kg and 1729 mg/kg) was observed. Protein Ⅰ in soil organic matter (SOM) was reduced by regulating CH and carboxyl group OH, which indicated that protein Ⅰ was inactive. Protein Ⅰ oxidation after regulation was decreased significantly. Protein Ⅰ was the main active organic matter to capture OH. When the relative reactivity coefficient KTPH/SOM (the ratio of TPH oxidation to SOM oxidation) and KTPH/ₚᵣₒₜₑᵢₙ I (the ratio of TPH oxidation to protein Ⅰ oxidation) were higher than 1, low oxidation of SOM and protein Ⅰ was obtained. It indicated that for the oriented oxidation of all alkanes, the high coefficient of relative reactivity for petroleum was the key for the transfer of OH from oxidizing SOM to oxidizing alkanes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoxidation 3apetroleum 3asoil organic matter 0aThe proportion of OH allocation 0aRegulation of organic functional groups 0aLow dose of H2O2 0aRelative reactivity coefficient1 aFan, Peiqi1 aDong, Yanliang1 aXu, Lu1 aZheng, Yuanyuan0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 399 p.123078-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1230783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001800159245008900177300001800266500000900284520154500293592002801838650001501866650001301881650001201894650001601906650002601922650002401948650002301972650002201995650002802017650001202045651001602057700002102073700002302094773015002117852000902267856009602276655001202372IND2061158120221119063507.0191125e199707  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206115812DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1997.03615995006100040028x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobermann, A.10aResin Capsules for On-Site Assessment of Soil Nutrient Supply in Lowland Rice Fields  ap. 1202-1213.  aepub  aUsing ion-exchange resin capsules for assessing nutrient supply in lowland rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields requires strategies for estimating field means of resin adsorption quantities (RAQs). To develop recommendations for on-site use of capsules, we conducted two experiments in rice fields on Typic Tropaquepts and Tropaqualfs in the Philippines. Resin capsules were placed in situ (ISI) or inserted into composite soil samples for on-site incubation (OSI). Capsules were retrieved after 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 d and RAQs of NH₄-N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, and Mn were measured. In ISI or OSI of single soil cores, coefficients of variation in RAQs of N, P, and Fe ranged from 17 to 71%, whereas those for K and Ca ranged from 10 to 20%. Between one and five capsules per 0.25-ha field were required to estimate the average RAQ of P, K, and Ca after 14 d with a precision of ± 10%, compared with four to 10 capsules per field for estimating the RAQ of NH₄-N and Fe after 14 d. Soil core sampling and OSI of composite soil samples reduced microvariability in RAQs. About eight to 10 soil cores (0–15-cm depth) were required per field for resin capsule OSI. Because of soil physical changes, degassing, and oxidation during soil mixing, RAQs of P, Fe, K, and Ca were lower for OSI than for ISI. The ISI method is recommended for routine soil testing in lowland rice fields. The OSI requires fewer capsules but more labor. Its reliability depends on the extent to which mechanical disturbance, degassing, and exposure to air can be minimized.  aPublisher supplied data 3arice soils 3alowlands 3aAqualfs 3aInceptisols 3anutrient availability 3aion exchange resins 3asoil heterogeneity 3aspatial variation 3afertilizer requirements 3aAquents 3aPhilippines1 aPampolino, M.

Achieving optimal outcomes for both of these goals can bring them into conflict. An additional source of conflict can arise from the design of the abattoir. These problems are compounded by the dearth of research available to inform how livestock should be handled to achieve all of these goals. We applied the concept of ‘Optimal Flow’ to describe conditions under which rate of movement is maximised while overt signs of distress in sheep are minimised. Effectively, this represents the point at which trade-offs between speed and welfare converge. The current pilot study examined the behavioural interactions between humans (n = 5), livestock herding dogs (n = 7), and sheep (n = 3235) in a large Australian abattoir to describe the factors associated with an increase or decrease in rate of sheep movement per minute. It revealed that distress behaviours in sheep were associated with dog presence and with a decrease in livestock movement rate. However, we found that as sheep density increased, there was increased livestock movement rate as well as an elevated incidence of distress behaviours. Optimal Flow at this abattoir was achieved by maintaining sheep at lower densities. Our report discusses the possible confounds in this interpretation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3adistress 3adogs 3asheep 3aslaughterhouses1 aPayne, Elyssa 1 aMcGreevy, Paul 0 tAnimals.g2021 Jan. 29, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110203443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245007000160300001300230500001100243520172800254592002801982650001502010650002002025650002302045650001702068650003802085650002402123650001102147650001002158650004102168650001102209650001502220650001102235650001502246650001702261650001502278650001402293650001602307650002602323650001302349650001602362650001902378650003002397650001502427700001602442700001102458700001602469773009802485856008102583852000902664655001202673IND60574048320221122093104.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057404832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-016-3186-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMan, Yan10aAnalytical Methods for the Determination of Alternaria Mycotoxins  ap. 9-22.  aReview  aThe genus Alternaria comprises ubiquitous pathogens and saprophytes. They can even grow at low temperature, so they are the main fungi responsible for the spoilage of various fruits, vegetables, grains and their products during long-distance transport and refrigerated storage. Alternaria mycotoxins are the secondary metabolite of the genus Alternaria. They can be divided into five main classes according to their chemical structures, including dibenzopyrone derivatives, tetramic acid derivatives, perylene derivatives, AAL toxins and miscellaneous structures. Alternaria mycotoxins are associated with many health effects because of their mutagenicity, teratogenicity and carcinogenicity, which can cause economic losses to agriculture and serious diseases in humans and animals. So far, there is still a lack of monitoring data on these contaminants of Alternaria mycotoxins. Moreover, there are still no statutory or guideline limits set for Alternaria mycotoxins in food and feed by regulatory authorities worldwide. Until now, many analytical methods have been developed for the detection and quantification of Alternaria mycotoxins. On the basis of briefly introducing the chemical structures and toxicities of Alternaria mycotoxins, this article provides an overview of the progress achieved in the detection techniques for Alternaria mycotoxins, focusing on the analytical methods of thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography (LC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and so on. Finally, the problems of these analytical methods and future development trends are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3acarcinogenicity 3achemical structure 3acold storage 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afinancial economics 3afruits 3afungi 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agrains 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3amutagenicity 3amycotoxins 3apathogens 3asaprophytes 3asecondary metabolites 3aspoilage 3atemperature 3ateratogenicity 3athin layer chromatography 3avegetables1 aLiang, Gang1 aLi, An1 aPan, Ligang0 tChromatographia.g2017 Jan., v. 80, no. 1 p.9-22dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-016-3186-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245006400189300001600253500001500269520097000284592002801254650002801282650001601310650001401326650001101340650002101351650001801372650001001390650002201400650002501422650003301447650002701480650001601507650002801523650002201551650002101573650002601594650002701620653002401647773010401671856008101775852000901856655001201865IND50060227920221118231740.0141110e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006022792DNAL7 a230172412pmid7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2012.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenderson, Ian R.,10aControl of meiotic recombination frequency in plant genomes  ap. 556-561.  a2019-12-06  aSexual eukaryotes reproduce via the meiotic cell division, where ploidy is halved and homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal genetic exchange, termed crossover (CO). CO frequency has a profound effect on patterns of genetic variation and species evolution. Relative CO rates vary extensively both within and between plant genomes. Plant genome size varies by over 1000-fold, largely due to differential expansion of repetitive sequences, and increased genome size is associated with reduced CO frequency. Gene versus repeat sequences associate with distinct chromatin modifications, and evidence from plant genomes indicates that this epigenetic information influences CO patterns. This is consistent with data from diverse eukaryotes that demonstrate the importance of chromatin structure for control of meiotic recombination. In this review I will discuss CO frequency patterns in plant genomes and recent advances in understanding recombination distributions.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainterspecific variation 3achromosomes 3aevolution 3aploidy 3aeukaryotic cells 3acell division 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3arepetitive sequences 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aCrossing Over, Genetic 2aGenome Size 2aGenome, Plantxgenetics 2aMeiosisxgenetics 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aRecombination, Genetic 0aspecies differences0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2012 Nov., v. 15, no. 5 p.556-561dElsevier Ltdx1369-52667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2012.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005100139245011300190300001800303500002000321520173000341592002802071650002102099650002202120650001902142650002202161650002002183650001802203650001202221650002202233650001802255650001602273650002102289650001102310650004102321650001302362650003002375650001002405650001202415650001302427650002302440700001502463700001902478700001702497700002702514700002502541773014802566856007402714961001302788852000902801655001202810IND60588362820221117081758.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058836282DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.85632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yuan1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5453-237710aComparative analysis of juice volatiles in selected mandarins, mandarin relatives and other citrus genotypes  ap. 1124-1131.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Citrus fruit flavor is an important attribute prioritized in variety improvement. The present study compared juice volatiles compositions from 13 selected citrus genotypes, including six mandarins (Citrus reticulata), three sour oranges (Citrus aurantium), one blood orange (Citrus sinensis), one lime (Citrus limonia), one Clementine (Citrus clementina) and one satsuma (Citrus unshiu). RESULTS: Large differences were observed with respect to volatile compositions among the citrus genotypes. ‘Goutou’ sour orange contained the greatest number of volatile compounds and the largest volatile production level. ‘Ponkan’ mandarin had the smallest number of volatiles and ‘Owari’ satsuma yielded the lowest volatile production level. ‘Goutou’ sour orange and ‘Moro’ blood orange were clearly distinguished from other citrus genotypes based on the analysis of volatile compositions, even though they were assigned into one single group with two other sour oranges by the molecular marker profiles. CONCLUSIONS: The clustering analysis based on the aroma volatile compositions was able to differentiate mandarin varieties and natural sub‐groups, and was also supported by the molecular marker study. The gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of citrus juice aroma volatiles can be used as a tool to distinguish citrus genotypes and assist in the assessment of future citrus breeding programs. The aroma volatile profiles of the different citrus genotypes and inter‐relationships detected among volatile compounds and among citrus genotypes will provide fundamental information on the development of marker‐assisted selection in citrus breeding. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus aurantium 3aCitrus clementina 3aCitrus limonia 3aCitrus reticulata 3aCitrus sinensis 3aCitrus unshiu 3aSatsuma 3abreeding programs 3acitrus juices 3aclementines 3acluster analysis 3aflavor 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agenotype 3amarker-assisted selection 3aodors 3aoranges 3asatsumas 3avolatile compounds1 aBai, Jinhe1 aChen, Chunxian1 aPlotto, Anne1 aBaldwin, Elizabeth A.,1 aGmitter, Frederick G0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Feb., v. 98, no. 3 p.1124-1131dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.85633Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01983naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012900163300001600292520094100308592002801249650002301277650001701300650001201317650003001329650001301359650001901372650001201391700001501403773009301418852000901511856008101520930003301601946001101634655001201645IND60437386020221122085138.0151022e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043738602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-007-0918-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBillick, I.10aTesting the importance of the distribution of worker sizes to colony performance in the ant species Formica obscuripes Forel  ap. 113-117.  aWe examined the relationship between colony performance and the distribution of worker sizes within colonies in the ant species, Formica obscuripes. We manipulated the distribution of worker sizes within colonies and found that experimental colonies whose distributions mimicked the natural distributions retained a larger percentage of colony biomass over three weeks when fed on honeydew, relative to colonies composed of only large or only small workers. In natural colonies most of the variation in worker sizes was found within, as opposed, to between colonies, suggesting that homeostatic mechanisms within colonies regulated the distribution of worker sizes. While there were no disjunctions in the distribution of worker sizes within colonies, the distribution tended to be bimodal. This study demonstrates that the distribution of worker sizes within colonies is important even for ant species that lack discrete worker castes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormica obscuripes 3aant colonies 3abiomass 3ageographical distribution 3ahoneydew 3asocial insects 3atesting1 aCarter, C.0 tInsectes sociaux.g2007 May, v. 54, no. 2 p.113-117dBirkhäuser-Verlagx0020-18127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00040-007-0918-93Available from publisher's site  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03564naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245021200171300001400383520204500397592002802442650001202470650005302482650002302535650001202558650002202570650001902592650001002611650001702621650001102638651001002649653001602659653001302675653001202688653001702700653002802717700001602745700001402761700001802775700001902793700001602812700001602828700001602844700001402860773010002874856008702974852000903061655001203070IND60531539520221118002017.0170719e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053153952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Qingyuan10aIdentification of complex septic odorants in Huangpu River source water by combining the data from gas chromatography-olfactometry and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography using retention indices  ap. 36-44.  aIdentification of the trace odorants causing the septic odors in source waters with complex matrixes has long been a big challenge. The Huangpu (HP) River, an important source water for Shanghai, has long been suffering from septic and musty odors, although major odorants have not been identified. In this study, combining the data from gas chromatography-olfactometry with mass spectrometry (GC-O/MS) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC-TOFMS) using retention indices (RIs) was used for the identification of odorants in HP source water. Olfactometry peaks detected in water extracts by GC-O/MS were combined with the chromatography peaks detected by GC×GC-TOFMS based on the RIs determined using the retention times (RTs) of alkanes C7–C30. A total of thirteen olfactometry peaks were obtained though GC-O/MS analysis, and potential odorants corresponding to each of the olfactometry peaks were screened based on the odor characteristics and match similarity using GC×GC-TOFMS. Finally, fourteen odorants (one odorant was detected in GC×GC-TOFMS without an olfactometry peak), including three septic odorants (bis(2-chloroisopropyl) ether, diethyl disulfide and dimethyl disulfide) and two musty ones (geosmin and 2-MIB), were confirmed by using authentic standards. The septic and musty odorants in six source water samples taken over a period of six months were quantified. Bis(2-chloroisopropyl) ether, with an odor activity value (OAV) of 1.84–3.2, was found to be a major septic odorant in HP source water, followed by diethyl disulfide (OAV 1.56–1.96) and dimethyl disulfide (OAV 0.37–2.42), while geosmin (OAV 4.37–11.44) was the major musty odorant, followed by 2-MIB (OAV 1.13–1.89). This is the first comprehensive study focusing on the identification of odorants in a complex source water. The integrated approach used in this study could be applied for the identification of odorants in other complex source waters suffering similar odor problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3adimethyl disulfide 3ageosmin 3amass spectrometry 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aolfactometry 3arivers 3aChina 0aSeptic odor 0aOdorants 0aGC-O/MS 0aGC×GC-TOFMS 0aRetention indices (RIs)1 aYu, Jianwei1 aYang, Kai1 aWen, Xiaodong1 aZhang, Haifeng1 aYu, Zhiyong1 aLi, Hongyan1 aZhang, Dong1 aYang, Min0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 June 15, v. 556 p.36-44dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011300167300001600280520115400296592002801450650002901478650001201507650001701519650002401536650001801560650000901578650001401587650001501601651002101616700001601637773010901653856008501762852000901847655001201856IND60480663720221119074116.0160129e20080101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048066372DNAL7 a10.3318/BIOE.2008.108.2.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrong, J. A.10aHistorical chronologies of sedimentation and heavy-metal contamination in strangford lough, northern ireland  ap. 109-126.  a<p>Sediment coring for subsequent elemental analysis and radionuclide dating is an effective way to reconstruct sedimentation and contamination chronologies in sheltered marine environments. Of four sediment cores collected in Strangford Lough, three showed clear spikes in the mass accumulation of sediment in the late 1970s and early 1980s. These brief periods of heavy sedimentation also coincided with periods of conspicuous change in particle-size parameters in two cores. Monthly meteorological data for Northern Ireland suggest that wind speeds and rainfall were also above average for this period. However, the majority of the annualised meteorological data failed to correlate with the particle-size parameters or the sedimentation rate. Heavy-metal analysis indicated that most metals are near a predicted background concentration, although Cd appears to be particularly enriched, and Cd concentrations continue to increase in the most recent deposits. This study furthers our understanding of historical rates of sedimentation in Strangford Lough. The influence of anthropogenic activities on sedimentation dynamics is also discussed.</p>  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acadmium 3aheavy metals 3ameteorological data 3aparticle size 3arain 3asediments 3awind speed 3aNorthern Ireland1 aService, M.0 tBiology and environment.g2008 Jan. 1, v. 108, no. 2 p.109-126dThe Royal Irish Academyx0791-79457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3318%2FBIOE.2008.108.2.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245005500173300001300228520152700241592002801768650001101796650001001807650001301817650002101830650001501851650001301866650001601879650001901895650001001914650001201924700002101936700002201957773010501979856005502084852000902139655001202148IND4479294720221121180216.0120323e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447929472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-048X.2011.05515.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRawsthorne, John14aThe restricted seed rain of a mistletoe specialist  ap. 9-14.  aSpecialist frugivores are the dominant consumers of mistletoe fruit in many regions and have been shown to intensify infections of host plants as a result of their rapid gut passage rates and dependence on existing infections. The role of specialist frugivores in long distance dispersal of mistletoe and establishment of new infections is unclear, and has not been explicitly evaluated previously. Here we critically examine the premise that specialists are the dominant dispersers by examining the role of an Australian mistletoe specialist (mistletoebird Dicaeum hirundinaceum Dicaeidae) in dispersing mistletoe (Amyema preissii Santalales: Loranthaceae) seeds beyond infected host stands. We use two primary lines of evidence – presence of birds using remote call recorders, and presence of dispersed seeds via surveys for defecated seeds on host branches. The observed and inferred movements of the mistletoebird were wholly restricted to habitat patches containing mistletoe, and this bird was not observed to transport seeds to nearby uninfected host stands within the study system. While mistletoe specialists may provide much of the within‐stand dispersal service for mistletoes, this serves only to aggregate and intensify existing infections. We suggest that long distance dispersal of mistletoe seeds beyond existing hosts and infection centres is not performed by these dietary specialists, these services more likely to be provided by generalist frugivores and other occasional mistletoe fruit consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmyema 3abirds 3abranches 3adigestive system 3afrugivores 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3aseed dispersal 3aseeds 3asurveys1 aWatson, David M.1 aRoshier, David A.0 tJournal of avian biology.g2012 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.9-14dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-048X.2011.05515.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013300164300001600297520141100313592002801724650001501752650001001767650001901777650001701796650001501813650002201828650004101850650001101891650001601902650001501918650001401933650001801947650001301965650001401978650002501992700001502017700002002032700001902052700001502071700001802086700001202104700001702116700001602133773010102149856008102250852000902331655001202340IND60574048520221122093025.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057404852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-016-3206-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Tianxiao10aDetermination of Multiple Pesticides in Human Blood Using Modified QuEChERS Method with Fe3O4 Magnetic Nanoparticles and GC–MS  ap. 165-170.  aPesticides are often involved in numerous acute and fatal poisonings. Patients’ blood samples may be sent to a toxicological laboratory for a poisoning diagnosis. This study proposes a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) method for the determination of seven pesticides (malathion, methyl isofenphos, dichlorvos, chlorpyrifos, phenthoste, p,p′-DDD, p,p′-DDE) in human blood based on a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe (QuEChERS) sample preparation method with Fe₃O₄ magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as the new adsorbing material. It proved that Fe₃O₄ MNPs have excellent adsorbent function while purifying the complex blood sample and it is simple to be separated from the extract. Under the optimum conditions, the detection limits of the proposed method for seven pesticides ranged from 0.011 to 0.163 µg mL⁻¹. Good linearity (R value ≥0.9949) was achieved at concentration levels of 0.3–4.0 µg mL⁻¹, and acceptable method recoveries were found in the range of 70.0–111.8% at different concentrations, with the relative standard deviations (RSD) less than 10.5%. In short, the QuEChERS method with Fe₃O₄ MNPs used for removing impurities improved the speed of sample pre-treatment and exhibited an enhanced performance in purifying. It can be applied for both forensic and clinical cases of accidental or suicidal poisoning with these pesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3achlorpyrifos 3adichlorvos 3aforensic sciences 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahumans 3airon oxides 3aisofenphos 3amalathion 3ananoparticles 3apatients 3apoisoning 3astatistical analysis1 aWang, Teng1 aHuang, Zhenglan1 aHuang, Ningshu1 aZhang, Hui1 aLuo, Zhenhong1 aLi, Hui1 aDing, Shijia1 aFeng, Wenli0 tChromatographia.g2017 Jan., v. 80, no. 1 p.165-170dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-016-3206-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245007300156300001600229520115600245592002801401650002601429650001601455650001701471650001101488650001201499650001601511650001001527650002201537650001201559650001301571650001401584650001301598650001501611650002301626650001101649650001701660650004001677650001401717653001701731653001301748653002401761653002701785700002901812700002001841700002301861773011301884856007701997852000902074655001202083IND60516450320221117035338.0160325e20140624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051645032DNAL7 a10.1139/cjm-2014-02542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Xue10aProteome phenotyping of ΔrelA mutants in Enterococcus faecalis V583  ap. 525-531.  aThe (p)ppGpp synthetase RelA contributes to stress adaptation and virulence in Enterococcus faecalis V583. A 2-dimensional electrophoresis proteomic analysis of 2 relA mutants, i.e., ΔrelA carrying a complete deletion of the relA gene, and ΔrelAsp that is deleted from only its 3′ extremity, showed that 31 proteins were deregulated in 1 or both of these mutants. Mass spectrometry identification of these proteins showed that 10 are related to translation, including 5 ribosomal proteins, 3 proteins involved in translation elongation, and 2 proteins in tRNA synthesis; 14 proteins are involved in diverse metabolisms and biosynthesis (8 in sugar and energy metabolisms, 2 in fatty acid biosynthesis, 2 in amino acid biosynthesis, and 2 in nucleotide metabolism). Five proteins were relevant to the adaptation to different environmental stresses, i.e., SodA and a Dps family protein, 2 cold-shock domain proteins, and Ef1744, which is a general stress protein that plays an important role in the response to ethanol stress. The potential role of these proteins in the development of stress phenotypes associated with these mutations is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aamino acids 3abiosynthesis 3aenergy 3aethanol 3afatty acids 3agenes 3amass spectrometry 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aribosomal proteins 3asugars 3atransfer RNA 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3avirulence 0arelA mutants 0aproteome 0aguanine nucleotides 0ageneral stress protein1 aBudin-Verneuil, Aurélie1 aAuffray, Yanick1 aPichereau, Vianney0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2014 June 24, v. 60, no. 8 p.525-531dNRC Research Pressx1480-32757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2014-02543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012800167520124700295592002801542650001601570650002101586650004901607650002401656650001001680650000701690650001901697650002401716650001401740653001501754653002201769653002401791653001601815653001901831700001401850700002101864700001501885700001701900700001501917700001501932773011401947856008602061852000902147655001202156IND60697845120221119032453.0220426e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069784512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1230852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yu-Xuan10aS-TiO2/UiO-66-NH2 composite for boosted photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction and bisphenol A degradation under LED visible light  aSeries sulfur-doped TiO₂/amine-functionalized zirconium metal organic frameworks (S-TiO₂/UiO-66-NH₂) composites (U1Tx) were facilely fabricated from the as-prepared S-TiO₂ and UiO-66-NH₂ via ball-milling method. The photocatalytic activities of U1Tx toward Cr(VI) reduction and bisphenol A (BPA) degradation were tested under low-power LED visible light. The results demonstrated that U1T3 exhibited better photocatalytic performances than the pristine S-TiO₂ and UiO-66-NH₂ due to the improved separation and migration of electrons and holes. Furthermore, the influence factors like pH values and foreign ions on the photocatalytic performances of U1Tx were also investigated. The Box-Behnken design methodology was utilized to further clarify that the inorganic foreign anions and dissolved organic matters could exert significant effects on photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction performance. As well, the possible pathway of BPA degradation was depicted. After four runs of Cr(VI) removal, it was found that U1T3 exhibited preferable reusability and water stability. The probable reaction mechanism was proposed and verified by active species capture experiments, electron spin resonance determination and electrochemical analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aexperimental design 3alight 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3areaction mechanisms 3azirconium 0aUiO-66-NH2 0aSulfur-doped TiO2 0aHexavalent chromium 0aBisphenol A 0aPhotocatalysis1 aWang, Xun1 aWang, Chong-Chen1 aFu, Huifen1 aLiu, Yanbiao1 aWang, Peng1 aZhao, Chen0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Nov. 15, v. 399 p.123085-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1230853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04545naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245017500161300001800336506002800354506005900382520301200441592002803453596004503481506003703526650001603563650001803579650001703597650002103614650001103635650001103646650002803657650002303685650002503708653002003733653004103753653001103794700001503805700001603820773015303836856007903989903002204068852000904090655001204099IND60531870020221207064015.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053187002DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-102582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBender, R.W.10aComparison of in situ versus in vitro methods of fiber digestion at 120 and 288 hours to quantify the indigestible neutral detergent fiber fraction of corn silage samples  ap. 5394-5400.  aResource is Open Access  aAmerican Dairy Science Association License Information  aRuminal digestion of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) is affected in part by the proportion of NDF that is indigestible (iNDF), and the rate at which the potentially digestible NDF (pdNDF) is digested. Indigestible NDF in forages is commonly determined as the NDF residue remaining after long-term in situ or in vitro incubations. Rate of pdNDF digestion can be determined by measuring the degradation of NDF in ruminal in vitro or in situ incubations at multiple time points, and fitting the change in residual pdNDF by time with log-transformed linear first order or nonlinear mathematical treatments. The estimate of indigestible fiber is important because it sets the pool size of potentially digestible fiber, which in turn affects the estimate of the proportion of potentially digestible fiber remaining in the time series analysis. Our objective was to compare estimates of iNDF based on in vitro (IV) and in situ (IS) measurements at 2 fermentation end points (120 and 288h). Further objectives were to compare the subsequent rate, lag, and estimated total-tract NDF digestibility (TTNDFD) when iNDF from each method was used with a 7 time point in vitro incubation of NDF to model fiber digestion. Thirteen corn silage samples were dried and ground through a 1-mm screen in a Wiley mill. A 2×2 factorial trial was conducted to determine the effect of time of incubation and method of iNDF analysis on iNDF concentration; the 2 factors were method of iNDF analysis (IS vs. IV) and incubation time (120 vs. 288h). Four sample replicates were used, and approximately 0.5g/sample was weighed into each Ankom F 0285 bag (Ankom Technology, Macedon, NY; pore size=25 µm) for all techniques. The IV-120 had a higher estimate of iNDF (37.8% of NDF) than IS-120 (32.1% of NDF), IV-288 (31.2% of NDF), or IS-288 technique (25.7% of NDF). Each of the estimates of iNDF was then used to calculate the rate of degradation of pdNDF from a 7 time point in vitro incubation. When the IV-120 NDF residue was used, the subsequent rates of pdNDF digestion were fastest (2.8% h−1) but the estimate of lag was longest (10.3h), compared with when iNDF was based on the IS-120 or IV-288 NDF residues (rates of 2.3%h−1 and 2.4%h−1; lag times of 9.7 and 9.8 h, respectively). Rate of pdNDF degradation was slowest (2.1% h−1) when IS-288 NDF residue was used as the estimate of iNDF. The estimate of lag based on IS-288 (9.4h) was similar to lag estimates calculated when IS-120 or IV-288 were used as the estimate of iNDF. The TTNDFD estimates did not differ between treatments (35.5%), however, because differences in estimated pools of iNDF resulted in subsequent changes in rates and lag times of fiber digestion that tended to cancel out. Estimates of fiber digestion kinetic parameters and TTNDFD were similar when fit to either the linear or nonlinear fiber degradation models. All techniques also yielded estimates of iNDF that were higher than predicted iNDF based on the commonly used ratio of 2.4 × lignin.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acorn silage 3adigestibility 3afermentation 3ain vitro studies 3alignin 3amodels 3aneutral detergent fiber 3arumen fermentation 3atime series analysis 0afiber digestion 0aindigestible neutral detergent fiber 0alignin1 aCook, D.E.1 aCombs, D.K.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2016 July, v. 99, no. 7 p.5394-5400dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-102583Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245022500159500001400384520149100398592002801889650001301917650001101930650002501941650001301966650002001979650001501999650002502014650002602039700002002065700002202085700002502107700002402132700002202156700002002178700002002198773012002218856007502338852000902413655001202422IND60729163620221120204414.0210228e20210129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072916362DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110203472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrous, Emma 10aObservational Study on Variation of Longitudinal Platelet Counts in Calves over the First 14 Days of Life and Reference Intervals from Cross-Sectional Platelet and Leukocyte Counts in Dairy Calves up to Two Months of Age  aNAL-light  aPlatelet and leukocyte count reference intervals (RIs) for cattle differ by age and while adult RIs are known, RIs for calves are studied less. The aims of this observational study are to evaluate variation of platelet counts of Holstein Friesian calves over the first 14 days of life and to propose RIs for platelet and leukocyte counts of Holstein Friesian calves aged 0–60 days. In a longitudinal study, 19 calves were blood sampled 17 times, in the first 14 days of their lives. Blood was collected in a citrate blood tube and platelet counts were determined. We assessed the course of platelet counts. In a field study, 457 healthy calves were blood sampled once. Blood was collected in an EDTA blood tube and platelet and leukocyte counts were determined. The RIs were calculated by the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. Platelet counts started to increase 24 h after birth (mean platelet count 381 × 10⁹/L ± 138 × 10⁹/L) and stabilized after five days (mean platelet count 642 × 10⁹/L ± 265 × 10⁹/L). In calves up to six days of age, platelet counts were lower than in calves older than five days. In conclusion, the RIs of platelet and leukocyte counts in calves were wider in range than the RIs for adult cattle, therefore, calf specific RIs for platelet and leukocyte counts should be used. From 6 until 60 days of age, we propose an RI for platelet counts of 287–1372 × 10⁹/L and for the first 60 days of life an RI for leukocyte counts of 4.0–18.9 × 10⁹/L.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aadults 3ablood platelet count 3acitrates 3aleukocyte count 3aleukocytes 3alongitudinal studies 3aobservational studies1 aVanhoudt, Arne 1 aSmolenaars, Anja 1 avan Schaik, Gerdien 1 aSchouten, Matthijs 1 ade Pater, Henrik 1 aRoelofs, Bjorn 1 aNielen, Mirjam 0 tAnimals.g2021 Jan. 29, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110203473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010800163500002200271520134600293592002801639650003401667650002101701650002801722650002501750650001401775650001501789650001301804650002401817650001901841650002301860650001001883650002001893650004301913650001101956650001301967650001701980650001401997650001402011650001902025650001302044653001002057653000902067653000902076653001002085653001002095653001002105653000902115653000902124653001002133653000802143653000802151653001202159653000902171653001202180653001702192653002702209653001502236653001402251653001602265700002602281700001402307700001502321700001802336700001302354700001702367700001702384700001602401700001502417773005002432856008202482852000902564655001202573IND60585447520221122195454.0171109s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058544752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2017.10.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Yifan10aRecombinant latcripin 11 of Lentinula edodes C91-3 suppresses the proliferation of various cancer cells  aPre-press version  aLentinula edodes C91-3 is an edible mushroom that has demonstrated a remarkable anti-tumor effect in various cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we report the ability of recombinant thioredoxin-like latcripin 11 (LP-11) of Lentinula edodes C91-3 to suppress the proliferation of various cancer cells. The LP-11 gene of Lentinula edodes C91-3 was cloned in the pET-32a(+) expression vector and expressed in a prokaryotic system. The expressed protein was refolded by gradual dialysis and purified by affinity gel filtration chromatography. The antioxidant activity of LP-11 was tested by 1,1-dipheny l-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The anti-tumor activity of recombinant LP-11 was tested in eight kinds of tumor cell lines by CCK-8 assay. Recombinant LP-11 significantly suppressed the proliferation of various cancer cells, but not normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Human lymphoma U937 cells exhibited the most sensitivity to LP-11 protein. U937 cell apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V staining coupled with flow cytometry, and mitochondrial morphology was analyzed by light and electron microscopy. It was revealed that recombinant LP-11 induced apoptosis in human leukemic monocyte lymphoma U937 cells. Our findings suggest that recombinant LP-11 is a promising agent for the treatment of lymphoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aLentinula edodes 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3acell lines 3adialysis 3aelectron microscopy 3aflow cytometry 3agel chromatography 3agenes 3agenetic vectors 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahumans 3alymphoma 3amitochondria 3amonocytes 3amushrooms 3aneoplasm cells 3astaining 0aCCK-8 0aDPPH 0aA549 0aHep-2 0aHL-60 0aHUVEC 0aIPTG 0aK562 0aLP-11 0aPBS 0aROS 0aSGC7901 0aU937 0aUMSCC-6 0aLatcripin-11 0aLentinula edodes C91-3 0aExpression 0aAntitumor 0aAntioxidant1 aPadhiar, Arshad Ahmed1 aWang, Jia1 aZhang, Wei1 aZhong, Mintao1 aLiu, Ben1 aKang, Zhijie1 aWang, Xiaoli1 aLi, Xingyun1 aHuang, Min0 tGene.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2017.10.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245019300200300001600393500002000409520133900429592002801768650002701796650001301823650001801836650001801854650001301872650001001885650002601895650002401921650002701945650002801972650001502000650001002015650002002025650001202045700001902057700004002076700002502116773014602141856007402287852000902361655001202370IND60588363020221117081123.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058836302DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.85342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, Javier,1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9285-833210aEffects of correcting in situ ruminal microbial colonization of feed particles on the relationship between ruminally undegraded and intestinally digested crude protein in concentrate feeds  ap. 891-895.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: In situ estimates of ruminally undegraded protein (RUP) and intestinally digested protein (IDP) of ten concentrates, uncorrected or corrected for the ruminal microbial colonization, were used to examine the effects of this correction on the relationship between IDP and RUP values. Both variables were established for three rumen and duodenum cannulated wethers using ¹⁵N labeling‐techniques and considering measured rates of ruminal particle comminution (kc) and outflow (kₚ). RESULTS: A covariance analysis showed that the close relationship found between both variables (IDP = –0.0132 ± 0.00679 + 0.776 ± 0.0002 RUP; n = 60; P < 0.001; r = 0.960) is not affected by correcting for microbial colonization (P = 0.682). CONCLUSION: The IDP content in concentrates and industrial by‐products can be predicted from RUP values, thus avoiding the laborious and complex procedure of determining intestinal digestibility; however, a larger sample of feeds is necessary to achieve more accurate predictions. The lack of influence of the correction for microbial contamination on the prediction observed in the present study increases the data available for this prediction. However, only the use of corrected values may provide an accurate evaluation. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of covariance 3acannulas 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3aduodenum 3afeeds 3aindustrial byproducts 3alabeling techniques 3amicrobial colonization 3amicrobial contamination 3aprediction 3arumen 3astable isotopes 3awethers1 aMouhbi, Rabiaa1 aGuevara‐González, Jesús Alberto1 aArroyo, José María0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Feb., v. 98, no. 3 p.891-895dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.85343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245013600164500001400300520153700314592002801851650002701879650001201906650001101918650002101929650001101950650000901961650001801970650001301988650001502001650000902016650001802025651001002043700002402053700002402077700002302101700002202124700002302146773012002169856007502289852000902364655001202373IND60729163720221120153807.0210228e20210130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072916372DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110203482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalarce, Nicolás 10aAntimicrobial Use in Companion Animals: Assessing Veterinarians’ Prescription Patterns through the First National Survey in Chile  aNAL-light  aAlthough the relationship between the use of antimicrobials and the development of resistant bacteria is well established, information about the use of antimicrobials in companion animals has been poorly described, which represents a risk to public health. The aim of this study was to describe the antimicrobial prescription patterns of Chilean companion animal veterinarians. A nationally distributed survey targeted at companion animal veterinarians was designed. The survey included questions about the veterinarian’s demographics, bacterial diseases treated, prescribed antimicrobials, and the use of laboratory diagnostic tools. Three hundred twenty-three responses were collected, most of the respondents were female (59.4%). The most frequently reported bacterial diseases were pyoderma (17.2%), followed by otitis and abscesses (7.4%). The antimicrobials most used corresponded with critically or highly important drugs for veterinary and human use, including β-lactams (65.3%), quinolones (36.2%) and tetracyclines (23.2%). Only 15% of the veterinarians reported the use of laboratory diagnostic tests, although 67% declared they were aware of the official antimicrobial classification schemes. Our results describe for the first time the usage of antimicrobials by veterinarian practitioners in Chile to treat different diseases in companion animals.

The photosynthetic rate of plants growing at 2, 6 and 9Â°C was similar at 120Î¼molmâ»Â²sâ»Â¹ PPFD but the rate increased with increasing PPFD at all temperatures, particularly 9Â°C. Light saturation of photosynthesis was reached at approx. 300Î¼molmâ»Â²sâ»Â¹ at 2 and 6Â°C, and at approx. 600Î¼molmâ»Â²sâ»Â¹ at 9Â°C. At 300Î¼molmâ»Â²sâ»Â¹, the COâ exchange rate (CER) at 2Â°C was approx. 60% of that at 9Â°C. When the temperature increased gradually from 0Â°C at start to +5Â°C at the end of the 8-h photoperiod, CER decreased by about 20% compared with that at constant 5Â°C. Changing the temperature from constant +5Â°C to a diurnal variation between â2 and +2Â°C gradually decreased daytime CER to approx. 10% after five days, partly due to leaf area losses (â¼50% loss) when the poorly acclimatised plants were exposed to frost. At start of the photoperiod at â2Â°C CER was negative, but became slightly positive when temperature exceeded â1Â°C after two hours. Total daily photosynthesis was negative due to night-time respiration in this treatment. Soil heating to avoid freezing when the diurnal air temperature fluctuated between â3 and +3Â°C had no effect on CER at this low PPFD level (150Î¼molmâ»Â²sâ»Â¹). In contrast to the â2/+2Â°C treatment, total daily photosynthesis was slightly positive in the â3/+3Â°C treatment, where the plants were better acclimatised to frost. Increasing the COâ concentration from 350 to 600Î¼molmolâ»Â¹ had no effect on CER at 2 and 6Â°C, but increased it by 20% at 9Â°C. The data indicate that the minimum temperature for photosynthesis in the cultivar studied is about â4Â°C. The results can be applied in different photosynthesis models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium perenne 3aacclimation 3aair temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3adiurnal variation 3afreezing 3agrasses 3aleaf area 3alight intensity 3amechanistic models 3aoverwintering 3aphotoperiod 3aphotosynthesis 3asoil1 aHanslin, Hans M.1 aMortensen, L.

This study examined the influence of ecological factors (e.g. extent of grass and food availability) and anthropogenic factors (e.g. human activity and garden usage) on breeding site choice and reproductive success of the ground-nesting masked lapwing Vanellus miles on Phillip Island, Australia. Lapwings nested less frequently in residential properties (high levels of human usage) compared with vacant blocks and holiday houses. They were also more likely to breed on properties with high food availability and larger areas of grass. None of these variables influenced clutch size or the probability of eggs hatching, although larger clutches and higher hatching rates tended to be associated with more food. This study shows that, for an urban exploiting species, habitat quality is not homogenous at the scale of the house block, and that human activity is avoided by a species generally considered highly tolerant of people.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVanellus 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3aclutch size 3aeggs 3afood availability 3agardens 3agrasses 3ahabitats 3ahatching 3ahumans 3apets 3aprobability 3areproductive success 3awildlife 3aAustralia 0aSettlement 0aGarden 0aYard 0aMasked lapwings 0aDisturbance 0aVanellus miles1 aCardilini, Adam P.A.1 aLees, Daniel1 aMaguire, Grainne S.1 aDann, Peter1 aSherman, Craig D.H.1 aWeston, Michael A.0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 June 15, v. 556 p.189-195dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002500112245019100137300001600328506002800344520135600372592002801728506003701756650002001793650001401813650001601827650002001843650001001863650001901873650002101892650002901913650002601942650000901968650000901977650000701986650001301993650001102006650002202017653002502039653000802064653003802072653001302110700002902123773010102152852000902253655001202262IND60785295720221207131816.0120125e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078529572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aASTIRIN, OKID PARAMA10aIsocitrate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase and α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase polymorphysm enzyme of Black Tiger Shrimp (Penaeus monodon Fab.) which is hydrogen sulfide resistant  ap. 203-207.  aResource is Open Access  aThe hydrogen sulfide is one of compound which very often found in the shrimp pond caused by anaerobic decomposition or as a natural condition of the sea water which have volcano activity. This research was obtaining information of the differences of genetic expression between black tiger shrimp which could resist to H2S and the one which could not survive in this H2S. This research also trying to obtain information the genetic variety which could resist to H2S. The genetic variety of black tiger shrimp which could resist to H2S has been analysis with allozyme electrophoresis technique, using specific tissue meat and buffer CAPM (Citric Acid Aminopolimorpholine) pH 6. From the three enzymes analyzed it could be detected that IDH enzyme (Isocitrate dehydrogenase) has locus polymorphic, whereas enzyme α-GDP (α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase) and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) with monomorphic locus. The average heterozygosity for the group which could resist to H2S is 0.070, whereas the group which could not survive in the H2S is 0.042. The control group has heterozygosity 0.041. The group which could resist to H2S with higher heterozygosity will have bigger chance to survive and have better adaptation ability in environmental changes. A high heterozygosity made possible for genetic population improvement by exploiting the good gene.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPenaeus monodon 3aallozymes 3acitric acid 3aelectrophoresis 3agenes 3aheterozygosity 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aisocitrate dehydrogenase 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aloci 3ameat 3apH 3aseawater 3ashrimp 3avolcanic activity 0aPenaeus monodon Fab. 0aH2S 0aα-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase 0aallozyme1 aSUMITRO, SUTIMAN BAMBANG0 tBiodiversitas.g2006 July, v. 7, no. 3 p.203-207dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001900170245009500189300001800284520114400302592002801446650001801474650001901492650001901511650001901530650000901549650001501558650002201573650002101595650002801616650002301644650002001667650001501687650001601702650001901718650001701737650001601754650002701770650002001797650002001817650002001837700001901857700002401876700001901900700001901919700002501938700002401963700002701987773011202014856008702126852000902213655001202222IND4466814420221118231714.0141112e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446681442DNAL7 a213565442pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Zhaosheng10aWater and heat transport in boreal soils: Implications for soil response to climate change  ap. 1836-1842.  aSoil water content strongly affects permafrost dynamics by changing the soil thermal properties. However, the movement of liquid water, which plays an important role in the heat transport of temperate soils, has been under-represented in boreal studies. Two different heat transport models with and without convective heat transport were compared to measurements of soil temperatures in four boreal sites with different stand ages and drainage classes. Overall, soil temperatures during the growing season tended to be over-estimated by 2–4°C when movement of liquid water and water vapor was not represented in the model. The role of heat transport in water has broad implications for site responses to warming and suggests reduced vulnerability of permafrost to thaw at drier sites. This result is consistent with field observations of faster thaw in response to warming in wet sites compared to drier sites over the past 30years in Canadian boreal forests. These results highlight that representation of water flow in heat transport models is important to simulate future soil thermal or permafrost dynamics under a changing climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage structure 3aboreal forests 3aclimate change 3agrowing season 3aheat 3apermafrost 3asimulation models 3asoil temperature 3asoil thermal properties 3asoil water content 3atemperate soils 3awater flow 3awater vapor 2aClimate Change 2aCold Climate 2aEnvironment 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aHot Temperature 2aSoilxchemistry 2aWater Movements1 aNeff, Jason C.1 aHarden, Jennifer W.1 aZhang, Tingjun1 aVeldhuis, Hugo1 aCzimczik, Claudia I.1 aWinston, Gregory C.1 aO'Donnell, Jonathan A.0 tScience of the total environment.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 409, no. 10 p.1836-1842dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009700171300001600268520147000284592002801754650001601782650002101798650002001819650000901839650002401848650001501872650001201887650003101899650001001930650001201940650001001952650001501962700002701977700001702004773014602021856008402167852000902251655001202260IND60123483720221118071631.0150325e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012348372DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2012.7415522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEinfalt, Lisa M.10aBehavior, Growth and Habitat Selection of Hatchery Esocids Reared with Artificial Vegetation  ap. 345-352.  aWe evaluated the effect of adding artificial vegetation to the rearing environment on behavior, habitat selection, and growth of hatchery esocids in laboratory experiments. First, Muskellunge Esox masquinongy and the hybrid Tiger Muskellunge (Muskellunge × Northern Pike E. lucius) resided separately in pools either with or without artificial vegetation (250 stems/m ²) for 2 weeks. Both taxa raised in vegetated pools dispersed and spent more time away from the sides of the pools than did individuals residing in open pools. Tiger Muskellunge in vegetated pools also startled less often than fish in open pools, whereas vegetation did not decrease Muskellunge startle behavior. We next examined habitat selection between esocids raised in tanks with and without vegetation. Fish were tested in semivegetated pools, and for Tiger Muskellunge acclimated in vegetation, more fish (80%) used the vegetated half of the pool compared with fish raised in open tanks (61%). Muskellunge, regardless of treatment, spent a high proportion (>90%) of time in vegetation. Finally, growth of both taxa was similar between esocids reared in vegetated tanks compared with esocids reared in open tanks. The presence of artificial vegetation in tanks caused changes in behavior for both esocid taxa, but Tiger Muskellunge were more flexible in modifying their behavior. Behavioral responses resulting from exposure to vegetation could increase survival after stocking in lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEsox lucius 3aEsox masquinongy 3abehavior change 3afish 3ahabitat preferences 3ahatcheries 3ahybrids 3alaboratory experimentation 3alakes 3arearing 3astems 3avegetation1 aWojcieszak, Douglas B.1 aWahl, D.

Frangakis et al. (2007, Biometrics 63, 641–662) proposed an approach for estimating the causal effects under a strong monotonicity (SM) assumption. In this article, we focus on identifiability of the joint distribution of the covariate, treatment and potential outcomes, show sufficient conditions for identifiability, and relax the SM assumption to monotonicity (M) and no‐interaction (NI) assumptions. We derive expectation–maximization algorithms for finding the maximum likelihood estimates of parameters of the joint distribution under different assumptions. Further we remove the M and NI assumptions, and prove that signs of the causal effects of a treatment in the subgroups are identifiable, which means that their bounds do not cover zero.

Powdery mildew caused by Phyllactinia guttata has been reported in Italy and in most European countries, but recently in Austria, Switzerland, and central Europe a new species has been found (Beenken et al. 2020; Voglmayr et al. 2020). During summer 2020, in Villar Fioccardo (Torino province, Piedmont, Italy) on hazelnut (cv. ‘Tonda Gentile’) growing on the edges of private gardens and parks, an extensive colonization of the adaxial side of the leaves with white powdery mycelium covering more than 80% of the surface was observed. Also, the abaxial side of the leaves showed the scattered presence of powdery, white, and thin mycelium. The fungus collected from leaves showed amphigenous, hyaline, branched, septate, 1.5 to 3.7 μm wide mycelium; lobed, solitary hyphal appressoria; vertically elevated above the mycelium 53 to 82 μm long and 5 to 12 μm wide conidiophores (n = 30); hyaline, ellipsoid, ovoid to doliform conidia, solitary on conidiophores, 21 to 36 μm long, 15 to 21 μm wide (average 28 to 18 μm) (n = 50). Chasmothecia appeared in late September 2020, and they were spherical, single or in groups, 83 to 138 (average 100) μm in diameter (n = 50); seven to 15 aseptate appendages were straight, sometimes flexuous, 55 to 111 (average 73) μm long (n = 50), with four to five times dichotomous branched apexes and recurved tips. In each chasmothecium, there were three to five ellipsoid, ovoid to subglobose asci with a length of 41 to 60 μm and a width of 28 to 56 μm (average 52 to 44 μm) (n = 30). Asci contained four to eight ascospores, 15 to 26 μm long and 10 to 17 μm wide (average 19 to 12 μm) (n = 50). Mycelia were carefully collected by scraping them off with a scalpel, and the DNA was extracted by using the E.Z.N.A. Fungal DNA Mini Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Darmstadt, Germany). Partial rDNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of two isolates (DB20SET01 and DB20SET02) was amplified using specific primers PMITS1/PMITS2 (Cunnington et al. 2003) and sequenced. Obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession nos. MW045425 and MW045426). BLAST analysis of the obtained 749-bp fragments showed 100% identity to ITS rDNA sequences of Erysiphe corylacearum from Switzerland (MN822721) and Azerbaijan (LC270863). One-year-old plants of C. avellana, belonging to the cultivar Tonda Gentile, were artificially infected by dusting conidia from infected leaves. Inoculated plants were incubated under controlled conditions at 23 ± 1°C and 70 to 80% relative humidity. Typical symptoms (white bloom) appeared on the upper surface of the leaves at 8 to 10 days after inoculation. No symptoms were found on control plants treated with sterile water. The fungus isolated from inoculated leaves was morphologically identical to the original isolates from natural diseased plants. E. corylacearum causes a new and aggressive form of powdery mildew. Since the first observation in northeastern Turkey in 2013, it has spread rapidly throughout the Black Sea region, causing significant economic losses (Sezer et al. 2017). It has also been reported in Iran, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine (Arzanlou et al. 2018; Heluta et al. 2019). The disease has been observed sporadically in Piedmont, Italy, during summer 2020 (Regione Piemonte SFR and Agrion 2020) in some hazelnut growing areas without posing threat yet to the yield. This is the first report of E. corylacearum as an agent of powdery mildew on hazelnut in Italy. Such a finding suggests that this new powdery mildew may soon severely affect hazelnut groves in Italy and cause yield losses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorylus avellana 3aErysiphe 3aPhyllactinia 3aTurkey (country) 3aappressoria 3aasci 3aascospores 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3acultivars 3afungi 3ahazelnuts 3ahyphae 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amycelium 3anew species 3apiedmont 3apowdery mildew 3arelative humidity 3asummer 3aAustria 3aAzerbaijan 3aBlack Sea 3aCentral European region 3aIran 3aItaly 3aSwitzerland 3aUkraine 0aErysiphe corylacearum 0ahazelnut1 aGuarnaccia, V.1 aMartano, G.1 aSpadaro, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5207-93450 tPlant disease.g2021 May 15, v. 105, no. 05 p.1565-dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-10-20-2281-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245009200179300001800271500000900289520161200298592002801910650002201938650002501960650002301985650001702008650001602025650001702041650003702058650002302095650002202118650001402140650003302154650001102187650001302198651001002211651001802221700001602239700001702255773012302272852000902395856009802404655001202502IND2123917220221123033435.0191122e199707  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212391722DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1997.0011183X003700040023x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaynes, K.

Tubers from susceptible plants may have superficial, raised, or pitted lesions. Quantitative methods to evaluate tubers for the amount of surface area covered (AI) and the type of lesion (LI) have previously been developed. The purposes of this study were to (i) estimate broad-sense heritability on a mean basis for scab resistance in a tetraploid population of Solanum tuberosum for AI and LI, (ii) determine the importance genotype × environment interactions on AI nd LI, and (iii) determine the stability of potato genotypes for scab resistance. In 1992 and 1993, 23 potato clones were grown in replicated scab-infested field plots in Presque Isle, ME, and Cranesville, WV, and rated for AI and LI. There were significant environment, genotype, and genotype × environment efftects for AI and LI. Broad-sense heritabilities on a mean basis and their exact 95% confidence intervals for AI and LI wer estimated as 0.89 (0.78, 0.95) and 0.93 (0.86, 0.97), respectively. Shukla's stability-variance statistics indicated that the most scab resistant genotypes were the most unstable, whereas, the most susceptible genotypes were the most stable. Thus, disease pressure was intense. Moderate levels of scab resistance were found. However, to obtain genotypes with high levels of scab resistance that are stable across environments will probably require development of populations incorporating new sources of scab resistant germplasm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aStreptomyces scabiei 3adisease resistance 3aheritability 3atetraploidy 3asurface area 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agenetic resistance 3agenetic stability 3acultivars 3aplant diseases and disorders 3atubers 3agenotype 3aMaine 3aWest Virginia1 aGoth, R.

J.10aCentrarchid Assemblages in Floodplain Lakes of the Mississippi Alluvial Valley  ap. 323-332.  aThe family Centrarchidae is a principal and visible component of the ichthyofauna in most warmwater ecosystems in North America, and many of its species provide key recreational fisheries. We examined the significance of various local environmental factors to 13 centrarchid species in 53 floodplain lakes (remnant channels) of the Mississippi alluvial valley to identify major environmental gradients influential in structuring centrarchid assemblages. With few exceptions, changes in forest representation in the land cover, both in the lakeshore and the catchment, had the strongest associations with centrarchid assemblages. Other influential factors included depth, water clarity, and primary productivity. Connectivity to adjacent streams was weakly correlated with centrarchid assemblage structure and correlated only with a small number of species. Lake area did not appear to affect centrarchid assemblages. Recognition that land cover has the strongest correlation with centrarchid assemblage composition suggests a landscape basis for developing management plans. However, conservation and restoration of native centrarchid assemblages in these unique ecosystems will require both watershed management to curtail inputs and in-lake management to reverse years of neglect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentrarchidae 3aalluvial plains 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3afloodplains 3aforests 3alakes 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3aprimary productivity 3asport fishing 3astreams 3awater quality 3awatershed management 3awatersheds 3aMississippi 3aMississippi River1 aMiranda, L.

Noting the presence of two distinct putative glutamate dehydrogenases (GDH), we constructed knockout mutants of each gene with Streptomyces coelicolor M145 and examined the functionality related to antibiotic production. Out of the two, the sco2999 knockout (ΔgdhB, NAD⁺-specific) showed outstanding effects; it decreased the growth sevenfold but initiated the undecylprodigiosin (RED) production in complex Difco nutrient media which otherwise does not support the production from M145. With glucose supplementation, the growth difference by ΔgdhB disappeared but we could obtain significantly increased actinorhodin (ACT) and RED biosynthesis with the mutant by limiting the glucose content (0.5∼1.0 %, w/v). Complementing the gene to the knockout mutant inhibited the production, confirming its gene specificity. Along with the extended impacts on overall nitrogen metabolism based on the intracellular metabolite analysis and enzyme assays, GdhB and glutamate utilization were shown to interfere with N-acetylglucosamine metabolism and the activity of its associated global transcriptional regulator (DasR). Taken together, GdhB—subjected to the nutritional context-dependent regulation—is proposed as a key member of central nitrogen metabolism to control the secondary metabolism initiation in exploiting the organic nitrogen sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aN-acetylglucosamine 3aStreptomyces coelicolor 3aantibiotics 3abiosynthesis 3agene targeting 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3aglutamic acid 3aknockout mutants 3ametabolites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen metabolism 3atranscription factors1 aKim, Byung-Gee0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 June, v. 100, no. 12 p.5527-5536dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7433-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03670naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245013200209300001400341500001900355520162800374592002802002650001402030650001902044650002502063650002402088650001902112650001702131650001502148650002602163650001802189650001902207650002102226650000902247650001902256650002502275650001402300650001302314650001702327653001102344653000902355653001702364653001402381653002402395653001502419653000802434653000902442653000702451653000802458653000802466653000802474653000702482653000902489653001002498653000702508653000702515653000702522653000902529653000802538653000802546653000802554653000902562653000802571653000802579653000902587653000802596653001002604653000802614653000802622700002102630700001902651773008802670856008502758852000902843655001202852IND60709420420221120053407.0201104e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070942042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2020.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDierge, Emeline1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7395-600110aCancer diets for cancer patients: Lessons from mouse studies and new insights from the study of fatty acid metabolism in tumors  ap. 56-68.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSpecific diets for cancer patients have the potential to offer an adjuvant modality to conventional anticancer therapy. If the concept of starving cancer cells from nutrients to inhibit tumor growth is quite simple, the translation into the clinics is not straightforward. Several diets have been described including the Calorie-restricted diet based on a reduction in carbohydrate intake and the Ketogenic diet wherein the low carbohydrate content is compensated by a high fat intake. As for other diets that deviate from normal composition only by one or two amino acids, these diets most often revealed a reduction in tumor growth in mice, in particular when associated with chemo- or radiotherapy. By contrast, in cancer patients, the interest of these diets is almost exclusively supported by case reports precluding any conclusions on their real capacity to influence disease outcome. In parallel, the field of tumor lipid metabolism has emerged in the last decade offering a better understanding of how fatty acids are captured, synthesized or stored as lipid droplets in cancers. Fatty acids participate to cancer cell survival in the hypoxic and acidic tumor microenvironment and also support proliferation and invasiveness. Interestingly, while such addiction for fatty acids may account for cancer progression associated with high fat diet, it could also represent an Achilles heel for tumors. In particular n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids represent a class of lipids that can exert potent cytotoxic effects in tumors and therefore represent an attractive diet supplementation to improve cancer patient outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3acancer therapy 3acarbohydrate content 3acarbohydrate intake 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3afat intake 3afatty acid metabolism 3ahigh fat diet 3aketogenic diet 3alow calorie diet 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasm progression 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aradiotherapy 0aCancer 0aDiet 0aOmega-3 PUFA 0aKetogenic 0aCalorie-restriction 0aAmino-acid 0aALA 0aCD36 0aCR 0aCRP 0aDHA 0aEPA 0aER 0aFABP 0aFADS2 0aKD 0aLA 0aLD 0aMUFA 0aNMU 0an-3 0an-6 0aPUFA 0aRCT 0aROS 0aSCD1 0aSFA 0aSREBP 0aTCA 0aTME1 aLarondelle, Yvan1 aFeron, Olivier0 tBiochimie.g2020 Nov., v. 178 p.56-68dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2020.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002300135245012100158300001200279520124200291592002801533650001701561650001001578650001201588650001001600650001001610650001901620650001101639650001101650650001201661650001401673650001201687650002101699650002201720650001201742650001301754650001301767773009801780852000901878856007201887655001201959IND4433214020221119071702.0200510e20100301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443321402DNAL7 a10.1071/MU090572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriffith, Simon C.14aThe role of multiple mating and extra-pair paternity in creating and reinforcing boundaries between species in birds  ap. 1-9.  aExtra-pair paternity (EPP) is an important component of avian mating systems and can affect avian biodiversity by contributing to isolation between related forms. Over the past three decades, molecular surveys of more than 100 species have revealed EPP to be widespread in socially monogamous birds, significantly increasing the variance in reproductive success among males and helping to drive sexual selection on traits with which it is often associated (e.g. song, ornamental plumage). In the past 7 years many studies have also demonstrated that the distribution of EPP within a population is related to the level of genetic similarity between the parents. Multiple mating combined with sperm competition that follows a genetically loaded raffle model, would provide a route through which females could target compatible genes and act as an effective post-copulatory isolating mechanism between closely related species or forms in sympatry. EPP can result in significant divergence between an observed social mating system and the true underlying genetic mating system of a population or species, and needs to be considered in our attempts to define and understand species or morphs as genetically isolated populations in many cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3afemales 3agenes 3amales 3amating systems 3amodels 3amorphs 3aparents 3apaternity 3aplumage 3asexual selection 3asperm competition 3asurveys 3asympatry 3avariance0 tEmu.g2010 Mar. 1, v. 110, no. 1 p.1-9dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3957316x1448-55407nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MU090573Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02513naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245009600169300001600265500002000281520122400301592002801525650002101553650001401574650001401588650001701602650001401619650002501633650001901658650001101677650001401688650001901702650001501721650001301736650001401749650001001763651002201773700001701795700001801812700002401830773011501854852000901969856008901978655001202067IND2325497320221118093619.0210417e200112  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232549732DNAL7 a10.1046/j.0028-646X.2001.00277.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatty, A.

Seed germination was scored and compared with adult orchid plant distribution and soil factors. • A small fraction of available seed (< 1%) germinated to a stage of tuber formation where survival over the subsequent dry season would have been possible. Germination increased in the vicinity of adult C. arenicola plants, but other factors, such as soil potassium levels and presence of leaf litter, were also correlated with seed germination. • The measurement of the spatial variability in germination events within an orchid habitat demonstrated the availability of new recruitment sites. This information is required to assess the natural recruitment capacity and the potential for orchid reintroduction in natural habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseed germination 3aCaladenia 3asymbiosis 3aplant litter 3aseedlings 3aspatial distribution 3asoil chemistry 3atubers 3apotassium 3asoil fertility 3apopulation 3ahabitats 3amortality 3afungi 3aWestern Australia1 aDixon, K.

Experiments were conducted in a lab-scale CFB, within which either quartz or steel slag enriching in Mg was used as bed material to burn ZD at 950 °C. The particle size distribution, chemistry, mineralogy, morphology and in-situ sintering behaviour of the obtained samples were analysed in detail. Results showed that the discrete quartz particles were coated by a layer of submicron ash particles enriched in Ca and Mg. Na was less than 3% across the coating layer, but was enriched as Na silicates locally between quartz particles and initiated agglomeration. While heated in ESEM, Na silicates and those coated ashes became soft and even melted at 950-1100 °C, presenting a relatively low melting-point for agglomeration initiation. When steel slag was used as the bed material, Na in bottom ash became a negligible amount of 0.84 wt% as its chemical reaction with steel slag would not occur. The ash coating layer was also not formed on the steel slag, resulting in these particles in discrete state for agglomeration mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottom ash 3acombustion 3aenergy 3afluidized beds 3alignite 3amelting point 3aparticle size distribution 3aquartz 3aslags 3asteel 0aBed particle agglomeration 0aCirculating fluidized bed 0aMg-based steel slag 0aSodium 0aZhundong lignite1 aLi, Jianbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4645-38521 aLong, Xiaofei1 aLu, Xiaofeng0 tEnergy.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 245 p.123313-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1233133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05653naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011600168520370000284592002803984596007504012650001904087650000804106650002504114650002004139650001004159650001104169650001604180650001504196650002004211650001204231650001104243650001404254650001804268650001404286650001604300650001204316650001004328650004504338650001504383650001304398650003304411650001404444650001104458650001304469650001304482650001804495650001404513650001604527650001004543650001204553651001004565651001804575651001804593653001504611653001004626700001704636700001504653700001804668700005804686773013104744856008304875852000904958655001204967IND60748797520221122034023.0210827e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074879752DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-10-20-2298-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhaohui10aFirst Report of Colletotrichum aenigma Causing Apple Glomerella Leaf Spot on the Granny Smith Cultivar in China  aGlomerella leaf spot (GLS) is a devastating fungal disease causing premature defoliation on apple (Malus domestica). It was first reported in 1970s and since then has been reported in North America, South America, and Asia. GLS disease is caused by Colletotrichum fungi, and the pathogens are genetically diverse, encompassing at least nine species belonging to three species complexes (Velho et al. 2018). In August 2018, a disease with sudden leaf necrosis symptom, typical of GLS symptom appearance, occurred in a ‘Granny Smith’ orchard in Wugong county, China; over 70% of tree leaves bore brown and necrotic lesions. Small leaf tissues (3 to 4 mm²) cut from lesion margins were surface sterilized for 30 s in 3% NaClO and 30 s in 75% ethanol, followed by rinsing three times in sterile water before transferring onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates (25 ± 2°C). Seven isolates were obtained, all producing round cottony colonies on PDA, being white to pale on the upper side and dark green on the reverse side. Conidia were single-celled, cylindrical, and transparent (17.33 ± 1.29 × 5.11 ± 0.77 μm, n = 50). Appressoria were single-celled, thick-walled, dark brown, oval or irregular shaped, sometimes lobed (9.07 ± 0.88 × 6.66 ± 0.33 μm, n = 50). The morphological and cultural characteristics of the fungal isolates matched the descriptions of Colletotrichum aenigma (Weir et al. 2012). To confirm the species identity, genomic DNA was isolated from two representative isolates (QSG1 and QSY1), and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), actin (ACT), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta-tubulin (TUB2), manganese-superoxide dismutase (SOD2), chitin synthase (CHS), and calmodulin (CAL) regions were amplified by PCR using reported primers (Weir et al. 2012). The sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession nos. MT872061, MT873580, MT873581, MT888183, MT888185, MT888187, and MT888189 for QSG1; and MT834933, MT835166, MT873579, MT888182, MT888184, MT888186, and MT888188 for QSY1). BLASTn search against the GenBank nr database showed that ITS sequences of the two strains showed high nucleotide identity (over 99%) to sequences derived from the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex (CGSC). Further concatenated phylogenetic analysis with reported CGSC strains (Weir et al. 2012) placed QSG1 and QSY1 in the clade of C. aenigma. To fulfill Koch’s postulates, a field pathogenicity test was performed. The experiment was performed in an orchard located in Yangling in September 2020, with the daily average temperature ranging between 15 and 20°C. Healthy Granny Smith leaves were surface sterilized with 70% alcohol and inoculated with conidial suspension (10⁶ conidia/ml) using cotton swabs. For each isolate, 10 leaf inoculations were performed. Inoculation with distilled water served as a negative control. Inoculated leaves were covered with plastic bags to maintain high humidity, and the bags were removed at 48 h postinoculation. Conidium-inoculated leaves started to exhibit GLS-resembling necrotic lesions from 5 days postinoculation (dpi) onward. The lesion extent, however, varied among inoculated leaves, ranging from blurry, small-sized lesions to blight of the entire leaf. In contrast with conidium inoculations, water-inoculated leaves remained asymptomatic until 14 dpi. Reisolated fungi from the symptomatic leaf tissues were identical to C. aenigma in morphological appearance. Taken together, this is the first report of GLS on Granny Smith apple and the first report of C. aenigma causing apple GLS in China. This information should provide an important guideline for developing field control practices for GLS.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0201132cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aColletotrichum 3aDNA 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aMalus domestica 3aactin 3aapples 3aappressoria 3acalmodulin 3achitin synthase 3aconidia 3acotton 3acultivars 3aculture media 3adatabases 3adefoliation 3aethanol 3afungi 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aguidelines 3ahumidity 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3anecrosis 3aorchards 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3atemperature 3atrees 3atubulin 3aChina 3aNorth America 3aSouth America 0aGlomerella 0aapple1 aYan, Mingjie1 aLi, Wenwen1 aGuo, Yunzhong1 aLiang, Xiaofei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3279-58940 tPlant disease.g2021 May 15, v. 105, no. 05 p.1563-dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-10-20-2298-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245006200155300001400217520135300231592002801584650001001612650001401622650001301636650001701649650001701666650002101683650001801704650001201722650001301734700002601747773010001773852000901873856007201882655001201954IND4433214120221119071316.0200510e20100301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443321412DNAL7 a10.1071/MU090762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerg, Mathew L.14aThe evolution of plumage colouration in parrots: a review  ap. 10-20.  aThe plumages of parrots provide some of the most striking colouration in nature. We summarise the diversity of mechanisms producing colour in parrots and the current evidence for the adaptive significance of variation in the colour of parrot plumages. Only recently have detailed studies begun to unravel the mechanisms of their colour-production and colour-vision systems. Parrots produce much of their plumage colouration through a unique suite of pigments (psittacofulvins), or through a feather tissue nanostructure that results in coherent scattering of light, or a combination of the two (producing green). Psittacofulvins are found nowhere else in nature, and may even generate fluorescence in many parrot species. Compared with other avian taxa, the adaptive significance of parrot plumage colouration remains poorly understood, although some studies suggest that plumage colouration may form important sexual signals and may be used in mate-choice by several species. There is evidence to suggest that parrot colouration can be subject to both environmental and genetic control. We emphasise that parrots offer a distinctive and useful colouration system for further study. Further research is required to unravel how the dramatic colour patterns of parrots evolved, and what roles colour signals may play in the life histories of parrots.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aevolution 3afeathers 3afluorescence 3alife history 3alight scattering 3ananomaterials 3aparrots 3apigments1 aBennett, Andrew T.

Ann10aMolecular anthropology: the judicial use of genetic data in archaeology  ap. 141-145.  aAnthropology has always been an unashamed scavenger discipline, acquiring and employing techniques developed in other physical, life and social sciences to apply to a holistic approach to studying humanity. In this regard, the adoption of genetic analyses into archaeological investigations has paralleled many previous adoptions including those of radiometric dating, stable isotope analysis and chemical analysis of material culture. Employing DNA data in reconstructions of prehistory, however, has been hampered particularly by the expense of generating the data – both financial and logistical – and, at least initially, by unwarranted resistance to take seriously molecular data. While the expense continues to rise as new techniques become available, there has been a reversal in the place of genetic data in that it is now privileged over other sources of data. This kind of molecular chauvinism leads to overreach in interpretation and is no less likely to hamper our progress. Moving forward we would do best be judicial in the use of genetic data alongside other independent archaeological evidence in reconstructing the past.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aarchaeology 3achemical analysis 3agenetic analysis 3aradiometry 3astable isotopes 0aMolecular anthropology 0aAncient DNA 0aHominid evolution 0aBehavioral modernity 0aHominin evolution0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2015 Apr., v. 56 p.141-145dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2015.02.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245008900178300001200267520167800279592002801957650001901985650001802004650002002022650000902042650001702051650002202068650002502090650002802115650001102143650001902154650001102173650001602184650001302200653001102213653001602224653001202240653000902252700002502261700002302286700002702309700002002336700002402356700002802380700002602408773010302434856008502537852000902622655001202631IND60585876120221119071133.0190403e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058587612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTasioudi, Konstantia E.10aFactors influencing the outcome of primary immunization against rabies in young dogs  ap. 1-4.  aThere is currently limited information on the factors influencing the outcome of rabies vaccination in dogs based on the primary immunization schedule. The objective of this study was to investigate whether selected variables (signalment, number of vaccinations, vaccine brand and multivalence, and time interval between the most recent vaccination and blood sampling) were associated with the achievement of an acceptable titer threshold (based on international standards) and with absolute antibody titers in young dogs vaccinated with commercially available vaccines. Serologic data from 662 dogs tested prior to their first annual booster for rabies were retrospectively reviewed. Neutralizing antibody titers were determined using a fluorescent antibody neutralization test. An acceptable titer threshold (≥0.5IU/ml) was achieved in 86.5% of the dogs. Dogs that had been vaccinated twice had significantly (P<0.001) higher antibody titers compared with dogs vaccinated once. The odds of achieving seropositivity and the median absolute antibody titer tended to decrease with increasing time between vaccination and blood sampling. Dogs vaccinated with monovalent vaccines were more likely to achieve an acceptable titer than dogs vaccinated with polyvalent vaccines. Dogs that were vaccinated after 3–6 months of age were more likely to develop higher antibody titers. These results indicate that the administration of two vaccines rather than one vaccine in the primary immunization schedule for rabies, result in a superior vaccination response and may be a more beneficial policy for ensuring pre-exposure prophylaxis and for travel certification of young dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood sampling 3acertification 3adisease control 3adogs 3afluorescence 3aissues and policy 3aneutralization tests 3aneutralizing antibodies 3arabies 3aseroprevalence 3atravel 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aRabies 0aVaccination 0aCanines 0aFAVN1 aPapatheodorou, Dimos1 aIliadou, Peristera1 aKostoulas, Polychronis1 aGianniou, Maria1 aChondrokouki, Eleni1 aMangana-Vougiouka, Olga1 aMylonakis, Mathios E.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2018 Jan., v. 213 p.1-4dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01643naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245005900173300001800232520055700250592002800807650002100835650001400856650002200870650002200892650001500914650001300929700002200942700002200964700002000986700002101006700002201027773011801049856008201167990002301249852000901272655001201281IND60091116320221121161004.0141103e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009111632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViswanathan, Kishore10aViridin analogs derived from steroidal building blocks  ap. 6919-6922.  aNaturally occurring furanosteroids such as viridin and wortmannin have long been known as potent inhibitors of the lipid kinase PI-3K.

Isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods offer significant advantages over the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), since they are more rapid and do not require the sophisticated instruments needed for thermal cycling. We previously described a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method, ‘Strand Invasion Based Amplification’ (SIBA®), with high analytical sensitivity and specificity, for the detection of DNA. In this study, we describe the development of a variant of the SIBA method, namely, reverse transcription SIBA (RT-SIBA), for the rapid detection of viral RNA targets. The RT-SIBA method includes a reverse transcriptase enzyme that allows one-step reverse transcription of RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) and simultaneous amplification and detection of the cDNA by SIBA under isothermal reaction conditions. The RT-SIBA method was found to be more sensitive than PCR for the detection of influenza A and B and could detect 100 copies of influenza RNA within 15 min. The development of RT-SIBA will enable rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral RNA targets within point-of-care or central laboratory settings.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfluenza A virus 3aRNA 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aantibiotics 3acomplementary DNA 3adetection limit 3adisease control 3agene amplification 3ainfluenza 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3areverse transcription1 aFilén, Sanna,1 aOjalehto, Tuomas1 aBrummer, Mirko1 aElf, Sonja1 aPousi, Kirsi1 aHoser, Mark0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 June, v. 100, no. 12 p.5559-5567dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7491-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01976naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245008000169300001600249520077000265592002801035650001601063650001301079650002201092650001401114650001401128650001001142650002201152650001801174650002001192651001301212653001301225653001501238653003101253653002101284653002001305653001501325700002501340773009901365856008101464852000901545655001201554IND60573129020180620000000.0180620e20170524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057312902DNAL7 a10.1515/biolog-2017-00562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHindáková, Alica10aLife cycle of Aulosira epiphytica comb. nova (Cyanobacteria) just completed  ap. 494-499.  aAmong littoral mats of an irrigation canal in South Slovakia, long filaments of a heterocytous cyanobacterium were found that were longitudinally attached to filaments of Mougeotia sp. and the centric diatom Aulacoseira italica (Ehrenberg) Simonsen.

What biological factors contribute to variation in cross‐ecosystem movements, however, have rarely been examined. Here, we investigated how ontogeny (body size), sex and individual‐level behaviour impacts intrapopulation variation in cross‐ecosystem foraging (i.e. between freshwater and marine systems), by the top‐predator Alligator mississippiensis. Field surveys revealed A. mississippiensis uses marine ecosystems regularly and are abundant in estuarine tidal creeks (from 0·3 to 6·3 individuals per km of creek, n = 45 surveys). Alligator mississippiensis captured in marine/estuarine habitats were significantly larger than individuals captured in freshwater and intermediate habitats. Stomach content analysis (SCA) showed that small juveniles consumed marine/estuarine prey less frequently (6·7% of individuals) than did large juveniles (57·8%), subadult (73%), and adult (78%) size classes. Isotopic mixing model analysis (SIAR) also suggests substantial variation in use of marine/estuarine prey resources with differences among and within size classes between sexes and individuals (range of median estimates for marine/estuarine diet contribution = 0·05–0·76). These results demonstrate the importance of intrapopulation characteristics (body size, sex and individual specialization) as key determinants of the strength of predator‐driven ecosystem connectivity resulting from cross‐ecosystem foraging behaviours. Understanding the factors, which contribute to variation in cross‐ecosystem foraging behaviours, will improve our predictive understanding of the effects of top‐predators on community structure and ecosystem function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlligator mississippiensis 3aadults 3abody size 3acommunity structure 3adiet 3afood webs 3aforaging 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3amarine ecosystems 3aontogeny 3astatistical models 3astomach 3astreams 3asurveys1 aLayman, Craig A.1 aSilliman, Brian R.1 aBearhop, Stuart0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2015 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.35-48dBlackwell Scientific Publ.x0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.123063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245014800210300001800358520094600376592002801322650001601350650002101366650001701387650001001404650001101414650001501425650002801440650001701468650003701485700001601522700001701538700002401555700002101579700001501600700002401615700002101639773011801660856008201778990002301860852000901883655001201892IND60091116520221121204844.0141103e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009111652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.0172doi7 aPMC35301942pmcid7 a230411562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathew, Mohit P.10aExtracellular and intracellular esterase processing of SCFA–hexosamine analogs: Implications for metabolic glycoengineering and drug delivery  ap. 6929-6933.  aThis report provides a synopsis of the esterase processing of short chain fatty acid (SCFA)-derivatized hexosamine analogs used in metabolic glycoengineering by demonstrating that the extracellular hydrolysis of these compounds is comparatively slow (e.g., with a t₁/₂ of ∼4h to several days) in normal cell culture as well as in high serum concentrations intended to mimic in vivo conditions. Structure–activity relationship (SAR) analysis of common sugar analogs revealed that O-acetylated and N-azido ManNAc derivatives were more refractory against extracellular inactivation by FBS than their butanoylated counterparts consistent with in silico docking simulations of Ac₄ManNAc and Bu₄ManNAc to human carboxylesterase 1 (hCE1). By contrast, all analogs tested supported increased intracellular sialic acid production within 2h establishing that esterase processing once the analogs are taken up by cells is not rate limiting.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acarboxylesterase 3acell culture 3adrugs 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3ashort chain fatty acids 3asialic acids 3astructure-activity relationships1 aTan, Elaine1 aShah, Shivam1 aBhattacharya, Rahul1 aAdam Meledeo, M.1 aHuang, Jun1 aEspinoza, Freddy A.1 aYarema, Kevin J.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 22, no. 22 p.6929-6933dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.09.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245014600171520120900317592002801526650001201554650002501566650002201591650001701613650001901630653002401649653001201673653001601685653001301701653001701714700001801731773009001749856008501839852000901924655001201933IND60766050720221121043451.0220824e20220415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076605072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1233172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Min-Hsiung10aInvestigation of the potential of R717 blends as working fluids in the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) for ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC)  aAmmonia, R717, has been considered as a useful working fluid of the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) in the OTEC. The aim of this study is to investigate the potentials of R717 blends on thermodynamic and economic performances to surpass pure R717 used in an OTEC. The environmentally friendly refrigerants of R32 and R1234YF are considered and selected as the components of R717 blends. The effects of mass fraction ratios for R717 blends and four pinch points of conditions for the ORC are applied to evaluate the net power output and energy cost of the OTEC. The performances of OTEC system with R717/R32 and R717/R1234YF are evaluated and compared with pure R717. In thermodynamic improvement, the maximum net power outputs of R717/R32 and R717/R1234YF are higher than pure R717 by 18.9% and 12.23% with mass fraction ratios of 0.21/0.79 and 0.41/0.59, respectively. In addition, R717/R32 and R717/R1234YF blends with mass fraction ratios of 0.4/0.6 and 0.62/0.38 possess higher optimum economic performance than pure R717 by 3.45% and 2.1%, respectively. Furthermore, the optimum mass fraction ratios for economics are both higher than those for thermodynamics as R717/R32 and R717/R1234YF used in OTEC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aeconomic performance 3aenergy conversion 3aenergy costs 3athermal energy 0aMass fraction ratio 0aOptimum 0aPerformance 0aR717/R32 0aR717/R1234YF1 aYeh, Rong-Hua0 tEnergy.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 245 p.123317-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1233173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03494naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245012600164300001500290520187000305592002802175650002402203650001102227650001202238650001102250650002002261650001902281650002102300650002002321650001102341650001502352650001602367650002102383650002002404650001802424650001502442650002302457650002302480650002502503651001002528653003302538653001902571653001802590653001502608653001802623700001802641700001802659700001502677700001702692700001102709773011502720856008402835852000902919655001202928IND60585876420221119071335.0190403e20180131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058587642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2017.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Shuai10aPerformance of AquaCrop model for cotton growth simulation under film-mulched drip irrigation in southern Xinjiang, China  ap. 99-113.  aAquaCrop is a model of crop growth for predicting responses to various scenarios such as climates and irrigation strategies. Few studies, however, have assessed the applicability of AquaCrop for cotton under film-mulched drip irrigation in salt-affected soil. The objectives of this study were to test AquaCrop performance and to determine the appropriate irrigation amounts for cotton under several scenarios of initial soil-water content (SWC) and soil salinity for two typical soils in a saline region of southern Xinjiang of China with film-mulched drip irrigation. A four-year irrigation experiment was conducted in 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016 growing seasons for cotton, covering full (100%), over (115 and 145% of full) and deficit (55–90% of full) irrigation treatments. Based on the recommended parameters for cotton in AquaCrop manual, the model was calibrated using 2016 data sets and validated using the data sets from the other three years. Simulations of canopy cover, soil water storage of the root zone and aboveground biomass fitted well with the field observations with coefficient of determination r2>0.77 and the index of agreement d>0.92 and slightly underestimated yield. As for soil salinity, the model gave a reliable simulation for less than 80% of full irrigation treatments, while underestimated for over 80% of full irrigation treatments. Overall, AquaCrop can be used as a feasible tool to predict cotton growth response to water under film-mulched drip irrigation in this region. According to the principle of high yield and WUE, the simulation results showed that the appropriate irrigation amounts were recommended at 358–457mm for silty loam and 406–462mm for sandy loam in this region, which can provide a reference for irrigation optimization under film-mulched drip irrigation in southern Xinjiang and other similar regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3acanopy 3aclimate 3acotton 3adata collection 3agrowing season 3airrigation rates 3amicroirrigation 3amodels 3aprediction 3arhizosphere 3asandy loam soils 3asilt loam soils 3asoil salinity 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asoil water storage 3awater use efficiency 3aChina 0aFilm-mulched drip irrigation 0aAquaCrop model 0aCotton growth 0aSoil water 0aSoil salinity1 aWang, Quanjiu1 aZhang, Jihong1 aChen, Yong1 aShan, Yuyang1 aXu, Di0 tAgricultural water management.g2018 Jan. 31, v. 196 p.99-113dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2017.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245009500168300001600263520151300279592002801792650001301820650003801833650002001871650002101891650002001912650002301932650001701955650001601972700002401988700002302012700001802035700003902053700002302092773011802115856008202233852000902315655001202324IND60563069520170926000000.0170211e20170112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056306952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b083702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudzki, Arkadiusz10aPhase Behavior and Dynamics of Binary and Multicomponent Thioester Liquid Crystal Mixtures  ap. 273-286.  aThe results of studies conducted by means of complementary methods, differential scanning calorimetry, transmitted light intensity measurements, polarized optical microscopy, the electro-optical method, as well as dielectric relaxation spectroscopy of two new liquid crystal mixtures are presented. The first mixture is an equimolecular binary mixture consisting of two ferroelectric chiral liquid crystals from the homologous series, abbreviated as (S)-MHOBSn. The second mixture is a multicomponent mixture and consists of four mesogens from the homologous series of nOS5 as the base of the mixture, abbreviated as 610712 and chiral MHOBS8. The binary MHOBS4 + MHOBS7 mixture has an enantiotropic phase sequence, as follows: Cr, SmG*, SmI*, SmC*, N*. The second mixture has the same phase sequence but a much wider temperature range of ferroelectric SmC* phase. The switching time changes from 50 to 90 μs in the SmC* phase of the binary MHOBS4 + MHOBS7 mixture, whereas in 610712 + MHOBS8, the change is more than an order of magnitude higher, ranging from 500 to 3500 μs. Numerical analysis of the dielectric spectra results point toward the complex dynamics of the MHOBS4 + MHOBS7 and 610712 + MHOBS8 mixtures. The relaxation processes in the crystalline, SmC*, SmI*, and SmG* subphases have been observed and described. The relaxation processes have been detected up to 12 °C. There is a very low intensity Goldstone mode in SmC* and a low-frequency noncancellation mode in the SmI* and SmG* phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromium 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3alight intensity 3alight microscopy 3aliquid crystals 3aphysical chemistry 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature1 aZalewski, Sławomir1 aSuchodolska, Beata1 aCzerwiec, Jan1 aOssowska-Chruściel, Mirosława D.1 aChruściel, Janusz0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Jan. 12, v. 121, no. 1 p.273-286dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b083703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001300191245011800204300001800322520147100340592002801811650002101839650001201860650001201872650001601884650001601900650001701916650001101933650002201944650001401966650001501980650001901995650002002014650002002034650001602054650003602070650003202106650001302138700001402151700002302165773013202188856008402320990002302404852000902427655001202436IND60090094320221120233218.0141110e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009009432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.05.0102doi7 aPMC37156002pmcid7 a236847052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFei, Bei10aModulation by Syk of Bcl-2, calcium and the calpain–calpastatin proteolytic system in human breast cancer cells  ap. 2153-2164.  aSyk is a 72kDa non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is best characterized in hematopoietic cells. While Syk is pro-tumorigenic in some cancer cell types, it also has been reported as a negative regulator of metastatic cell growth in others. An examination of the RelA (p65) subunit of NF-κB expressed in MCF7 breast cancer cells indicated that either treatment with pervanadate or stable expression of Syk protected RelA from calpain-mediated proteolysis. Similar results were observed with the tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1B, another sensitive calpain substrate. The activity of calpain in MCF7 cell lysates was inhibited by both treatment with hydrogen peroxide and expression of Syk, the former due to oxidative inactivation of calpain and the latter to enhanced expression of calpastatin (CAST), the endogenous calpain inhibitor. The level of CAST was elevated in the cytosolic fraction of Syk-positive breast cancer cells resulting in more CAST present in complex with calpain in cell lysates. The high levels of CAST coincided with elevated basal levels of calcium–and of intracellular calpain activity–in Syk-expressing cells resulting from decreased levels of Bcl-2, an inhibitor of IP3-receptor-mediated calcium release. The inhibition of cellular calpain stimulated the Syk-mediated enhancement of NF-κB induced by TNF-α, enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation resulting from integrin crosslinking, and increased the localization of Syk to the plasma membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acalcium 3acalpain 3acalpastatin 3acell growth 3acrosslinking 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aintegrins 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphorylation 3aplasma membrane 3aproteolysis 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3atyrosine1 aYu, Shuai1 aGeahlen, Robert L.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

Wormhole-like mesostructured γ-alumina with nano-sized crystalline domains and pores in the range of 8nm was one-pot synthesized using polymeric template assisted sol-gel method via evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA). Nanoporous catalysts were prepared by employing the incipient wetness co-impregnation method followed by a calcination step, 15wt% MoO₃ and 3wt% NiO or CoO, were impregnated on the nanoporous support. Both catalysts favored the hydrodeoxygenation reaction pathway, and the liquid hydrocarbons consisted mostly of C15–C18 n-alkanes. The effects of LHSV and temperature on the liquid product composition were investigated in the range of, LHSV: 1 to 3h⁻¹, and temperature of 325 to 400°C while keeping other reaction conditions constant at a pressure of 450psi and H₂/oil of 600mLmL⁻¹. Slightly better catalytic activity was perceived for NiMo-S/γ-alumina at higher LHSV compared to CoMo-S γ-alumina catalyst. The liquid conversion on NiMo-S/γ-alumina is higher than that on CoMo-S/γ-alumina over the temperature range of 325 to 350°C. At 375°C, the conversion reached 100% over both catalysts. The production of green diesel range liquid products over NiMo-S/γ-alumina and CoMo-S/γ-alumina was found optimal at 325°C and 1h⁻¹ LHSV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3acanola oil 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adiesel fuel 3afuel production 3aliquids 3ananopores 3anickel oxide 3asol-gel processing 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerols 0aGreen diesel 0aTriglycerides hydrotreatment 0aMesostructured γ-alumina 0aNiMo/γ-alumina 0aCoMo/γ-alumina1 aKaliaguine, Serge0 tFuel processing technology.g2018 Mar., v. 171 p.20-30dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04698naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011900167520307500286592002803361650002303389650000803412650002103420650002003441650001203461650001803473650001403491650001003505650004503515650001603560650001603576650001303592650003303605650001603638650001403654650001203668650001803680650001403698650002203712651001003734653002003744653002103764700001903785700005503804700002303859700001503882700001703897700001803914773013103932856008404063852000904147655001204156IND60748798020221122044618.0210910e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074879802DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-11-20-2445-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamesh, G. V.10aFirst Confirmed Report of Leaf Blight on Browntop Millet Caused by Bipolaris setariae in Southern Peninsular India  aBrowntop millet (Brachiaria ramosa [L.] Stapf), which is native to India, was recently introduced as one of the small millet crops. In September 2018, leaf blight symptoms were observed on cultivar Dundu Korale on the adaxial side of the leaves in a field at Bangalore, India (13.0784°N, 77.5793°E). Initial lesions were brown with a small yellow halo that ranged from 1 to 5 mm and eventually enlarged, exhibiting light brown centers. Afterward, spots coalesced and leaves were blighted. About 75% of the plants were infected in the field of 0.5 ha. Samples of symptomatic and asymptomatic leaves were collected, and nine isolates were recovered on PDA. Single conidial isolation was performed. Colonies were gray to olive green with regular margins in 7-day-old cultures at 27 ± 1°C and 16-h light and 8-h dark cycles. Conidiophores were single or in clusters from 4.92 to 6.04 μm wide. Conidia were fusoid, cylindrical to slightly curved ranging from 38.50 to 130 μm in length and from 8.30 to 17 μm in width, with four to 10 distosepta (n = 100). Hilum was flat to inconspicuous or slightly protruded. Based on the morphology, the pathogen was identified as a Bipolaris species according to the genus standard descriptions of Helminthosporium (Alcorn 1988). Misra and Prakash (1972) reported that Helminthosporium setariae caused leaf spot on browntop millet in India, but they did not provide any morphological or molecular evidence of identification. For molecular identification, the genomic DNA of isolate BTMH3 was extracted, and the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GPD) were amplified using the pairs of primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990) and GPD1/GPD2 (Berbee et al. 1999), respectively. BLAST analysis of ITS (MT750301; 562 matching base pairs) and GPD (MT896702; 562 matching base pairs) sequences showed 99.82% identity with sequences of Bipolaris setariae (Sawada) Shoemaker type strain CBS 141.31 (ITS, EF452444; GPD, EF513206). Pathogenicity was proved by spraying 10 healthy 20-day-old browntop millet plants with conidial suspension (10⁶ conidia/ml). Control plants were sprayed with distilled water. Plants were covered with transparent polythene bags in a greenhouse at 28 ± 2°C and high relative humidity of 90%. Symptoms were observed at 5 days postinoculation. The pathogen was reisolated from infected areas using the same protocol as before, whereas the control plants were symptomless. The reisolated pathogen was confirmed as B. setariae based on morphological characters and PCR assay. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of leaf blight on browntop millet caused by B. setariae in the southern peninsular region of India. A disease specimen was deposited in the Herbarium Cryptogamae Indiae Orientalis, New Delhi, India, with accession number 52209.

Prealbumin, a plasma protein, is commonly used in clinical practice to assess nutritional status. Prealbumin is also a powerful predictor of mortality risk in dialysis patients. Variation in prealbumin concentration provides valuable information regarding malnutrition and diagnostic applications. Fluorescent microspheres, which combine with anti-human prealbumin monoclonal antibodies, were introduced into an immunochromatographic assay for quantitative detection of human prealbumin in serum. A sandwich immunoassay was developed and the fluorescence intensity of the test line in the test strip was proportional to the prealbumin content in the specimens. The fluorescence intensities of the test and control lines were recorded using a commercial fluorescence strip reader. The results showed that the limit of detection of prealbumin reached 1.0 ng mL⁻¹ within 20 min with a good linear range of 8.0 ng mL⁻¹ to 110.0 ng mL⁻¹. Serum specimens can be diluted 5000 times to avoid matrix interference. The average intra- and inter-assay recoveries ranged from 95.7% to 102.8% and 95.3% to 105.6% respectively, with corresponding variation coefficients of 3.3% to 4.3% and 4.1% to 9.9%. The test strip showed no cross-reaction with hemoglobin and albumin. A significantly good agreement was observed between the test strip and immunoturbidimetric assay. The developed novel assay in this study is a sensitive, specific, reproducible, time-saving, inexpensive, and quantitative method for detection of human prealbumin in serum.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3adialysis 3afluorescence 3ahemoglobin 3ahumans 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3aimmunoassays 3amicroparticles 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amortality 3anutritional status 3apatients 3aprealbumin 3aprotein energy malnutrition 3aquantitative analysis 3arisk1 aLi, Chaohui1 aWang, Wei1 aDong, Tingting1 aXiong, Yonghua1 aShen, Jun1 aLai, Weihua0 tAnalytical methods.g2015 Oct. 8, v. 7, no. 20 p.8683-8688dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay01659b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013500170300001600305520192300321592002802244650002702272650002502299650002002324650002102344650000902365650001102374650001902385650000902404650001402413650002502427650001302452650001002465650001202475650001102487650001102498650001102509651001402520651001502534651001802549651001702567651001302584651001202597700002202609700002102631773014602652856008402798852000902882655001202891IND60123484620221118071352.0150325e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012348462DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2012.7479912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerbst, Seth J.10aLake Whitefish Diet, Condition, and Energy Density in Lake Champlain and the Lower Four Great Lakes following Dreissenid Invasions  ap. 388-398.  aLake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis support some of the most valuable commercial freshwater fisheries in North America. Recent growth and condition decreases in Lake Whitefish populations in the Great Lakes have been attributed to the invasion of the dreissenid mussels, zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha and quagga mussels D. bugensis , and the subsequent collapse of the amphipod, Diporeia , a once-abundant high energy prey source. Since 1993, Lake Champlain has also experienced the invasion and proliferation of zebra mussels, but in contrast to the Great Lakes, Diporeia were not historically abundant. We compared the diet, condition, and energy density of Lake Whitefish from Lake Champlain after the dreissenid mussel invasion to values for those of Lake Whitefish from Lakes Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario. Lake Whitefish were collected using gill nets and bottom trawls, and their diets were quantified seasonally. Condition was estimated using Fulton's condition factor (K) and by determining energy density. In contrast to Lake Whitefish from some of the Great Lakes, those from Lake Champlain Lake Whitefish did not show a dietary shift towards dreissenid mussels, but instead fed primarily on fish eggs in spring, Mysis diluviana in summer, and gastropods and sphaeriids in fall and winter. Along with these dietary differences, the condition and energy density of Lake Whitefish from Lake Champlain were high compared with those of Lake Whitefish from Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Ontario after the dreissenid invasion, and were similar to Lake Whitefish from Lake Erie; fish from Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Ontario consumed dreissenids, whereas fish from Lake Erie did not. Our comparisons of Lake Whitefish populations in Lake Champlain to those in the Great Lakes indicate that diet and condition of Lake Champlain Lake Whitefish were not negatively affected by the dreissenid mussel invasion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoregonus clupeaformis 3aDreissena polymorpha 3aMysis diluviana 3acondition factor 3adiet 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3afish 3afish eggs 3afreshwater fisheries 3agillnets 3alakes 3amussels 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3aLake Erie 3aLake Huron 3aLake Michigan 3aLake Ontario 3aMichigan 3aOntario1 aMarsden, J.

We find that physical disruptions of the pipeline network account for no more than 5% of the MWh lost to fuel shortages over the six years we examined. Gas shortages at generators have caused correlated failures of power plants with both firm and non-firm fuel arrangements. Unsurprisingly, plants using the spot market or interruptible pipeline contracts for their fuel were somewhat more likely to experience fuel shortages than those with firm contracts. We identify regions of the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic where power plants with non-firm fuel arrangements may have avoided fuel shortage outages if they had obtained firm pipeline contracts. The volume of gas needed by power plants to fuel the lost MWh in those regions was only a small fraction of the total volume delivered to potentially non-essential commercial and industrial pipeline customers in those regions and modest prices there at the times when power plants failed indicate gas was available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy policy 3amarkets 3anatural gas 3apower plants 0aCorrelated failures 0aFuel assurance 0aFuel security 0aGenerating availability data system 0aPipeline failures 0aPipeline curtailment1 aApt, Jay1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6195-03551 aMoura, John0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Dec., v. 147 p.111805-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1118053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014200166300001200308520113400320592002801454650001201482650001201494650001501506650001201521650000901533650003101542650002601573650001601599653002301615653002901638653002301667653001301690653001401703700001701717700002101734700001701755700001801772773010401790856008501894852000901979655001201988IND60585876920221119071304.0201118e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058587692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Zhongfa10aAggravated fine particulate matter emissions from heating-upgraded biomass and biochar combustion: The effect of pretreatment temperature  ap. 1-9.  aHeat pretreatment is a promising method for biomass upgrading. However, PM formation from the combustion of such pretreated biomass has not been fully evaluated. In this work, the effect of pretreatment temperature on PM emission of the upgraded biomass and biochar combustion was studied in an entrained flow reactor. The physical and chemical properties of upgraded biomass, biochar and PMs at varied pretreatment temperatures were obtained to illustrate the PM formation mechanism. Results show that pretreatment temperature significantly affects the concentration and particle size distribution of PM emissions, through changing the char yield and K/Cl contents in char. With increase in pretreatment temperature, the PM₁.₀ emission of upgraded biomass and biochar combustion first increases, reaches maximum at 500°C, and then decreases. A linear relationship between the PM₁.₀ emission and Cl content in upgraded biomass and biochar was found. This result indicates that the combustion of upgraded biomass and biochar produced at moderate temperatures of 250–500°C result in aggravated fouling and PM emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acombustion 3afouling 3aheat 3aparticle size distribution 3aparticulate emissions 3atemperature 0aBiomass combustion 0aPretreatment temperature 0aParticulate matter 0aChlorine 0aPotassium1 aWang, Xuebin1 aAdeosun, Adewale1 aRuan, Renhui1 aTan, Houzhang0 tFuel processing technology.g2018 Mar., v. 171 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010300164300001800267520127200285592002801557650001801585650002101603650002301624650001401647650001601661650001301677650002401690650002101714650002601735650002901761700001501790700001801805700001401823700001501837700001501852700001801867700001401885773013201899856008402031990002302115852000902138655001202147IND60090094620221120233219.0141110e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009009462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbamcr.2013.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Zhu10aDownregulation of Ezh2 methyltransferase by FOXP3: New insight of FOXP3 into chromatin remodeling?  ap. 2190-2200.  aTranscription factor FOXP3 (forkhead box P3) is found initially as a key regulator in regulatory T cells. Recently its expression has been demonstrated in some non-lymphoid normal and cancerous cells. Now FOXP3 has been proven to regulate cancer-related genes, especially suppressor genes in breast cancer. But the mechanisms by which FOXP3 regulates suppressor genes are not fully determined. In this study, we found the inverse correlation between FOXP3 and Ezh2, an enzyme for histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and a central epigenetic regulator in cancer. The overexpression of FOXP3 weakened Ezh2's enhancement on the mammosphere formation, cell proliferation, directional migration, and colony forming ability of T47D cells. We demonstrated that FOXP3 could downregulate Ezh2 protein level and this depended on not only the FOXP3 expression amount, but also the nuclear localization of FOXP3. More importantly, we demonstrated FOXP3 accelerated Ezh2 protein degradation through the polyubiquitination–proteasome pathway by enhancing the transcription of E3 ligase Praja1 directly. These results provided a new mechanism for FOXP3 in histone modifications as an Ezh2 suppressor and supported new evidence for FOXP3 as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3abreast neoplasms 3acell proliferation 3achromatin 3aepigenetics 3ahistones 3aprotein degradation 3asuppressor genes 3atranscription factors 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aChen, Ling1 aYang, Xiaojun1 aZhao, Yun1 aPier, Eric1 aZhang, Xia1 aYang, Xichuan1 aXiong, Ya0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

The massive occurrence of hibernating bats which is observed in few caves in the Carpathian Mountains encourages the idea that the genetic diversity at these sites will be greater comparing to known situation in surrounding region. This study aimed to determine the genetic diversity of individuals that aggregate in two such caves in Slovakia and Romania with the help of a common and available genetic marker. Using an mtDNA cytochrome b, 571 bp long fragment, very low haplotype diversity was found within both mass hibernacula of P. pipistrellus (15 haplotypes only, from which one significantly predominated with > 80% in both caves). The initial screening did not suggest that hibernating bats migrated to mass hibernacula from remote areas behind central European region. However, reliable study of the species’ migratory behaviour is required to understand more about the phenomenon of the mass hibernacula of these bats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPipistrellus pipistrellus 3acaves 3acytochrome b 3agene flow 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahibernation 3amigratory behavior 3amitochondrial DNA 3ascreening 3aswarming 3aCarpathian region 3aCentral European region 3aRomania 3aSlovakia 0aChiroptera 0aphylogeography 0amitochondrial DNA 0awinter roosts 0amigration 0aEurope1 aŠemeláková, Martina1 aPaučulová, Lenka1 aUhrin, Marcel1 aKaňuch, Peter0 tBiológia.g2017 May 24, v. 72, no. 5 p.548-553dDe GruyterwJournal:jnl34824x1336-95637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2017-00613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05661naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245009300165520384800258592002804106596005704134650000804191650003204199650002304231650001804254650002604272650001104298650002204309650001204331650001804343650001404361650001004375650001804385650002204403650002304425650001204448650001004460650001104470650001104481650001304492650002504505650001804530650003104548650001404579650001304593650000904606651001004615651001004625651001004635651001404645653002204659653002204681700001604703700001104719700001604730700005404746773013104800856008304931852000905014655001205023IND60748798220221122044526.0210827e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074879822DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-11-20-2489-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Y. H.10aFirst Report of Fusarium Wilt of Coleus forskohlii Caused by Fusarium oxysporum in China  aColeus forskohlii (Wild) Briq. is an aromatic plant in the Lamiaceae family cultivated primarily in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and China (Yunnan Province). This herb is considered to have medicinal properties, and the whole plant can be used to treat asthma, cancer, and other diseases with remarkable efficacy. Due to the high medicinal and economic value of C. forskohlii, it has been introduced to Tongcheng (N29°18′12.24″, E113°53′59.36″), Hubei Province, for cultivation. However, severe Fusarium wilt disease of C. forskohlii has been epidemic in Tongcheng since 2018 with a disease incidence of 5 to 30% in surveyed fields. This disease is characterized typically by root rot, vascular discoloration, and leaf wilting of C. forskohlii, resulting in progressive plant death. Ten diseased plants were collected from the fields, and the roots and stems were rinsed in 70% ethanol for 5 min. Samples at the junction of diseased and healthy tissues (0.5 × 0.5 cm) were cut and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for fungal isolation in a dark chamber at 28°C. Eventually, 10 pure isolates were obtained from hyphal-tip followed by single-spore purification on PDA. Seven of the purified isolates showed white aerial mycelium initially and secreted orange-brown pigment 8 days after incubation. Macroconidia were falciform, hyaline, three to five septate, and 2.02 to 4.17 µm (mean 2.98 µm) × 10.05 to 21.90 µm (mean 12.04 µm) in size (n = 30). These morphological characteristics resembled Fusarium oxysporum (Leslie and Summerell 2006), and we selected one of them for molecular identification. Genome DNA was extracted from isolate (RS-4) using the CTAB method (Mahadevakumar et al. 2018). The translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1α) DNA sequence was amplified using primers EF1/EF2 (Geiser et al. 2004), and the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2) DNA sequence was amplified using primers fRPB2-5F/fRPB2-7cR (Liu et al. 1999). The obtained EF-1α sequence of RS-4 (MW219142) showed 100% identity with that of F. oxysporum (FD_01376) (FUSARIUM-ID database). RPB2 sequences of RS-4 (MW219143) showed 100% identity with F. oxysporum (FD_01679) (FUSARIUM-ID database). Moreover, a phylogenetic tree of the EF-1α gene sequence of RS-4 was constructed based on the neighbor-joining method in MEGA7 software (Tamura et al. 2013) and revealed that strain RS-4 was closest to F. oxysporum. To test the pathogenicity of RS-4, six healthy leaves of C. forskohlii were collected and inoculated either with the colonized PDA discs (diameter, 5 mm) of RS-4 or control PDA discs, in a moist chamber at 25 ± 2°C. Five days later, brown-black lesions were observed on all inoculated leaves. However, the noninoculated leaves remained asymptomatic. For in vivo pathogenicity testing, 20-day-old C. forskohlii plants (n = 3) were inoculated with 10⁶ spores/ml of the RS-4 at a position approximately 1 cm above the soil. Three seedlings treated with sterile water were used as controls. These inoculated and control seedlings were incubated in a moist chamber (25 ± 2°C, 85% RH). Three days later, typical Fusarium rot symptoms were observed on all inoculated seedlings with rotten stems and withering leaves. Fungal pathogens were reisolated from the inoculated sites of in vitro and in vivo inoculations by repeating the above isolating operation and were reconfirmed through morphological features. This is the first report of F. oxysporum causing root rot on C. forskohlii in China. F. oxysporum is one of the most economically important fungal pathogens causing vascular wilt on a wide range of plants worldwide (Dean et al. 2012). The identification of F. oxysporum as the causal agent of the observed Fusarium wilt on C. forskohlii is critical to the prevention and control of this disease in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  a2060302cKey project at the central government level 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium wilt 3aPlectranthus barbatus 3aasthma 3acomputer software 3aconidia 3aculture media 3adatabases 3adeath 3adiscoloration 3adisease incidence 3aeconomic valuation 3aethanol 3afungi 3agenome 3aleaves 3amycelium 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogenicity 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphylogeny 3aroot rot 3asoil 3aChina 3aIndia 3aNepal 3aSri Lanka 0aFusarium root rot 0aColeus forskohlii1 aChen, Q.

However, some bacteria have established a stable symbiotic relationship with amebae. Recent reports indicate an association of amebae with intracellular bacterial pathogens.

Moench] as a bioenergy crop is an adequate seed supply, which will require development of hybrid varieties using dwarf seed-parent lines. A set of 6 public sweet sorghum A-lines (Dwarf Kansas Sourless, KS9, N36, N38, N39, and N4692) were crossed with a set of 6 public sweet sorghum cultivars (Brawley, Kansas Collier, Dale, Sugar Drip, Waconia, and Wray). Grain, fiber, and sugar yields were determined, and conversion formulas were applied to estimate ethanol yields. Hybrids were grown in fields in at Ithaca, NE in 1983-1984 fertilized with 112 kg ha-1 N. In terms of yield components and overall ethanol yields, one A-line, N38, was inferior. Average total ethanol yields from hybrids made on the other A-lines were not significantly different, suggesting that any of those five A-lines could be useful seed-parents. With the exception of grain yield, cultivars used as pollen parents were among the highest performing entries for all traits. For all traits directly contributing to total ethanol yield (grain yield, juice yield, % soluble solids, sugar yield, fiber yield), hybrids were also among the highest performing entries. Results of this study demonstrate that hybrid sweet sorghum with performance criteria equivalent to existing sweet sorghum cultivars can be produced on the sweet sorghum seed-parent lines A-Dwarf Kansas Sourless, A-KS9, A-N36, A-N39 and A-N4692. Identification of specific seed-parent x pollen parent lines with characteristics best suited for particular growing regions and end-user needs will be critical for commercial hybrid development. 3atotal soluble solids 3aenergy crops 3acrossing 3apollen 3ahybrids 3ajuices 3asugars 3aparents 3agenetic lines 3agrain yield 3ayield components 3adwarf cultivars 3aseeds 3aplant fibers 3aethanol production 3agrains 3acommercialization 3aethanol 3aSorghum bicolor 3asweet sorghum 3aNebraska 0asoluble solids1 aSattler, Scott E.1 aAnderson, William F.0 tBioenergy research.g2013, v. 6 p.91-102dSpringerx1939-12427nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/563063Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-012-9231-1  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Log%20%23278035%20Sattler.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245013500162300001600297520160500313592002801918650002501946650001401971650001201985650001401997650001602011650001002027650001002037650001002047650001702057650001102074650002002085650001202105650001302117650001602130650005202146650001002198650001102208650001702219653002502236653003002261653002502291653002302316653001802339653001102357700001902368700001802387700001802405700001702423773009902440856008102539852000902620655001202629IND60573129620180620000000.0180620e20170524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057312962DNAL7 a10.1515/biolog-2017-00622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNahar, Noor10aFunctional studies of AtACR2 gene putatively involved in accumulation, reduction and/or sequestration of arsenic species in plants  ap. 520-526.  aFood-based exposure to arsenic is a human carcinogen and can severely impact human health resulting in many cancerous diseases and various neurological and vascular disorders. This project is a part of our attempts to develop new varieties of crops for avoiding arsenic contaminated foods. For this purpose, we have previously identified four key genes, and molecular functions of two of these, AtACR2 and AtPCSl, have been studied based on both in silico and in vivo experiments. In the present study, a T-DNA tagged mutant, (SALK_143282C with mutation in AtACR2 gene) of Arabidopsis thaliana was studied for further verification of the function of AtACR2 gene. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that this mutant exhibits a significantly reduced expression of the AtACR2 gene. When exposed to 100 μM of arsenate (AsV) for three weeks, the mutant plants accumulated arsenic approximately three times higher (778 μg/g d. wt.) than that observed in the control plants (235 μg/g d. wt.). In contrast, when the plants were exposed to 100 μM of arsenite (AsIII), no significant difference in arsenic accumulation was observed between the control and the mutant plants (535 μg/g d. wt. and 498 μg/g d. wt., respectively). Also, when arsenate and arsenite was measured separately either in shoots or roots, significant differences in accumulation of these substances were observed between the mutant and the control plants. These results suggest that AtACR2 gene is involved not only in accumulation of arsenic in plants, but also in conversion of arsenate to arsenite inside the plant cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3acarcinogens 3acrops 3afoods 3agenes 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ain vivo studies 3amutants 3amutation 3anew variety 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3ashoots 3atransfer DNA 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aarsenate reductase 2 gene 0aarsenic accumulation 0aarsenic speciation 0aIC-ICP-DRC-MS 0aRT-PCR1 aRahman, Aminur1 aGhosh, Sibdas1 aNawani, Neelu1 aMandal, Abul0 tBiológia.g2017 May 24, v. 72, no. 5 p.520-526dDe GruyterwJournal:jnl34824x1336-95637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2017-00623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01884naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245007700176300001600253520094900269592002801218653001801246653002001264653001501284653004301299653001401342653001601356773012101372856009201493852000901585655001201594IND60127010220221116151433.0151108e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012701022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1550-7408.2004.tb00277.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeon, Kwang W.,10aGenetic and Physiological Interactions in the Amoeba-Bacteria Symbiosis1  ap. 502-508.  aAmoebae of the xD strain of Amoeba proteus that arose from the D strain by spontaneous infection of Legionella-like X-bacteria are now dependent on their symbionts for survival. Each xD amoeba contains about 42,000 symbionts within symbiosomes, and established xD amoebae die if their symbionts are removed. Thus, harmful infective bacteria changed into necessary cell components. As a result of harboring X-bacteria. xD amoebae exhibit various physiological and genetic characteristics that are different from those of symbiont-free D amoebae. One of the recent findings is that bacterial symbionts control the expression of a host's house-keeping gene. Thus, the expression of the normal amoeba sams gene (sams1) encoding one form of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase is switched to that of sams2 by endosymbiotic X-bacteria. Possible mechanisms for the switching of sams genes brought about by endosymbionts and its significance are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEndosymbiosis 0agene expression 0aLegionella 0aS-adenosylmethionine synthetase (SAMS) 0asymbiosis 0asymbiosomes0 tjournal of eukaryotic microbiology.g2004 Sept., v. 51, no. 5 p.502-508dSociety of Protozoologistsx1066-52347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1550-7408.2004.tb00277.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009900164300001600263520155500279592002801834650001601862650001301878650002401891650001101915650001601926650001601942650001401958650001001972650001601982651001001998651002802008653001902036653001302055653001702068653000902085653001002094653001602104653004102120653003302161700002402194700003202218700001902250773011102269856008102380852000902461655001202470IND60604447820221118031956.0180717e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060444782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2015.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuval, Colin10aDid Romanization impact Gallic pig morphology? New insights from molar geometric morphometrics  ap. 345-354.  aIn Western Europe, at the turn of our era, the emergence of the Roman economic and agropastoral model is considered as the trigger for morphological changes experienced by livestock. This assumption is now undermined, reviving questions of the origin and mechanism of these changes as well as the influence of Gaul's agricultural particularities in the process. To investigate this question we used a geometric morphometric approach to study the phenotypic relationships of almost 600 dental remains of pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) from 11 Gallic and Italian sites, and pinpoint evidence of Roman or indigenous signature on the livestock. The comparison of these different samples allowed us to demonstrate that the link between the Roman and Gallic pigs is weak, and, more importantly, that each of the two territories seem to follow its own livestock management model. Furthermore, each region or settlement within Gaul adopted their own particular pastoral or supplying strategies; apart from two urban sites of central Gaul which showed clear phenotypic relationships with southern populations. These results suggest that the pigs' morphology depended mainly on agricultural and economic characteristics of the different territories, within Gaul and Italy, except perhaps on some urban sites with different supply strategies. It seems, therefore, that the changing economic environment impacted both provinces independently, or at least differently, since it cannot be excluded that there may have been some commercial relationships between them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3ageometry 3alivestock husbandry 3amodels 3amorphometry 3apastoralism 3aphenotype 3aswine 3aurban areas 3aItaly 3aWestern European region 0aArchaeozoology 0aIron Age 0aRoman period 0aGaul 0aItaly 0aMolar shape 0aMorphological and phenotypic changes 0aLocal and regional diversity1 aLepetz, Sébastien,1 aHorard-Herbin, Marie-Pierre1 aCucchi, Thomas0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2015 May, v. 57 p.345-354dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2015.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245015500183300001400338500001500352520174500367592002802112650001102140650001302151650001302164650001502177650001402192650001602206650001802222650001402240650001402254650001202268650001302280650001302293650001002306650001802316650001602334650007502350650001402425653001002439653001602449700001702465773011102482856004802593852000902641655001202650IND4450715520221122164606.0121003e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445071552DNAL7 a213369302pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-011-3143-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoigt, Kerstin10aRecent developments in the taxonomic affiliation and phylogenetic positioning of fungi: impact in applied microbiology and environmental biotechnology  ap. 41-57.  a2019-12-06  aThe goal of modern taxonomy is to understand the relationships of living organisms in terms of evolutionary descent. Thereby, the relationships between living organisms are understood in terms of nested clades—every time a speciation event takes place, two new clades are produced. Life comprises three domains of living organisms, these are the Bacteria, the Archaea and the Eukaryota. Within the eukaryotic domain, the fungi form a monophyletic group of the eukaryotic crown group and are thus high up in the evolutionary hierarchy of life. Fungus-like organisms possess certain morphological features of fungi, such as the hyphal organization of the Oomycota or the spores and reproductive structures inside a fructification of plasmodiophorids (Plasmodiophoromycota) and slime moulds (Mycetozoa). The first group are algae which secondarily lost their plastids during evolution and contain cellulose in their cell walls. Both osmotrophic phyla, the Oomycota and the Plasmidiophoromycota belong to the Chromista and Rhizaria, respectively, whereas the last group, the cellular and plasmodial slime moulds (Mycetozoa) are phagotrophic amoeboid protists belonging to the Amoebozoa. These fungus-like organisms are not considered further in this review. The Fungi sensu stricto comprise a heterogenous, often inconspicuous group of microorganisms which (1) are primarily heterotrophic with an (2) osmotrophic style of nutrition containing (3) chitin and its derivatives in the cell wall. This review discusses species concepts and current strategies in fungal taxonomy, phylogenetic affiliations of miscellaneous fungus-like groups like the microsporidia, perspectives of fungal nomenclature, and their impact on natural product research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aspores 3ataxonomy 3aAmoebida 3acell walls 3aphylogeny 3aMyxogastrea 3abiotechnology 3acellulose 3anutrition 3aArchaea 3aplastids 3abacteria 3afungi 2aBiotechnology 2aEnvironment 2aFungixclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 0aAlgae 0aMyxomycetes1 aKirk, P.

EPR, resonance Raman, and MCD spectroscopies have been used to determine the redox states of these sites under different reductant conditions, showing that the CuZ* site accesses the 1-hole and fully reduced redox states, while the CuZ site accesses the 2-hole and 1-hole redox states. Single-turnover reactions of N₂OR for CuZ and CuZ* poised in these redox states and steady-state turnover assays with different proportions of CuZ and CuZ* show that only fully reduced CuZ* is catalytically competent in rapid turnover with N₂O.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactive sites 3acopper 3anitrous oxide 3anitrous-oxide reductase 3areducing agents 3asulfur1 aDell’Acqua, Simone1 aRamos, Susana1 aPauleta, Sofia R.,1 aMoura, Isabel1 aSolomon, Edward I.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 136, no. 2 p.614-617dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja411500p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245007300159300002000232520140200252592002801654650002401682650001301706650000901719650001201728650001101740650001101751653002601762653001401788653001901802653001801821653002401839700001701863700001801880700001701898700002201915700002101937700001901958700002201977773012701999856008002126852000902206655001202215IND60579973920221118010016.0170907e20170906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057997392DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b081342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirai, Kei10aMelting of Oxygen Vacancy Order at Oxide–Heterostructure Interface  ap. 30143-30148.  aModifications in oxygen coordination environments in heterostructures consisting of dissimilar oxides often emerge and lead to unusual properties of the constituent materials. Although lots of attention has been paid to slight modifications in the rigid oxygen octahedra of perovskite-based heterointerfaces, revealing the modification behaviors of the oxygen coordination environments in the heterostructures containing oxides with oxygen vacancies have been challenging. Here, we show that a significant modification in the oxygen coordination environmentsmelting of oxygen vacancy orderis induced at the heterointerface between SrFeO₂.₅ (SFO) and DyScO₃ (DSO). When an oxygen-deficient perovskite (brownmillerite structure) SrFeO₂.₅ film grows epitaxially on a perovskite DyScO₃ substrate, both FeO₆ octahedra and FeO₄ tetrahedra in the (101)-oriented SrFeO₂.₅ thin film connect to ScO₆ octahedra in DyScO₃. As a consequence of accommodating a structural mismatch, the alternately ordered arrangement of oxygen vacancies is significantly disturbed and reconstructed in the 2 nm thick heterointerface region. The stabilized heterointerface structure consists of Fe³⁺ octahedra with an oxygen vacancy disorder. The melting of the oxygen vacancy order, which in bulk SrFeO₂.₅ occurs at 1103 K, is induced at the present heterointerface at ambient temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3ageometry 3airon 3amelting 3aoxides 3aoxygen 0aoxide heterostructure 0ainterface 0aoxygen vacancy 0avacancy order 0aepitaxial thin film1 aAso, Ryotaro1 aOzaki, Yusuke1 aKan, Daisuke1 aHaruta, Mitsutaka1 aIchikawa, Noriya1 aKurata, Hiroki1 aShimakawa, Yuichi0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Sept. 06, v. 9, no. 35 p.30143-30148dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b081343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100006400181245015600245300001600401500002000417506007600437520149000513592002802003506003702031650001702068650001502085650002302100650001402123650001302137650002002150650002602170650001702196700002302213700005502236700002402291700002302315700002202338700002602360773011002386856007402496852000902570655001202579IND60598233620221207134547.0180628e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059823362DNAL7 a10.1111/biom.127922doi7 aPMC58955422pmcid7 a290236262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoslovsky, Matthew D.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5144-204210aBayesian variable selection for multistate Markov models with interval‐censored data in an ecological momentary assessment study of smoking cessation  ap. 636-644.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe application of sophisticated analytical methods to intensive longitudinal data, collected with ecological momentary assessments (EMA), has helped researchers better understand smoking behaviors after a quit attempt. Unfortunately, the wealth of information captured with EMAs is typically underutilized in practice. Thus, novel methods are needed to extract this information in exploratory research studies. One of the main objectives of intensive longitudinal data analysis is identifying relations between risk factors and outcomes of interest. Our goal is to develop and apply expectation maximization variable selection for Bayesian multistate Markov models with interval‐censored data to generate new insights into the relation between potential risk factors and transitions between smoking states. Through simulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in identifying associated risk factors and its ability to outperform the LASSO in a special case. Additionally, we use the expectation conditional‐maximization algorithm to simplify estimation, a deterministic annealing variant to reduce the algorithm's dependence on starting values, and Louis's method to estimate unknown parameter uncertainty. We then apply our method to intensive longitudinal data collected with EMA to identify risk factors associated with transitions between smoking states after a quit attempt in a cohort of socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers who were interested in quitting.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMarkov chain 3aalgorithms 3aanalytical methods 3aannealing 3abiometry 3adata collection 3aparameter uncertainty 3arisk factors1 aSwartz, Michael D.1 aChan, Wenyaw1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3329-52821 aLeon‐Novelo, Luis1 aWilkinson, Anna V.1 aKendzor, Darla E.1 aBusinelle, Michael S.0 tBiometrics.g2018 June, v. 74, no. 2 p.636-644dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16956x0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/biom.127923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01656naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011700159300001600276520056100292592002800853650001300881650001300894650001800907650001200925650002000937700002300957700002100980700002101001700002301022700002501045700002301070773012901093856007501222852000901297655001201306IND60539146820170620000000.0160815e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053914682DNAL7 a10.1021/ja411522f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAydillo, Carlos10aS-Michael Additions to Chiral Dehydroalanines as an Entry to Glycosylated Cysteines and a Sulfa-Tn Antigen Mimic  ap. 789-800.  aStereoselective sulfa-Michael addition of appropriately protected thiocarbohydrates to chiral dehydroalanines has been developed as a key step in the synthesis of biologically important cysteine derivatives, such as S-(β-d-glucopyranosyl)-d-cysteine, which has not been synthesized to date, and S-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranosyl)-l-cysteine, which could be considered as a mimic of Tn antigen.

Influenza A virus, belonging to a family of orthomyxoviruses, is a negative-strand RNA virus which encodes 11 viral proteins. A numbers of intracellular signaling pathways in the host cells interact with influenza the viral proteins, which affect various stages of viral infection and replication.In this study, we investigated how inhibition of Akt kinase activity impacts on influenza virus infection by using “Akt-in”, a peptide Akt inhibitor. In PR8 influenza-infected A549 cells, Akt interacted with the NS1 (Non structural protein 1), and hence increased phosphorylation of Akt kinase activity and NS1. Treatment of cells with either “TCL1- or TCL1b-based Akt-in” efficiently suppressed Akt kinase activity while decreasing the levels of phosphorylated NS1; this, in turn, inhibited viral replication in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect on viral replication appears to not be due to inhibition of the production of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-8, in the host cells. Inhibition of Akt kinase activity in the host cells inhibited the efficiency of viral entry, which is associated with decreased levels of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3, a substrate of Akt. Thus inhibition of Akt kinase activity in host cells may have therapeutic advantages for influenza virus infection by inhibiting viral entry and replication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3ainfluenza 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3apandemic 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3astructural proteins 3atau-protein kinase 3aviral proteins 3avirus replication 0aInfluenza virus 0aPI3K–Akt signaling 0aAkt inhibitor1 aSuizu, Futoshi1 aMatsuda-Lennikov, Mami1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9845-22051 aEdamura, Tatsuma1 aBala, Jyoti1 aNoguchi, Masayuki0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 July 18, v. 450 p.891-898dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.06.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245008500206300002000291506007600311520090900387592002801296506003701324650002101361650002501382650001601407650001501423650001501438650001701453650001201470650001901482650001701501650001401518650001701532650001301549700002801562700002001590700001601610700001601626700002201642700001801664700002201682773017601704856007901880852000901959655001201968IND60173565820221207053848.0150603e20121218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017356582DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12092531092doi7 aPMC35290702pmcid7 a231849902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomery, Kathryn10aAntibody WN1 222-5 mimics Toll-like receptor 4 binding in the recognition of LPS  ap. 20877-20882.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEscherichia coli infections, a leading cause of septic shock, remain a major threat to human health because of the fatal action to endotoxin (LPS). Therapeutic attempts to neutralize endotoxin currently focus on inhibiting the interaction of the toxic component lipid A with myeloid differentiating factor 2, which forms a trimeric complex together with Toll-like receptor 4 to induce immune cell activation. The 1.73-Å resolution structure of the unique endotoxin-neutralizing protective antibody WN1 222-5 in complex with the core region shows that it recognizes LPS of all E. coli serovars in a manner similar to Toll-like receptor 4, revealing that protection can be achieved by targeting the inner core of LPS and that recognition of lipid A is not required. Such interference with Toll-like receptor complex formation opens new paths for antibody sepsis therapy independent of lipid A antagonists.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aantagonists 3aantibodies 3aendotoxins 3ahuman health 3alipid A 3aneutralization 3aseptic shock 3aserotypes 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity1 aMüller-Loennies, Sven,1 aBrooks, Cory L.1 aBrade, Lore1 aKosma, Paul1 aDi Padova, Franco1 aBrade, Helmut1 aEvans, Stephen V.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Dec. 18, v. 109, no. 51 p.20877-20882dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12092531093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245015100171520128800322592002801610650001701638650001601655650001001671650000901681650001801690650000901708650001801717650001201735650001601747650001601763650002801779650002101807650002401828650001301852650001001865650001801875700002301893700002301916700002201939700002301961700002301984700001902007700001702026700002202043700002402065700002202089700001802111700001902129700003202148700003002180700002102210773013302231856008402364852000902448655001202457IND60790787220221119144144.0220826e20220819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079078722DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120812622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZanine, Anderson 14aThe Effect of Cotton Lint from Agribusiness in Diets on Intake, Digestibility, Nitrogen Balance, Blood Metabolites and Ingestive Behaviour of Rams  aThis study aimed to evaluate intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance, ingestive behavior, and blood parameters of sheep fed with cotton lint levels. Twenty rams weighing 30.2 ± 3.7 kg and aged 12 ± 1.3 months were distributed in a completely randomized design, with four treatments and five repetitions. Diets consisted of 50% roughage and 50% concentrate. The treatments consisted of replacing corn with cotton lint at levels of 0, 70, 140, and 210 g/kg of dry matter (DM) of the diets. The animals’ feeding behavior was determined in the last three days of the experimental period. Data were subjected to regression analysis. Decreased linear effect (p < 0.05) was observed for the nutritional fraction’s intake. However, neutral detergent fibre (NDF) intake and plasma urea-N were not affected (p > 0.05) by lint levels. Apparent digestibility of DM, crude protein (CP), ethereal extract (EE), and non-fibrous carbohydrate (NFC) were affected (p < 0.05), except for total carbohydrate. There was a decreased linear effect (p < 0.05) for the intake efficiency of DM and NDF in g/h. The nitrogen balance (g/day) and glucose levels (mg/dL) were reduced with the addition of lint in the diet. The addition of cotton lint up to 70 g/kg in DM can be used over a short-term period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagribusiness 3aagriculture 3ablood 3acorn 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aglucose 3alint cotton 3ametabolites 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anitrogen balance 3aregression analysis 3aroughage 3asheep 3aurea nitrogen1 aCastro, Wanderson 1 aFerreira, Daniele 1 aSousa, Alexandre 1 aParente, Henrique 1 aParente, Michelle 1 aSantos, Edson 1 aGeron, Luiz 1 aLima, Anny Graycy1 aRibeiro, Marinaldo 1 aRodrigues, Arlan 1 aSá, Cledson 1 aCosta, Renata 1 aNascimento, Thiago Vinicius1 aSantos, Francisco Naysson1 aNegrão, Fagton 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 Aug. 19, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120812623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245010700168300001800275520091100293592002801204650002101232650001901253650002501272650001601297650001001313650001701323650001001340650001901350650002301369650002301392650001001415650001101425650001101436650001901447653002801466653002201494653002101516653001901537700002001556700002401576700004101600700003401641700003201675700004001707773011301747856007901860852000901939655001201948IND60515063520221122102352.0160311e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051506352DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2013.00632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBegnini, Karine Rech10aComposition and Antiproliferative Effect of Essential Oil of Origanum vulgare Against Tumor Cell Lines  ap. 1129-1133.  aCancer is a leading cause of death and is responsible for one in eight deaths worldwide. The use of herbs as complementary medicine for cancer, especially advanced cancer, has recently increased. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro, the antiproliferative effect of Origanum vulgare against human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), and human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29). The essential oil (EO) was extracted from a bought amount of O. vulgare dried leaves and analyzed in a gas chromatograph interfaced with a mass selective detector. The cytotoxicity test was performed by sulforhodamine B assay. The results show that the EO is composed mostly of 4-terpineol and induces a high cytotoxicity effect in HT-29. In the MCF-7 cell line the EO was less effective. In conclusion, this study showed that O. vulgare main component is 4-terpineol and was effective in inducing cancer cell growth inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriganum vulgare 3aadenocarcinoma 3aalternative medicine 3acell growth 3acolon 3acytotoxicity 3adeath 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography 3agrowth retardation 3aherbs 3ahumans 3aleaves 3aneoplasm cells 0aantiproliferative assay 0acancer cell lines 0aOriganum vulgare 0aplant extracts1 aNedel, Fernanda1 aLund, Rafael Guerra1 aCarvalho, Pedro Henrique de Azambuja1 aRodrigues, Maria Regina Alves1 aBeira, Fátima Tereza Alves1 aDel-Pino, Francisco Augusto Burkert0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 17, no. 10 p.1129-1133dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-76007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fjmf.2013.00633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010000160300001800260500001100278520107600289592002801365596006401393650001501457650001701472650001001489650002001499650002001519650001201539650001101551650002001562650001501582650002701597700001701624700001601641700001301657700001901670773012001689856007301809852000901882655001201891IND60613416220221119143511.0180912e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061341622DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.131332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreenberg, D.

Anthropogenic habitat conversion has been associated with the loss of evolutionarily distinct bird species at local scales, but whether this evolutionary pattern holds across other clades is unknown. We collate a global dataset on amphibian assemblages in intact forests and nearby human‐modified sites to assess whether evolutionary history influences susceptibility to land conversion. We found that evolutionarily distinct amphibian species are disproportionately lost when forested habitats are converted to alternative land‐uses. We tested the hypothesis that grassland‐associated amphibian lineages have both higher diversification and are pre‐adapted to human landscapes, but found only weak evidence supporting this. The loss of evolutionarily distinct amphibians with land conversion suggests that preserving remnant forests will be vital if we aim to preserve the amphibian tree of life in the face of mounting anthropogenic pressures.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aamphibians 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3adata collection 3aforest habitats 3aforests 3ahumans 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3aterrestrial ecosystems1 aPalen, W.

Almost all traditional fold recognition methods use sequence (homology) comparison to indirectly predict the fold of a target protein based on the fold of a template protein with known structure, which cannot explain the relationship between sequence and fold. Only a few methods had been developed to classify protein sequences into a small number of folds due to methodological limitations, which are not generally useful in practice. We develop a deep 1D-convolution neural network (DeepSF) to directly classify any protein sequence into one of 1195 known folds, which is useful for both fold recognition and the study of sequence–structure relationship. Different from traditional sequence alignment (comparison) based methods, our method automatically extracts fold-related features from a protein sequence of any length and maps it to the fold space. We train and test our method on the datasets curated from SCOP1.75, yielding an average classification accuracy of 75.3%. On the independent testing dataset curated from SCOP2.06, the classification accuracy is 73.0%. We compare our method with a top profile–profile alignment method—HHSearch on hard template-based and template-free modeling targets of CASP9-12 in terms of fold recognition accuracy. The accuracy of our method is 12.63–26.32% higher than HHSearch on template-free modeling targets and 3.39–17.09% higher on hard template-based modeling targets for top 1, 5 and 10 predicted folds. The hidden features extracted from sequence by our method is robust against sequence mutation, insertion, deletion and truncation, and can be used for other protein pattern recognition problems such as protein clustering, comparison and ranking.

In this study, a facile strategy is developed to enable the fast fabrication of multiply doped carbon materials via room-temperature dehalogenation of polyvinyl dichloride (PVDC) promoted by KOH with the presence of different organic dopants. A N,S-codoped carbon material (NS-DCM) is demonstratively synthesized using two dopants (dimethylformamide for N doping and dimethyl sulfoxide for S doping). Afterward, the precursive room-temperature NS-DCM with intentionally overdosed KOH is submitted to inert annealing to obtain large specific surface area and high conductivity. Remarkably, NS-DCM annealed at 600 °C (named as 600-NS-DCM), with 3.0 atom % N and 2.4 atom % S, exhibits a very high specific capacitance of 427 F g–¹ at 1.0 A g–¹ in acidic electrolyte and also keeps ∼60% of capacitance at ultrahigh current density of 100.0 A g–¹. Furthermore, capacitive deionization (CDI) measurements reveal that 600-NS-DCM possesses a large desalination capacity of 32.3 mg g–¹ (40.0 mg L–¹ NaCl) and very good cycling stability. Our strategy of fabricating multiply doped carbon materials can be potentially extended to the synthesis of carbon materials with various combinations of heteroatom doping for broad electrochemical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aannealing 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3adehalogenation 3adesalination 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adimethylformamide 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3apolymers 3apotassium hydroxide 3asodium chloride 3asurface area 0adehalogenation 0acarbon materials 0acodoping 0asupercapacitor 0acapacitive deionization1 aZhang, Guoxin1 aHan, Biao1 aLi, Haoyuan1 aHu, Cejun1 aPang, Yingchun1 aChang, Zheng1 aSun, Xiaoming,d1955-0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Sept. 06, v. 9, no. 35 p.29753-29759dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b081813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245010200160300001800262520112900280592002801409650002201437650001201459650001001471650001101481650001301492650001201505650003101517650002501548650001701573650001101590650002801601650002101629650001701650650002301667650001401690650000901704650002101713650001301734650000901747650000901756650000801765650001001773650002201783653001101805653002001816653000801836653002101844653002801865653000901893653000801902653001001910700001701920700002101937700002001958773011301978856007902091852000902170655001202179IND60515063620221122033334.0160312e20151101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051506362DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2014.33942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Yoon-Mi10aBioactives in Commonly Consumed Cereal Grains: Implications for Oxidative Stress and Inflammation  ap. 1179-1186.  aOxidative stress and inflammation are closely linked to various chronic diseases. Thus, targeting this axis of oxidative stress and inflammation is a particularly interesting area of study for reducing the risk of chronic diseases, including, but not limited to, metabolic disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease. It is well known that antioxidants play a pivotal role in tuning this axis. In this review, we introduce five different cereal grains, which are the most commonly consumed throughout the world and are functionally reported to have antioxidant activity: oat (Avena spp.), barley (Hordeum spp.), rice (Oryza spp.), wheat (Triticum spp.), and rye (Secale spp.). Bioactive components of these grains, partial grains or whole grains, have demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in cells and animals. Although further study is required to establish their efficacy for treating patients with chronic diseases, we suggest that grains, which are a great source of antioxidants, have potential in the prevention of oxidative stress and inflammation-related chronic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aHordeum 3aOryza 3aSecale 3aTriticum 3aanimals 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abarley 3acardiovascular diseases 3achronic diseases 3ainflammation 3ametabolic diseases 3aneoplasms 3aoats 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3arice 3arisk 3arye 3awheat 3awhole grain foods 0abarley 0achronic disease 0aoat 0aoxidative stress 0areactive oxygen species 0arice 0arye 0awheat1 aHan, Sang-Ik1 aSong, Byeng Chun1 aYeum, Kyung-Jin0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 18, no. 11 p.1179-1186dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-76007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fjmf.2014.33943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01590naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245014900164300001600313520032100329592002800650650001600678650002200694650002400716650001200740650000900752700002200761700002300783700002500806700002400831700002300855700002100878700001900899700002200918700005100940773012900991856007501120852000901195655001201204IND60539147020221122030131.0160815e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053914702DNAL7 a10.1021/ja411624q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedlmaier, Stefan

Arrays of factors were explored including Physiological parameters (Germination percentage, seedling vigour, Vigour index), Biochemical parameters (Determination of reducing sugar and soluble protein analysis, lipid peroxidation assay, enzymatic antioxidant system) and DNA extraction and analysis. Vigour and germination index declined with increased ageing period, whereas germination loss became more accentuate depicted by mean germination times. Growth parameters as length of root/shoot and weight (fresh/dry) also decreased with ageing. In aged seeds, increased glucose content indicated the occurrence of sugar hydrolysis. Consequently, Amadori products increased during ageing. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive products (TBA) increased as a sign of the lipid peroxidation. Decrease in the antioxidant enzyme activity and soluble protein content suggested increased protein oxidation and loss of functional properties. DNA degradation was also illustrated by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Analysis of pivotal factor involved in stress signaling i.e. Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) was done for the first time in tomato seeds. Results showed the upregulation of two MAPKs i.e. MPK-3 and -6. The outcomes of the study suggest that network of various redox factors and signals contributes to the ageing in tomato seeds with the involvement of the MAPK pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmadori products 3aDNA 3aantioxidants 3aenzyme activity 3afunctional properties 3agermination 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3alipid peroxidation 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoxidation 3aprotein content 3aqualitative analysis 3areducing sugars 3aroots 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashoots 3atomatoes 3avigor 0aROS 0aMAPKs 0aTBA 0aOS 0aGP 0aMGT 0aGI 0aVI 0aAA 0aCAT 0aSOD 0aAPX 0aPOD 0aGR 0aDHAR 0aMDHAR 0aBSA 0aSenescence 0aOxidative stress 0aAntioxidants 0aLipid peroxidation 0aROS 0aSolanaceae1 aMishra, Abhay P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2224-08521 aSalehi, Bahare1 aKumar, Manoj1 aSahrifi-Rad, Mehdi1 aCoviello, Elena1 aIriti, Marcello1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5063-12361 aSharifi-Rad, Javad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7301-81510 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Apr. 05, v. 248 p.20-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.12.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001500169245014500184300001600329520098200345592002801327650001201355650001301367650001101380650001701391650000901408650001201417650001001429650001401439650001601453650001601469650001201485650003101497650000901528650001101537650000901548650004701557650006601604650005301670650005201723650004501775650003701820651001001857651001001867700001501877700001501892700001501907700001401922700001401936700001601950700002201966700001501988700001802003773010202021856008402123852000902207655001202216IND50067562420221118012114.0141111e20120323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006756242DNAL7 a219448452pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2011.08.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoroni, M.10aGurltia paralysans (): Description of adults and additional case reports of neurological diseases in three domestic cats from southern Chile  ap. 377-380.  aAdults of Gurltia paralysans were obtained from veins of the spinal cord subarachnoid space from three domestic cats presenting with chronic paraparesis/paraplegia from rural areas of southern Chile.

It was found that iron metal can substantially reduce few-layer graphene oxide (GO) to form reduced graphene oxide (RGO) in GO aqueous suspension under ambient conditions, and in the meantime be oxidized to form γ-Fe₂O₃ nanoparticles dispersed on the surface of RGO sheets. The γ-Fe₂O₃/RGO composite delivered both stable cycling performance and good rate capability when used as an anode in a lithium-ion battery cell.

Pot experiments were thus conducted to explore the effects and mechanisms of foliar spraying with composite sols of silicon (Si) and selenium (Se) during tillering to booting stage on diminishing cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) translocation to rice grains and affiliated physiological and biochemical responses in rice seedlings grown in Cd + Pb-polluted soils (positive control). Results showed that Cd and Pb contents in leaves or grains were distinctly below the positive control by the sols. Compared to the positive control, transcriptions of Cd transporter-related genes including OsLCT1, OsCCX2, OsHMA2 and OsPCR1 genes in leaves, and OsLCT1, OsCCX2, TaCNR2 and OSPCR1 in peduncles were downregulated by the increasing sols. Meanwhile, Se-binding protein 1 was evidently upregulated, together to retard Cd and Pb translocation to rice grains. The sols not only upregulated transcriptions of Lhcb1, RbcL, and OsBTF3 genes and production of psbA, Lhcb1 and RbcL proteins, but also increased the chlorophylls contents and RuBP carboxylase activities in the leaves, improving photosynthesis. The sols restrained ROS production from NADPH oxidases, but activated glutathione peroxidase, alleviating oxidative stress and damage. Additionally, Se was significantly enriched and was existed as selenomethionine in the rice grains. However, Pb transporter-related genes remain to be specified. Thus, the composite sols have potential to reduce Cd and Pb accumulation, mitigate oxidative damage, and promote photosynthesis and organic Se enrichment in rice plants under Cd and Pb combined pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aOryza sativa 3abooting stage 3acadmium 3achlorophyll 3aenzyme activity 3afoliar spraying 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglutathione peroxidase 3alead 3aleaves 3aoxidative stress 3apeduncle 3aphotosynthesis 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3aproteins 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3arice 3aseedlings 3aselenium 3aselenomethionine 3asilicon 3atillering 3atoxicity 0aHeavy metals 0aNano-Se and nano-Si 0aCd transporters 0aPhotosynthesis 0aFood quality and safety1 aRong, Hong1 aZhang, Xuebiao1 aShi, Wenjun1 aHong, Xiu1 aLiu, Weichen1 aCao, Tong1 aYu, Xianxian1 aYu, Qifen0 tChemosphere.g2020 July, v. 251 p.126347-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1263473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245009300212300001800305506007600323520143400399592002801833506003701861650000801898650001601906650001501922650001901937650001401956650002401970650001501994700002102009700001602030700002502046700002302071700002102094700002202115773012002137856008602257852000902343655001202352IND60624928420221207110359.0191017e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062492842DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btx7832doi7 aPMC59056602pmcid7 a292369712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntczak, Maciej10aNew algorithms to represent complex pseudoknotted RNA structures in dot-bracket notation  ap. 1304-1312.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnderstanding the formation, architecture and roles of pseudoknots in RNA structures are one of the most difficult challenges in RNA computational biology and structural bioinformatics. Methods predicting pseudoknots typically perform this with poor accuracy, often despite experimental data incorporation. Existing bioinformatic approaches differ in terms of pseudoknots’ recognition and revealing their nature. A few ways of pseudoknot classification exist, most common ones refer to a genus or order. Following the latter one, we propose new algorithms that identify pseudoknots in RNA structure provided in BPSEQ format, determine their order and encode in dot-bracket-letter notation. The proposed encoding aims to illustrate the hierarchy of RNA folding. New algorithms are based on dynamic programming and hybrid (combining exhaustive search and random walk) approaches. They evolved from elementary algorithm implemented within the workflow of RNA FRABASE 1.0, our database of RNA structure fragments. They use different scoring functions to rank dissimilar dot-bracket representations of RNA structure. Computational experiments show an advantage of new methods over the others, especially for large RNA structures.

The SCDS data include 20 outcomes measured on 9-year-old children that can be classified broadly in four outcome classes or “domains”: cognition, memory, motor, and social behavior. Previous analyses and scientific theory suggest that these outcomes may belong to more than one of these domains, rather than only a single domain as is frequently assumed for modeling. We present a framework for examining the effects of exposure and other covariates when the outcomes may each belong to more than one domain and where we also want to learn about the assignment of outcomes to domains. Each domain is defined by a sentinel outcome, which is preassigned to that domain only. All other outcomes can belong to multiple domains and are not preassigned. Our model allows exposure and covariate effects to differ across domains and across outcomes within domains, and includes random subject-specific effects that model correlations between outcomes within and across domains. We take a Bayesian MCMC approach. Results from the Seychelles study and from extensive simulations show that our model can effectively determine sparse domain assignment, and at the same time give increased power to detect overall, domain-specific, and outcome-specific exposure and covariate effects relative to separate models for each endpoint. When fit to the Seychelles data, several outcomes were classified as partly belonging to domains other than their originally assigned domains. In retrospect, the new partial domain assignments are reasonable and, as we discuss, suggest important scientific insights about the nature of the outcomes. Checks of model misspecification were improved relative to a model that assumes each outcome is in a single domain.

Oxidation of acrolein delivers glycidaldehyde (90%), which directs a regioselective phosphorylation in water and specifically affords 5′-phosphorylated nucleotide precursors in upto 36% yield.

And nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to obtain the composition of functional groups in hydrocarbons, which were classified into 11 carbon types according to different structural properties of molecules. The GC × GC–TOFMS results reflected that −50# diesel contains less unsaturated hydrocarbons, while −35# diesel contains more heavy hydrocarbons. The NMR spectroscopy results indicated that −50# diesel contains more CH3 (primary carbon) and n-alkane CH2 (secondary carbon), and the H/C ratio reflected by the analysis results of NMR spectroscopy were consistent with the H/C ratio measured by ASTM D5291. Based on the results of GC × GC–TOFMS, one five-component and one seven-component surrogate fuels were constructed for −35# diesel and −50# diesel through genetic algorithm by matching the density, viscosity, cetane number, distillation curve and functional groups. Then spray penetration of the surrogate fuels were validated and the result are compared with the experimental results of lower freezing point diesel under spray condition (Pₐₘb = 3 MPa, Tₐₘb = 800 K). It turned out that the both the target properties and the non-target properties showed good agreement that the surrogate fuels can emulate properties of lower freezing point diesels well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aalkanes 3acarbon 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3adistillation 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aviscosity 0aLower freezing point diesel 0aFuel property 0aSurrogate fuel formulation 0aFunctional groups1 aZhang, Linqi1 aWu, Zhiyong1 aZhou, Dezhi1 aQian, Yong1 aLu, Xingcai0 tFuel processing technology.g2022 Oct., v. 235 p.107359-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2022.1073593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03181naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245017600164300001600340520162600356592002801982650001902010650002302029650001302052650001502065650001702080650001402097650001002111650002302121650002302144650002302167653002602190653002602216653002902242700002102271700003102292700002602323700003602349700001802385700003102403700002502434700003302459773013202492856007802624852000902702655001202711IND60643911820221123021157.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064391182DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2017-02652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÚbeda, Natalia10aMuscular contraction frequency does not affect plasma homocysteine concentration in response to energy expenditure- and intensity-matched acute exercise in sedentary males  ap. 107-112.  aAcute exercise seems to increase total plasma homocysteine (tHcy); since this variable associated with cardiovascular risk, it is important to understand the determinants of its response to all types of exercise. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of cycling at 2 different rates of muscle contraction on the complete tHcy kinetics. Eight young sedentary males were required to complete 2 isocaloric (400 kcal) acute exercise trials at 50% peak oxygen uptake on separate occasions at 50 or 80 rpm. Blood samples were drawn at different points before (4 h before exercise and immediately before exercise), during (10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min during exercise), and after exercise (immediately and 19 h after exercise). Dietary and lifestyle factors were controlled during the research. Maximum tHcy occurred during exercise for both conditions (50 rpm: 11.4 ± 2.7 μmol·L–¹; 80 rpm: 10.8 ± 3.2 μmol·L–¹). From this point onwards tHcy declined until the cessation of exercise and continued descending below pre-exercise values at 19 h postexercise (p < 0.05). No hyperhomocysteinemia were observed at any sampling point in both trials. In conclusion, the different muscular contraction frequency during exercise has no impact on tHcy during an acute bout of exercise in sedentary individuals, when at least 400 kcal are spent during exercise and the nutritional status for folate, B₁₂, and B₆ is adequate. This information is relevant to further inform healthy exercise prescription, not only in terms of duration and intensity of exercise, but also taking into account frequency of contraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood sampling 3aenergy expenditure 3aexercise 3afolic acid 3ahomocysteine 3alifestyle 3amales 3amuscle contraction 3anutritional status 3apeak oxygen uptake 0ahomocysteine kinetics 0aexercise prescription 0afrequency of contraction1 aCarson, Brian P.1 aGarcía-González, Ángela1 aAguilar Ros, Antonio,1 aDíaz-Martínez, Ángel Enrique1 aVenta, Rafael1 aTerrados Cepeda, Nicolás,1 aO’Gorman, Donal J.1 aIglesias-Gutiérrez, Eduardo0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2018, v. 43, no. 2 p.107-112dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2017-02653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01880naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245007700166300002000243520063600263592002800899650002300927650002100950650001000971650001800981650002500999650001101024650002401035650001801059650003401077700001901111700003001130700001901160700002001179700002201199700001901221700002201240773012501262856007401387852000901461655001201470IND60666920520221120040745.0190919e20141113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066692052DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra10306h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontalbano, Francesco10aPhenylalanine iminoboronates as new phenylalanine hydroxylase modulators  ap. 61022-61027.  aHerein we report the discovery of new modulators of human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hPAH) inspired by the structure of its substrate and regulator l-phenylalanine.

Among these dyes, Dye3, with the strongest electron donating ability, shows the most red shift in the UV-Vis absorption spectrum. Moreover, the Dye3@(TiO₂)₃₈ complex shows stronger adsorption energy of −19.54 kcal mol⁻¹. Nevertheless, Dye2 has shown the best photovoltaic performance. We measured the molecular volume and molecular width based on the geometries from the PBE functional, together with the double-numerical with polarization performed in the DMol³ program, to investigate the effect of N-substituted donors on the number density of the adsorbed dye, on the TiO₂ surface. We found that the bulkiness of the N-substituted donor in Dye3 can dramatically reduce the number density of the adsorbed on the surface. The molecular width and projected area of Dye3 are calculated to be 15.980 Å and 214 Å², respectively, indicating the more bulky structure compared to Dye2 (molecular width = 14.505 Å and projected area = 180 Å²) which corresponds to the dye uptake of Dye3 (1.38 × 10¹⁷ molecule per cm²) being significantly less than of Dye2 (4.55 × 10¹⁷ molecule per cm²). Finally, Dye3 with an extra bulky donor exhibits poorer energy conversion efficiency of 3.91% compared to 5.45% of Dye2, under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm⁻²).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adyes 3aenergy conversion 3afluorenes 3ageometry 3airradiation 3asolar cells 3aspectral analysis 3athiophene 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aRattanawan, Rattanawalee1 aRonyhut, Kritsada1 aMangsachart, Ponlawat1 aSudyoadsuk, Taweesak1 aPromarak, Vinich1 aNamuangruk, Supawadee1 aKungwan, Nawee1 aJungsuttiwong, Siriporn0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 26, v. 5, no. 15 p.11549-11557dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra15645e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03415naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245015800164300001800322520189700340592002802237650002202265650001602287650001902303650002202322650001302344650001702357650001802374650001602392650000902408650001202417650001202429650002202441650001302463650004402476650001102520650002202531650000702553650001202560650001402572700001802586700002602604700002902630700002502659700002002684773012202704856007402826852000902900655001202909IND60667200820221119224246.0190919e20150106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066720082DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15649h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatalenszki, János10aHalf-sandwich complexes of ruthenium, osmium, rhodium and iridium with dl-methionine or S-methyl-l-cysteine: a solid state and solution equilibrium study  ap. 8094-8107.  a[(η⁶-p-cym)Ru(H₂O)₃]²⁺ binding strength of the thioether ligands dl-methionine (H₂met⁺) or S-methyl-l-cysteine (H₂mecys⁺) was studied with the combined use of pH-potentiometry, NMR and mass spectrometry in aqueous solution. Both ligands were found to form stable [(η⁶-p-cym)RuA]⁺ complexes with [S, NH₂, COO⁻] coordination of the amino acids over a wide pH-range. A log βRᵤA value of 17.2(2) was obtained from NMR titrations for the met system by a competition reaction with hydroxide ions. Comparison of the [(η⁶-p-cym)Ru(H₂O)₃]²⁺ binding strength of the [O, O, O] (citrate), [O, N, O] (isoserine) and [S, N, O] (met) donor sets at pH = 7.4 reveals the exclusive formation of a [S, N, O] chelated metal complex. Synthesis and characterisation of [(η⁶-p-cym)Ru(L)]X, [(η⁶-p-cym)Os(L)]Cl or [(η⁵-Cp*)M′(L)]Cl (L = mecys, dl-met, l-met; X = Cl, NO₃, CF₃SO₃; M′ = Rh, Ir) complexes together with the molecular structures of the [(η⁶-p-cym)Ru(mecys)]NO₃ (10) and [(η⁶-p-cym)Ru(met)]NO₃ (11) obtained by the X-ray diffraction method are reported. Both tridentate ligands form chiral-at-metal complexes in which the configuration of the metal centre is determined by the ligands containing a stereogenic centre (αC) as well. Diffraction data indicate that 10 contains the RRᵤRαCSS stereoisomer while 11 consists of the RRᵤSαCRS and SRᵤRαCSS enantiomers in the lattice. Owing to the labile configuration of the thioether sulfurs epimerisation in both systems was detected and the ratio of the diastereomers was estimated. 11 together with [(η⁶-p-cym)Ru(l-met)]Cl (3), [(η⁵-Cp*)Rh(dl-met)]Cl (7) and [(η⁵-Cp*)Ir(dl-met)]Cl (9) were tested for their in vitro cytotoxicity using human-derived ovarian cancer lines (A2780) and showed no anti-proliferative activity in the concentration range (0–50 μM) studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aamino acids 3aanimal ovaries 3aaqueous solutions 3acitrates 3acytotoxicity 3adiastereomers 3aenantiomers 3aions 3airidium 3aligands 3amass spectrometry 3anitrates 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aosmium 3aovarian neoplasms 3apH 3arhodium 3aruthenium1 aBíró, Linda1 aBényei, Attila Csaba1 aMuchova, Tereza Radosova1 aKašpárková, Jana,1 aBuglyó, Péter0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 06, v. 5, no. 11 p.8094-8107dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra15649h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01578naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245011800163300001800281520051600299592002800815650001400843650002300857650002300880650001100903650002000914650002100934650002400955650003200979700002401011773013401035856007401169852000901243655001201252IND60639141820221120192323.0190501e20170629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063914182DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc02188g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSconyers, David J.10aDistinguishing between homogeneous and heterogeneous hydrogen-evolution catalysis with molecular cobalt complexes  ap. 7286-7289.  aMolecular proton-reduction catalysts can decompose under the acidic conditions required for hydrogen evolution, resulting in formation of secondary metal-containing materials.

Assessing the dynamics of these elements and their interactions on crop productivity in dryland cropping are complex because climate often dictates crop nutrient response. This results in under- or over- fertilising crops, suboptimal crop yield, and fertiliser inefficiency. The Agricultural Productions Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model accounts for C x N x climate interactions, but simulation of P dynamics is constrained by a dearth of suitable data. To address this problem, we used a novel approach to simulate P, N, and C dynamics at a 35-year long-term field trial, where a broad range of N (0, 40, 80, 120 kg ha⁻¹) and P (0, 10, 20 kg ha⁻¹) fertiliser rates were consistently applied. We parameterised the soil P model with quantified adsorption isotherms and by assuming correspondence between conceptual soil P pools and Hedley fractionation pools. Soil N and C dynamics were parameterised with measured organic N, C, and charcoal content to estimate organic matter decay coefficients, pool sizes, and C:N ratios. APSIM accounted for variation in mean N export (94%), crop yield (88%), and P export (62%) across the 12 treatments, and reproduced interannual variation in N × P effects for crop yield and N export, where crop response was strongly mediated by N supply and water availability. APSIM also identified the long-term depletion or accumulation of soil P, N, and C in most treatments. P fractionation and isotherm measurements are labour intensive but worthwhile, and future efforts should work to consolidate a database for different soil types. Better informed P modelling will provide insights into the effects of climate variability on soil fertility and crop productivity, and guide management practices to deliver better fertiliser efficiency and maintain soil organic C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aarid lands 3acharcoal 3aclimate 3acrop yield 3adatabases 3afield experimentation 3afractionation 3alabor 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aresearch 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic carbon 3atropical agriculture 0aAPSIM 0aSoil P model 0aHedley fractionation 0aPhosphorus isotherm 0aSustainable cropping systems1 aSchmidt, Susanne1 aBiggs, Jody1 aLester, David W.1 aBourne, Nicholas1 aHuth, Neil I.0 tField crops research.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 285 p.108590-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2022.1085903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100006000189245012900249300001400378506007600392520144600468592002801914506003701942650001601979650003401995650002202029650001202051650001402063650001202077650001902089650002202108650002602130650001102156700002302167773013602190856008202326852000902408655001202417IND60682846520221207115257.0200203e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068284652DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-019-01392-82doi7 aPMC69957842pmcid7 a318582152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrolov, Roman V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7431-529710aElectrophysiological adaptations of insect photoreceptors and their elementary responses to diurnal and nocturnal lifestyles  ap. 55-69.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNocturnal vision in insects depends on the ability to reliably detect scarce photons. Nocturnal insects tend to have intrinsically more sensitive and larger rhabdomeres than diurnal species. However, large rhabdomeres have relatively high membrane capacitance (Cₘ), which can strongly low-pass filter the voltage bumps, widening and attenuating them. To investigate the evolution of photoreceptor signaling under near dark, we recorded elementary current and voltage responses from a number of species in six insect orders. We found that the gain of phototransduction increased with Cₘ, so that nocturnal species had relatively large and prolonged current bumps. Consequently, although the voltage bump amplitude correlated negatively with Cₘ, the strength of the total voltage signal increased. Importantly, the background voltage noise decreased strongly with increasing Cₘ, yielding a notable increase in signal-to-noise ratio for voltage bumps. A similar decrease in the background noise with increasing Cₘ was found in intracellular recordings in vivo. Morphological measurements of rhabdomeres were consistent with our Cₘ estimates. Our results indicate that the increased photoreceptor Cₘ in nocturnal insects is a major sensitivity-boosting and noise-suppressing adaptation. However, by requiring a compensatory increase in the gain of phototransduction, this adaptation comes at the expense of the signaling bandwidth.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acapacitance 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrophysiology 3ainsects 3alifestyle 3aphotons 3aphotoreceptors 3aphototransduction 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3avision1 aIgnatova, Irina I.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2020 Jan., v. 206, no. 1 p.55-69dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl37825x0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-019-01392-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006200170300001600232520122200248592002801470650002001498650001801518650001101536650001501547653003301562653003401595653001701629653003401646653001301680700001901693773012801712856008401840852000901924655001201933IND60123339120221118164928.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012333912DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2013.8369742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIng, Ching-Kang10aPredictor Selection for Positive Autoregressive Processes  ap. 243-253.  aLet observations y ₁, …, y ₙ be generated from a first-order autoregressive (AR) model with positive errors.

Based on these expressions, we compare the relative performance of () and the least-squares predictor (estimator) from the MSPE (MSE) point of view. Our comparison reveals that the better predictor (estimator) is determined not only by whether a unit root exists, but also by the behavior of the underlying error distribution near the origin, and hence is difficult to identify in practice. To circumvent this difficulty, we suggest choosing the predictor (estimator) with the smaller accumulated prediction error and show that the predictor (estimator) chosen in this way is asymptotically equivalent to the better one.

This paper aims to provide an overview of published research findings on rice yield gaps and the effects of ‘good agricultural practices’ (GAPs) on rice yield and nutrient use efficiency. The majority of previous studies were from irrigated lowlands, and quantified rice yield gaps as farmer-based (difference between ‘actual yield’ and ‘best farmers’ yield’) and model-based yield gaps (difference between ‘actual yield’ and ‘potential yield for irrigated and water-limited potential yield for rainfed rice’). The mean farmer- and model-based yield gaps were 3.1 and 5.0 t ha–¹ for irrigated lowland (IL); 3.1 and 7.7 t ha–¹ for rainfed lowland (RL); 2.0 and 6.0 t ha–¹ for rainfed upland (RU), respectively in Africa. An analysis of studies from literature on GAPs in Africa revealed that most studies (64 %) were from IL and a wide range of yield increases following individual components of GAPs across environments. A median yield increase of 1.0 t ha–¹ was achieved with improved water conservation practices in IL, whereas improved weed management increased yields by 0.7 t ha–¹, mainly in IL compared to farmers’ practices. Application of inorganic fertilizers and/or organic amendments increased the yield by 0.8–1.2 t ha–¹ across the environments. Integration of GAPs increased the median yield by 2.1 and 1.5 t ha–¹ in IL and RL, respectively. The calculated agronomic efficiency of N, P and K from fertilizer experiments were within the desirable levels mainly in the IL and RL environments and comparable to the values from similar environments in Asia. For instance, the agronomic efficiency of N was 21, 13 and 12 kg kg–¹, respectively for IL, RL and RU in Africa. Although rice yield gaps in Africa can be substantially reduced by introduction of integrated GAPs to farmers, there is large difference between model-based yield gaps and yield gain obtained by integrated GAPs. Further efforts are needed to identify factors causing this difference. We recommend a research and development focus on rainfed lowland rice systems, which have the largest model-based yield gaps by partially converting them to irrigated systems, and on improving nutrient use efficiencies and closing nutrient cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahighlands 3airrigation 3anutrient use efficiency 3aresearch and development 3arice 3awater conservation 3aweed control 3aAfrica 3aAsia 0aGAPs 0aYield gap 0aMeta-analysis 0aNutrient use efficiency 0aRice growing environments0 tField crops research.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 285 p.108591-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2022.1085913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245008800202300001800290520179100308592002802099650001402127650002102141650001802162650001302180650001302193650001402206650001802220650001802238650000902256650000702265650002102272650002102293650002302314650001602337650002002353650001702373650001602390653003002406653001202436653002402448653002302472700001502495700001602510700005202526700001702578773014802595856008002743852000902823655001202832IND60686760720221123034331.0200318e20200224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068676072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.0c001282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhigao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1821-484310aRapeseed Protein Nanogels As Novel Pickering Stabilizers for Oil-in-Water Emulsions  ap. 3607-3614.  aRecently plant protein Pickering particles have received tremendous interests because of their environmentally friendly, biodegradable, and safe characteristics. However, developing plant protein particles as stabilizers of Pickering emulsion still face many challenges. In current study, a novel nanogel system produced from acylated rapeseed protein isolates (ARPI) was used to stabilize Pickering emulsions. Results showed that self-assembled nanogel after native RPI modified by acylation adjusted the three-phase contact angle of ARPI nanogels system to 86.7° closing to a neutral wettability. At constant oil phase fraction (0.3, v/v), increasing the ARPI nanogels concentrations produced smaller droplet sizes of Pickering emulsions, whereas all freshly prepared Pickering emulsions were stable except 0.1% (w/v) ARPI nanogel-stabilized Pickering emulsion occurred with creaming. The rise of the oil phase fraction showed little influences on the droplets size and visual appearances of Pickering emulsions at a fixed ARPI nanogels concentration (0.75%, w/v). Moreover, the prepared ARPI nanogels stabilized Pickering emulsions were stable against aggregations of droplets at a range of pH conditions ranging from 5.5 to 8.5 and salt concentration as high as 0.2 M. Additionally, the ARPI nanogels concentration above 0.5% favored the formation of Pickering emulsion with long-term storage stability (up to 30 days) against creaming. Microscopic images evidenced that ARPI nanogels could absorb and anchor at the droplets surface forming an interfacial layer. Above findings may deliver a potential strategy for fabricating stable Pickering emulsion based on plant protein particles and are of important significance for the utilization of rapeseed protein in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacylation 3abiodegradability 3acontact angle 3acreaming 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3afood industry 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3apH 3aprotein isolates 3arapeseed protein 3asalt concentration 3astabilizers 3astorage quality 3astorage time 3awettability 0arapeseed protein isolates 0ananogel 0apickering emulsions 0aemulsion stability1 aZhang, Nan1 aChen, Chong1 aHe, Rong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3341-97861 aJu, Xingrong0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Feb. 24, v. 68, no. 11 p.3607-3614dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c001283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011500170300001600285520115500301592002801456650000901484650001701493650001301510650001601523650002201539650001201561650001301573650001301586653001801599653001501617653001901632653001501651653002701666653002201693773012101715856005101836852000901887655001201896IND50086918020221119075124.0140412e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008691802DNAL7 a10.1080/17480272.2011.6497832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGjerdrum, Peder10aSawlog scaling accuracy before and after barking, and the importance for sawn timber recovery – A case study  ap. 120-125.  aScaling accuracy is of utmost importance to obtain optimal sawn timber yield in primary breakdown. In this article, sawmill observations, review of available publications and supplementary tests are combined to analyse the accuracy of conifer roundwood scaling. The influence of important log parameters are considered for various scaling technology: one- and two-directional (1Dir and 2Dir) shadow scanners and three-dimensional (3Dim) reflected beam scanners. Standard error for each of the terms, ovality, bark and scanner technology, is discussed. The overall accuracy for diameter under bark can be calculated by adding the variances for each independent term. Results show that for unbarked logs, 2Dir shadow scanner remains the most accurate technology. For barked logs, 3Dim reflected laser beam scanner combines the highest accuracy and the ability of providing a wide range of important log parameters. For a case study sawmill, annual roundwood consumption are reduced by 2.0% by transferring from scaling unbarked logs in a two-dimensional shadow scanner to 3Dim scanning of barked logs, while keeping the volume yield of the sawn timber.  aPublisher supplied data 3abark 3acase studies 3aconifers 3aengineering 3amaterials science 3asawlogs 3asawmills 3ascanners 0aNorway spruce 0aScots pine 0ashadow scanner 0a3D scanner 0aindustrial log scaling 0ascaling precision0 tWood material science and engineering.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 7, no. 3 p.120-125dTaylor & Francis Groupx1748-02807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480272.2011.649783  aDNAL 7aarticle03458naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245014900164300001400313520178000327592002802107650001302135650003702148650001202185650004102197650001902238650004002257650001802297650002102315650003302336650001002369653002102379653002202400653002102422653002102443653002902464700002302493700003302516700002202549700004002571700002002611700001902631700003002650700002602680700002902706773013002735856007802865852000902943655001202952IND60643912220221123032417.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064391222DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2017-02942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiniz, Tiego A.10aChanges in HDL-c concentrations after 16 weeks of combined training in postmenopausal women: characteristics of positive and negative responders  ap. 38-44.  aThis study aimed to investigate the individual characteristics of body composition and metabolic profile that could explain interindividual variation in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) concentrations in response to 16 weeks of combined strength plus aerobic (combined) training in postmenopausal women. The participants were divided into tertiles based on percentage of changes in HDL-c concentrations after combined training. Only women in the upper tertile (positive responders: Δ > 10.4%; n = 19) and lower tertile (negative responders: Δ < −1.4%; n = 19) were considered for analyses. The total body fat (BF), trunk fat (TF), android fat (AF), gynoid fat, and lean body mass were estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The metabolic profile – glucose, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, HDL-c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) – were assessed. After 16 weeks, both positive and negative responders presented similar improvement in body composition, such as a decrease in percentage and kilograms of BF, TF, and AF, and increase in lean body mass (p value for time < 0.05). As expected, there was an effect of time and also a significant interaction (time vs. group) (p value < 0.001) in the improvement of HDL-c, with higher values for positive responders. Regarding metabolic profile, there were significant interactions (time vs. group) for triacylglycerol (p value = 0.032) and VLDL (p value = 0.027) concentrations, with lower values for positive responders. Our results suggests there is heterogeneity in combined training-induced HDL-c changes in postmenopausal women, and the positive responders were those who presented more pronounced decreases in triacylglycerol and VLDL concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody fat 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aglucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alean body mass 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3apostmenopause 3atriacylglycerols 3avery low density lipoprotein 3awomen 0aaerobic exercise 0astrength training 0abody composition 0alipid metabolism 0ahigh-density lipoprotein1 aRossi, Fabricio E.1 aFortaleza, Ana Claudia Souza1 aNeves, Lucas Melo1 aChristofaro, Diego Giulliano Destro1 aBuonani, Camila1 aLira, Fabio S.1 aCampos, Eduardo Zapaterra1 aPrado, Wagner Luiz do1 aFreitas Jr, Ismael Forte0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2018, v. 43, no. 1 p.38-44dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2017-02943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245015100164300001600315520152900331536010401860592002801964596001301992650003402005650002902039650002102068650001402089650001402103650001702117650001502134650002002149650001902169650001702188650001402205650001402219650002002233700001402253700001502267700001702282700001402299700001202313773011602325856008602441852000902527655001202536IND60768578620221118061407.0220225e20220207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076857862DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2021.19123682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wang10aTrilobatin Induces Apoptosis and Attenuates Stemness Phenotype of Acquired Gefitinib Resistant Lung Cancer Cells via Suppression of NF-κB Pathway  ap. 735-746.  aTrilobatin is a common type of flavonoids compounds derived from Lithocarpus polystachyus Rehd leaves. Previous report suggests that trilobatin was potentially involved in pro-and anticancer, antioxidative and anti-hyperglycemic activities. Here, we investigated the anticancer efficiency of trilobatin on gefitinib resistant lung cancer cells. In this study, MTT assays, EdU incorporation assays, DAPI staining, tumor sphere formation assays, immunofluorescent staining and Western blot analysis were performed to explore the functional role of trilobatin on gefitinib resistant lung cancer cells. The results showed that trilobatin inhibits proliferation of gefitinib resistant lung cancer cells. In addition, the proportions of apoptotic cells were increased along with down-regulated expression levels of Bcl-2 and mitochondrial Cytochrome C while up-regulated Bax, Cleaved Caspase-3, −9, and cytosolic Cytochrome C expression. Moreover, trilobatin decreased tumor sphere formation and expression levels of multiple stemness markers (ALDH1, CD133, Nanog, and ABCG2) in gefitinib resistant lung cancer cells. Furthermore, investigation of the mechanism indicated that trilobatin suppressed activity of NF-κB via decreasing constitutive phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and IκB-α in gefitinib resistant lung cancer cells. All these results indicate that trilobatin induces apoptosis and attenuates stemness phenotype of gefitinib resistant lung cancer cells, involved with, or partly, the suppression of NF-κB activity.  aThe present study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 81802512).  aPublisher supplied data  a81802512 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aLithocarpus polystachyus 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acytochrome c 3aflavonoids 3aglycemic effect 3alung neoplasms 3amitochondria 3anutrition 3aphenotype 3aphosphorylation1 aZihan, Xu1 aYizhe, Wei1 aYanyang, Liu1 aZhixi, Li1 aXi, Yan0 tNutrition and cancer.g2022 Feb. 7, v. 74, no. 2 p.735-746dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11654x1532-79147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2021.19123683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245029000173300001600463520133000479592002801809650001301837650002101850650002001871650002201891650000901913650002601922650001201948650001301960650001901973650001901992650002902011650001502040653001702055653002502072653002102097653002202118773011102140856008802251852000902339655001202348IND60633953320221122134744.0190502e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063395332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDziadosz, Marek10aApplication of combined acetate salt based multiple analyte adduct formation in signal separated quantification performed for the purposes of forensic toxicology with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry — Discussion on the basis of salicylic acid applied as a model drug  ap. 249-253.  aIn this work the examination of analyte adduct formation by the application of both sodium acetate and lithium acetate was performed with salicylic acid used as a model drug. Additionally, on the basis of combined acetate salt based multiple analyte adduct ions it was aimed to investigate the generation of different analyte precursor ions and their application in signal separated quantification with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Adduct identification experiments were performed by infusion experiments and resulted in an optimised detection of analyte adduct ions with lithium acetate, sodium acetate and combined lithium acetate/sodium acetate. Sample preparation based on a fast protein precipitation with a methanol solution containing lithium acetate and sodium acetate. A Luna 5 μm C18 (2) 100 A, 150 mm × 2 mm analytical column and a mobile phase composed of an H2O/methanol = 3%/97% (v/v) solution with 10 mmol l-1 ammonium acetate and 0.1% acetic acid were used for chromatographic purposes. The linearity was investigated in the range of 5–500 μg/ml. The limit of detection (LOD of 1.2 μg/ml) and quantification (LOQ 4.0 μg/ml) together with other results of validation experiments revealed that this strategy can be applied for salicylic acid quantification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aammonium acetate 3adetection limit 3aforensic sciences 3aions 3aliquid chromatography 3alithium 3amethanol 3asalicylic acid 3asodium acetate 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicology 0aAcetate salt 0aAcetylsalicylic acid 0aAdduct formation 0aSignal separation0 tForensic science international.g2019 Apr., v. 297 p.249-253dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245006300164300001600227500001100243520094400254592002801198650001401226650001601240650003301256650001201289650002401301650003201325650002501357700001501382773013101397856007801528852000901606655001201615IND60589121120221122150656.0180202e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058912112DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2016003672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Zhixiong10aCurrent trends in sample preparation for cosmetic analysis  ap. 152-169.  aREVIEW  aThe widespread applications of cosmetics in modern life make their analysis particularly important from a safety point of view. There is a wide variety of restricted ingredients and prohibited substances that primarily influence the safety of cosmetics. Sample preparation for cosmetic analysis is a crucial step as the complex matrices may seriously interfere with the determination of target analytes.

As wheat is essential for food security it is worrying that its yield gains over the last two decades were small. To achieve further yield increases it is critical to continue increasing number of grains per unit area (GN m⁻²), the trait best related to yield. In this context, it is relevant to identify the main determinants of GN m⁻² in response to genetic and environmental factors as well as the trade-offs between them. In the present study we compiled a large database across the literature to analyse the relative importance of components when affected by genetic or environmental factors, producing small or large changes in GN m⁻² and its components, either numerical (the number of spikes per m², SN m⁻²; and the number of grains per spike, GN spike⁻¹) or physiological (spike dry weight at anthesis, SDWa; and fruiting efficiency, FE) determinants. The database included 367 papers published in: (i) Field Crop Research (FCR), (ii) European Journal of Agronomy (EJA), (iii) Crop Science (CS) and (iv) Crop and Pasture Science (CPS, formerly Australian Journal of Agricultural Research) between 1990 and 2020. The complete dataset was split into classes, depending on the source of experimental variation, environment or genotype and was normalised to remove the differences between experiments and determine the environmental and genotypic effects within each experiment. Normalised data showed that the responsiveness of GN m⁻² was similarly explained by changes in both SN m⁻² and GN spike⁻¹, but in terms of physiological components SDWa was more relevant than FE for explaining the variations in GN m⁻². Considering the numerical components of GN m⁻² genotypic and environmental factors modified more GN spike⁻¹ than in SN m⁻². On the other hand, physiological components were differently modified by genotype and environment: for genotypic effects FE was more critical than SDWa and the other way around for environmental factors. A trade-off between numerical and physiological components was observed although was greater between physiological than between numerical components.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural research 3aagronomy 3acrop yield 3adata collection 3adatabases 3afield crops 3aflowering 3afood production 3afood security 3agenotype 3apastures 3awheat 0aNumber of grains 0aNumber of spikes 0aFruiting efficiency 0aSpike dry weight 0aYield components 0aTriticum aestivum1 aGarcía, Guillermo A.1 aSerrago, Román A.1 aMiralles, Daniel J.0 tField crops research.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 285 p.108593-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2022.1085933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009900158300001800257520177200275592002802047650001402075650002102089650001502110650001102125650001702136650000902153650001402162650002202176650001102198650001402209650002202223650001702245700002502262700002102287700002002308700002102328773013402349856007402483852000902557655001202566IND60639142420221120231537.0190501e20170629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063914242DNAL7 a10.1039/c7cc02204b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOoka, Hideshi10aElement strategy of oxygen evolution electrocatalysis based on in situ spectroelectrochemistry  ap. 7149-7161.  aOxygen evolution electrocatalysis has received extensive attention due to its significance in biology, chemistry, and technology. However, it is still unclear how the abundant 3d-elements can be used to drive the four-electron oxidation of water as efficiently as in Nature. In this Feature Article, we will propose a design strategy concerning the optimization of the charge accumulation process based on our ongoing spectroelectrochemical study on Mn, Fe, and Ir oxygen evolution catalysts. Spectroscopic identification of the reaction intermediates showed that the activity of MnO₂ and Fe₂O₃ was dictated by the generation of Mn³⁺ and Fe⁴⁺, whereas in the case of IrOₓ, the activity did not correlate with the valence change of Ir. The efficiency of charge accumulation through valence change is closely linked with the spin configuration of the metal center, because charge disproportionation, which was found to inhibit charge accumulation in the high-spin 3d metals, requires an electron in the eg orbital. In addition to directly increasing the overpotential through the generation of an unstable intermediate, charge disproportionation inhibits charge accumulation by dissipating the total oxidative energy of the system. A favorable charge accumulation process may also be beneficial for electrode kinetics due to the enhanced coupling between reaction rates and electrochemical driving force. The model proposed in this study may help explain why low-spin 4d/5d rare metals are often more active than the abundant high-spin 3d materials for multi-electron transfer reactions in general, and provides new insight into how active 3d-metal catalysts can be synthesized by optimizing the energetics of both bond formation and charge accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aferric oxide 3airon 3amanganese 3amanganese dioxide 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production 3aspectroscopy1 aTakashima, Toshihiro1 aYamaguchi, Akira1 aHayashi, Tōru,1 aNakamura, Ryuhei0 tChemical communications.g2017 June 29, v. 53, no. 53 p.7149-7161dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7cc02204b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011300176300001600289520142600305536007101731592002801802650002201830650002201852650002801874650002501902650002001927650002001947650001601967650001501983650001901998650001302017650002402030650001402054650002302068650001702091650001302108650001402121773011602135856008602251852000902337655001202346IND60768578920221118061325.0220225e20220207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076857892DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2021.19242092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzuegbuna, Ogochukwu10aLeukemia Chemoprevention and Therapeutic Potentials: Selected Medicinal Plants with Anti-Leukemic Activities  ap. 437-449.  aHaematological malignancies account for more than one million cases of all cancers yearly worldwide. While survival has improved due to newer drugs used in their management, relapsed/refractory disease remains a challenge, and treatment modalities come with side effects and morbidities. The management of leukaemias with medicinal plants and their natural products remain a viable option. Numerous studies have shown the potentials and viability of medicinal plants and their natural products as good options against leukaemias. However many of these natural products face peculiar challenges such as low systemic bioavailability, hydrophobic nature and displayed toxicities when given at different pharmacologic doses, while the medicinal plants face the threat of extinction. The development of semi-synthetic analogues and better regulations have helped overcome some of these challenges. This review briefly analyzes four medicinal plants and their different natural products that are used traditionally in the management of cancers, and have been scientifically proven to have some form of activity against leukemia. These plants include Tanacetum parthenium, Garcinia hanburyi, Scutellaria baicalensis, and Combretum caffrum. This review discusses these medicinal plants and their natural products under the following headings: ethnobotany, phytochemistry, mechanism of action, antileukaemic activity and toxicity.  aThe researcher did not receive any external funding for this work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCombretum caffrum 3aGarcinia hanburyi 3aScutellaria baicalensis 3aTanacetum parthenium 3abioavailability 3achemoprevention 3aethnobotany 3aextinction 3ahydrophobicity 3aleukemia 3amechanism of action 3anutrition 3aplant biochemistry 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3aviability0 tNutrition and cancer.g2022 Feb. 7, v. 74, no. 2 p.437-449dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11654x1532-79147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2021.19242093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001200155245006100167520119600228592002801424650002101452650001301473650002301486650001601509650002201525650001501547650001401562650001001576650001801586650002501604650001401629650001701643653000901660653002301669653002001692653000901712653001101721700001401732700001301746700001301759700001701772700001601789700001201805773011201817856009001929852000902019655001202028IND60779830320221122102549.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077983032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2022.1070152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Ya10aExpression and hormone regulation of UCP2 in goat uterus  aPregnancy success is closely related to the molecular mechanisms that control energy metabolism balance. However, the mechanisms have not been fully understood. Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) plays a physiological role by regulating energy metabolism in numerous tissues. In this study, we determined the expression and hormone regulation of UCP2 in goat uterus. UCP2 is expressed in the luminal and glandular epithelia of goat uterus during early pregnancy, as revealed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry conducted on pregnant goats. The signals were detected from day 0 (D0) to D30 of pregnancy, though weak on D16 (the adhesion period). The low levels of UCP2 on D16 were confirmed by RT-qPCR and western blot. In goat uterus and endometrial epithelial cells (EECs), UCP2 was up-regulated by progesterone and estrogen. In addition, after goat EECs were treated with genipin (an inhibitor of UCP2), not only UCP2 expression but also cell proliferation was inhibited. Collectively, UCP2 is dynamically expressed in goat uterus and can affect EEC proliferation, suggesting that it may participate in regulating the energy metabolism balance of goat uterus during early pregnancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadhesion 3acell proliferation 3aendometrium 3aenergy metabolism 3aepithelium 3aestrogens 3agoats 3ahybridization 3aimmunohistochemistry 3apregnancy 3aprogesterone 0aUCP2 0aHormone regulation 0aEarly pregnancy 0aGoat 0aUterus1 aBu, Li-Ge1 aWang, Bo1 aRen, Jie1 aLi, Ting-Yue1 aKong, Li-Li1 aNi, Hua0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2022 Aug., v. 243 p.107015-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2022.1070153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245009400214300001600308520133300324592002801657650001201685650002001697650001701717650001701734650002001751650001901771650002901790653003301819653002601852653000901878653000901887700002001896700001901916773009701935856008502032852000902117655001202126IND60764022720221116141630.0220314e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076402272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.01.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukhtarov, Shahriyar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6248-612014aThe impact of financial development on renewable energy consumption: Evidence from Turkey  ap. 169-176.  aGlobal warming creates significant problems for people, such as severe droughts. One of the biggest causes of global warming is the preference of fossil fuels in energy production. Therefore, renewable energy projects should be increased to overcome this problem. However, there is a need for a new study that considers different indicators at the same time to understand the key issues for improving renewable energy projects. This study aims to evaluate the influence of financial development, economic growth, and energy prices on energy use. Within this framework, the VECM and ARDL techniques were employed to the data spanning from 1980 to 2019 for Turkey. The findings demonstrate that financial development has a positive and statistically significant influence on renewable energy consumption. According to the findings, a 1% increase in financial development leads to a 0.21% rise in renewable energy consumption. The main novelty of this study is to provide appropriate strategies for Turkey to increase renewable energy investments that contribute to sustainable social and economic development. Additionally, the analysis results of this study pave the way for other energy-importing countries. Thus, with the help of increasing renewable energy projects, it can be much easier to handle the global warming problem.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3aeconomic impact 3aenergy costs 3afossil fuels 3afuel production 3aglobal warming 3arenewable energy sources 0aRenewable energy investments 0aFinancial development 0aVECM 0aARDL1 aYüksel, Serhat1 aDinçer, Hasan0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Mar., v. 187 p.169-176dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.01.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245005900160300002000219520061000239592002800849650002400877650001400901650001500915650001400930650002200944650002000966650001300986650002000999650001901019650001801038700002101056773012401077856007401201852000901275655001201284IND60666921520221120040713.0190919e20141007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066692152DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra10317c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBritton, Joshua10aContinuous flow vortex fluidic production of biodiesel  ap. 49850-49854.  aA thin film vortex fluid device (VFD) is effective in the room temperature continuous flow conversion of sunflower oil to biodiesel.

Twenty-month-old rats were divided into 6 groups: a control group, 2 groups treated with l-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (25 or 100 mg/kg) for 63 days, 2 groups treated with L-NAME (25 or 100 mg/kg) for 63 days plus 2 months of exercise, and 1 group treated with exercise. Behavioral tests were conducted to determine the anxiolytic and memory-improving role of exercise and NOS inhibition. BDNF, P70S6K, and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were evaluated by Western blotting. Exercise and L-NAME (25 mg/kg) or their combination had an anxiolytic effect and improved spatial memory in old rats compared with the control or exercised group, respectively. Exercise and treatment with a low dose of L-NAME (25 mg/kg) each increased BDNF and P70S6K in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex compared with levels in control rats. In comparison with exercise alone, co-treatment with exercise and a low dose of L-NAME (25 mg/kg) also increased BDNF and P70S6K in the hippocampus. The neuronal level of cleaved caspase-3 was reduced in the L-NAME (25 mg/kg) + exercise group compared with the exercised group. The L-NAME (100 mg/kg) + exercise treatment had no positive behavioral or molecular effects compared with exercise alone. The protective role of NOS inhibition and aerobic exercise against aging is probably modulated via BDNF and P70S6K in the brain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aanxiety 3acaspase-3 3acognition 3aenzyme inhibition 3aexercise 3ahippocampus 3amemory 3aneurons 3anitric oxide synthase 3aprefrontal cortex 3aprotective effect 3aprotein content 3arats 3atranquilizers 0anitric oxide synthase inhibitor 0atreadmill running 0aanxiety 0aspatial memory 0aaging1 aKhodagholi, Fariba1 aZeinaddini Meymand, Arman1 aNourshahi, Maryam1 aAshabi, Ghorbangol0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2018, v. 43, no. 1 p.45-53dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2017-03133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245008500162300002000247520132000267592002801587650002201615650002201637650003801659650001301697650001801710650001901728650001101747650002001758650001501778650001601793650002101809650002201830650002101852650003701873650001601910700002001926700001901946773012401965856007402089852000902163655001202172IND60667201720221119224333.0190919e20150323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066720172DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15669b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValapa, Ravi Babu10aEffect of graphene content on the properties of poly(lactic acid) nanocomposites  ap. 28410-28423.  aIn the current work, the influence of temperature on the exfoliation of expandable graphite (EG) and its structural properties were investigated in detail. The EG exfoliated at 750 °C was subjected to sonication and further used as reinforcement material in the poly(lactic acid) (PLA) matrix to investigate the influence of “graphene” (GR) on the structural, morphological, thermal, optical, mechanical and oxygen barrier properties of PLA composites. X-ray diffraction results disclose the effect of sonication time on the dispersion ability of GR in the PLA matrix. A high resolution transmission electron microscopy image of GR demonstrates a monolayer structure of GR. Thermo-gravimetric analysis reveals that the Tₒₙₛₑₜ value for the PLA composite with 0.5 wt% GR content increases by 6 °C over neat PLA, when 10% weight loss is taken as a point of comparison. The increase in the thermal stability of PLA composites is also verified by an increase of activation energy (Eₐ) value evaluated by the Coats–Redfern method. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis confirms that GR acts as a nucleating agent that enhances the melting point of PLA composites over neat PLA. The enhancement of tensile strength (17%) and elongation at break (51%) is obtained for PLA composites over neat PLA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivation energy 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3agraphene 3amelting point 3ananocomposites 3aoxygen 3apolylactic acid 3asonication 3atemperature 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aweight loss1 aPugazhenthi, G.1 aKatiyar, Vimal0 tRSC advances.g2015 Mar. 23, v. 5, no. 36 p.28410-28423dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra15669b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245017700167520170000344592002802044650002202072650001702094650003002111650001802141650001402159650001602173650001502189651001002204653002102214653002302235653001302258700001802271700001402289700002102303700002002324700001702344700001302361700001802374773011802392856008702510852000902597655001202606IND60767750320221119075243.0220328e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076775032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2022.1046252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Fu-Jun12aA new gigantopterid taxon Paragigantopteris qingloongensis gen. et sp. nov. from the Permian (Wuchiapingian) of southwestern China: Taxonomic and biogeographic implications  aSince gigantopterids are an enigmatic group of plants as they are grouped by their megaphyllous leaves with distinctive reticulate venation, their systematic relationships between each other are also so far essentially unknown. Clarifying these confusions about gigantopterids requires new information provided by more detailed studies of previously described and/or new material. Variations in venation can provide clues to explore the taxonomic relationships and diversity of gigantopterid taxa, even leading to an improved understanding of their biogeography. Recently, a gigantopterid-bearing plant assemblage was discovered from the Wuchiapingian Lungtan Formation of Qinglong County, Guizhou, China; some of which having the diagnostic venation pattern of gigantopterids are recognized here as Paragigantopteris qingloongensis gen. et sp. nov. The new genus has basal actinodromous venation with three primary veins radiating from the petiolar insertion and double meshes formed by the tertiary and occasionally quaternary veins, distinctly different from other double-meshed gigantopterid genera. P. qingloongensis gen. et sp. nov. is characterized by its obovate, entire margined, simple leaves. Together with previous studies, the taxonomic and biogeographic implications of Paragigantopteris gen. nov. are discussed. Since the new genus is characterized by megaphyllous leaves with angiosperm-like reticulate venation while lacking sutural veins, it conforms to the more restricted concept proposed by Glasspool et al. (2004a). Besides, the occurrence of Paragigantopteris gen. nov. known from a single deposit and its absence elsewhere may indicate that it was an endemic, rare taxon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWuchiapingian age 3abiogeography 3ageographical distribution 3aleaf venation 3anew genus 3apaleobotany 3apalynology 3aChina 0aVenation pattern 0aTaxonomic position 0aEndemism1 aSun, Bai-Nian1 aLiu, Song1 aZhou, Guang-Hong1 aLing, Chen-Chen1 aHu, Xiao-Pan1 aHan, Dan1 aWang, Qiu-Jun0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2022 May, v. 300 p.104625-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11736x0034-66677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2022.1046253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01548naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245005600173300001600229520056000245592002800805650002200833650001100855650002500866653002300891653001400914653002200928653002300950700001800973700002300991773011101014856008801125852000901213655001201222IND60633953920221122134738.0190502e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063395392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2019.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeester, Ronald10aReply to Lucas & Henneberg: Are human faces unique?  ap. 217-220.  aThis paper offers a response to the 2015 article of Lucas and Henneberg “Are human faces unique?” (Forensic Sci.

In COVID-19 era, it is mandatory to face cancer with more organized & prompter response. Nutrition plays an important role in prevention & management of cancer patients. The objective of this study is to understand the role of nutrition in cancer patients during Corvid 19 era. We conducted literature searches till May 2020, electronic databases, evidence-based collections, relevant websites and trial registries about SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 and nutrition in cancer patients. Search generated 836 sources; 83/836 sources were relevant. This review summarized role of nutrition in predisposition, prevention and management of COVID-19 in cancer patient and role of vitamins, mineral supplements and microbiota in era of COVID-19. In this review, implementing appropriate nutritional care with vitamins or mineral supplementation & their effect on outcome remain largely unknown. COVID co-infection with cancer whether under chemotherapy or not have worse outcome especially in male adults. Findings may help in creating recommendations on nutritional protocol of management & prevention of complications during ongoing COVID-19 pandemic for all cancer patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aCorvidae 3aInternet 3acancer therapy 3adrug therapy 3aimmunity 3amales 3amicroorganisms 3amixed infection 3anutrition 3apatients 3aprotocols 3asystematic review1 aAhmed, Aliaa1 aHassanain, Omneya1 aEmad, Aya1 aEssameldin, Samer1 aRagai, Marianne1 aSaad, Yasmin0 tNutrition and cancer.g2022 Feb. 7, v. 74, no. 2 p.450-462dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11654x1532-79147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2021.19313633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03621naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002900155245008100184520170500265592002801970650001901998650002102017650001502038650001202053650001302065650001302078650001702091650001302108650001202121650000702133650002902140650002502169650001602194650000902210650001102219653001802230653002702248653003402275653002902309653001302338653001902351700002602370700003002396700003102426700003002457700003102487700003302518700003002551700002002581700002602601700003802627700002402665700003302689700003402722700002802756773011202784856009002896852000902986655001202995IND60779830620221122102609.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077983062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2022.1070182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrança, Thales de Souza10aPost-thaw dilution of Rhamdia quelen sperm improves the reproductive success  aThe aim was to evaluate the effect of a post-thaw dilution of Rhamdia quelen sperm in 1.1% NaCl (325 mOsm kg⁻¹; pH 7.6; 24 °C) solution on the quality and reproductive capacity. Sperm from eight males were cryopreservation in nitrogen vapor at − 170 °C for 18 h in 0.25 mL straws in a freezing medium containing 5% fructose, 5% Powdered milk, and 10% methanol. The samples were thawed and post-thaw diluted (1:20) in NaCl solution or not (control). The higher spermatozoa velocities were observed in the post-thaw diluted samples (curvilinear (VCL) - 69 ± 11 µm s⁻¹; average path (VAP) - 45 ± 8 µm s⁻¹; straight-line (VSL) - 43 ± 8 µm s⁻¹) compared to the control (VCL - 47 ± 10 µm s⁻¹; VAP - 31 ± 6 µm s⁻¹; VSL - 30 ± 6 µm s⁻¹). Greater straightness (STR), progression (PROG), and beat cross frequency (BCF) were observed in the post-thaw diluted samples (STR - 96 ± 7%; PROG - 666 ± 128 µm; BCF - 42 ± 2 Hz) than in control (STR - 95 ± 5%; PROG - 463 ± 92 µm; BCF - 40 ± 2 Hz). The strongly curled tail was the only morphology change that differ between the post-thaw diluted (5 ± 2%) and control (2 ± 1%). Membrane integrity, mitochondrial activity, and normal larvae rate were not different between treatments. Fertilization and hatching were higher in the post-thaw diluted sperm (93 ± 3%; 82 ± 9%) when compared to control samples (65 ± 13%; 55 ± 17%). Were used oocytes from one female, limiting these results. The post-thaw dilution improved the sperm kinetics and reproductive parameters. Thus, this methodology can be included in the sperm cryopreservation protocol for R. quelen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhamdia quelen 3acryopreservation 3adried milk 3afemales 3afructose 3amethanol 3amitochondria 3anitrogen 3aoocytes 3apH 3areproductive performance 3areproductive success 3aspermatozoa 3atail 3avapors 0aSperm quality 0aSperm cryopreservation 0aSouth American silver catfish 0aArtificial fertilization 0aHatching 0aSperm dilution1 aGomes, Itamar Cossina1 aSanches, Eduardo Antônio1 aAtehortúa, Maritza Pérez1 aTeixeira, Nathalia Santos1 aRodrigues, Rômulo Batista1 ade Freitas, Thaiza Rodrigues1 aGaluppo, Andrea Giannotti1 aQuirino, Monike1 aBenato, Jhony Lisbôa1 aMachado, Thales Lysakowski Flores1 aMarques, Lis Santos1 aBustamante-Filho, Ivan Cunha1 aBortolozzo, Fernando Pandolfo1 aStreit Jr, Danilo Pedro0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2022 Aug., v. 243 p.107018-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2022.1070183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245022900171520137900400592002801779650001801807650001501825650002201840650002001862650001901882650002001901650000901921650001901930650001201949650001201961650001001973650003001983650001502013650001002028650002402038650001602062650001502078650001002093651000902103653002102112653001202133653001902145653001402164700001502178700001802193773011802211856008702329852000902416655001202425IND60767750520221119075235.0220328e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076775052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2022.1046272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGee, Carole T.10aMultitrophic plant–insect–fungal interactions across 150 million years: A giant Agathoxylon tree, ancient wood-boring beetles and fungi from the Morrison Formation of NE Utah, and the brood of an extant orchard mason bee  aAlthough plant–insect interactions can be traced back to the Silurian, little is known from Upper Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous ecosystems. In the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation, evidence is limited to insect body fossils and trace fossils in mostly wood. However, until now, multitrophic interactions have not been reported from the Morrison Formation. Here we describe a complex web of interrelationships between an ancient tree, fungi, and wood-boring insect from the Morrison Formation with an extant bee in NE Utah, USA, using microscopy, thin sectioning, and microCT for non-destructive internal imaging. The tree is Agathoxylon hoodii (Araucariaceae), one of the largest individuals in a monospecific forest, whose trunk was infected and decayed by white rot while the tree was alive during the Jurassic. Fungal formation of voids in the wood facilitated the boring of large-diameter galleries by an insect, likely a beetle. One gallery was repurposed by a modern orchard mason bee, Osmia lignaria, as a linear nest for her brood. The fossil wood specimen was serendipitously collected with two bee larvae plus food provisions in cocoons in the lowermost two chambers. Thus, this example is not only a simple interaction between fossil plants and insects, but transcends 150 million years between the ancient tree–insect–fungal relationship and a living insect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraucariaceae 3aColeoptera 3aCretaceous period 3aJurassic period 3aOsmia lignaria 3aSilurian period 3abees 3aboring insects 3aforests 3afossils 3afungi 3amicro-computed tomography 3amicroscopy 3anests 3aold and fossil wood 3apaleobotany 3apalynology 3atrees 3aUtah 0aBlue orchard bee 0aMicroCT 0aUpper Jurassic 0aXylophagy1 aXie, Aowei1 aZajonz, Jonas0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2022 May, v. 300 p.104627-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11736x0034-66677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2022.1046273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245011200179300001400291520101000305592002801315650000801343650001501351650002501366650001501391650001101406650002901417650001501446650001601461650004301477650000901520650002501529650002701554650001001581653001201591653004301603653002901646653001601675653001801691653002901709700001801738700002601756700006301782773009701845856008601942852000902028655001202037IND60635610320221119064949.0190402e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063561032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.12.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzam, Nura Fazira Noor10aMeat species identification using DNA-luminol interaction and their slow diffusion onto the biochip surface  ap. 29-36.  aRecently, there has been a growing concern of consumers on the authenticity of food ingredients including adulteration with porcine and/or its derivatives. Therefore, this work reports on the development of a novel, simple, sensitive and rapid luminol-based electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technique for Sus scrofa (Porcine) DNA detection. Porcine DNA was firstly amplified using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method and subsequently added to luminol solution for further ECL analysis for quantification. The DNA-luminol complexes were formed causing the diffusion of luminol towards the electrode surface to be slowed down and hindered that resulted in low luminol intensity. The LAMP-ECL sensor is shown to be highly specific, sensitive (≥0.1 pg/μL) and rapid (∼5 min for detection). Hence, by employing this principle with carbon screen-printed electrode (SPE), this technique has a potential to be developed further into a compact biosensor for the verifying food authenticity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aSus scrofa 3aadulterated products 3abiosensors 3acarbon 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectrodes 3aingredients 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3ameat 3aproduct authenticity 3aspecies identification 3aswine 0aLuminol 0aLoop-mediated isothermal amplification 0aElectrochemiluminescence 0aPorcine DNA 0aDNA detection 0aScreen-printed electrode1 aRoy, Sharmili1 aLim, Syazana Abdullah1 aUddin Ahmed, Minhaz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8267-85060 tFood chemistry.g2018 May 15, v. 248 p.29-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.12.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011900154300002000273520166200293592002801955650001201983650002501995650001102020650002802031650002102059650001502080650002102095650002202116650000902138650001602147650001402163650001802177650001502195650000702210650001802217650001502235650001602250700001302266700001602279700001402295700001702309700001702326700001902343773012402362856007402486852000902560655001202569IND60667202120221119224249.0190919e20150114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066720212DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15675g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ke12aA simple route to CoFe₂O₄ nanoparticles with shape and size control and their tunable peroxidase-like activity  ap. 10632-10640.  aRecent studies have suggested that the physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles (NPs) strongly depend on local chemical composition, size, and shape. Here, we report a new precursor-mediated growth of monodisperse magnetic cobalt ferrite (CoFe₂O₄) NPs with controlled size and shape. CoFe₂O₄ NPs with near corner-grown cubic, near cubic and polyhedron shape can be successfully prepared by simply tuning the amount of iron and cobalt acetylacetonates in oleic acid. Interestingly, the product shape varies from near corner-grown cubic to starlike by only changing the reaction temperature from 320 °C to 330 °C. These CoFe₂O₄ NPs exhibit size and shape-dependent peroxidase-like activity towards 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzdine (TMB) in the presence of H₂O₂, and thus exhibited different levels of peroxidase-like activities, in the order of spherical > near corner-grown cubic > starlike > near cubic > polyhedron; this order was closely related to their particle size and crystal morphology. CoFe₂O₄NPs exhibited high stability in HAc–NaAc buffer (pH = 4.0) and high activity over a broad pH (2.5–6.0). Furthermore, the Michaelis constants Kₘ value for the CoFe₂O₄ NPs (0.006 mM) with TMB as the substrate was lower than HRP (0.062 mM) and Fe₃O₄ NPs (0.010 mM). After further surface functionalization with folic acid (FA), the folate-conjugated CoFe₂O₄ nanoparticles allow discrimination of HeLa cells (folate receptor overexpression) from NIH-3T3 cells (without folate receptor expression). Such investigation is of great significance for peroxidase nanomimetics with enhanced activity and utilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffers 3achemical composition 3acobalt 3aferrimagnetic materials 3afolate receptors 3afolic acid 3ahuman cell lines 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3ananoparticles 3aoleic acid 3apH 3aparticle size 3aperoxidase 3atemperature1 aZuo, Wei1 aWang, Zhiyi1 aLiu, Jian1 aLi, Tianrong1 aWang, Baodui1 aYang, Zhengyin0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 14, v. 5, no. 14 p.10632-10640dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra15675g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245012000183520107400303592002801377650001801405650001501423650002001438650001301458650002701471650001201498650001101510650001601521650002101537650002101558650001201579650001601591650001501607650001401622651001301636653001001649653001901659653003401678653001801712653001701730700002501747700002101772700002601793773011801819856008701937852000902024655001202033IND60767750720221119075325.0220328e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076775072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2022.1046302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiraldo López, Alejandro,10aAncient trouble in paradise: Seed beetle predation on coconuts from middle–late Paleocene rainforests of Colombia  aModern Neotropical rainforests are characterized by the high intensity and host specificity with which insects feed on plants. Previous studies have shown that, during the middle–late Paleocene, the leaves of the early evolving Neotropical rainforests of tropical South America were heavily herbivorized by insects. Yet, less attention has been given to insect damage found on fossil fruits and seeds, despite the host specialization of many disseminule predators in modern forests. Here, we present and describe borings found on a fruit compression fossil of cf. Cocos (coconut) from the middle–late Paleocene Cerrejón Formation (58–60 Ma) of Colombia. We interpret the borings as constructed by palm seed beetles (Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae: Pachymerina) based on size, number, position, plant reaction tissue, and plant host selection. This occurrence provides the earliest record of an ecological interaction between seed beetles and palms, suggesting that this host-specific interaction has been consistently maintained for several tens of millions of years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysomelidae 3aNeotropics 3aPaleocene epoch 3acoconuts 3aecological competition 3afossils 3afruits 3ahost plants 3ahost preferences 3ahost specificity 3ainsects 3apaleobotany 3apalynology 3apredation 3aColombia 0aCocos 0aSeed predation 0aHost-specialized interactions 0aFossil fruits 0aPaleoecology1 aCarvalho, Mónica R.1 aHerrera, Fabiany1 aLabandeira, Conrad C.0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2022 May, v. 300 p.104630-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11736x0034-66677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2022.1046303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01614naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014600155300002000301520057100321592002800892650001400920650002600934650002100960650002400981650001801005650001101023650001501034700001601049700001601065773012401081856007401205852000901279655001201288IND60667202220221119224058.0190919e20150113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066720222DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra15680c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Tian10aMetal–organic framework-derived nickel phosphides as efficient electrocatalysts toward sustainable hydrogen generation from water splitting  ap. 10290-10295.  aDeveloping robust earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an ongoing scientific challenge.

However, in recent years, bisphenol analogs such as bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) are replacing BPA in the production of some consumer products. Because human exposure to these alternative bisphenols may occur, biomonitoring of these bisphenol analogs is warranted. In the present study, we developed and validated a sensitive and selective method that uses on-line solid phase extraction coupled to high performance liquid chromatography-isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry with peak focusing to measure BPA, BPF, BPS, and 11 other environmental phenols in urine. The method required a small amount of sample (100μL) and minimal sample pretreatment. The limits of detection were 0.03ng/mL (BPS), 0.06ng/mL (BPF), 0.10ng/mL (BPA), and ranged from 0.1ng/mL to 1.0ng/mL for the other 11 phenols. In 100 urine samples collected in 2009–2012 from a convenience group of anonymous adults in the United States, of the three bisphenols, we detected BPA at the highest frequency and median concentrations (95%, 0.72ng/mL), followed by BPS (78%, 0.13ng/mL) and BPF (55%, 0.08ng/mL). This sensitive, rugged, and labor and cost-effective method could be used for the analysis of large number of samples for epidemiologic studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abisphenol A 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3aepidemiological studies 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aisotope dilution technique 3asolid phase extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine 3aUnited States 0aCDC 0aBPA 0aBPF 0aBPS 0aHPLC 0aLOD 0aOn line-SPE 0aQC 0aQCH 0aQCL 0aQCM 0aRAM 0aRSD 0aBisphenol A 0aBisphenol F 0aBisphenol S 0aExposure 0aHPLC–MS/MS 0aUrine1 aKramer, Joshua P.1 aCalafat, Antonia M.1 aYe, Xiaoyun0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 944 p.152-156dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2013.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03748naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245010800186300001400294520172200308592002802030650001202058650001002070650001402080650002302094650001802117650001802135650001202153650001702165650003402182650002102216650000902237650001302246650001702259650001202276650003702288650002802325650008902353650002002442650005102462650002402513650007402537650006002611650004402671650000902715650003802724650001702762650002202779700002102801700002302822700001802845700001502863700001902878773010902897856008403006990002303090852000903113655001203122IND60097843220221118040837.0141104e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009784322DNAL7 a221731272pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.11.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNa, Hyo-Seok10a17β-Estradiol attenuates the activity of the glutamate transporter type 3 expressed in Xenopus oocytes  ap. 20-25.  aEstrogen, a neuroactive sex hormone in the brain, enhances neuronal excitability and increases seizures. Glutamate transporters help in limiting the excitatory neurotransmission by uptaking glutamate from the synapses. We investigated the effects of 17β-estradiol on the activity of a glutamate transporter, excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3), in Xenopus oocytes. EAAT3 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injection of rat EAAT3 mRNA. l-Glutamate (30μM)-induced membrane currents mediated by EAAT3 were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. 17β-Estradiol reduced EAAT3 activity in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. 17β-Estradiol (10nM for 72h) significantly decreased Vₘₐₓ but had no effect on Kₘ of EAAT3 for glutamate. When 17β-estradiol treated oocytes were incubated with phorbol-12-myrisate-13-acetate, a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, 17β-estradiol-induced decrease in EAAT3 activity was abolished. Furthermore, in pretreatment of oocytes with chelerythrine or staurosporine, two PKC inhibitors, EAAT3 activity was significantly decreased. However, there was no statistical difference among the 17β-estradiol, PKC inhibitor, or 17β-estradiol plus PKC inhibitor groups. Likewise, wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, significantly reduced basal EAAT3 activity, but the activity did not differ among the 17β-estradiol, wortmannin, or 17β-estradiol plus wortmannin groups. Estradiol receptor inhibitor, fulvestrant, did not change the reduced EAAT3 activity by 17β-estradiol. Our results suggest that 17β-estradiol decreases EAAT3 activity. PKC and PI3K seem to be involved in this effect, possibly not via estradiol receptors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXenopus 3abrain 3aestradiol 3aestrogen receptors 3aglutamic acid 3amessenger RNA 3aoocytes 3apharmacology 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aprotein kinase C 3arats 3aseizures 3atransporters 2aAnimals 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEstradiolxpharmacology 2aExcitatory Amino Acid Transporter 3xantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aIntracellular Spacexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aOocytesxmetabolism 2aPhosphatidylinositol 3-Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Kinase Cxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Kinase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 2aTime Factors 2aXenopusxgenetics1 aPark, Hee-Pyeong1 aKim, Chŏng-sŭng,1 aDo, Sang-Hwan1 aZuo, Zhiyi1 aKim, Chong-Soo0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 676, no. 1-3 p.20-25dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.11.0473Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011600170300001600286520154600302592002801848650001101876650002501887650001201912650001801924650002401942650002501966650001701991650001102008653003002019653003702049653001402086653001902100653002402119653002102143700001302164700001702177700001802194700005502212773011502267856008702382852000902469655001202478IND60633647120221120081214.0190516e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063364712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.03.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhaoshu10aDesign, fabrication and thermal performance of a novel ultra-thin vapour chamber for cooling electronic devices  ap. 221-231.  aIn this work, a novel vapour-liquid channel-separated ultra-thin (0.4-mm-thick) vapour chamber fabricated via etching and diffusion bonding was designed for cooling electronic devices. The heat performance of ultra-thin vapour chamber was tested under five states, and micropillar arrays were etched into the chamber to study their effect on heat transfer. Additionally, infrared thermal imaging was performed to investigate the heat dissipation of cooling modules with and without the ultra-thin vapour chamber. The maximum heat transfer capacity of the ultra-thin vapour chamber in the horizontal state was 4.50 W, and the temperature difference was 4.75 °C. The experimentally measured values were very close to the theoretical capillary limit. Under normal and reverse gravities, the maximum heat transfer capacity changed by less than 11%. The effective thermal conductivity of the ultra-thin vapour chamber was 12000 W/(m·K), which is 30 times higher than that of pure copper. The cooling module with the ultra-thin vapour chamber exhibited better heat dissipation, thermal uniformity and thermal response properties. When the heating input power was 6 W, the heating block temperature, maximum surface temperature difference and equilibrium time of the cooling module with the ultra-thin vapour chamber were 8%, 54% and 32% lower, respectively, than those of the module without the ultra-thin vapour chamber. The proposed cooling solution is promising for heat dissipation problems in high-power portable electronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3aelectronic equipment 3agravity 3aheat transfer 3asurface temperature 3athermal conductivity 3athermography 3avapors 0aUltra-thin vapour chamber 0aVapour-liquid channel separation 0aMesh wick 0aCooling module 0aThermal performance 0aHeat dissipation1 aLi, Yong1 aZhou, Wenjie1 aDeng, Liqiang1 aYan, Yuying1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8603-43720 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 May 01, v. 187 p.221-231dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.03.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245008300178520103000261592002801291650002701319650002501346650002001371650002001391650001801411650001801429650001201447650002401459650001401483650001401497650001701511650001601528653003401544653002301578653002001601700002401621700002201645773009701667856009001764852000901854655001201863IND60791495820221119062558.0220914e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079149582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1066652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNogrado, Kathyleen10aAntimicrobial peptides: On future antiprotozoal and anthelminthic applications  aControl and elimination of parasitic diseases are nowadays further complicated by emergence of drug resistance. Drug resistance is a serious threat as there are not many effective antiparasitic drugs available. Aside from drug resistance, it is also favorable to look for alternative therapeutics that have lesser adverse effects. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were found to address these issues. Some of its desirable traits are they are fast-acting, it has broad action that the pathogen will have difficulty developing resistance to, it has high specificity, and most importantly there are extensive sources such as bacteria; invertebrate and vertebrate animals as well as plants. Aside from this, AMPs are also found to modulate the immune response. This review would like to describe AMPs that have been studied for their antiparasitic activities especially on parasitic diseases that causes high mortality and exhibits drug resistance like malaria and leishmaniasis and to discuss the mechanism of action of these AMPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantiparasitic agents 3adrug resistance 3aimmune response 3ainvertebrates 3aleishmaniasis 3amalaria 3amechanism of action 3amortality 3apathogens 3atherapeutics 3avertebrates 0aAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 0aParasitic diseases 0aDrug resistance1 aAdisakwattana, Poom1 aReamtong, Onrapak0 tActa tropica.g2022 Nov., v. 235 p.106665-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2022.1066653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245016600177520150600343592002801849650001501877650001501892650001301907650001401920650001301934650001101947650002501958650001101983650002101994650001902015650000702034650001402041650001502055650002002070650001102090650001102101650001302112650001502125653002402140653002102164653003002185653002802215653001502243700002502258700005902283773009102342856009002433852000902523655001202532IND60685130720221120181639.0200516e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068513072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1263092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabatabaei, Shiva10aSemicontinuous enhanced electroreduction of Cr(VI) in wastewater by cathode constructed of copper rods coated with palladium nanoparticles followed by adsorption  aConventional techniques used for reduction of Cr(VI) in wastewater product great amounts of metal sludge due to the use of reducing chemicals. Since in electrochemical process, the reducing agent is the electron, so the main advantage of this method is its adaptability to the environment. The aim of the current study is to reduce Cr(VI) from electroplating wastewater by the electrochemical method and to adsorb Cr(III) by cellulose sulfate adsorbent. Furthermore, to enhance the reduction efficiency of Cr(VI), the cathode was modified with Pd nanoparticles. In the present study, recovery in the electrochemical column was conducted continuously and semi-continuously. In addition, the effect of pH, amperage, flow rate, and initial concentration of Cr(VI) was investigated. To remove Cr(III) from the wastewater, the cellulose sulfate adsorbent was provided from modification of cotton health wastes. The highest recovery rate (99.63%) was witnessed at pH = 1.5, 1 A amperage, flow rate of 4.24 mL min⁻¹, and initial concentration of 50 mg L⁻¹. The sewage was removed from the system after several consecutive cycles and during 20–55 min reached recovery efficiency of 99.99%. Based on the results, pH had the highest effect on the process. The optimum removal percentage was 85.74% occurred at a pH of 5.6, chromium concentration of 150 mg L⁻¹, and adsorbent concentration of 400 mg L⁻¹. The removal rate of the pollutant was 97.32%, done by cellulose sulfate adsorbent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acathodes 3acellulose 3achromium 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3acotton 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectroplating 3apH 3apalladium 3apollutants 3areducing agents 3asewage 3asludge 3asulfates 3awastewater 0aHexavalent chromium 0aElectroreduction 0aElectroplating wastewater 0aPalladium nanoparticles 0aAdsorption1 aForouzesh Rad, Bahar1 aBaghdadi, Majid1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9816-764X0 tChemosphere.g2020 July, v. 251 p.126309-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1263093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009400169500002200263520141400285592002801699650002601727650001601753650001701769650001501786650001101801650001101812653003201823653003001855653002501885653001901910653006001929700001801989700001502007700001502022700001702037773010902054856005202163852000902215655001202224IND60795487620221121220654.0221004e20220930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079548762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1301162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jinping10aEvaluation of FEAST for Metagenomics-based Source Tracking of Antibiotic Resistance Genes  aPre-press version  aA metagenomics-based technological framework has been proposed for evaluating the potential and utility of FEAST as an ARG profile-based source apportionment tool. To this end, a large panel of metagenomic data sets was analyzed, associating with eight source types of ARGs in environments. Totally, 1089 different ARGs were found in the 604 source metagenomes, and 396 ARG indicators were identified as the source-specific fingerprints to characterize each of the source types. With the source fingerprints, predictive performance of FEAST was checked using "leave-one-out" cross-validation strategy. Furthermore, artificial sink communities were simulated to evaluate the FEAST for source apportionment of ARGs. The prediction of FEAST showed high accuracy values (0.933±0.046) and specificity values (0.959±0.041), confirming its suitability to discriminate samples from different source types. The apportionment results reflected well the expected output of artificial communities which were generated with different ratios of source types to simulate various contamination levels. Finally, the validated FEAST was applied to track the sources of ARGs in river sediments. Results showed STP effluents were the main contributor of ARGs, with an average contribution of 76%, followed by sludge (10%) and aquaculture effluent (2.7%), which were basically consistent with the actual environment in the area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aaquaculture 3ametagenomics 3aprediction 3arivers 3asludge 0aAntibiotic resistance genes 0aMicrobial source tracking 0aMetagenomic analysis 0aRiver sediment 0aFast expectation-maximization microbial source tracking1 aChen, Haiyang1 aLiu, Chang1 aHuan, Huan1 aTeng, Yanguo0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Sept. 30,  p.130116-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.130116  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245008900205300002000294506007600314520109700390592002801487506003701515650001901552650003501571650001801606700001901624700002301643700001701666700002401683700001501707700001401722700001301736700001801749700002401767700001801791700002301809700002401832700002001856700002501876773017601901856007902077852000902156655001202165IND60173563520221207084404.0150603e20121211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017356352DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12180521092doi7 aPMC35286032pmcid7 a231696712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevi, Benjamin10aIn vivo directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells for skeletal regeneration  ap. 20379-20384.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPluripotent cells represent a powerful tool for tissue regeneration, but their clinical utility is limited by their propensity to form teratomas. Little is known about their interaction with the surrounding niche following implantation and how this may be applied to promote survival and functional engraftment. In this study, we evaluated the ability of an osteogenic microniche consisting of a hydroxyapatite-coated, bone morphogenetic protein-2–releasing poly- l -lactic acid scaffold placed within the context of a macroenvironmental skeletal defect to guide in vivo differentiation of both embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. In this setting, we found de novo bone formation and participation by implanted cells in skeletal regeneration without the formation of a teratoma. This finding suggests that local cues from both the implanted scaffold/cell micro- and surrounding macroniche may act in concert to promote cellular survival and the in vivo acquisition of a terminal cell fate, thereby allowing for functional engraftment of pluripotent cells into regenerating tissue.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abone formation 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3atissue repair1 aHyun, Jeong S.1 aMontoro, Daniel T.1 aLo, David D.1 aChan, Charles K.

The lack of suitable in vivo models makes HCV–ethanol studies very difficult. Here, we examine whether chimeric SCID Alb-uPA mice transplanted with human hepatocytes and infected with HCV develop worsening pathology when fed ethanol. After 5weeks of feeding, such mice fed chow+water (control) or chow+20% ethanol in water (EtOH) diets mice developed oxidative stress, decreased proteasome activity and increased steatosis. Importantly, HCV+ mice in the control group cleared HCV RNA after 5weeks, while the infection persisted in EtOH-fed mice at the same or even higher levels compared with pre-feeding HCV RNA. We conclude that in chimeric SCID Alb-uPA mice, EtOH exposure causes the complex biochemical and histological changes typical for alcoholic liver injury. In addition, ethanol feeding delays the clearance of HCV RNA thereby generating persistent infection and promoting liver injury. Overall, this model is appropriate for conducting HCV–ethanol studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aalcohol drinking 3aanimal models 3achimerism 3achronic diseases 3adiet 3aethanol 3ahepatitis C 3ahepatocytes 3ahumans 3aliver 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3asevere combined immunodeficiency 0aHCV 0aEtOH 0aALT 0aTBARS 0aproteasome ChT-like activity 0aPCR 0aSCID Alb-uPA mice 0aHepatitis C virus 0aAlcohol 0aOxidative stress 0aProteasome activity1 aKharbanda, Kusum K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7759-88891 aSun, Yimin1 aSimpson, Ronda L.1 aPoluektova, Larisa E.1 aGanesan, Murali1 aWisecarver, James L.1 aMercer, David F.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 July 18, v. 450 p.773-776dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.06.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010700173500002200280520161800302592002801920650001201948650001301960650001901973650001701992650001202009650001802021650001402039650001902053650001102072653002202083653002802105653001602133653002202149653002102171700002302192700002002215700002402235773010802259856005202367852000902419655001202428IND60795487720221121182517.0221004e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079548772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1301172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivers-Auty, Jack14aThe one-two punch of plastic exposure: macro- and micro-plastics induce multi-organ damage in seabirds  aPre-press version  aPlastic pollution in the world’s oceans is ubiquitous and increasing. The environment is inundated with microplastics (<1mm), and the health effects of these less conspicuous pollutants is poorly known. In addition, there is now evidence that macroplastics can release microplastics in the form of shedding or digestive fragmentation, meaning there is potential for macroplastic exposure to induce direct and indirect pathology through microplastics. Therefore, there is an urgent need for data from wild populations on the relationship between macro- and microplastic exposure and the potential compounding pathological effects of these forms of plastics. We investigated the presence and impact of microplastics in multiple tissues from Flesh-footed Shearwaters Ardenna carneipes, a species that ingests considerable quantities of plastics, and used histopathological techniques to measure physiological responses and inflammation from the plastics. All organs examined (kidney, spleen, proventriculus) had embedded microplastic particles and this correlated with macroplastic exposure. Considerable tissue damage was recorded, including a significant reduction in tubular glands and rugae in the proventriculus, and evidence of inflammation, fibrosis, and loss of organ structures in the kidney and spleen. This indicates macroplastics can induce damage directly at the site of exposure, while microplastics can be mobilised throughout the body causing widespread pathology. Collectively, these results indicate the scope and severity of the health impacts of plastic pollution may be grossly underestimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArdenna 3afibrosis 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3akidneys 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3aproventriculus 3aspleen 0aArdenna carneipes 0aFlesh-footed Shearwater 0ananoplastic 0aplastic pollution 0atissue pathology1 aBond, Alexander L.1 aGrant, Megan L.1 aLavers, Jennifer L.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Oct. 01,  p.130117-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.130117  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245010600161300001800267500001500285520178200300592002802082650002302110650001302133650001902146650001902165650001502184650001702199650001202216650001002228650001902238650002102257650001702278650001602295650002402311650002002335650000902355650001502364650003702379653001402416653000902430653000802439653002502447653000902472653002202481700001902503700001902522700001902541700001802560700002002578700001902598700001702617700001802634700001902652773011302671856007902784852000902863655001202872IND60515061020221120112215.0160312e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051506102DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2015.34752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Min Sun10aEssential Oils from the Medicinal Herbs Upregulate Dopamine Transporter in Rat Pheochromocytoma Cells  ap. 1112-1120.  a2019-12-06  aThe dopamine transporter (DAT) protein, a component of the dopamine system, undergoes adaptive neurobiological changes from drug abuse. Prevention of relapse and reduction of withdrawal symptoms are still the major limitations in the current pharmacological treatments of drug addiction. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of essential oils extracted from Elsholtzia ciliata, Shinchim, Angelicae gigantis Radix, and Eugenia caryophyllata, well-known traditional Korean medicines for addiction, on the modulation of dopamine system in amphetamine-treated cells and to explore the possible mechanism underlying its therapeutic effect. The potential cytotoxic effect of essential oils was evaluated in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells using cell viability assays. Quantification of DAT, p-CREB, p-MAPK, and p-Akt was done by immunoblotting. DAT was significantly reduced in cells treated with 50 μM of amphetamine in a time-dependent manner. No significant toxicity of essential oils from Elsholtzia ciliata and Shinchim was observed at doses of 10, 25, and 50 μg/mL. However, essential oils from A. gigantis Radix at a dose of 100 μg/mL and E. caryophyllata at doses of 50 and 100 μg/mL showed cytotoxicity. Treatment with GBR 12909, a highly selective DAT inhibitor, significantly increased DAT expression compared with that of amphetamine only by enhancing phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and Akt. In addition, essential oils effectively induced hyperphosphorylation of cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), MAPK, and Akt, which resulted in DAT upregulation. Our study implies that the essential oils may rehabilitate brain dopamine function through increased DAT availability in abstinent former drug users.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElsholtzia ciliata 3adopamine 3aimmunoblotting 3acell viability 3acyclic AMP 3acytotoxicity 3arelapse 3abrain 3aessential oils 3amedicinal plants 3atherapeutics 3aamphetamine 3aSyzygium aromaticum 3aphosphorylation 3arats 3adrug abuse 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 0aaddiction 0aCREB 0aAkt 0adopamine transporter 0aMAPK 0aElsholtzia cilata1 aChoi, Bang-sub1 aKim, Sang Heon1 aPak, Sok Cheon1 aJang, Chul Ho1 aChin, Young-Won1 aKim, Young Mi,1 aKim, Dong-il1 aJeon, Songhee1 aKoo, Byung-Soo0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 18, no. 10 p.1112-1120dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-76007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fjmf.2015.34753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01952naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245017000152300001800322520067800340592002801018650002401046650001101070650002601081650001701107650002401124650001601148650001401164650001401178650001401192700001501206700001601221700001401237700001701251700001701268700001901285700001601304773013901320856007401459852000901533655001201542IND60618514120221119161922.0181030e20180123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061851412DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta09939h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, You10aLow-ruthenium-content NiRu nanoalloys encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon as highly efficient and pH-universal electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction  ap. 1376-1381.  aRational design and synthesis of low-cost and robust electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical for the development of water electrolysis technology.

If there is sufficient knowledge on the underlying causal structure then existing confounder selection criteria can be used to select subsets of the observed pretreatment covariates, X, sufficient for unconfoundedness, if such subsets exist. Here, estimation of these target subsets is considered when the underlying causal structure is unknown. The proposed method is to model the causal structure by a probabilistic graphical model, for example, a Markov or Bayesian network, estimate this graph from observed data and select the target subsets given the estimated graph. The approach is evaluated by simulation both in a high‐dimensional setting where unconfoundedness holds given X and in a setting where unconfoundedness only holds given subsets of X. Several common target subsets are investigated and the selected subsets are compared with respect to accuracy in estimating the average causal effect. The proposed method is implemented with existing software that can easily handle high‐dimensional data, in terms of large samples and large number of covariates. The results from the simulation study show that, if unconfoundedness holds given X, this approach is very successful in selecting the target subsets, outperforming alternative approaches based on random forests and LASSO, and that the subset estimating the target subset containing all causes of outcome yields smallest MSE in the average causal effect estimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3abiometry 3acomputer software 3amodels 3aselection criteria0 tBiometrics.g2018 June, v. 74, no. 2 p.389-398dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16956x0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/biom.127883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245017500166500002200341520142300363592002801786650002501814650002501839650001701864650001501881650001701896650002701913650002301940650002001963650003101983650001802014650002002032650002302052650003702075650001502112650001302127653003302140653002202173653001702195653002702212700001702239700001602256700001702272700001802289700001702307773010802324856005202432852000902484655001202493IND60795487820221121182512.0221004e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079548782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1301182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBan, Yihui10aTranscriptome Analysis Reveals the Molecular Mechanisms of Phragmites australis Tolerance to CuO-nanoparticles and/or Flood Stress Induced by Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi  aPre-press version  aThe molecular mechanism of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) for the purification of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO-NPs) contaminated wastewater remains unclear. In this study, transcriptome analysis was used to explore the effect of AMF inoculation on the gene expression profile of Phragmites australis roots under different concentrations of CuO-NPs and/or flood stress. 551, 429 and 2281 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were specially regulated by AMF under combined stresses of CuO-NPs and flood, single CuO-NPs stress and single flood stress, respectively. Based on the results of DEG function annotation and enrichment analyses, AMF inoculation under CuO-NPs and/or flood stress up-regulated the expression of a number of genes involved in antioxidant defense systems, cell wall biosynthesis and transporter protein, which may contribute to plant tolerance. The expression of 30 transcription factors (TFs) was up-regulated by AMF inoculation under combined stresses of CuO-NPs and flood, and 44 and 44 TFs were up-regulated under single CuO-NPs or flood condition, respectively, which may contribute to the alleviating effect of symbiosis on CuO-NPs and/or flood stress. These results provided a theoretical basis for enhancing the ecological restoration function of wetland plants for metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) by mycorrhizal technology in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3aantioxidant activity 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3acupric oxide 3aecological restoration 3aflooded conditions 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ananoparticles 3atranscriptomics 3atransport proteins 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awastewater 3awetlands 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0aCuO nanoparticles 0aFlood stress 0aTranscriptome analysis1 aTan, Jiayuan1 aXiong, Yang1 aMo, Xiantong1 aJiang, Yinghe1 aXu, Zhouying0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Oct. 01,  p.130118-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.130118  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013300166520142300299592002801722650001601750650002501766650001201791650001901803650002201822650001601844650002001860650002201880650002101902650001101923650002401934650001001958650002801968650001601996651001002012700001902022700001702041700001302058700001702071700002102088700001202109773013302121856008402254852000902338655001202347IND60790784920221119144142.0220826e20220724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079078492DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120810892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Xiaopei 10aModeling Adaptive Strategies on Maintaining Wheat-Corn Production and Reducing Net Greenhouse Gas Emissions under Climate Change  aClimate change has posed serious challenges to food production and sustainable development. We evaluated crop yields, N₂O emissions, and soil organic carbon (SOC) in a typical wheat–corn rotation system field on the North China Plain on a 50-year scale using the Denitrification–Decomposition (DNDC) model and proposed adaptive strategies for each climate scenarios. The study showed a good consistency between observations and simulations (R² > 0.95 and nRMSE < 30%). Among the twelve climate scenarios, we explored ten management practices under four climate scenarios (3 °C temperature change: P/T−3 and P/T+3; 30% precipitation change: 0.7P/T and 1.3P/T), which have a significant impact on crop yields and the net greenhouse effect. The results revealed that changing the crop planting time (CP) and using cold-resistant (CR) varieties could reduce the net greenhouse effect by more than 1/4 without sacrificing crop yields under P/T−3. Straw return (SR) minimized the negative impact on yields and the environment under P/T+3. Fertigation (FG) and Drought-Resistant (DR) varieties reduced the net greenhouse effect by more than 8.34% and maintained yields under 0.7P/T. SR was most beneficial to carbon sequestration, and yields were increased by 3.87% under 1.3P/T. Multiple adaptive strategies should be implemented to balance yields and reduce the environmental burden under future climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought tolerance 3afertigation 3afood production 3agreenhouse effect 3agreenhouse gases 3amodels 3asoil organic carbon 3astraw 3asustainable development 3atemperature 3aChina1 aChang, Naijie 1 aDing, Wuhan 1 aXu, Chi 1 aZhang, Jing 1 aZhang, Jianfeng 1 aLi, Hu 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 July 24, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120810893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245009000153300001800243520127800261592002801539650002201567650001301589650001101602650001601613650000901629650002101638650002501659650000801684650001301692700001701705700001701722700001601739773013801755856007401893852000901967655001201976IND60618514220221119161816.0181030e20180206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061851422DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta09941j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shan10aRecent progress towards high performance of tin chalcogenide thermoelectric materials  ap. 2432-2448.  aThermoelectric materials have been extensively studied for decades to help resolve the global energy shortage and environmental problems. Many efforts have been focused on the improvement of the figure of merit (ZT) for highly efficient power generation. Lead telluride is one of the materials with high ZT, but lead toxicity is always a concern, which has inspired research on lead-free tin chalcogenides. ZT values as high as ∼2.6 at 923 K for SnSe single crystals and ∼1.6 at 923 K for Sn₀.₈₆Mn₀.₁₄Te(Cu₂Te)₀.₀₅-5 atm% Sn were recently reported, attracting extensive attention for potential applications. In this review, we present the progress in SnTe, SnSe, and SnS, mainly discussing the effective tuning of the electron and phonon transport based on the intrinsic properties, along with the challenges for further optimization and applications. For SnTe, successful strategies, including resonant doping, band convergence, defect engineering, etc., are discussed. For SnSe, we focus on the analysis of the intrinsic low thermal conductivity due to strong anharmonicity and a high Seebeck coefficient because of the multi-valley bands. For SnS, high performance is expected considering its similar band structure and crystal structure to SnSe.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3aenergy 3aengineering 3alead 3apower generation 3athermal conductivity 3atin 3atoxicity1 aLi, Xiaofang1 aRen, Zhifeng1 aZhang, Qian0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Feb. 6, v. 6, no. 6 p.2432-2448dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta09941j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245010500209300002000314506007600334520144000410592002801850506003701878650002701915650002201942650002301964650001801987650001102005650002502016650001902041650001202060650002302072650002902095650001802124650001702142653003102159653002402190653002202214700002102236773017602257856007902433852000902512655001202521IND60173563820221207084402.0150603e20121211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017356382DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12183481092doi7 aPMC35285872pmcid7 a231757902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVargiu, Attilio V.10aMultidrug binding properties of the AcrB efflux pump characterized by molecular dynamics simulations  ap. 20637-20642.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMultidrug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria, to which multidrug efflux pumps such as the AcrB transporter makes a major contribution, is becoming a major public health problem. Unfortunately only a few compounds have been cocrystallized with AcrB, and thus computational approaches are essential in elucidating the interaction between diverse ligands and the pump protein. We used molecular dynamics simulation to examine the binding of nine substrates, two inhibitors, and two nonsubstrates to the distal binding pocket of AcrB, identified earlier by X-ray crystallography. This approach gave us more realistic views of the binding than the previously used docking approach, as the explicit water molecules contributed to the process and the flexible binding site was often seen to undergo large structural changes. We analyzed the interaction in detail in terms of the binding energy, hydrophobic surface-matching, and the residues involved in the process. We found that all substrates tested bound to the pocket, whereas the binding to this site was not preferred for the nonsubstrates. Interestingly, both inhibitors [Phe-Arg-β-naphthylamide and 1-(1-naphtylmethyl)-piperazine] tended to move out of the pocket at least partially, getting into contact with a glycine-rich loop that separates the distal pocket from the more proximal region of the protein and is thought to control the access of substrates to the distal pocket.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aX-ray diffraction 3abinding properties 3abinding sites 3aenergy 3aglycine (amino acid) 3ahydrophobicity 3aligands 3amolecular dynamics 3amultiple drug resistance 3apublic health 3atransporters 0abacterial drug efflux pump 0adrug-binding pocket 0aefflux inhibitors1 aNikaido, Hiroshi0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Dec. 11, v. 109, no. 50 p.20637-20642dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12183481093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245015000168520221200318592002802530650001602558650001902574650001602593650001202609650002602621650002402647650001602671650001502687650002402702650001602726650001802742650002202760650001702782650001202799650002102811650001902832650001602851700001402867700002002881700002002901700001702921700001402938700001702952773013302969856008403102852000903186655001203195IND60790785020221119144104.0220826e20220817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079078502DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120812432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Guanfang 10aSpatiotemporal Patterns and Key Driving Factors of Soil Salinity in Dry and Wet Years in an Arid Agricultural Area with Shallow Groundwater Table  aSoil salinization is a major eco-environmental problem in irrigated agro-ecosystems. Understanding regional soil salinity spatial patterns and seasonal dynamics and their driving factors under changing environments is beneficial to managing soil salinity to maintain agricultural production in arid agricultural areas. To better investigate this topic, soil salinity was measured, ranging from topsoil to the depth of 1.8 m in an irrigation district with 68 sampling sites before and after the crop growing seasons of the dry year of 2017 and wet year of 2018. Soil texture, groundwater table depth, groundwater salinity, and crop type were monitored. The results indicated that an increase in soil salinity in the root zone (0–0.6 m) was accompanied by a decrease in soil salinity in the deep soil (0.6–1.8 m) through the crop growing season due to water movement from the deep layer to shallow layer, whereas the opposite trend was observed during the fallow seasons. During the dry year, the area with soil desalted was measured to be 19.89%, 14.42%, and 2.78% lower at depths of 0–0.6 m, 0.6–1.2 m, and 1.2–1.8 m than that during the wet year. The groundwater table depth in the crop growing season had the least impact on the change in root zone soil salinity (p > 0.05). Interactions between crop types and groundwater table depth had a significant effect on the change of soil salinity in the root zone during the growing season of the dry year, but were insignificant during the wet year. Crop types, groundwater table depth, and climate conditions determined the contribution of shallow groundwater to crop water consumption and, to a greater extent, soil salinity. Regression tree analysis showed that groundwater salinity and soil texture had a greater influence on soil salinity than groundwater table depth and land elevation. The effect of groundwater on soil salinity is strongly related to soil texture, and the salinity of fine-textured soil was 36–54% greater than that of coarse-textured soil due to large capillary action. Therefore, we suggest strengthening groundwater management in areas with fine-textured soil to relieve soil salinization, particularly during dry years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aagroecosystems 3acapillarity 3aclimate 3acoarse-textured soils 3afine-textured soils 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3aregression analysis 3arhizosphere 3asoil salinity 3asoil salinization 3asoil texture 3atopsoil 3awater management 3awater salinity 3awater table1 aZhu, Yan 1 aGao, Chaoliang,1 aYang, Jinzhong 1 aQu, Zhongyi 1 aMao, Wei 1 aWu, Jingwei 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 Aug. 17, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120812433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245017300174300001600347520139500363592002801758650001901786650002101805650000801826650002501834650002001859650001201879650003101891650002401922650001001946650002001956650001301976650003201989650002802021650002102049650001002070650001302080650002902093650002702122653001102149653003802160653002102198653001902219653002002238653002702258700002102285700002402306773010902330856008602439852000902525655001202534IND60628453820221120120246.0190725e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062845382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2018.12.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkiewicz, Monika10aHypersensitive reaction of plum (Prunus domestica) in response to Plum pox virus infection: Changes in gene expression and identification of potential molecular markers  ap. 430-435.  aThe aim of the study was to identify plum genes which are associated with plant hypersensitive response to Sharka caused by Plum pox virus (PPV) and to explain the molecular mechanism of hypersensitive reaction (HR) in response to PPV infection in selected genotypes of plum and search for molecular markers related of hypersensitivity. To identify candidate genes whose expression is modified during PPV infection, cDNA-AFLP technique was used. The analyses were done using pools of RNA isolated from hypersensitive and sensitive plants, both healthy and infected. Products of selective amplification showing differential expression in PPV-infected and non-infected plants were re-amplified and sequenced. Analysis using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) revealed their homology to genes encoding proteins involved in defence and host-pathogen interaction, cellular stress, signal perception and transduction, transmembrane transport, regulation of transcription and translation and various enzymes involved in other metabolic pathways. Especially interesting for their potential function in plant defence reactions are genes which were overexpressed in infected plants, both hypersensitive and susceptible. Some of them are proposed as potential molecular markers of hypersensitive reaction to PPV infection, useful in early selection of hypersensitive genotypes in plum breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlum pox virus 3aPrunus domestica 3aRNA 3abiochemical pathways 3aearly selection 3aenzymes 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ahypersensitive response 3ahypersensitivity 3aplums 3aproteins 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics) 0aSharka 0aMolecular mechanism of resistance 0aPrunus domestica 0aPlum pox virus 0aGene expression 0aTranscriptome analysis1 aMichalczuk, Lech1 aNeumüller, Michael0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 247 p.430-435dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.12.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245022000166300001400386520119700400592002801597650001901625650001201644650002401656650002001680650001701700650004301717650001101760650002901771650000701800650002101807650002601828650001601854653001401870653002601884653003401910653001701944653002101961700001801982700001602000700001502016700001902031700001502050773009502065856008502160852000902245655001202254IND60554410220221121223058.0161024e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055441022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2013.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi-Bo, Dai10aQuantitative analysis of trazodone in human plasma by using HPLC-fluorescence detector coupled with strong cation exchange chromatographic column: Application to a pharmacokinetic study in Chinese healthy volunteers  ap. 43-48.  aA simple, selective, and sensitive high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedure has been developed for determination of trazodone in human plasma. Prazosin was employed as the internal standard (IS). Sample preparation involved liquid–liquid extraction by methyl tert-butyl ether after alkalinization with ammonia. The HPLC separation was performed on a CAPCELL PAK SCX column (250mm×4.6mm, 5.0μm, Shiseido, Japan) with a mobile phase of acetonitrile/80mmol/L ammonium phosphate (pH adjusted to 6.0) (60:40, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.2mL/min. The peaks were detected by using fluorescence detector (excitation wavelength 320nm and emission wavelength 440nm). The extraction recovery was 72.6–88.3% and the method was over the concentration range of 5.0–2486ng/mL with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 5.0ng/mL using 300μL of plasma. The intra- and inter-day accuracy of the method at three concentrations ranged from 96.7% to 104.2% for trazodone with precision of 2.9–3.7%. This validated method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study enrolling 12 Chinese volunteers administered a single oral trazodone hydrochloride extended-release tablet of 75mg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinization 3aammonia 3aammonium phosphates 3acation exchange 3afluorescence 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3apH 3apharmacokinetics 3aquantitative analysis 3awavelengths 0aTrazodone 0aFluorescence detector 0aStrong cation exchange column 0aHuman plasma 0aPharmacokinetics1 aRong-Hua, Zhu1 aHuan-De, Li1 aFeng, Wang1 aPing-Fei, Fang1 aJiang, Lou0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 944 p.43-48dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2013.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03524naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245014100178520174500319592002802064650001902092650001602111650002502127650001402152650002002166650002502186650001802211650002502229650001502254650002302269650002102292650001202313650001502325650001602340650001502356650001202371650001302383650004402396650001102440650001902451650001102470650001902481650001902500653002702519653001302546653001802559653002002577653001502597653001502612700002502627700002702652700002202679700001702701773010502718856009002823852000902913655001202922IND60685131120221120192321.0200503e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068513112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1263142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelivermiş, Murat10aEffects of variable deoxygenation on trace element bioaccumulation and resulting metabolome profiles in the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis)  aThe dissolved oxygen concentration of the world’s oceans has systematically declined by 2% over the past 50 years, and there has been a notable commensurate expansion of the global oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). Such wide-scale ocean deoxygenation affects the distribution of biological communities, impacts the physiology of organisms that may affect their capacity to absorb and process contaminants. Therefore, the bioaccumulation efficiencies of three contrasting radionuclides, ¹¹⁰ᵐAg, ¹³⁴Cs and ⁶⁵Zn were investigated using controlled aquaria in the blue mussel Mytilus edulis under three contrasting dissolved oxygen regimes: normoxic; 7.14 mg L⁻¹, reduced oxygen; 3.57 mg L⁻¹ and hypoxic 1.78 mg L⁻¹ conditions. Results indicated that hypoxic conditions diminished ¹¹⁰ᵐAg uptake in the mussel, whereas depuration rates were not affected. Similarly, hypoxia appeared to cause a decrease in the ⁶⁵Zn bioaccumulation rate, as evidenced by both weakened uptake and rapid elimination rates. Effects of hypoxia on the metabolome of mussels were also explored by untargeted Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopic methods. The metabolic response was characterised by significantly greater abundance of several amino acids, amino sulfonic acids, dicarboxylic acids, carbohydrates and other metabolites in the lowest oxygen treatment, as compared to the higher oxygen treatments. Clearance rates significantly dropped in hypoxic conditions compared to normoxia. Results suggest that hypoxic conditions, and even partly moderate hypoxia, alter ventilation, an-aerobic, oxidative and osmoregulation metabolism of this mussel, which may further influence the trace element bioaccumulation capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus edulis 3aamino acids 3aanaerobic conditions 3aaquariums 3abioaccumulation 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbohydrates 3acesium radioisotopes 3adepuration 3adicarboxylic acids 3adissolved oxygen 3ahypoxia 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3amussels 3anormoxia 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoceans 3aosmoregulation 3aoxygen 3asulfonic acids 3atrace elements 0aVariable deoxygenation 0aBivalves 0aTrace element 0aBioaccumulation 0aDepuration 0aMetabolome1 aSwarzenski, Peter W.1 aOberhänsli, François1 aMelvin, Steven D.1 aMetian, Marc0 tChemosphere.g2020 July, v. 250 p.126314-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1263143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245008000164300001600244520092900260592002801189650001301217650001401230650001501244650002701259650001701286650001901303650001101322650001001333650002101343650001101364650001901375650002401394650005201418650001501470653002201485653001601507653001101523653001501534653002001549700002701569700002201596700002101618700002001639773011001659856007901769852000901848655001201857IND60515061520221120162715.0160312e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051506152DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2014.00032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRafi, Mohamed M.10aDietary Lutein Modulates Growth and Survival Genes in Prostate Cancer Cells  ap. 173-181.  aLutein is a carotenoid pigment present in fruits and vegetables that has anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties.

These findings highlight that lutein modulates the expression of growth and survival-associated genes in prostate cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aapoptosis 3abiomarkers 3acell cycle checkpoints 3adrug therapy 3aflow cytometry 3afruits 3agenes 3ain vitro culture 3alutein 3aneoplasm cells 3aprostatic neoplasms 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avegetables 0acancer prevention 0acarotenoids 0alutein 0aPC-3 cells 0aprostate cancer1 aKanakasabai, Saravanan1 aGokarn, Sarita V.1 aKrueger, Eric G.1 aBright, John J.0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 18, no. 2 p.173-181dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-76007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fjmf.2014.00033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03777naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245016600174300001600340520200500356592002802361650002402389650002502413650001702438650002502455650001102480650001002491650001402501650001802515650002002533650001702553650001502570650001102585650001802596650001102614650001002625650002002635650002002655650001602675650001902691650000702710650001502717650001802732650001502750650001002765650001702775650001202792650002502804650001802829653001002847653001702857653002202874653001202896653001702908700002202925773010902947856008603056852000903142655001203151IND60628453920221120130423.0190725e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062845392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2018.12.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarbakhsh, Saeedeh10aInfluence of postharvest gamma irradiation on the antioxidant system, microbial and shelf life quality of three cultivars of date fruits (Phoenix dactylifera L.)  ap. 275-286.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of gamma irradiation on the physicochemical properties, microbial load and storage life of three date fruit cultivars. Gamma irradiation was directed at semi-dry date fruits of the ‘Piarom’ cultivar and also at the dry date fruits of the ‘Zahedi’ and ‘Deiri’ cultivars. The irradiation treatment was carried out at three doses, i.e. 1, 3 and 5 kG, in a 60Co chamber. Then, the date fruits were stored at 25 ± 2 °C for 4 months. At the end of the storage, the treated samples showed a higher total soluble solid compared to the control. Over time, the moisture content of the samples decreased. However, among all cultivars, the ‘Zahedi’ cultivar had a higher moisture content than the control. Through the storage time, the total phenolic content was reduced, but irradiation had a significant effect on maintaining the total phenolic content of the samples. Comparing the three cultivars, the highest flavonoid content was observed in ‘Piarom’ samples (26.82 mg CEQ/g FW). Furthermore, the ‘Piarom’ cultivar exhibited higher levels of antioxidant capacity, peroxidase enzyme, ascorbate peroxidase, sensory attributes (color, flavor, texture, smell and overall acceptability) and fungal load, compared to the other two cultivars. The irradiation treatment caused the retention of the total antioxidant content, fungal load, sensory attributes, pH value and peroxidase enzyme. In addition, the irradiation dose of 5 kG appeared to be an optimal dose for decontamination and the maintenance of date fruit quality. In general, the present study indicated that the efficiency of gamma irradiation can be substantial for the postharvest maintenance of quality among dates. The treatments can assist horticulturists in preventing the deterioration of nutritional contents and the hygienic condition of fruits. This opens opportunities for future methods of disinfection that can reduce the occurrence of contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acobalt 3acolor 3acultivars 3adates (fruit) 3adecontamination 3adisinfection 3aflavonoids 3aflavor 3afruit quality 3afruits 3afungi 3agamma radiation 3ahorticulturists 3airradiation 3amicrobial load 3apH 3aperoxidase 3aradionuclides 3ashelf life 3asmell 3astorage time 3atexture 3atotal soluble solids 3awater content 0aDates 0aDisinfection 0aGamma irradiation 0aQuality 0aStorage life1 aRastegar, Somayeh0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 247 p.275-286dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.12.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245016200175300001400337520130100351592002801652650001701680650001801697650001301715650001201728650002001740650001601760650001501776650002601791650002901817650001601846650001501862650000701877650001301884650002901897650001301926653002201939653001301961653001401974653001201988653002002000700002102020700001602041700001802057700006502075700006102140700002102201773009502222856008502317852000902402655001202411IND60554410320221121223054.0161024e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055441032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2013.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlshogran, Osama Y.10aDetermination of warfarin alcohols by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry: Application to in vitro enzyme kinetic studies  ap. 63-68.  aA sensitive, accurate, and reproducible ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for determination of warfarin and its alcohol metabolites (RS/SR- and RR/SS-warfarin alcohol) in 10mM Tris–HCl incubation buffer (pH 7.4). Sample preparation involved acidification with 4% formic acid, followed by liquid–liquid extraction using methyl tert-butyl ether. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a Hypersil Gold C18 (2.1mm×100mm, 1.9μm) analytical column with gradient elution of solvent A (water containing 0.01% formic acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid). The flow rate was 0.4mL/min and the total run time was 5min. Detection of analytes was performed using heated electrospray ionization (negative mode) and selected reaction monitoring. Excellent linearity was observed for all analytes over the standard curve concentration ranges of 100–10,000ng/mL for warfarin, and 0.5–250ng/mL for warfarin alcohols. The intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision for analytes were within ±10.0%. Excellent recovery and negligible matrix effects were observed. The method is robust, sensitive, accurate and reproducible, and was successfully applied to in vitro enzyme kinetic studies of warfarin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aacidification 3aalcohols 3abuffers 3aenzyme kinetics 3aformic acid 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3apH 3asolvents 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awarfarin 0aWarfarin alcohols 0aWarfarin 0aReduction 0aLC–MS 0aEnzyme kinetics1 aOcque, Andrew J.1 aZhao, Jielu1 aDay, Billy W.1 aLeblond, François A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5249-80021 aPichette, Vincent1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1188-69701 aNolin, Thomas D.0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 944 p.63-68dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2013.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011500155300001800270520144000288592002801728650001501756650002001771650001101791650000901802650002401811650001601835650001001851650001301861650001801874650001301892650001901905650001901924650001401943650001301957700001701970700001601987700002002003700001502023700001802038700001702056773013902073856007402212852000902286655001202295IND60618514520221119161903.0181030e20180227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061851452DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta09953c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Su-Un10aMetal–semiconductor yolk–shell heteronanostructures for plasmon-enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution  ap. 4068-4078.  aPlasmonic metal–semiconductor heteronanostructures with controlled topologies have attracted increasing attention as promising platforms for the efficient conversion of solar to chemical energy. Herein, we describe a novel synthesis route toward the formation of heteronanostructures with plasmonic metal yolks and semiconductor shells, which can enable the enhancement of light harvesting efficiency. Au nanorod-CdS yolk–shell nanostructures with well-defined structural configurations were realized by sulfidation and a subsequent cation exchange reaction with pre-synthesized Au nanorod@Ag core–shell nanostructures. The prepared yolk–shell nanostructures showed superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance under visible light irradiation over their core–shell nanostructured counterparts, CdS hollow nanoparticles, and Au nanorods. A series of mechanistic studies on the photocatalysis distinctly corroborated that the pronounced photocatalytic function of the yolk–shell nanostructures is due to the synergism between the radiative relaxation of the plasmon energy of the Au nanorod yolks and the multiple reflections of the incident light within their voids provided by the yolk–shell structure, which can promote the light absorption of CdS that can drive the photocatalysis. This study can provide a new perspective for designing hetero-nanoarchitectures with intended structures and desired functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acation exchange 3aenergy 3agold 3ahydrogen production 3airradiation 3alight 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3aphotocatalysis 3asemiconductors 3asynergism 3atopology1 aJung, Hayoon1 aWi, Dae Han1 aHong, Jong Wook1 aSung, Jiha1 aChoi, Sang-Il1 aHan, Sang-u,0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Feb. 27, v. 6, no. 9 p.4068-4078dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta09953c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002300158245007200181300001600253520139400269592002801663650001501691650001301706650002601719650001401745650001001759650001001769650001801779650001501797650001101812650001401823650001401837650004701851650001201898650002101910650002501931650001401956650003401970650002602004700002702030700001702057700002802074773009702102856004002199852000902239655001202248IND50075001920221116235656.0140410e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007500192DNAL7 a244440302pmid7 a10.1111/nph.126902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayer, Veronika E.10aCurrent issues in the evolutionary ecology of ant–plant symbioses  ap. 749-764.  a749 I. 749 II. 750 III. 754 IV. 758 V. 759 760 References 761 SUMMARY: Ant–plant symbioses involve plants that provide hollow structures specialized for housing ants and often food to ants. In return, the inhabiting ants protect plants against herbivores and sometimes provide them with nutrients. Here, we review recent advances in ant–plant symbioses, focusing on three areas. First, the nutritional ecology of plant‐ants, which is based not only on plant‐derived food rewards, but also on inputs from other symbiotic partners, in particular fungi and possibly bacteria. Food and protection are the most important ‘currencies’ exchanged between partners and they drive the nature and evolution of the relationships. Secondly, studies of conflict and cooperation in ant–plant symbioses have contributed key insights into the evolution and maintenance of mutualism, particularly how partner‐mediated feedbacks affect the specificity and stability of mutualisms. There is little evidence that mutualistic ants or plants are under selection to cheat, but the costs and benefits of ant–plant interactions do vary with environmental factors, making them vulnerable to natural or anthropogenic environmental change. Thus, thirdly, ant–plant symbioses should be considered good models for investigating the effects of global change on the outcome of mutualistic interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3abacteria 3aenvironmental factors 3aevolution 3afoods 3afungi 3aglobal change 3aherbivores 3amodels 3amutualism 3anutrients 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aAntsxphysiology 2aBiological Evolution 2aEcosystem 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aSymbiosisxphysiology1 aFrederickson, Megan E.1 aMcKey, Doyle1 aBlatrix, R.q(Rumsais),0 tnew phytologist.g2014 May, v. 202, no. 3 p.749-764dWilliam Wesley and Sonx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.12690  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008000161300001600241520152100257592002801778650002201806650001501828650001501843650001201858650001901870650001101889650001301900650001701913650001301930650001701943650003401960700001901994700002002013700002002033773012902053856007502182852000902257655001202266IND60539144820170628000000.0160815e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053914482DNAL7 a10.1021/ja410278r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrysiak, Stefanie10aPeptide Desorption Kinetics from Single Molecule Force Spectroscopy Studies  ap. 688-697.  aWe use a combined experimental/theoretical approach to determine the intrinsic monomeric desorption rate k₀ of polytyrosine and polylysine homopeptides from flat surfaces. To this end, single polypeptide molecules are covalently attached to an AFM cantilever tip and desorbed from hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers in two complementary experimental protocols. In the constant-pulling-velocity protocol, the cantilever is moved at finite velocity away from the surface and the distance at which the constant plateau force regime ends and the polymer detaches is recorded. In the waiting-time protocol, the cantilever is held at a fixed distance above the surface and the time until the polymer detaches is recorded. The desorption plateau force is varied between 10 and 90 pN, by systematically changing the aqueous solvent quality via the addition of ethanol or salt. A simultaneous fit of the experimental data from both protocols with simple two-state kinetic polymer theory allows to unambiguously disentangle and determine the model parameters corresponding to polymer contour length L, Kuhn length a, adsorption free energy λ, and intrinsic monomeric desorption rate k₀. Crucial to our analysis is that a statistically significant number of single-polymer desorption experiments are done with one and the same single polymer molecule for different solvent qualities. The surprisingly low value of about k₀ ≈ 10⁵ Hz points to significant cooperativity in the desorption process of single polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3aethanol 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3apolymers 3apolypeptides 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy 3astandard operating procedures1 aLiese, Susanne1 aNetz, Roland R.1 aHugel, Thorsten0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 136, no. 2 p.688-697dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja410278r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245012200175300001400297520118100311592002801492650001501520650000901535650001501544650002201559650002001581650003101601650002401632650002101656650001601677650001001693651001101703653001801714653002301732653001801755653001101773653000801784653001501792700006101807700002501868700002701893773011301920856008702033852000902120655001202129IND60633647820221120071135.0190509e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063364782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.03.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlytaria, Maria T.10aNumerical simulation of a solar cooling system with and without phase change materials in radiant walls of a building  ap. 40-53.  aThis work investigates energetically and financially a building solar cooling system with radiant walls which includes phase change materials (PCMs). The examined building has a floor area of 100 m2 and it is located in Athens (Greece). The solar cooling system includes evacuated tube collectors coupled to a single-effect absorption chiller for producing cold water for the building radiant walls. The use of PCM is examined in all the building’s outer walls and different scenarios with PCM in only some walls are also investigated in details. Different combinations of collecting areas and storage tank volumes are examined in order to determine the optimum design for every scenario. The study is performed with the commercial software TRNSYS which uses an active layer to simulate the radiant wall. The most important calculated parameters of this work are the auxiliary energy consumption, the solar coverage and the indoor temperature of the building. The results indicate that the best location of PCM layer is in south wall with a reduction of the auxiliary energy 30%, an increase of the solar coverage 3.8% and a reduction of the total system cost of about 3%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acold 3acollectors 3acomputer software 3acooling systems 3aenergy use and consumption 3amathematical models 3aphase transition 3atemperature 3awater 3aGreece 0aSolar cooling 0aAbsorption chiller 0aRadiant walls 0aTRNSYS 0aPCM 0aTotal cost1 aBellos, Evangelos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5876-65491 aTzivanidis, Christos1 aAntonopoulos, Kimon A.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 May 15, v. 188 p.40-53dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.03.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03856naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245009100209300002000300506007600320520184200396592002802238506003702266650001502303650000802318650002702326650001502353650001402368650001402382650001502396650002002411650002002431650003102451650001002482650001302492650001102505650001502516650001602531650001702547650001102564650003702575650001702612650002902629650002002658651002102678651001502699651001802714653002602732653002502758700002202783700001902805700001902824700002202843700002102865700002002886700002402906773017602930856007903106852000903185655001203194IND60173564120221207084312.0150603e20121211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017356412DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12186611092doi7 aPMC35285662pmcid7 a231978282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeets, Nicholas M.10aGene expression changes governing extreme dehydration tolerance in an Antarctic insect  ap. 20744-20749.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAmong terrestrial organisms, arthropods are especially susceptible to dehydration, given their small body size and high surface area to volume ratio. This challenge is particularly acute for polar arthropods that face near-constant desiccating conditions, as water is frozen and thus unavailable for much of the year. The molecular mechanisms that govern extreme dehydration tolerance in insects remain largely undefined. In this study, we used RNA sequencing to quantify transcriptional mechanisms of extreme dehydration tolerance in the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica, the world’s southernmost insect and only insect endemic to Antarctica. Larvae of B. antarctica are remarkably tolerant of dehydration, surviving losses up to 70% of their body water. Gene expression changes in response to dehydration indicated up-regulation of cellular recycling pathways including the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome and autophagy, with concurrent down-regulation of genes involved in general metabolism and ATP production. Metabolomics results revealed shifts in metabolite pools that correlated closely with changes in gene expression, indicating that coordinated changes in gene expression and metabolism are a critical component of the dehydration response. Finally, using comparative genomics, we compared our gene expression results with a transcriptomic dataset for the Arctic collembolan, Megaphorura arctica. Although B. antarctica and M. arctica are adapted to similar environments, our analysis indicated very little overlap in expression profiles between these two arthropods. Whereas several orthologous genes showed similar expression patterns, transcriptional changes were largely species specific, indicating these polar arthropods have developed distinct transcriptional mechanisms to cope with similar desiccating conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCollembola 3aRNA 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aarthropods 3aautophagy 3abody size 3abody water 3adata collection 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenomics 3alarvae 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amidges 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3asurface area 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 3aArctic region 0aphysiological ecology 0aenvironmental stress1 aPeyton, Justin T.1 aColinet, Herve1 aRenault, David1 aKelley, Joanna L.1 aKawarasaki, Yuta1 aLee, Richard E.1 aDenlinger, David L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Dec. 11, v. 109, no. 50 p.20744-20749dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12186611093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005100171500002200222520143100244592002801675650001801703650001701721650001101738653000801749653000801757653000801765653000801773653003601781653002601817653002601843653003001869653002401899700001601923773009201939856005202031852000902083655001202092IND60795488320221122032958.0221004e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079548832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalat, Jorge F.10aMultiple treatments with strategic substitutes  aPre-press version  aWe develop an empirical framework to identify and estimate the effects of treatments on outcomes of interest when the treatments are the result of strategic interaction (e.g., bargaining, oligopolistic entry, peer effects). We consider a model where agents play a discrete game of complete information and strategic substitutability, whose equilibrium actions (i.e., binary treatments) determine a post-game outcome in a nonseparable model with endogeneity. Due to the simultaneity in the first stage, the model as a whole is incomplete and the selection process fails to exhibit the conventional monotonicity. Without imposing parametric restrictions or large support assumptions, this poses challenges in recovering treatment parameters. To address these challenges, we establish a monotonic pattern of the equilibria in the first-stage game in terms of the number of treatments selected. Based on this finding, we derive bounds on the average treatment effects (ATE’s) under nonparametric shape restrictions and the existence of excluded exogenous variables. We show that the instrument variation that compensates strategic substitution helps solve the multiple equilibria problem. We apply our method to data on airlines and air pollution in cities in the U.S. We find that (i) the causal effect of each airline on pollution is positive, and (ii) the effect is increasing in the number of firms but at a decreasing rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aeconometrics 3amodels 0aC14 0aC31 0aC36 0aC57 0aHeterogeneous treatment effects 0aStrategic interaction 0aEndogenous treatments 0aAverage treatment effects 0aMultiple equilibria1 aHan, Sukjin0 tJournal of econometrics.g2020 Dec. 01, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.12.015  aDNAL 7aarticle01855naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007400166300001400240520088100254592002801135653001401163653002701177653002001204653002601224653001301250653001801263700001901281700001601300700001801316773010401334856008201438852000901520655001201529IND60554731020221120071632.0161024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055473102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpp.2015.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCole, Garrard10aCase report: A giant calcified uterus, likely due to benign leiomyoma  ap. 51-57.  aDuring the 2011 excavation of the site of St. Michael’s Litten, in Chichester, England, a female skeleton, dating to the post-Medieval period (1550–1850), with a large, unidentified pelvic mass was uncovered. The mass measured 16.4H×19.0W×24.3L and was 66cm in its greatest circumference; it weighed 3.32kg. The skeleton presented with established osteoporosis and was estimated to be of an advanced age. The analytic methodology used to evaluate the mass was based on that of Kramar et al. (1983). Considering the results of these analyses, and through an extensive search of the relevant medical, historical and archaeological literature, it was determined that this mass was likely a neoplasm of reproductive origin, and was further defined as a calcified uterus containing a number of leiomyomas. To date, this is the largest of its kind ever found archaeologically.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLeiomyoma 0aDifferential diagnosis 0aEnlarged uterus 0aPost-medieval england 0aNeoplasm 0aCalcification1 aRando, Carolyn1 aSibun, Lucy1 aWaldron, Tony0 tInternational Journal of Paleopathology.g2015 Sept., v. 10 p.51-57dElsevier Inc.x1879-98177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpp.2015.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245010400162300002000266520152000286592002801806650002001834650001001854650002601864650001701890650001001907650002101917650002101938650002001959650002101979650001902000650001702019650001802036650001902054650003702073653001802110653001802128653001702146653001802163653003102181700001602212700001602228700001202244700001602256700001902272700001702291773012702308856008002435852000902515655001202524IND60579972420221118010227.0170907e20170906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057997242DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b075652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhihao10aConstruction of a Supramolecular Drug–Drug Delivery System for Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Therapy  ap. 29505-29514.  aNanoscale drug delivery systems (DDSs) are generally considered to be an effective alternative to small molecular chemotherapeutics due to improved accumulation in the tumor site and enhanced retention in blood. Nevertheless, most DDSs have low loading efficiency or even pose a high threat to normal organs from severe side effects. Ideally, a supramolecular drug–drug delivery system (SDDDS) composed of pure drugs via supramolecular interaction provides a hopeful approach for cancer treatment. Herein we propose a facile method to construct SDDDS via coassembly of gefitinib (GEF) and tripeptide tyroservatide (YSV), two kinds of chemotherapeutic pharmaceuticals for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via multiple intermolecular interactions, including hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking. As shown through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS), GEF and YSV self-assemble into nanoparticles with regular morphology and uniform size, which facilitates the delivery of both drugs. In vitro studies demonstrate that the SDDDS is much more efficient in entering cancer cells and inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells compared with single GEF, YSV, or GEF/YSV drug mixture. In vivo experiments show that the SDDDS can selectively accumulate in tumor tissue, resulting in much better drug efficacy without evident side effects. Considering the advantages of the SDDDS, we believe this strategy provides a promising route for enhanced anticancer therapy in nanomedicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3ablood 3adrug delivery systems 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3ahydrogen bonding 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3alight scattering 3alung neoplasms 3ananomedicine 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3atransmission electron microscopy 0adrug delivery 0aself-assembly 0achemotherapy 0ananoparticles 0anon-small-cell lung cancer1 aShi, Leilei1 aWu, Chenwei1 aSu, Yue1 aQian, Jiwen1 aDeng, Hongping1 aZhu, Xinyuan0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Sept. 06, v. 9, no. 35 p.29505-29514dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b075653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011000158300001800268520176000286592002802046650002402074650002802098650001202126650001402138650002602152650001502178650001902193650001102212650001602223650001702239700002002256700001502276700002602291700001502317700001402332700001702346700002102363700001802384700002002402773013902422856007402561852000902635655001202644IND60618514820221119161812.0181030e20180522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061851482DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta09967c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Juanxiu10aRoom temperature ferroelectricity of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites with mixed iodine and bromine  ap. 9665-9676.  aFerroelectricity has been reported in organic–inorganic perovskites, and it can enhance the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) because ferroelectricity can facilitate charge carrier separation and charge transport through the perovskite layer. However, the existence of ferroelectricity in perovskites has been in hot debate, particularly at room temperature. Here, we report the ferroelectric polarization switching of MAPb(I₁₋ₓBrₓ)₃ which showed a high dependence on its composition. The ferroelectric behavior of MAPbI₃-50% PbBr₂ is confirmed with domain switching by Piezoelectric Force Microscopy (PFM) imaging and bias-off “butterfly-like” amplitude loops and piezoresponse hysteresis loops at room temperature. The possible factors, such as film electrical properties attributed to the enhanced room-temperature ferroelectricity in MAPb(I₁₋ₓBrₓ)₃ films are clarified by using conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM). In addition, the charge separation and charge transport in the perovskite MAPb(I₁₋ₓBrₓ)₃ films are further investigated by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Finally, the possible influences of polarization orientations, trapping effects and ion migrations within the MAPb(I₁₋ₓBrₓ)₃ films on the J–V characteristics of PSC devices are discussed in detail. It discovers that the polarization switching under the positive tip biased condition in the PSCs with 50% PbBr₂, which could hinder the photovoltaic performance. These findings help better understand the electronic structure of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites and provide guidance for the improvement of the PSC performance and other electronic applications of perovskites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aatomic force microscopy 3abromine 3achemistry 3aelectrical properties 3ahysteresis 3aimage analysis 3aiodine 3asolar cells 3asolar energy1 aChang, Jingjing1 aLi, Bichen1 aIsikgor, Furkan Halis1 aWang, Dong1 aFan, Zhen1 aLin, Zhenhua1 aOuyang, Jianyong1 aZeng, Kaiyang1 aChen, Jingsheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 May 22, v. 6, no. 20 p.9665-9676dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta09967c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03426naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245013000208300001600338520192400354592002802278650002002306650000802326650001202334650001302346650002002359650001802379650001902397650001102416650003102427650001402458650002302472653003002495653005502525653002102580653003202601653002902633700005502662700001702717700002102734773012902755856008702884852000902971655001202980IND60633648120221122071259.0190516e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063364812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.03.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Kuojiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0387-950312aA novel caudal-fin-inspired hourglass-shaped self-agitator for air-side heat transfer enhancement in plate-fin heat exchanger  ap. 297-315.  aA novel caudal-fin-inspired hourglass-shaped self-agitator installed inside a plate-fin heat exchanger has been experimentally investigated to characterize its thermo-hydraulic performance. Because of fluid-structure interaction between the air and the caudal-fin-inspired hourglass-shaped self-agitator, there is periodic conversion between fluid kinetic energy and elastic strain energy. Vortices generated by the self-sustained vibration of the self-agitator enhance flow mixing and thus heat transfer performance. Experiments were conducted at a wide range of Reynolds numbers from 400 to 10,000, which covered the laminar-transitional-turbulent regime. Experimental correlations of pressure drop as a function of a dimension parameter, friction factor, and Nusselt number have been proposed. Mutual coupling motions and effects of multiple-row flapping caudal-fin-inspired hourglass-shaped self-agitators in parallel and tandem configurations were studied by using a high-speed camera. A stereo Particle Image Velocimetry system was used to conduct detailed flow field measurements to quantify the flow mixing level. Parameter studies for the stream-wise distance (i.e., the pitch) between the neighboring caudal-fin-inspired hourglass-shaped self-agitators have been investigated to exploit the best performance of the heat exchanger equipped with caudal-fin-inspired hourglass-shaped self-agitators. For the chosen plate-fin heat exchanger and assigned working conditions, the best heat transfer performance was obtained with twelve-row self-agitators with a pitch of 12.5 mm, which caused a 200% increase in the Nusselt number over the clean channel at the same Reynolds number. However, the best overall performance was obtained with six-row self-agitators with a pitch of 25 mm, which caused a 68% enhancement in thermal-hydraulic characteristics compared to the clean channel at the same Reynolds number.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aair 3acameras 3afriction 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3akinetic energy 3amixing 3aparticle image velocimetry 3avibration 3aworking conditions 0aHeat transfer enhancement 0aCaudal-fin-inspired hourglass-shaped self-agitator 0aPIV measurements 0aFluid-structure interaction 0aPlate-fin heat exchanger1 aWang, Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6542-58921 aKe, Zhaoqing1 aChen, Chung-Lung0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 May 01, v. 187 p.297-315dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.03.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245010400189300001600293520130700309592002801616650002001644650002701664650001101691650000901702650002901711650002301740650001501763650001301778650001201791650000901803650001901812650002801831650001501859650001101874650001501885650001401900650001201914650000901926650001601935650001801951650001001969650000901979650002001988650001202008650003502020650002602055650001102081650003202092650002702124650002402151650003002175650002302205650002702228700001602255773010202271856008402373852000902457655001202466IND50067560620221118012303.0141111e20120323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006756062DNAL7 a218999532pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2011.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCallander, J.T.10aInsecticidal and repellent effects of tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) oil against Lucilia cuprina  ap. 271-278.  aLaboratory studies were conducted to assess the effect of tea tree oil (TTO) from Melaleuca alternifolia (terpinen-4-ol chemotype) against different stages of the Australian sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina. When applied to wool, 3% TTO formulation repelled gravid female L. cuprina and prevented oviposition for six weeks. Formulations containing 1% TTO caused 100% mortality of L. cuprina eggs and 1st instar larvae and 2.5% TTO caused mortality of most second and third instar larvae in agar feeding assays. In experiments where third instar larvae were dipped in TTO formulations for 60s, concentrations of up to 50% TTO gave less than 50% kill. TTO at concentrations of 0.5%, 2% and 5% was strongly repellent to third instar larvae and caused them to evacuate treated areas. Inclusion of TTO in formulations with diazinon, ivermectin and boric acid reduced mortality in comparison with the larvicides used alone, at least partially because of avoidance behaviour stimulated by the TTO. Addition of TTO to wound treatments may aid in wound protection and myiasis resolution by preventing oviposition by L. cuprina adults, insecticidal action against L. cuprina eggs and larvae, stimulating larvae to leave the wound and through antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties that aid in wound healing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLucilia cuprina 3aMelaleuca alternifolia 3aadults 3aagar 3aantimicrobial properties 3aavoidance behavior 3aboric acid 3adiazinon 3adipping 3aeggs 3agravid females 3ainsecticidal properties 3aivermectin 3alarvae 3alarvicides 3amortality 3amyiasis 3aoils 3aoviposition 3atissue repair 3atrees 3awool 3awound treatment 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aDipteraxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aInsect Repellentsxtoxicity 2aInsecticidesxtoxicity 2aLarvaxdrug effects 2aOvipositionxdrug effects 2aOvumxdrug effects 2aTea Tree Oilxtoxicity1 aJames, P.J.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2012 Mar. 23, v. 184, no. 2-4 p.271-278dElsevier B.V.x0304-40177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2011.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014400168520149200312592002801804650001201832650001301844650001301857650001801870650002101888650001101909650001401920650002201934650004301956650002001999650001902019650001802038653001002056653001702066653002002083653002602103653002002129700001302149700001602162700001602178700001602194700001402210700005502224700001402279700001602293700001502309773010902324856008602433852000902519655001202528IND60743793620221120084831.0211206e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074379362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1103742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Wenqian10aCharacterization of BBX family genes and their expression profiles under various stresses in the sweet potato wild ancestor Ipomoea trifida  aB-box (BBX) proteins are one kind of zinc-finger transcription factors that play critical roles in plant development, growth and multiple stress responses. Ipomoea trifida is the closest diploid wild ancestor of sweet potato, and its genome has been released. However, no comprehensive study has yet been carried out on the BBX genes in Ipomoea species. In this study, a total of 34 BBX (ItfBBX) genes were identified in Ipomoea trifida, and were phylogenetically divided into five clades. BBX members within the same clade showed similar domain organizations, suggesting similarity of biological function potentially. Evolutionary analysis indicated that segmental duplications played a major role in the ItfBBX gene expansion, and gene loss has frequently occurred after Ipomoea whole-genome triplication event. On the basis of the transcriptome data, we identified ItfBBX genes with tissue specific and dynamic stress response expression patterns. With the quantitative real-time PCR analysis, we discovered highly divergent stress-response patterns of ItfBBX genes (such as ItfBBX7, ItfBBX8, ItfBBX12, ItfBBX14 and ItfBBX22) in root and leaf, implying their functional conservation and divergence. Furthermore, the transient expression assay demonstrated that eight selected ItfBBXs were localized in nucleus. Our study provides the first step in systemic analyses of the ItfBBX genes, and will be useful to understand the functional characterization of BBX genes in Ipomoea species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIpomoea 3aancestry 3adiploidy 3agene deletion 3agenome expansion 3aleaves 3aphylogeny 3aplant development 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astress response 3asweet potatoes 3atranscriptome 0aB-box 0aSweet potato 0aIpomoea trifida 0aPhylogenetic analysis 0aGene expression1 aRen, Lei1 aZhang, Yang1 aSun, Haoyun1 aShi, Tianye1 aGu, Yulan1 aWang, Aimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7057-87511 aMa, Daifu1 aLi, Zongyun1 aZhang, Lei0 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 288 p.110374-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1103743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01877naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245010400167300001600271520079100287592002801078650001401106650001301120650001801133650004401151700002501195700002901220700001501249700002101264700002001285700002101305773012901326856007501455852000901530655001201539IND60539145120170615000000.0160815e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053914512DNAL7 a10.1021/ja410396g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhivonitko, Vladimir V.10aTweezers for Parahydrogen: A Metal-Free Probe of Nonequilibrium Nuclear Spin States of H2 Molecules  ap. 598-601.  aTo date, only metal-containing hydrogenation catalysts have been utilized for producing substantial NMR signal enhancements by means of parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP). Herein, we show that metal-free compounds known as molecular tweezers are useful in this respect. It is shown that ansa-aminoborane tweezers QCAT provided (20–30)-fold signal enhancements of parahydrogen-originating hydrogens in ¹H NMR spectra. Nuclear polarization transfer from the polarized hydrogens to ¹¹B nuclei leads to a 10-fold enhancement in the ¹¹B NMR spectrum. Moreover, our results indicate that dihydrogen activation by QCAT and CAT tweezers is carried out in a pairwise manner, and PHIP can be used for understanding the activation mechanism in metal-free catalytic systems in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aTelkki, Ville-Veikko1 aChernichenko, Konstantin1 aRepo, Timo1 aLeskelä, Markku1 aSumerin, Victor1 aKoptyug, Igor V.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 136, no. 2 p.598-601dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja410396g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245009500204300001800299520125300317592002801570596011201598596008801710650002801798650001901826650002401845650002301869650001001892650001601902650002001918700001701938700001401955700001501969700001401984700001701998700001502015700001902030773012002049856008602169852000902255655001202264IND60624926320221122040241.0191017e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062492632DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btx7612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Ling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5141-025913aAn attention-based BiLSTM-CRF approach to document-level chemical named entity recognition  ap. 1381-1388.  aIn biomedical research, chemical is an important class of entities, and chemical named entity recognition (NER) is an important task in the field of biomedical information extraction. However, most popular chemical NER methods are based on traditional machine learning and their performances are heavily dependent on the feature engineering. Moreover, these methods are sentence-level ones which have the tagging inconsistency problem. In this paper, we propose a neural network approach, i.e. attention-based bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with a conditional random field layer (Att-BiLSTM-CRF), to document-level chemical NER. The approach leverages document-level global information obtained by attention mechanism to enforce tagging consistency across multiple instances of the same token in a document. It achieves better performances with little feature engineering than other state-of-the-art methods on the BioCreative IV chemical compound and drug name recognition (CHEMDNER) corpus and the BioCreative V chemical-disease relation (CDR) task corpus (the F-scores of 91.14 and 92.57%, respectively).

Four extra heat exchangers than traditional test bench are equipped for the system performance testing with different evaporator and condenser or heat transfer examinations of the evaporator and condenser. The combination of an expansion valve and a cooler is designed to simulate the expander with desired type and expansion characteristic. Meanwhile, a scroll expander is installed in parallel. Preliminary investigations are motivated to explore the operating characteristics of the novel experimental facility under different conditions and to quantitatively discover the system improvement potentials for further optimizations. After the steady-state operation evaluation, the system is investigated by varying the heat source temperature and heat sink temperature as well as the working fluid pump stroke. The constant expander isentropic efficiency scenario is simulated through the combination of the expansion valve and cooler, and it is also validated by the installed expander. Results show that the power output of the system and electricity consumption of the working fluid pump are in the ranges of 2.42–3.55 kW and 0.44–0.49 kW, respectively, and the system thermal efficiency varies from 5.2% to 7.3%. Moreover, the system is then deeply explored by using exergy analyses to reveal the potential for performance improvement. The conventional exergy analysis tells that the evaporator has the largest exergy destruction. However, the advanced exergy analysis gives a more realistic improvement potential and suggests that the expansion process should be firstly improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric energy consumption 3aexergy 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3atemperature 0aOrganic Rankine cycle 0aExperiment 0aIsentropic efficiency 0aAdvanced exergy analysis1 aZheng, Xiaosheng1 aGuo, Guiqi1 aLuo, Xianglong1 aChen, Ying1 aYang, Zhi0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 May 01, v. 187 p.339-355dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.03.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245011200159300002000271520106600291592002801357650002401385650002101409650000901430650001601439650002001455650001101475650002201486653002201508653003001530653002401560653002701584653001301611700001701624700002201641700001201663700001501675773012701690856008001817852000901897655001201906IND60579972720221118010043.0170907e20170906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057997272DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b076442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Haomin10aHighly (001)-Textured Tetragonal BiFeO3 Film and Its Photoelectrochemical Behaviors Tuned by Magnetic Field  ap. 30127-30132.  aHighly (001)-textured BiFeO₃ film in tetragonal phase (T-BFO) with a giant c/a ratio was first obtained on quartz/polycrystalline ITO substrate. Our results indicate that the polycrystalline ITO layer with small surface roughness is a critical point to control the growth of T-BFO structure. It should be ascribed to the fact that a Bi-rich phase interlayer (∼5 nm) could be formed on ITO, which acted as a crystal seed layer and thus induced the growth of (001)-textured T-BFO structure. The observed weak room temperature ferromagnetism should be attributed to Fe valence change. Open circuit potential measurements under 360 μW/cm² full spectra irradiation show that the open circuit potential and the lifetime of photo-induced carriers increased under applied magnetic field, which reveals that the applied magnetic field can manipulate the photo electrochemical behaviors of BFO film. Our findings offer a simple way to fabricate highly (001)-textured T-BFO film, which make it desirable to obtain extensive applications for these oriented BFO films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aelectrochemistry 3airon 3airradiation 3amagnetic fields 3aquartz 3asurface roughness 0atetragonal BiFeO3 0apolycrystalline substrate 0amagnetic controlled 0aphoto-induced electron 0alifetime1 aLin, Yuanhua1 aHarumoto, Takashi1 aShi, Ji1 aNan, Cewen0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Sept. 06, v. 9, no. 35 p.30127-30132dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b076443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04558naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002700169245008600196300001600282520183800298592002802136650001302164650001602177650001802193650001602211650001902227650001002246650001602256650002802272650002002300650001302320650001202333650002802345650001602373650002302389650002202412650003302434650002502467650001802492650001502510650000902525650001402534650001402548650001702562650001202579650007602591650003502667650003002702650003002732650002502762650006902787650007202856650004502928650002702973650003003000650002403030650006303054650000903117650000903126650002403135650003303159650004203192650003403234650001703268650006603285700002203351700002703373700002103400700001903421700002103440700002803461773011103489856008403600990002303684852000903707655001203716IND60097844520221118040915.0141104e20120229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009784452DNAL7 a222100532pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonaventura, María M.10aEffects of GABAB receptor agonists and antagonists on glycemia regulation in mice  ap. 188-196.  aγ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibits insulin secretion through GABAB receptors in pancreatic β-cells. We investigated whether GABAB receptors participated in the regulation of glucose homeostasis in vivo. BALB/c mice acutely pre-injected with the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (7.5mg/kg, i.p.) presented glucose intolerance and diminished insulin secretion during a glucose tolerance test (GTT, 2g/kg body weight, i.p.). The GABAB receptor antagonist 2-hydroxysaclofen (15mg/kg, i.p.) improved the GTT and reversed the baclofen effect. Also a slight increase in insulin secretion was observed with 2-hydroxysaclofen. In incubated islets 1.10⁻⁵M baclofen inhibited 20mM glucose-induced insulin secretion and this effect was reversed by coincubation with 1.10⁻⁵M 2-hydroxysaclofen. In chronically-treated animals (18days) both the receptor agonist (5mg/kg/day i.p.) and the receptor antagonist (10mg/kg/day i.p.) induced impaired GTTs; the receptor antagonist, but not the agonist, also induced a decrease in insulin secretion. No alterations in insulin tolerance tests, body weight and food intake were observed with the treatments. In addition glucagon, insulin-like growth factor I, prolactin, corticosterone and growth hormone, other hormones involved in glucose metabolism regulation, were not affected by chronic baclofen or 2-hydroxysaclofen. In islets obtained from chronically injected animals with baclofen, 2-hydroxysaclofen or saline (as above), GABAB₂ mRNA expression was not altered. Results demonstrate that GABAB receptors are involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis in vivo. Treatment with receptor agonists or antagonists, given acutely or chronically, altered glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion alerting to the need to evaluate glucose metabolism during the clinical use of these drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3acorticosterone 3adrugs 3afood intake 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3agene expression 3aglucagon 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance tests 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin secretion 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aislets of Langerhans 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3amice 3aprolactin 3areceptors 3asomatotropin 2aAnimals 2aBaclofenxadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aBasal Metabolismxdrug effects 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aGABA-B Receptor Agonistsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aGABA-B Receptor Antagonistsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHomeostasisxdrug effects 2aInsulinxsecretion. 2aIslets of Langerhansxdrug effectsxmetabolismxsecretion. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aProtein Subunitsxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, GABA-Bxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 2agamma-Aminobutyric Acidxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology.1 aCrivello, Martín1 aFerreira, María Laura1 aRepetto, Martín1 aCymeryng, Cora1 aLibertun, Carlos1 aLux-Lantos, Victoria A.0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2012 Feb. 29, v. 677, no. 1-3 p.188-196dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.12.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245024000168520172900408592002802137650001602165650001802181650001102199650003502210650001402245650001202259650001602271650003102287650002102318650001702339650001402356650001802370650001302388650002602401650002502427651001002452653003502462653002402497653001302521653002002534653002002554700001202574700001502586700001802601773009102619856009002710852000902800655001202809IND60685131820221120101244.0200503e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068513182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1263232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Jian10aPossible effect of submarine groundwater discharge on the pollution of coastal water: Occurrence, source, and risks of endocrine disrupting chemicals in coastal groundwater and adjacent seawater influenced by reclaimed water irrigation  aThis study investigated occurrence, source, and risks of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in coastal groundwater and adjacent seawater influenced by reclaimed water irrigation in a typical coastal region of China. All target EDCs were detected in coastal groundwater and reclaimed water while only estrone, bisphenol A (BPA), and nonylphenol were detected in seawater. Concentrations of BPA that was the predominant EDC in coastal groundwater ranged from 35.9 to 52.9 ng/L and estradiol was easy to accumulate in groundwater under reclaimed water irrigation. Concentrations of all target EDCs in seawater ranged from 18.9 to 30.9 ng/L, much lower than those in groundwater. Ecological risks posed by EDCs in groundwater and seawater were very high. Estrone contributed to 51.3%–62.9% of total acute risk quotients for seawater while detected 17-α-ethynylestradiol contributed to 41.1%–56.2% of total acute risk quotients for groundwater. Estradiol equivalent concentrations of target EDCs in groundwater/seawater were in the range of (3.5–7.6)/(1.4–2.3) ng/L while non-cancer risks posed by EDCs in groundwater/seawater were acceptable. Dual-isotope analysis illustrated that reclaimed water was the main source of EDCs in coastal groundwater. About 82% of EDCs was discharged into the Laizhou Bay through the submarine groundwater discharge based on the flux analysis. The pollution of the coastal groundwater through reclaimed water irrigation subsequently led to EDCs pollution of the adjacent seawater through the submarine groundwater discharge. Therefore, effective control of EDCs in reclaimed water for irrigation will be beneficial to control EDCs in groundwater and seawater of the coastal regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aestradiol 3aestrone 3agroundwater 3ahealth effects assessments 3airrigation water 3anonylphenols 3apollution 3arelative risk 3aseawater 3awastewater irrigation 3awastewater treatment 3aChina 0aEndocrine-disrupting chemicals 0aCoastal groundwater 0aSeawater 0aReclaimed water 0aRisk assessment1 aWu, Jun1 aZhang, Cui1 aZhang, Yuxuan0 tChemosphere.g2020 July, v. 250 p.126323-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1263233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010200162300001600264520191600280592002802196650001402224650001902238650001602257650001402273700002802287700002602315700002502341700002002366700001402386700001902400700002402419700001702443700001602460700002502476700002402501773013602525856007402661852000902735655001202744IND60618515120221119161734.0181030e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061851512DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta09972j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDowell, Caitlin10aImpact of rotamer diversity on the self-assembly of nearly isostructural molecular semiconductors  ap. 383-394.  aConformational diversity due to different orientations of structural subunits has a complex impact on morphological disorder of organic semiconductors. Here, we isolate the impact of a specific structural change: replacing bithiophene (biTh) units with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT). We compare four molecules with an alternating donor–acceptor structure (D′–A–D–A–D′) composed of a central, electron-rich dithienosilole (DTS) unit flanked by pyridyl-[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PT) or fluorinated benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (FBT) and end-capped with bithiophene biTh or TT groups. We find that using TT instead of biTh results in an increased degree of order within films cast directly from solution by influencing the self-assembly tendencies of the different molecules. Unlike switching the acceptor subunit, such as FBT for PT, the TT for biTh structural change has little impact on the electronic structure of these molecular semiconductors. Instead, these morphological effects can be understood within the context of the predicted conformational diversity. TT units limit the number of rotational conformations (rotamers) available within this molecular architecture; low rotamer dispersity facilitates self-assembly into ordered domains. As a practical illustration of this greater drive toward self-assembly, we use the TT-containing molecules as donors in bulk heterojunction solar cells with PC₇₀BM. Devices with TT-containing molecules show improved photovoltaic performance compared to their previously characterized biTh analogs (d-DTS(PTTh₂)₂ and p-DTS(FBTTh₂)₂) in both as-cast and optimized conditions, with efficiencies up to 6.4% and 8.8% for PT-TT and FBT-TT, respectively. The TT subunit and, more broadly, the strategy of limiting conformational diversity can be readily applied toward the design of solution-processable organic semiconductors with increased as-cast order.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3asemiconductors 3asolar cells 3athiophene1 aNarayanaswamy, Kamatham1 aYadagiri, Bommaramoni1 aGayathri, Thumuganti1 aSeifrid, Martin1 aDatt, Ram1 aRyno, Sean M.1 aHeifner, Michael C.1 aGupta, Vinay1 aRisko, Chad1 aSingh, Surya Prakash1 aBazan, Guillermo C.0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Jan. 2, v. 6, no. 2 p.383-394dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta09972j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245007000173300001600243520182700259592002802086650001702114650001702131650002402148650001102172650001002183650002002193650001902213650001202232650001702244650001002261650002002271650001602291650001402307650001202321650001102333650001502344651001102359700002402370700002002394773010802414856005502522852000902577655001202586IND4479278320221122164544.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447927832DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-048X.2011.05281.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsghar, Muhammad10aAre chronic avian haemosporidian infections costly in wild birds?  ap. 530-537.  aOne group of commonly found parasites in birds, for which fitness consequences and effects on life history traits have been much debated are Haemosporidian blood parasites. In a long term study population of great reed warblers Acrocephalus arundinaceus in Sweden, previous studies have shown that the Haemosporidian blood parasites are in their chronic phase during the breeding season and that the fitness of infected and non‐infected birds are similar. In the present study, we quantified parasite intensity (parasitemia) in 718 adults great reed warblers sampled between 1987 and 1998 for the three most common parasite species; Haemoproteus payevskyi (lineage GRW1), Plasmodium ashfordi (GRW2) and Plasmodium relictum (GRW4). We verified that the q‐PCR method is accurately quantifying Haemoproteus payevskyi (GRW1) as it was highly correlated with the number of parasites seen under microscope. Frequency of mixed infections with two lineages was significantly higher than expected based on the prevalence of each of the three parasite lineages. The mean level of parasitemia was significantly different for the three lineages and individual birds had repeatable parasitemia levels between years. Females tended to have a higher parasitemia than males for all three parasite lineages combined. Females with higher GRW1 parasitemia tended to arrive later in spring to their breeding sites. There was a negative correlation between parasitemia and number of fledged offspring for GRW1, and a tendency for a negative correlation between GRW2 parasitemia and the proportion of recruiting offspring. Overall our results demonstrate that chronic Haemosporidian infections can have slight but significant effects on host life history traits, and therefore may act as important selective agents in wild bird populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrocephalus 3aHaemoproteus 3aPlasmodium relictum 3aadults 3ablood 3abreeding season 3abreeding sites 3afemales 3alife history 3amales 3amixed infection 3aparasitemia 3aparasites 3aprogeny 3aspring 3awild birds 3aSweden1 aHasselquist, Dennis1 aBensch, Staffan0 tJournal of avian biology.g2011 Nov., v. 42, no. 6 p.530-537dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-048X.2011.05281.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02202naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245008000203300002000283506007600303520087100379592002801250506003701278650002101315650001801336650002101354650002201375650002301397650001401420650001701434653002801451653001801479653002201497700002101519773017601540856007901716852000901795655001201804IND60173564620221207084325.0150603e20121211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017356462DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12189991092doi7 aPMC35285062pmcid7 a231887952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Zhuojun10aRotation of the head of the 30S ribosomal subunit during mRNA translocation  ap. 20391-20394.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aElongation factor-G–catalyzed translocation of mRNA and tRNAs during protein synthesis involves large-scale conformational changes in the ribosome. Formation of hybrid-state intermediates is coupled to counterclockwise (forward) rotation of the body of the 30S subunit. Recent structural studies implicate intrasubunit rotation of the 30S head in translocation. Here, we observe rotation of the head during translocation in real time using ensemble stopped-flow FRET with ribosomes containing fluorescent probes attached to specific positions in the head and body of the 30S subunit. Our results allow ordering of the rates of movement of the 30S subunit body and head during translocation: body forward > head forward > head reverse ≥ body reverse. The rate of quenching of pyrene-labeled mRNA is consistent with coupling of mRNA translocation to head rotation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afluorescent dyes 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein subunits 3aprotein synthesis 3aribosomal proteins 3aribosomes 3atransfer RNA 0atranslocation mechanism 0amRNA movement 0aribosome dynamics1 aNoller, Harry F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Dec. 11, v. 109, no. 50 p.20391-20394dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12189991093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011300159300002000272520115000292592002801442650001501470650001201485650001401497650002301511650001301534650002601547650002201573650001301595650003101608650001501639650000901654650001201663650001501675650002501690650001301715650001101728700001701739700001401756700001601770773012501786856007401911852000901985655001201994IND60669356820221121063240.0190920e20151116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066935682DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra17615h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yingshi10aSynthesis of phosphotungstic acid-supported versatile metal–organic framework PTA@MIL-101(Fe)–NH₂–Cl  ap. 97589-97597.  aThe catalyst PTA@MIL-101(Fe)–NH₂–Cl was synthesized in various solvents to investigate the effect of solvents on the catalyst crystal structure. PTA@MIL-101(Fe)–NH₂–Cl can only be obtained in DMF because of its excellent ability to deprotonate the organic ligands and promotion to yield MIL-101 crystals by forming a Cl–H–DMF complex. The water-containing solvents were unfavorable to yield MIL-101 crystals since MIL-101 crystals reorganized and other crystals were formed in this kind of solvents. The metal cation concentration kinetically controlled the crystal structure. MIL-101 crystals were fabricated only at low metal cation concentration. In the DMF synthesis system, the supported phosphotungstic acid (PTA) retained its Keggin structure. The acidity dramatically decreased compared to PTA caused by the double electrostatic interaction of amino groups and positively charged exterior surface of carrier MIL-101(Fe)–NH₂–Cl. The roles of both amino groups as PTA immobilization sites and chlorine groups as substrate absorption sites were confirmed in starch hydrolysis catalyzed by PTA@MIL-101(Fe)–NH₂–Cl.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacidity 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achlorine 3acoordination polymers 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrolysis 3airon 3aligands 3ametal ions 3aphosphotungstic acid 3asolvents 3astarch1 aWan, Jinquan1 aWang, Yan1 aMa, Yongwen0 tRSC advances.g2015 Nov. 16, v. 5, no. 118 p.97589-97597dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra17615h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02164naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245013300213520089300346592002801239650002001267650001801287650001601305650002101321650001501342650002001357650001101377653003301388653001501421653002001436653001701456653001701473653001701490653001601507653002301523700002401546773010201570856008501672852000901757655001201766IND60727045420221120080401.0210401e20210330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072704542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2021.1528342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPourshahian, Soheil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4138-944110aStereochemistry of internucleoside phosphorus atom affects sugar pucker and acid hydrolysis of N3′-P5′ thio-phosphoramidates  aInvestigation of the sugar pucker of the two diastereomers of dinucleotide N3′-P5′-thio-phosphoramidates TNPSTNH₂ and TNPSTOH shows that the Sₚ isomer adopts a more C3′-endo (North) sugar ring configuration than the Rₚ counterpart. In contrast, P-stereochemistry of oligonucleotide phosphorothioate (O3′-P5′) compounds has no effect on the nucleoside sugar puckering. This difference is also reflected in the different rate of acid hydrolysis for the two isomers. Thus, the Rₚ stereoisomer with less prevalent C3′-endo configuration has an acid hydrolysis rate constant ~50% higher than that of the Sₚ molecule. The TNPOTNH₂ and TNPOTOH dinucleotides are hydrolyzed an order of magnitude faster than TNPSTNH₂ and TNPSTOH, respectively. In addition, dinucleotides with the terminal 3′-OH group are hydrolyzed two times faster than their 3′-NH₂ counterparts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid hydrolysis 3adiastereomers 3anucleosides 3aoligonucleotides 3aphosphorus 3astereochemistry 3asugars 0aOligonucleotide therapeutics 0aNucleoside 0aPhosphoramidate 0aStereoisomer 0aDiastereomer 0aSugar pucker 0aStereo-pure 0aRate of hydrolysis1 aGryaznov, Sergei M.0 tTetrahedron letters.g2021 Mar. 30, v. 68 p.152834-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2021.1528343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245009200187300001800279520165900297592002801956650001201984650001801996650000902014650002102023650001802044650002502062650002402087650002402111650003202135650001902167650001002186653000802196653000802204653000902212653001502221653001202236653000902248653001402257700002002271700002202291700002202313700002002335700001802355773013902373856008202512852000902594655001202603IND60516254820221118035749.0190726e20130614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051625482DNAL7 a230515912pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145120041022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacka, Felice N.10aDietary intake of fish and PUFA, and clinical depressive and anxiety disorders in women  ap. 2059-2066.  aFish and PUFA consumption are thought to play a role in mental health; however, many studies do not take into account multiple sources of PUFA. The present study analysed data from a sample of 935 randomly selected, population-based women aged 20–93 years. A validated and comprehensive dietary questionnaire ascertained the consumption of n-3 and n-6 PUFA. Another assessed fish and energy intake and provided data for a dietary quality score. The General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) measured psychological symptoms and a clinical interview (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Research Version, Non-patient edition) assessed depressive and anxiety disorders. Median dietary intakes of long-chain n-3 fatty acids (310 mg/d) were below suggested dietary target levels. The only PUFA related to categorical depressive and anxiety disorders was DHA. There was a non-linear relationship between DHA intake and depression; those in the second tertile of DHA intake were nearly 70 % less likely to report a current depressive disorder compared to those in the first tertile. The relationship of DHA to anxiety disorders was linear; for those in the highest tertile of DHA intake, the odds for anxiety disorders were reduced by nearly 50 % after adjustments, including adjustment for diet quality scores, compared to the lowest tertile. Those who ate fish less than once per week had higher GHQ-12 scores, and this relationship was particularly obvious in smokers. These are the first observational data to indicate a role for DHA in anxiety disorders, but suggest that the relationship between DHA and depressive disorders may be non-linear.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3aenergy intake 3afish 3afish consumption 3amental health 3anutritional adequacy 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aquestionnaires 3awomen 0an-3 0an-6 0aPUFA 0aDepression 0aAnxiety 0aDiet 0aNutrition1 aPasco, Julie A.1 aWilliams, Lana J.1 aMeyer, Barbara J.1 aDigger, Rebecca1 aBerk, Michael0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2013 June 14, v. 109, no. 11 p.2059-2066dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145120041023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03415naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245015600197300001800353500002000371520155800391592002801949650004401977650001602021650001502037650001502052650001902067650002302086650001302109650001702122650001602139650001302155650001702168650002602185650001902211650001102230650001902241650001302260650000902273650001302282650001902295650001102314650001502325650001102340700001902351700001602370700001602386700001602402700001802418700001502436700001702451700005702468700005502525773015102580856007302731852000902804655001202813IND60608748820221117232529.0180808e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060874882DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.56192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Qianlin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2602-874110aControllable synthesis of monoacrylate‐modified adsorption resins and enhancing adsorption toward fermentation inhibitors from rice straw hydrolysate  ap. 2652-2658.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: A series of monoacrylate modified adsorption resins from reactive mixtures with different amounts and types of monoacrylate have been synthesized by an oil/water (O/W) suspension polymerization technique and utilized to remove fermentation inhibitors and pigments from rice straw hydrolysate for the first time. The modified resin was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT‐IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and N₂ adsorption–desorption isotherms. Batch experiments were carried out to determine the adsorption performance of the modified resin for fermentation inhibitors. Regeneration and reusability experiments were performed to evaluate the economic value. RESULTS: The modified resin with 80% glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) feed and epoxy group showed optimal selectivity of fermentation inhibitors from rice straw hydrolysate. The adsorption capacities of acid soluble lignin (ASL), formic acid, acetic acid, levulinic acid, 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (5‐HMF) and furfural onto 80% GMA modified resin were enhanced by 45%, 156%, 86%, 79%, 131%, 52%, respectively. Furthermore, the decolorization rate was improved by 12% over unmodified styrene‐divinylbenzene (St‐DVB) adsorption resin with approximately 5% sugar loss. CONCLUSION: This work not only provides a potential adsorbent for the removal of fermentation inhibitors from rice straw hydrolysate, but also provides guidance for choosing and modifying the adsorbent to detoxify lignocellulose hydrolysate. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetic acid 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3adecolorization 3aeconomic valuation 3aepoxides 3afermentation 3aformic acid 3afurfural 3ahydrolysates 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3alevulinic acid 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3anitrogen 3aoils 3apigments 3apolymerization 3aresins 3arice straw 3asugars1 aZhang, Hairong1 aXiong, Lian1 aHuang, Chao1 aGuo, Haijun1 aChen, Xuefang1 aLuo, Mutan1 aTian, Lanlan1 aLin, Xiaoqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1751-53481 aChen, Xinde1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5027-41470 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 Sept., v. 93, no. 9 p.2652-2658dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.56193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03642naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245016000178300001600338520225400354592002802608650001202636650001602648650001502664650002002679650002302699650002402722650001902746650002202765650001902787650001902806650002102825650001702846653001702863653002802880653003902908700002202947700002802969700002802997773009203025856008203117852000903199655001203208IND60546355320221121232015.0220523e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054635532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2014.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaimaitijiang, Maitiniyazi10aDrivers of land cover and land use changes in St. Louis metropolitan area over the past 40 years characterized by remote sensing and census population data  ap. 161-174.  aIn this study, we explored the spatial and temporal patterns of land cover and land use (LCLU) and population change dynamics in the St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area. The goal of this paper was to quantify the drivers of LCLU using long-term Landsat data from 1972 to 2010. First, we produced LCLU maps by using Landsat images from 1972, 1982, 1990, 2000, and 2010. Next, tract level population data of 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 were converted to 1-km square grid cells. Then, the LCLU maps were integrated with basic grid cell data to represent the proportion of each land cover category within a grid cell area. Finally, the proportional land cover maps and population census data were combined to investigate the relationship between land cover and population change based on grid cells using Pearson's correlation coefficient, ordinary least square (OLS), and local level geographically weighted regression (GWR). Land cover changes in terms of the percentage of area affected and rates of change were compared with population census data with a focus on the analysis of the spatial-temporal dynamics of urban growth patterns. The correlation coefficients of land cover categories and population changes were calculated for two decadal intervals between 1970 and 2010. Our results showed a causal relationship between LCLU changes and population dynamics over the last 40 years. Urban sprawl was positively correlated with population change. However, the relationship was not linear over space and time. Spatial heterogeneity and variations in the relationship demonstrate that urban sprawl was positively correlated with population changes in suburban area and negatively correlated in urban core and inner suburban area of the St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area. These results suggest that the imagery reflects processes of urban growth, inner-city decline, population migration, and social spatial inequality. The implications provide guidance for sustainable urban planning and development. We also demonstrate that grid cells allow robust synthesis of remote sensing and socioeconomic data to advance our knowledge of urban growth dynamics from both spatial and temporal scales and its association with population change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acensus data 3aland cover 3aland use change 3ametropolitan areas 3apopulation dynamics 3aremote sensing 3aspatial variation 3asuburban areas 3aurban planning 3aurban population 3aurbanization 0aUrban growth 0aLand cover and land use 0aGeographically weighted regression1 aGhulam, Abduwasit1 aSandoval, J.S.

The experimental set-up consisted in the evaluation of changes in the morphology of the gland, as well as in the activity of some key digestive enzymes (amylase, laminarinase, cellulase and protease) within a broad range of SFG obtained through manipulation of food ration. The higher SFG values were correlated to an increase in both the size of the digestive gland and the activities of enzymes when expressed in relation to individual. In contrast, no clear relations were observed when the activity of enzymes was expressed in relation to soluble protein, with the exception to amylase. The higher protease activities measured in mussels showing lower SFG may reflect an initial stage of catabolic processes intended to compensate the energy deficit produced by food restriction. The potential use of parameters measured in digestive glands in studies of marine pollution was discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3adigestive enzymes 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3amussels 3apollution 3aproteinases1 aSánchez Hernández, Míriam,1 aCampillo, Juan Antonio1 aMoyano, Francisco Javier0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2012 Nov., v. 163, no. 3-4 p.286-295dElsevier Inc.x1095-64337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008600160300001800246520165900264592002801923650001301951650001801964650001501982650001401997650001102011650001802022650001402040650001002054650001102064650002302075650001702098650001602115700002402131700001502155700002302170700001902193700002402212700002102236773014102257856007402398852000902472655001202481IND60636809520221120203234.0190411e20190409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063680952DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta09521c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmyahi, Furqan14aThe role of surface energy control in organic photovoltaics based on solar paints  ap. 9202-9214.  aThe fabrication of organic photovoltaic devices from aqueous solar nanoparticle (ASNP) inks or solar paints is challenging, driven by the often competing requirements of maintaining emulsion stability whilst simultaneously facilitating surface wettability. In this paper, we have investigated multiple pathways for successfully coating ASNP inks across a range of fabrication scales. Initial attempts at roll-to-roll (R2R) printing of ASNP inks focussed simply on optimising film quality by altering the free-SDS concentration in the ASNP inks. Although high quality films were produced, the prepared R2R printed devices exhibited low performance, driven by the high SDS content of the printed films. Consequently, a detailed study of the effect of surface ozone treatments on ASNP film formation was undertaken. The work function, contact angle, surface composition and surface morphology were investigated as a function of surface ozone treatment for a range of PEDOT:PSS hole-transport layer (HTL) electrodes on small-scale devices. Optimised ozone surface treatments yielded nanoparticle organic photovoltaic (NP-OPV) device efficiencies of 1.5%, with the surface characterisation revealing that the ozone treatment of the HTL films predominantly results in increased PSS surface concentration. Transferring these results to R2R scale devices showed that surface ozone treatments can be used to successfully coat medium SDS content ASNP films of good quality resulting in large area devices with an efficiency of 0.45%; highlighting the role of surface energy control in determining device performance of R2R OPV devices fabricated from solar paints.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3aelectrodes 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3ananoparticles 3aozonation 3aozone 3apaints 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asolar energy 3awettability1 aAndersen, Thomas R.1 aFahy, Adam1 aDickinson, Michael1 aFeron, Krishna1 aBelcher, Warwick J.1 aDastoor, Paul C.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Apr. 9, v. 7, no. 15 p.9202-9214dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta09521c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01321naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245010800174520031100282592002800593650002700621650002200648650001700670650001100687651001200698700002400710700002100734700002300755700001800778773011800796856008400914852000900998655001201007IND60622470520221118074634.0181130s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062247052DNAL7 a10.1094/PHP-2013-0328-01-BR2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParkunan, Venkatesan13aAn Epidemic of Downy Mildew caused by Peronospora destructor on Vidalia Sweet Onions in Georgia in 2012  aThe first reported occurrence of onion downy mildew (ODM) on Vidalia sweet onions in Georgia was in 1999.

Herein, we have developed a controllable strategy to fabricate a series of hierarchically structured cobalt-ruthenium-phosphide arrays on nickel foam (Co–Ru–P@NF) as a highly efficient and stable catalyst for hydrogen generation from NaBH₄ hydrolysis in alkaline media. SEM and TEM analyses show that the interconnected rugae-like Co–Ru–P arrays are vertically grown on the surface of Ni foam, together with uniformly distributed RuP₃ nanoclusters on the surface of CoP nanosheets. More importantly, the optimized Co–Ru–P@NF catalyst exhibits an outstanding catalytic performance on NaBH₄ hydrolysis in alkaline media with a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 2123.6 molH₂ min⁻¹ molRᵤ⁻¹ at 25 °C, which is one of the highest known so far. Furthermore, the exceptional catalytic performance is in line with the outcome of low activation energy (40.3 kJ mol⁻¹). Additionally, the catalyst also shows a high stability with less than 8.0% lost after 5 consecutive cycles. The superior catalytic performance is ascribed to the synergetic effect between RuP₃ and CoP species resulting in a significant electron transfer effect, together with the unique morphologies associated with a large specific surface area and open-channels for effective solute transport/adsorption and H₂ gas emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectron transfer 3afoams 3agas emissions 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrolysis 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3anickel 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium borohydride 3asolutes 3asurface area 3asynergism 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aWu, Chongbei1 aZhang, Jifang1 aYan, Puxuan1 aTian, Jianniao1 aShen, Xingcan1 aIsimjan, Tayirjan Taylor1 aYang, Xiulin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Apr. 9, v. 7, no. 15 p.8865-8872dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta10695a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245012400169500001500293520103200308592002801340650001801368650001601386650002501402650002401427650002501451650003801476650001201514650004001526650001101566650002701577650002201604650002201626650003001648650002601678650002401704650002201728650001001750650001401760650002501774650002501799650002601824650003901850651000901889653003001898653003401928773011801962856008402080852000902164655001202173IND60622470620221118074611.0181130s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062247062DNAL7 a10.1094/PHP-2013-0330-01-RS2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFisher, John R.10aIdentification of Two Tobacco rattle virus Sequence Variants Associated with Virus-like Mottle Symptom on Hosta in Ohio  a2019-12-06  aTwo Hosta sp. ‘So Sweet’ plants and one Hosta sieboldii (labeled as ‘Albo-marginata’) plant showing a suspected virus-like leaf mottle symptom tested negative for the Potyvirus group, Hosta virus X, Alfalfa mosaic virus, Arabis mosaic virus, Cucumber mosaic virus, Impatiens necrotic spot virus, Tobacco mosaic virus, Tobacco ringspot virus, Tomato ringspot virus, and Tomato spotted wilt virus by ELISA.

The results of the acute toxicity test showed that no mortality was observed for MWCNTs concentration up to 1000 mg kg−1. The earthworms suffered DNA damage in soils amended with MWCNTs at 50 mg kg−1 in a natural soil, despite of the fact that no significant (p > 0.05) avoidance had occurred at this level of MWCNTs in artificial soil. The LC50 values of PCP-Na for the 7-d and 14-d were 176.0 and 71.1 mg kg−1, respectively. PCP-Na at the concentration of 35.6 mg kg−1 in soil induced behavior toxicity in avoidance test, and genetic toxicity could be determined at a relatively low concentration (1.4 mg kg−1). The avoidance assay revealed a synergetic effect of the two chemicals on E. fetida, regardless of whether these compounds were both added separately or after the adsorption of PCP-Na to the MWCNTs. The two exposure methods showed no differences on the combined toxicity of MWCNTs and PCP-Na when low concentrations of the chemicals were used. Comet assay is not a suitable method for evaluation of combined toxicity of the two chemicals in this study, because exposure to PCP-Na at high dosages could induce lower values of the parameters compared with the lower dosages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aEisenia fetida 3aacute toxicity 3aadsorption 3abioassays 3acarbon nanotubes 3aearthworms 3agenotoxicity 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3asodium 3asoil 3asoil amendments 3asoil sampling 3asynergism 0aCarbon nanotubes 0aSodium pentachlorophenate 0aToxicity 0aAdsorption 0aSoil avoidance assay 0aComet assay1 aZhang, L.J.1 aWang, W.L.1 aCui, Y.B.1 aLi, M.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2014 Mar., v. 70 p.123-130dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2013.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01891naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010200165300001800267520094500285592002801230650001501258650001301273650001501286650001101301650001501312651001901327700001801346700001801364773010501382856008101487852000901568655001201577IND4393541820221120151733.0151024e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439354182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-007-9085-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSweeney, Sandra10aUsing place names to interpret former floodplain connectivity in the Morava River, Czech Republic  ap. 1007-1018.  aToponyms, or place names have been used to reveal historical land-use patterns based on degree of wetness in the Morava River floodplain. Eleven patch types were plotted on three land cover types representing broad ecological niches with different moisture regimes for four time periods. The river’s simultaneous decrease in sinuosity, which underscores the loss of the landscape’s ecohydrological connectivity, was quanified. The results show that long-term human-dominated land use worked in concert with a naturally occuring seasonal flood regime. The findings strongly indicate that high human density and intensive exploitation can co-exist with a functioning floodplain. Landscape change was interpreted by using a new concept, that of the place-name patch, which can be universally applied to interpret historical land use changes in river basins. Our method is reproducible in river basins with a history of intensive human use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland cover 3aland use 3alandscapes 3arivers 3awatersheds 3aCzech Republic1 aJurek, Martin1 aBednar, Marek0 tLandscape ecology.g2007 Aug., v. 22, no. 7 p.1007-1018dKluwer Academic Publishersx0921-29737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-007-9085-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245003300176300001400209520188300223592002802106653001702134653001202151653001902163653003002182653001102212653001302223700001902236700001902255773009102274856008502365852000902450655001202459IND60126309420221119040908.0151105e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012630942DNAL7 a10.1675/1524-4695-31.sp2.192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSavard, Jean-Pierre L.10aHarlequin Ducks in Quéébec  ap. 19-31.  aIn the last decade, several survey and research efforts have been undertaken to better understand the ecology and distribution of Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) in Quéébec. The results of these efforts are summarized and new survey, research and management needs are identified. Harlequin Ducks breed on rivers and streams of the Gaspéé Peninsula, the Quéébec North Shore, and the immense Hudson Bay and Ungava Bay drainage basins. Quéébec is possibly the most important breeding area for Harlequin Ducks in eastern Canada, and there is every indication that a significant proportion of the birds wintering in south-western Greenland and in eastern North America breed in Quéébec. In spring, significant numbers of birds spend a few days or weeks along the Gaspéé Peninsula before departing for their breeding or molting areas. The most important molting sites in Quéébec are Bonaventure Island, the Port-Daniel/Newport area, and the Pointe du Sud-Ouest/Jupiter River area on Anticosti Island. Known fall staging areas include the coastal waters of the Gaspéé Peninsula, the Pointe du Sud-Ouest/Jupiter River area, and Brion Island, on the Magdalen Islands. The few Harlequin Ducks that overwinter in Quéébec are mostly in Baie des Chaleurs, on the south shore of the Gaspéé Peninsula. There are no good data on trends of Harlequin Ducks in Quéébec. Major threats to population recovery/health include hydroelectric developments, illegal and subsistence harvests, coastal exploitation (aquaculture, fisheries, boating), and recreational activities on breeding rivers and streams. Survey, research and management needs include better estimates of breeding densities and distribution, characterization of spring, summer and fall coastal habitats, comprehensive genetic analysis, monitoring, and public education on the status of Harlequin Ducks.  aPublisher supplied data 0adistribution 0aecology 0aHarlequin Duck 0aHistrionicus histrionicus 0aQuebec 0asea duck1 aRobert, Michel1 aBrodeur, Serge0 tWaterbirds.g2008 Dec., v. 31, no. sp2 p.19-31dThe Waterbird Societyx1524-46957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1675%2F1524-4695-31.sp2.193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245018400186300001800370520163400388592002802022650001702050650002402067650001102091650002502102650003102127650001102158650001902169650001502188653001102203653002502214653002402239653002202263700002402285700002002309700002402329773013902353856008202492852000902574655001202583IND60516255320221118034114.0190726e20130614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051625532DNAL7 a230840772pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145120041872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerrow, Emma J.14aThe effects of a lutein-based supplement on objective and subjective measures of retinal and visual function in eyes with age-related maculopathy – a randomised controlled trial  ap. 2008-2014.  aLutein and zeaxanthin are lipid-soluble antioxidants found within the macula region of the retina. Links have been suggested between increased levels of these carotenoids and reduced risk for age-related macular disease (ARMD). Therefore, the effect of lutein-based supplementation on retinal and visual function in people with early stages of ARMD (age-related maculopathy, ARM) was assessed using multi-focal electroretinography (mfERG), contrast sensitivity and distance visual acuity. A total of fourteen participants were randomly allocated to either receive a lutein-based oral supplement (treated group) or no supplement (non-treated group). There were eight participants aged between 56 and 81 years (65·50 (sd 9·27) years) in the treated group and six participants aged between 61 and 83 years (69·67 (sd 7·52) years) in the non-treated group. Sample sizes provided 80 % power at the 5 % significance level. Participants attended for three visits (0, 20 and 40 weeks). At 60 weeks, the treated group attended a fourth visit following 20 weeks of supplement withdrawal. No changes were seen between the treated and non-treated groups during supplementation. Although not clinically significant, mfERG ring 3 N2 latency (P= 0·041) and ring 4 P1 latency (P= 0·016) increased, and a trend for reduction of mfERG amplitudes was observed in rings 1, 3 and 4 on supplement withdrawal. The statistically significant increase in mfERG latencies and the trend for reduced mfERG amplitudes on withdrawal are encouraging and may suggest a potentially beneficial effect of lutein-based supplementation in ARM-affected eyes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aelectroretinography 3alutein 3amacular degeneration 3arandomized clinical trials 3aretina 3arisk reduction 3azeaxanthin 0aLutein 0aMacular degeneration 0aElectroretinography 0aElectrophysiology1 aBartlett, Hannah E.1 aEperjesi, Frank1 aGibson, Jonathan M.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2013 June 14, v. 109, no. 11 p.2008-2014dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145120041873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245017400209520078000383592002801163650001501191650001601206650001301222650001301235650001301248650001401261650002101275653001701296653002201313653002701335653002101362700001701383700006401400700006701464773010201531856008501633852000901718655001201727IND60727046220221120080531.0210320e20210316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072704622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2021.1528432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDvorak, Curt A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2567-984110aRegioselective assembly of fused pyrazole-azepine heterocycles: Synthesis of the 5-HT7 antagonist 1-benzyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydropyrazolo[3,4-d]azepine  aThe synthesis of the 5-HT₇ antagonist 1-benzyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydropyrazolo[3,4-d]azepine is described using a regioselective assembly of a pyrazole ring fused to an azepine ring. Two different approaches were examined for the construction of the fused pyrazole-azepine heterocyclic core. These were based on the timing and method of installation of the appended aryl ring and construction of the fused heterocycle. The team focused on a route that featured a palladium coupling reaction to introduce the aryl ring via a pyrazole triflate and a selective alkylation to set the position of benzyl moiety on the pyrazole nitrogen. This led to a scalable synthesis of 1 (JNJ-18038683) allowing the discovery team to select and advance a clinical candidate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3aantagonists 3aazepines 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3apalladium 3aregioselectivity 0aHeterocycles 0aPyrazole coupling 0aPyrazolo[3,4-d]azepine 0a5-HT7 antagonist1 aLiang, Jimmy1 aMani, Neelakandha S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4652-52621 aCarruthers, Nicholas I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7924-19440 tTetrahedron letters.g2021 Mar. 16, v. 67 p.152843-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2021.1528433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013000165300001600295520175700311592002802068650001602096650001302112650002202125650001602147650003302163650001102196650001202207650002402219650001802243650001302261650001402274650001402288650001602302650004002318650001002358650001002368700001502378700001702393700001602410700001602426700002202442700002802464700002202492700001802514700001502532700001602547700001902563700001902582700001602601773012302617856008102740852000902821655001202830IND60082332620221122064031.0170830e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008233262DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-012-1141-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrouillet, S.10aEG-VEGF controls placental growth and survival in normal and pathological pregnancies: case of fetal growth restriction (FGR)  ap. 511-525.  aIdentifiable causes of fetal growth restriction (FGR) account for 30 % of cases, but the remainders are idiopathic and are frequently associated with placental dysfunction. We have shown that the angiogenic factor endocrine gland-derived VEGF (EG-VEGF) and its receptors, prokineticin receptor 1 (PROKR1) and 2, (1) are abundantly expressed in human placenta, (2) are up-regulated by hypoxia, (3) control trophoblast invasion, and that EG-VEGF circulating levels are the highest during the first trimester of pregnancy, the period of important placental growth. These findings suggest that EG-VEGF/PROKR1 and 2 might be involved in normal and FGR placental development. To test this hypothesis, we used placental explants, primary trophoblast cultures, and placental and serum samples collected from FGR and age-matched control women. Our results show that (1) EG-VEGF increases trophoblast proliferation ([³H]-thymidine incorporation and Ki67-staining) via the homeobox-gene, HLX (2) the proliferative effect involves PROKR1 but not PROKR2, (3) EG-VEGF does not affect syncytium formation (measurement of syncytin 1 and 2 and β hCG production) (4) EG-VEGF increases the vascularization of the placental villi and insures their survival, (5) EG-VEGF, PROKR1, and PROKR2 mRNA and protein levels are significantly elevated in FGR placentas, and (6) EG-VEGF circulating levels are significantly higher in FGR patients. Altogether, our results identify EG-VEGF as a new placental growth factor acting during the first trimester of pregnancy, established its mechanism of action, and provide evidence for its deregulation in FGR. We propose that EG-VEGF/PROKR1 and 2 increases occur in FGR as a compensatory mechanism to insure proper pregnancy progress.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3aexplants 3afetal development 3agiant cells 3ahuman chorionic gonadotropin 3ahumans 3ahypoxia 3amechanism of action 3amessenger RNA 3apatients 3apregnancy 3areceptors 3atrophoblast 3avascular endothelial growth factors 3avilli 3awomen1 aMurthi, P.1 aHoffmann, P.1 aSalomon, A.1 aSergent, F.1 aDe Mazancourt, P.1 aDakouane-Giudicelli, M.1 aDieudonné, M.

We synthesized mesoporous titania thin films (MTTFs) with two different structures (that is, pillar structure and tube structure, denoted as P-MTTFs and T-MTTFs, respectively) through an evaporation-induced self-assembling (EISA) process with the presence of a surfactant as a structure-directing agent. The synthesized MTTFs were carefully characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and UV–Vis spectra. After analysis of photocurrent and hydrogen generation, we concluded that with different structures, MTTFs generate photocurrents and hydrogen with different efficiencies. The results indicated that the T-MTTF had a higher net current (i.e., 1.05E−3eV) than the P-MTTF (i.e., 1.04E−3eV). However, the yield of hydrogen from T-MTTFs (i.e., 17.5μmol) was lower than that of P-MTTFs (i.e., 37.5μmol). Tube structure induced a concentration gradient of NaOH, which restrained the generation of oxygen and hydrogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysts 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium hydroxide 3asurfactants 3atitanium dioxide1 aHuang, Chao-Wei1 aLiao, Chi-Hung1 aWu, Jeffery C.-S.1 aWu, Kevin C.-W.0 tApplied energy.g2012 Dec., v. 100 p.75-80dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.02.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245016000202300001600362500002000378520172500398592002802123596004902151596003502200596003802235650002002273650001702293650001402310650002002324650001902344650001502363650001202378650002302390650002902413650001902442650001302461650002302474700006002497700001802557700006202575700002002637700005602657700001602713700006302729700002102792773012002813856007302933852000903006655001203015IND60632439020221119183600.0190314e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063243902DNAL7 a10.1111/faf.123312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakris, Nicholas C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4369-296X10aInstantaneous areal population density of entire Atlantic cod and herring spawning groups and group size distribution relative to total spawning population  ap. 201-213.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe wide‐area group behaviour of spawning Atlantic cod and herring is investigated. By a combination of Ocean Acoustic Waveguide Remote Sensing (OAWRS) and conventional sensing methods, first‐look images of the instantaneous population density are obtained of entire Atlantic cod spawning groups, stretching for tens of kilometres in the Nordic Seas. This structural information made it possible to quantify the spawning group size distribution of cod over a roughly 30‐year period from conventional line‐transect data acquired annually by vertical echo sounding in the Nordic Seas. The size distribution is found to be consistent with the log‐normal probability density often found in growth processes that depend on many independent parameters. Nordic Seas cod populations are found to distribute into many vast behavioural groups during spawning with relatively stable mean size despite larger variations in total annual population. When sustained at pre‐industrial levels, the total spawning population is found to greatly exceed the mean spawning group size. As an apparent consequence of this large differential, when the total population, or overall scale, declined to within a standard deviation of this mean cod spawning group quantum, or inner‐group‐behavioural scale, return to pre‐industrial levels required decades. Findings for Atlantic herring are similar, where summing the spawning group populations measured in a single instantaneous OAWRS image per day over the 8‐day peak spawning period enabled accurate enumeration of the entire Georges Bank herring spawning population to within 7% of the independent NOAA estimate for 2006. These results may be relevant to other oceanic fish.  aPublisher supplied data  cNorwegian Institute of Marine Research (IMR)  cOffice of Naval Research (ONR)  cNational Science Foundation (NSF) 3aClupea harengus 3aGadus morhua 3aacoustics 3adata collection 3agroup behavior 3agroup size 3aherring 3apopulation density 3aprobability distribution 3aremote sensing 3aspawning 3astandard deviation1 aGodø, Olav Rune1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8826-80681 aYi, Dong Hoon1 aMacaulay, Gavin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2518-65371 aJain, Ankita D.1 aCho, Byunggu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4926-27921 aGong, Zheng1 aJech, Josef Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7691-66431 aRatilal, Purnima0 tFish and fisheries.g2019 Mar., v. 20, no. 2 p.201-213dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867077x1467-29607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.123313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024003700134040001800171100006200189245007700251506007600328506003100404520166000435592002802095596008302123596004802206506003702254650002802291650002702319650001502346650001802361650001502379650001102394650001902405650003602424650002402460650001202484651001902496653001202515653002102527653001602548653001802564653003102582700005902613773011802672856008402790856004502874961000902919852000902928655001202937IND60723483020221207132409.0210305e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072348302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijgfs.2021.1003032chorus7 a10.1016/j.ijgfs.2021.1003032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoldavini, Jessica1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1718-235X10aCharacteristics associated with cooking frequency among college students  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe objective of this study was to determine cooking frequency and identify student characteristics associated with cooking frequency among students from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This cross-sectional study included data from 4845 students who completed an online survey in the fall of 2016. Cooking frequency was assessed using the question “How often do you cook for yourself or for others?” with the response options being “often,” “sometimes,” and “never.” Students also self-reported information on a variety of student characteristics. Descriptive statistics were calculated and associations between cooking frequency and student characteristics were assessed using Pearson's chi square tests, ANOVA, and multinomial logistic regression. Statistical significance was considered p < 0.05. Among students in the sample, 45.7% reported often cooking, 40.3% reported sometimes cooking, and 14% reported never cooking. Characteristics significantly associated with cooking frequency in the adjusted models were race/ethnicity, year in school, living on vs. off-campus, having a car, receiving financial aid, perceived health rating, weight status, having a meal plan, food security status, and perceived cooking skills. Age, gender, marital status, having dependent children, being an international student, part-time vs. full-time enrollment, and employment status were not significantly associated with cooking frequency in adjusted models. Cooking was common among college students in this sample, although there were differences in characteristics among students who reported different frequencies of cooking.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3across-sectional studies 3adescriptive statistics 3aemployment 3afood security 3agastronomy 3agender 3amarital status 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3aNorth Carolina 0aCooking 0aCollege students 0aYoung adult 0aUnited States 0aSurveys and questionnaires1 aBerner, Maureen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5786-31790 tInternational journal of gastronomy and food science.g2021 Apr., v. 23 p.100303-dElsevier B.V.x1878-450X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2021.1003033Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7234830  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005400139245016900193300001600362500002000378520201400398592002802412650001702440650001502457650002502472650001402497650001502511650002002526650001502546650001402561650001502575650002302590650001602613650001302629650001202642650001502654700001802669700001402687700001502701700001502716700002202731773012502753856007302878852000902951655001202960IND60608749420221117232555.0180808e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060874942DNAL7 a10.1111/evj.128112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoulin, N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7892-061110aSurgical repair of propagating condylar fractures of the third metacarpal/metatarsal bones with cortical screws placed in lag fashion in 26 racehorses (2007–2015)  ap. 629-635.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Despite the recommendation of plate fixation for propagating condylar fractures of the third metacarpal (McIII) or third metatarsal bone (MtIII), lag screw fixation can be a viable surgical option. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate short‐term outcome and long‐term racing performance of horses that underwent lag screw fixation of long condylar fractures of the McIII/MtIII. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Medical records, post‐surgical racing performance and outcome of 26 horses with propagating fractures of the medial and/or lateral condyle of McIII/MtIII were reviewed. Medical information included were age, breed, sex, physical examination at admission, circumstances of fracture, radiographic evaluation, anaesthesia and recovery records, surgical and post‐operative management, as well as complications. Outcome included racing data and information from telephone interviews. RESULTS: Twenty‐six horses (9 Standardbreds and 17 Thoroughbreds) were admitted with a long condylar fracture of the McIII/MtIII. Fore‐ and hindlimbs were equally represented with the left hindlimb being more frequently involved. Most of the fractures had a spiralling component (76%) and four (15%) were comminuted. Fifteen (58%) horses raced post‐surgery including nine Standardbreds (100%) and six Thoroughbreds (35%). Twelve of them were placed in at least one race and 11 won at least once. One horse sustained a severe complication in recovery. No significant difference was observed in the racing performances before and after surgery. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Follow‐up method and duration were not standardised and there is a low number of cases with six surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: Long condylar fractures can be repaired using lag fashion technique combined with a half‐limb or full‐limb tight cast for recovery as a good surgical alternative. Similar results to plate fixation can be expected, with a return to racing of more than 50%, and the prognosis being even better for pacers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThoroughbred 3aanesthesia 3aclinical examination 3ahindlimbs 3ainterviews 3amedical records 3ametacarpus 3aprognosis 3aracehorses 3aracing performance 3aradiography 3asurgeons 3asurgery 3atelephones1 aFrançois, I.1 aCoté, N.1 aAlford, C.1 aCleary, O.1 aDesjardins, M.

Diel fluctuations in pH and alkalinity were correlated with the temperature-dependent CO₂ solubility and the biologically-induced CO₂ production, both of which were higher during the night. Adsorption/desorption to/from streambed material, in particular ferrihydrite, is believed to be the main in-stream mechanism causing the observed diel variations in dissolved concentrations of As and Zn. Arsenic was mainly affected by the dual action of temperature and competing carbonate ions, whereas pH seemed less important. Temperature acted in accordance with the exothermic feature of anion sorption onto hydrous metal oxide surfaces; aqueous carbonate species exerted their competitive effect in relation to alkalinity variation. Zinc was primarily affected by temperature, in accordance with the endothermic feature of metal cation sorption onto hydrous metal oxide surfaces, and secondly by pH. Co-precipitation of As and Zn with calcite is another possible mechanism, which requires further investigation involving examination of inorganic and biological materials coating the streambed. All these processes potentially controlling the diel cycles of trace elements should be carefully considered to assess the effectiveness of remediation actions currently in progress at Baccu Locci. A normalization method for data from asynchronous sampling has been developed and proposed in order to eliminate or at least attenuate the effect of sampling time and provide an additional tool to identify the processes/mechanisms involved in trace element concentration fluctuations observed along a contaminated stream during base-flow conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalkalinity 3aarsenic 3abase flow 3acalcite 3acarbon dioxide 3acoatings 3acoprecipitation 3adesorption 3aferrihydrite 3aheat production 3ahydrochemistry 3aions 3amining 3apH 3aremediation 3asolubility 3astream channels 3atemperature 3azinc 3aItaly 3aSardinia1 aCidu, Rosa1 aArdau, Carla0 tApplied geochemistry.g2012 Sept., v. 27, no. 9 p.1844-1853dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2012.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01786naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245003600170300001400206520097000220592002801190653001901218653003001237653002501267653002001292653001101312773009101323856008501414852000901499655001201508IND60126309820221119040439.0151105e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012630982DNAL7 a10.1675/1524-4695-31.sp2.442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Peter W.10aHarlequin Ducks in Newfoundland  ap. 44-49.  aRelatively low numbers of Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) are present year-round in Newfoundland, with breeding, molting and wintering at specific areas. Breeding is largely restricted to the Great Northern Peninsula, but there is some evidence of breeding in remote areas of the eastern part of the island. A large molting concentration is present on the Grey Islands, east of the Northern Peninsula. Harlequin Ducks winter on the south coast of Newfoundland, with the largest concentration at Cape St. Mary's. Counts from Cape St. Mary's indicated Harlequin Ducks decreased through the 1980s, but have been increasing rapidly since the early 1990s. Although anecdotal, information from early sources suggests populations of Harlequin Ducks in Newfoundland are much reduced. Chronic oiling and misidentification of Harlequin Ducks by hunters remain as threats, while forestry and hydroelectric development may be potential sources of habitat reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHarlequin Duck 0aHistrionicus histrionicus 0ainsular Newfoundland 0aspecies at risk 0astatus0 tWaterbirds.g2008 Dec., v. 31, no. sp2 p.44-49dThe Waterbird Societyx1524-46957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1675%2F1524-4695-31.sp2.443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011400153300001800267520111200285592002801397650001301425650001201438650001401450650001401464650001601478650001501494650001201509650000901521650001601530650001701546650000801563650001301571700002101584700001601605700001601621700001501637700001801652700002001670700001601690700001301706700001501719773014101734856007401875852000901949655001201958IND60636810220221120235531.0190411e20190409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063681022DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta11891d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Long10aBand alignment of Pb–Sn mixed triple cation perovskites for inverted solar cells with negligible hysteresis  ap. 9154-9162.  aSubstituting the toxic lead (Pb) in Pb halide perovskites by less harmful Sn is an attractive approach towards obtaining environment-friendly perovskite solar cells. However, complete substitution of Pb by Sn undermines the stability of perovskite materials and devices. Therefore, partial substitution of Pb by Sn has attracted much interest to balance environmental considerations and device performance. Here, we exploit the Sn ratio to optimize the band alignment in Pb–Sn mixed perovskite solar cells with an inverted structure. The band edge properties of Pb–Sn mixed triple cation perovskites (Cs/MA/FAPb₁₋ₓSnₓX₃, X = Cl, Br, I) for efficient inverted solar cells are studied via simulation and experiment. The optimized solar cell with x = 0.336 shows the highest power conversion efficiency of 16.10% along with negligible hysteresis. We demonstrate that the devices are stable and maintain 93% of the initial PCE under ambient conditions for 30 days. These results suggest that bandgap engineering is a feasible approach to balance the efficiency and stability of Pb–Sn mixed PSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromides 3acations 3achemistry 3achlorides 3aengineering 3ahysteresis 3aiodides 3alead 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3atin 3atoxicity1 aZhang, Xiangzhao1 aZhang, Ting1 aWang, Yafei1 aWang, Feng1 aZhong, Zhiqin1 aChen, Zhi David1 aXiao, Zewen1 aChen, Li1 aLi, Shibin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Apr. 9, v. 7, no. 15 p.9154-9162dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta11891d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245008500178500001900263520157000282592002801852650001101880650001101891650001501902650001501917650001501932650001101947650002201958650000901980650003201989650001402021650001402035650002102049650001902070650002102089650001102110650001302121650001502134650001402149650001602163650002002179650001502199650001302214650001102227650002802238650001502266650001302281650000902294653001602303653001202319653001602331653001102347700002702358773013302385856008402518852000902602655001202611IND60723483120221123041316.0210305e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072348312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijgfs.2021.1003042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrdoñez-Araque, Roberto10aEdible insects: A food alternative for the sustainable development of the planet  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCurrently, the livestock industry occupies a large percentage of the planet's ice-free surface. In addition, it is considered one of the main factors causing environmental pollution and global warming due to the toxicity it causes in soils and due to the emission of organic matter, pathogens and drug residues in products for human consumption, therefore it becomes imperative to find a medium and long-term solution to this problem. The objective of this research is to demonstrate that insects are a viable alternative to combat nutritional deficiencies in people's diets and to slow down the deterioration of the environment. Bibliographic sources from the main databases of indexed journals were used and the literature was selected according to various inclusion criteria. The main results found were the nutritional composition of various edible insects (highlights their protein content and in mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals such as: riboflavin, pantothenic acid, biotin and folic acid; copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, selenium and zinc), the content of functional compounds (mainly peptides, terpenoids, polyphenols, glycosides and sulfur compounds), its advantage of sustainable production with the planet, the possible risks that must be taken into account at the time of its industrialization and the development of possible innovative products. This research allows us to know what the reality of edible insects is, and how their development will allow us to have a new future for the following generations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotin 3acopper 3afolic acid 3agastronomy 3aglycosides 3ahumans 3aindustrialization 3airon 3alivestock and meat industry 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anutrient content 3aorganic matter 3apantothenic acid 3apeople 3apeptides 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3apolyphenols 3aprotein content 3ariboflavin 3aselenium 3asulfur 3asustainable development 3aterpenoids 3atoxicity 3azinc 0aEntomophagy 0aFeeding 0aAlternative 0aFuture1 aEgas-Montenegro, Erika0 tInternational journal of gastronomy and food science.g2021 Apr., v. 23 p.100304-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21450x1878-450X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2021.1003043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245014800170300001600318520130100334592002801635650002201663650001701685650002401702650002001726650002501746650002601771650001201797650001301809650001901822650005001841650001401891650004301905650001901948650001501967650001301982651001001995653001302005653000902018653001502027653003402042653001802076700002202094700006302116700005702179773009102236856008202327852000902409655001202418IND60546356020221121155533.0220523e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054635602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2014.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Luque, A.J.13aAn ontological system based on MODIS images to assess ecosystem functioning of Natura 2000 habitats: A case study for Quercus pyrenaica forests  ap. 142-151.  aThe implementation of the Natura 2000 network requires methods to assess the conservation status of habitats. This paper shows a methodological approach that combines the use of (satellite) Earth observation with ontologies to monitor Natura 2000 habitats and assess their functioning. We have created an ontological system called Savia that can describe both the ecosystem functioning and the behaviour of abiotic factors in a Natura 2000 habitat. This system is able to automatically download images from MODIS products, create indicators and compute temporal trends for them. We have developed an ontology that takes into account the different concepts and relations about indicators and temporal trends, and the spatio-temporal components of the datasets. All the information generated from datasets and MODIS images, is stored into a knowledge base according to the ontology. Users can formulate complex questions using a SPARQL end-point. This system has been tested and validated in a case study that uses Quercus pyrenaica Willd. forests as a target habitat in Sierra Nevada (Spain), a Natura 2000 site. We assess ecosystem functioning using NDVI. The selected abiotic factor is snow cover. Savia provides useful data regarding these two variables and reflects relationships between them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus pyrenaica 3acase studies 3aconservation status 3adata collection 3aecological footprint 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aimage analysis 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amountains 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asnowpack 3aSpain 0aOntology 0aNDVI 0aSnow cover 0a(satellite) Earth observation 0aSierra Nevada1 aPérez-Pérez, R.1 aBonet-García, F.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3145-89221 aMagaña, P.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0223-24250 tITC journal.g2015 May, v. 37 p.142-151dElsevier B.V.wJournal:22337x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2014.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245012300178300001600301520134300317592002801660650002301688650001901711650001701730650000901747650001301756650001101769650001501780650001001795650003101805650001001836650000901846650002301855650001701878650001801895650001201913650001801925650001301943650002101956650001501977650001401992650002202006650002002028650001302048650002002061653002102081653001602102653002002118653001302138653001602151653001102167700002802178700002402206700002302230700002402253773013402277856008502411852000902496655001202505IND60723483220221117171713.0210527e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072348322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2021.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRagasa, Lorenz Rhuel P.10aTranscriptome analysis reveals involvement of oxidative stress response in a copper-tolerant Fusarium oxysporum strain  ap. 435-446.  aHigh amount of copper is toxic to most organisms, but endophytic fungi can develop survival strategies to tolerate and respond to environmental stressors such as heavy metal contaminants. While high copper induces oxidative stress, it is still unclear which genes are associated with copper tolerance. Here, we performed a metatranscriptome analysis of endophytic fungi isolated from a black nightshade plant Solanum nigrum L. growing on mine tailings of a gold processing area. Initial screening revealed the presence of a copper-tolerant strain of Fusarium oxysporum, designated as IB-SN1W, which tolerated up to 1000 ppm and 300 ppm copper in solid and liquid media, respectively. Differential gene expression analysis by RNA sequencing showed that 23% of contigs are uniquely expressed in the copper-treated fungus. These genes are involved in copper ion import, polyamine transport, oxidoreductase activity, and oxidative stress response. Catalase transcripts were also highly upregulated in IB-SN1W compared to a non-tolerant F. oxysporum strain. Catalase inhibition decreased copper-tolerance in IB-SN1W, while the addition of antioxidants prevented the copper-dependent growth inhibition in the non-tolerant strain. Overall, these results suggest that oxidative stress response contributes to copper tolerance in F. oxysporum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aSolanum nigrum 3aantioxidants 3aarea 3acatalase 3acopper 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agold 3agrowth retardation 3aheavy metals 3aion transport 3aliquids 3amine tailings 3amycology 3aoxidative stress 3apolyamines 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 3astress response 3atoxicity 3atranscriptomics 0aFungal endophyte 0aHeavy metal 0aTranscriptomics 0aCatalase 0aAntioxidant 0aRNAseq1 aJoson, Santiago Emil A.1 aBagay, Windy Lou R.1 aPerez, Teresita R.1 aVelarde, Michael C.0 tFungal biology.g2021 June, v. 125, no. 6 p.435-446dElsevier LtdaBritish Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2021.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245014100180300001400321520167200335592002802007650002602035650002302061650001502084650001602099650002302115650001402138650001302152650001502165650001402180650001202194650002002206653002102226653001902247653002502266653002502291653002602316700002502342700002102367700002702388773009702415856009002512852000902602655001202611IND60639291620221122211735.0200106e20190615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063929162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.04.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuzan, Audrey Daning10aIs individual variation in metabolic rate related to growth of spiny lobster in culture and what is the influence of social interaction?  ap. 66-75.  aResearch with a variety of aquatic ectotherms suggests that variation in individual metabolic rate (i.e., metabolic phenotype) can be a factor that influences the behaviour and growth of individuals. Slow growth, growth disparity and growth depensation have been reported as major drawbacks to spiny lobster production which is thought to be associated with agonistic behaviour of dominant individuals controlling a disproportional share of food resources. Our study examined the relationship between individual variation of metabolic phenotypes (standard, routine and active metabolic rates and aerobic scope), and growth performance of juvenile spiny lobster, Sagmariasus verreauxi (5.99 ± 0.46 g) that were reared either individually (n = 20) or communally as a group of 20 for 90 days. Growth performance and feed intake were significantly higher in communal rearing demonstrating that social interaction is important for promoting growth of spiny lobsters. There was a positive relationship between standard metabolic rate, routine metabolic rate and growth in individually reared lobsters indicating a direct link between metabolic phenotype and growth of lobsters in the absence of social interaction. There was no relationship between metabolic phenotype and growth in communal rearing suggesting that social interactions outweigh the direct link between metabolic rate and lobster growth. The results demonstrate for the first time that growth performance of spiny lobsters can be linked with individual variation in metabolic status however social behaviour plays a more dominant role in determining growth of this naturally gregarious species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSagmariasus verreauxi 3aagonistic behavior 3aectothermy 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3ajuveniles 3alobsters 3ametabolism 3aphenotype 3arearing 3asocial behavior 0aSocial behaviour 0aMetabolic rate 0aIndividual variation 0aEastern rock lobster 0aSagmariasus verreauxi1 aFitzgibbon, Quinn P.1 aCarter, Chris G.1 aBattaglene, Stephen C.0 tAquaculture.g2019 June 15, v. 508 p.66-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.04.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03616naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245016500206300001600371520163400387592002802021650002902049650001102078650001802089650002002107650001402127650002802141650001002169650002202179650002102201650003002222650001702252650001402269650001402283650000902297650001402306653000802320653000802328653000802336653000702344653000902351653000902360653002902369653001902398653002002417653001302437653001902450653002102469653002102490653001502511653002102526700005802547700001402605700001802619700001802637700001702655700001702672700001802689700001702707773012602724856008302850852000902933655001202942IND60723483320221123041320.0211219s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072348332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2020.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Mingbang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5989-537710aVirulence factor-related gut microbiota genes and immunoglobulin A levels as novel markers for machine learning-based classification of autism spectrum disorder  ap. 545-554.  aAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition for which early identification and intervention is crucial for optimum prognosis. Our previous work showed gut Immunoglobulin A (IgA) to be significantly elevated in the gut lumen of children with ASD compared to typically developing (TD) children. Gut microbiota variations have been reported in ASD, yet not much is known about virulence factor-related gut microbiota (VFGM) genes. Upon determining the VFGM genes distinguishing ASD from TD, this study is the first to utilize VFGM genes and IgA levels for a machine learning-based classification of ASD. Sequence comparisons were performed of metagenome datasets from children with ASD (n = 43) and TD children (n = 31) against genes in the virulence factor database. VFGM gene composition was associated with ASD phenotype. VFGM gene diversity was higher in children with ASD and positively correlated with IgA content. As Group B streptococcus (GBS) genes account for the highest proportion of 24 different VFGMs between ASD and TD and positively correlate with gut IgA, GBS genes were used in combination with IgA and VFGMs diversity to distinguish ASD from TD. Given that VFGM diversity, increases in IgA, and ASD-enriched VFGM genes were independent of sex and gastrointestinal symptoms, a classification method utilizing them will not pertain only to a specific subgroup of ASD. By introducing the classification value of VFGM genes and considering that VFs can be isolated in pregnant women and newborns, these findings provide a novel machine learning-based early risk identification method for ASD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aautism 3abiotechnology 3adata collection 3adatabases 3agastrointestinal system 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametagenomics 3aphenotype 3aprognosis 3arisk 3avirulence 0aASD 0aIgA 0aLPS 0aTD 0aVFDB 0aVFGM 0aAutism spectrum disorder 0aClassification 0aEarly diagnosis 0aGenetics 0aGut microbiota 0aImmunoglobulin A 0aMachine learning 0aMetagenome 0aVirulence factor1 aDoenyas, Ceymi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4809-87191 aWan, Jing1 aZeng, Shujuan1 aCai, Chunquan1 aZhou, Jiaxiu1 aLiu, Yanqing1 aYin, Zhaoqing1 aZhou, Wenhao0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2021, v. 19 p.545-554dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013700166300001300303520151700316592002801833650001501861650001901876650001301895650002201908650001701930650001901947650002701966650000901993650001102002650000702013650001302020650002302033700002002056700002002076773010802096856008102204852000902285655001202294IND60080085120221121031236.0150216e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008008512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-014-2023-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgawa, Shouhei10aContribution of Hydroxyapatite and Ferrihydrite in Combined Applications for the Removal of Lead and Antimony from Aqueous Solutions  ap. 2023.  aIn this study, lead (Pb) and antimony (Sb) sorption experiments were conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of Pb and Sb sorption by combined applications using single or combined applications of hydroxyapatite (HAP) and ferrihydrite (FH), to evaluate the contribution of each material in Pb and Sb sorption, and to assess the chemical stability of the sorbed Pb and Sb. In the combined application, isotherms of Pb sorption and Sb sorption were well fitted to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models, respectively. The Pb and Sb amounts sorbed in the combined application were the same levels as the summed totals of those sorbed in the single applications, indicating that in the combined application, Pb sorption and Sb sorption were not suppressed. Pb was mainly sorbed on HAP in the combined application, at a 90 % level of the total adsorbed Pb. The HAP and FH contributions to Sb sorption were 32 and 68 % of the total adsorbed Sb, respectively, and Sb was sorbed on each material independently even in the combined application. The percentages of both Pb and Sb dissolved from the sorbed materials in the combined applications at pH 4 and 6 were the same levels as those in the single applications. However, the percentages of Sb dissolved in both combined and single applications were high at an alkaline pH. These results suggest that HAP and FH in a combined application would be useful for simultaneous Pb and Sb immobilization in soil with acidic to neutral pH, but not in soil with an alkaline pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3aalkaline soils 3aantimony 3aaqueous solutions 3aferrihydrite 3ahydroxyapatite 3aimmobilization in soil 3alead 3amodels 3apH 3asorption 3asorption isotherms1 aKatoh, Masahiko1 aSatō, Takeshi,0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2014 July, v. 225, no. 7 p.2023-2023dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-014-2023-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245016700173300001800340520189500358592002802253650001302281650001202294650001902306650002302325650001602348650002102364650001302385650002302398650001102421650000902432650001902441650001502460651001402475700002102489700002202510700002202532700002002554700001802574700001502592773009502607856008702702852000902789655001202798IND60085101620221120035103.0141101e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008510162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2012.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCartwright, Ian10aConstraining groundwater flow, residence times, inter-aquifer mixing, and aquifer properties using environmental isotopes in the southeast Murray Basin, Australia  ap. 1698-1709.  aEnvironmental isotopes (particularly δ¹⁸O, δ²H, and δ¹³C values, ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratios, and a¹⁴C) constrain geochemical processes, recharge distribution and rates, and inter-aquifer mixing in the Riverine Province of the southern Murray Basin. Due to methanogenesis and the variable δ¹³C values of matrix calcite, δ¹³C values are highly variable and it is difficult to correct ¹⁴C ages using δ¹³C values alone. In catchments where δ¹³C values, ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratios, and major ion geochemistry yield similar a¹⁴C corrections, ∼15% of the C is derived from the aquifer matrix in the silicate-dominated aquifers, and this value may be used to correct ages in other catchments. Most groundwater has a¹⁴C above background (∼2pMC) implying that residence times are <30ka. Catchments containing saline groundwater generally record older ¹⁴C ages compared to catchments that contain lower salinity groundwater, which is consistent with evapotranspiration being the major hydrogeochemical process. However, some low salinity groundwater in the west of the Riverine Province has residence times of >30ka probably resulting from episodic recharge during infrequent high rainfall episodes. Mixing between shallower and deeper groundwater results in ¹⁴C ages being poorly correlated with distance from the basin margins in many catchments; however, groundwater flow in palaeovalleys where the deeper Calivil–Renmark Formation is coarser grained and has high hydraulic conductivities is considerably more simple with little inter-aquifer mixing. Despite the range of ages, δ¹⁸O and δ²H values of groundwater in the Riverine Province do not preserve a record of changing climate; this is probably due to the absence of extreme climatic variations, such as glaciations, and the fact that the area is not significantly impacted by monsoonal systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acalcite 3aclimate change 3aevapotranspiration 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3aisotopes 3amethane production 3amixing 3arain 3awater salinity 3awatersheds 3aAustralia1 aWeaver, Tamie R.1 aCendón, Dioni I.1 aFifield, L.

HDBPs were found in samples from all locations studied. Concentrations of total HDBPs (ΣHDBPs) ranged from 0.4 ng/g lipid weight in ringed seals (Phoca hispida) from the White Sea to 2,540 ng/g lipid weight in Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) from the northwestern North Pacific Ocean. At their highest levels, ΣHDBPs made up 11% of the total quantitated organohalogen body burden of adult male Dall's porpoises. In two beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) data subsets, it was found that males contained significantly higher concentrations of ΣHDBPs than females. No significant effects of age or sex on ΣHDBPs were observed in harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) data subsets. The geographical distribution of concentrations did not resemble that of the ubiquitous anthropogenic organohalogen, polychlorinated biphenyl congener CB-153. Higher concentrations of HDBPs and different patterns of congeners were observed in samples from Pacific as opposed to non–Pacific Ocean influenced environments. Concentrations of HDBPs in beluga from the Arctic and St. Lawrence River were similar. Their high abundance in north Pacific Ocean biota and widespread occurrence suggest that HDBPs undergo extensive transport from a source located primarily in the Pacific Ocean. Evidence from HDBP congener patterns indicates that both ocean currents and atmospheric transport likely play a role in the movement of HDBPs. These results imply that HDBPs and anthropogenic organohalogens have different sources and support the natural production hypothesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBalaena mysticetus 3aDelphinapterus leucas 3aPhoca vitulina 3aPhocoenidae 3aPusa hispida 3aadults 3ablubber 3afemales 3ageographical distribution 3amales 3amarine mammals 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 2aAdipose Tissuexchemistry 2aAnimals 2aDolphins 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFemale 2aHalogensxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aMale 2aPyrrolesxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aSeals, Earless 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aWhales 3aArctic region 3aPacific Ocean 3aSaint Lawrence River 0aArctic regions. 0aPacific Ocean1 aBorrell, A.1 aDuffe, J.1 aDuignan, P.

Gene expression of fabp2 was observed in all tissues investigated, although differences were observed between isoforms. The highest fabp2a1, fabp2a2, and fabp2b expression was in the intestine. A 15kDa protein, corresponding to putative Fabp2 protein, was identified by immunoblotting using anti-human Fabp2 antibody. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry confirmed that Fabp2 protein was present in most Atlantic salmon tissues. Similar to gene expression, intestinal tissues had the highest Fabp2 protein levels, decreasing gradually from proximal to distal intestine. During development of distal intestinal inflammation caused by dietary soybean meal from 0 to 21days, Fabp2 decreased significantly on both transcriptional and protein levels. The reduction in Fabp2 was preceded by a down regulation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (ppar) alpha and gamma, fabp2's presumed regulatory proteins, and followed by a progressive increase in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Pcna) staining. Results illustrate that the early decline of distal intestinal fabp2 was likely caused by a down regulation of their regulatory proteins, but at later time points reduced Fabp2 may largely be due to a less mature enterocyte population resulting from rapid cell turnover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aantibodies 3acomplementary DNA 3adiet 3aenteritis 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aimmunoblotting 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aregulatory proteins 3asoybean meal 3atranscription (genetics) 0aDI 0afabp/Fabp 0afabp1/Fabp1 0afabp2/Fabp2 0aFM 0agapdh 0ahprt1 0apcna/Pcna 0appar/Ppar 0arnapolII 0aSBM 0aAtlantic salmon 0aDistal intestine 0aInflammation 0aFabp2 0aIntestinal-fatty-acid-binding protein 0aPcna 0aPpar 0aSoybean meal1 aPenn, Michael H.1 aThorsen, Jim1 aGu, Jinni1 aKortner, Trond M.1 aKrogdahl, Åshild1 aBakke, Anne Marie0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2013 Jan., v. 164 p.229-240dElsevier Inc.x1095-64337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014200170300001600312520105300328592002801381650001401409650001701423650001601440650001501456650001101471650002001482650001101502650002001513650001601533700001801549700001901567700001701586773008001603856008601683852000901769655001201778IND60084960020221121151625.0141101e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008496002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.05.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJhu, Can-Yong10aThermal runaway potential of LiCoO₂ and Li(Ni₁/₃Co₁/₃Mn₁/₃)O₂ batteries determined with adiabatic calorimetry methodology  ap. 127-131.  aThermal runaway hazards related to adiabatic runaway reactions in various 18650 Li-ion batteries were studied in an adiabatic calorimeter with vent sizing package 2 (VSP2). We selected two cathode types, LiCoO₂ and Li(Ni₁/₃Co₁/₃Mn₁/₃)O₂, and tested Li-ion batteries to determine the thermal runaway features. The charged 18650 Li-ion batteries were tested to evaluate the thermal hazard characteristics, such as the initial exothermic temperature (T₀), self-heating rate (dT/dt), pressure rise rate (dP/dt), pressure–temperature profiles, maximum temperature (Tₘₐₓ) and pressure (Pₘₐₓ), which are measured by VSP2 with a customized stainless steel test can. The thermal reaction behaviors of the Li-ion battery packs were shown to be an important safety concern for energy storage systems for power supply applications. The thermal abuse trials of the adiabatic calorimetry methodology used to classify the self-reactive ratings of the various cathodes for Li-ion batteries provided the safety design considerations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acalorimeters 3acalorimetry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aheat production 3aoxygen 3astainless steel 3atemperature1 aWang, Yih-Wen1 aWen, Chia-Yuan1 aShu, Chi-Min0 tApplied energy.g2012 Dec., v. 100 p.127-131dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.05.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009000168300001600258520173100274592002802005650000802033650001202041650001802053650001002071650002202081650002602103650001002129650001502139650001402154650001602168653003502184653002002219653000902239653000902248653001802257653001002275700002202285700001802307773012602325856008302451852000902534655001202543IND60723483520221123041313.0211219s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072348352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2020.12.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabinowitz, Tom10aImproved noninvasive fetal variant calling using standardized benchmarking approaches  ap. 509-517.  aThe technology of noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) enables risk-free detection of genetic conditions in the fetus, by analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal blood. For chromosomal abnormalities, NIPT often effectively replaces invasive tests (e.g. amniocentesis), although it is considered as screening rather than diagnostics. Most recently, the NIPT has been applied to genome-wide, comprehensive genotyping of the fetus using cfDNA, i.e. identifying all its genetic variants and mutations. Previously, we suggested that NIPD should be treated as a special case of variant calling, and presented Hoobari, the first software tool for noninvasive fetal variant calling. Using a unique pipeline, we were able to comprehensively decipher the inheritance of SNPs and indels. A few caveats still exist in this pipeline. Performance was lower for indels and biparental loci (i.e. where both parents carry the same mutation), and performance was not uniform across the genome. Here we utilized standardized methods for benchmarking of variant calling pipelines and applied them to noninvasive fetal variant calling. By using the best performing pipeline and by focusing on coding regions, we showed that noninvasive fetal genotyping greatly improves performance, particularly in indels and biparental loci. These results emphasize the importance of using widely accepted concepts to describe the challenge of genome-wide NIPT of point mutations; and demonstrate a benchmarking process for the first time in this field. This study brings genome-wide and complete NIPD closer to the clinic; while potentially alleviating uncertainty and anxiety during pregnancy, and promoting informed choices among families and physicians.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanxiety 3abiotechnology 3ablood 3acomputer software 3adiagnostic techniques 3afetus 3agenotyping 3apregnancy 3auncertainty 0aNoninvasive prenatal diagnosis 0aVariant calling 0aNIPT 0aNIPD 0acell-free DNA 0acfDNA1 aDeri-Rozov, Shira1 aShomron, Noam0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2021, v. 19 p.509-517dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.12.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01480naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010600153300002000259520039700279592002800676650002600704650001800730650002100748650001700769650001500786650001100801650001800812700001400830700001700844700002000861700001400881700001500895773012500910856007401035852000901109655001201118IND60669358320221122165240.0190920e20151020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066935832DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra17651d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Qun10aCuO/I₂-mediated intramolecular annulation for the synthesis of 2-aroyl-3-hydroxy-4-iodonaphthalenes  ap. 89427-89430.  aA novel strategy has been developed for the direct synthesis of 2-aroyl-3-hydroxy-4-iodonaphthalenes from easily available (Z)-2-(hetero)arylidene-1-(hetero)arylbutane-1,3-diones in the presence of copper(ii) oxide and iodine.

Two alternative detention models, based on Reservoir Routing and Richard’s Equation, were validated against the measured green roof runoff and temporary moisture storage data. Once the moisture content exceeds local field capacity, its response at different depths occurs simultaneously during storms, although the recorded data indicate a vertical gradient in the absolute values of local field capacity. Both Reservoir Routing and Richard’s Equation can provide reasonable estimations of the runoff and the vertical moisture content profiles, although Richard’s Equation exhibited stronger vertical water content gradients than were observed in practise. The vertical water content profile is not sensitive to the soil water release curve, although the hydraulic conductivity function influences both the vertical water content profile and runoff rate. The modelled results are highly sensitive to the bottom boundary condition, with a constant suction head boundary condition providing a more suitable option than a free drainage boundary condition or a seepage boundary condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrainage 3aequations 3afield capacity 3agreen roofs 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aphysical properties 3arunoff 3aseepage 3asimulation models 3asoil water 3asoil water characteristic 3astorms 3awater content 0aGreen roof 0aSubstrate 0aDetention modelling 0aMoisture content 0aSoil water release curve (SWRC) 0aHydraulic conductivity function (HCF)1 aSmith, Colin1 aStovin, Virginia0 tJournal of hydrology.g2019 June, v. 573 p.872-884dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245016900206300001600375506007600391520158200467592002802049506003702077650002302114650002002137650002302157650001002180650001002190650002802200650001002228650001102238650001602249650001002265650001502275651001002290700002002300700002202320700001902342773009602361856008102457852000902538655001202547IND60583555020221207115034.0171018e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058355502DNAL7 a10.1007/s00572-017-0788-62doi7 aPMC56454512pmcid7 a287070272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Shuzheng10aRoot-associated fungal communities in three Pyroleae species and their mycobiont sharing with surrounding trees in subalpine coniferous forests on Mount Fuji, Japan  ap. 733-745.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPyroleae species are perennial understory shrubs, many of which are partial mycoheterotrophs. Most fungi colonizing Pyroleae roots are ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and share common mycobionts with their Pyroleae hosts. However, such mycobiont sharing has neither been examined in depth before nor has the interspecific variation in sharing among Pyroleae species. Here, we examined root-associated fungal communities in three co-existing Pyroleae species, including Pyrola alpina, Pyrola incarnata, and Orthilia secunda, with reference to co-existing ECM fungi on the surrounding trees in the same soil blocks in subalpine coniferous forests. We identified 42, 75, and 18 fungal molecular operational taxonomic units in P. alpina, P. incarnata, and O. secunda roots, respectively. Mycobiont sharing with surrounding trees, which was defined as the occurrence of the same mycobiont between Pyroleae and surrounding trees in each soil block, was most frequent among P. incarnata (31 of 44 plants). In P. alpina, sharing was confirmed in 12 of 37 plants, and the fungal community was similar to that of P. incarnata. Mycobiont sharing was least common in O. secunda, found in only 5 of 32 plants. Root-associated fungi of O. secunda were dominated by Wilcoxina species, which were absent from the surrounding ECM roots in the same soil blocks. These results indicate that mycobiont sharing with surrounding trees does not equally occur among Pyroleae plants, some of which may develop independent mycorrhizal associations with ECM fungi, as suggested in O. secunda at our research sites.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconiferous forests 3aectomycorrhizae 3afungal communities 3afungi 3ahosts 3ainterspecific variation 3aroots 3ashrubs 3asoil blocks 3atrees 3aunderstory 3aJapan1 aNakano, Takashi1 aHattori, Masahira1 aNara, Kazuhide0 tMycorrhiza.g2017 Nov., v. 27, no. 8 p.733-745dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0940-63607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-017-0788-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245008200166300001400248520131800262592002801580650002401608650001101632650001301643650001901656650002301675650001601698700001701714773011601731856008201847852000901929655001201938IND60561652120221116141921.0170121e20160114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056165212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b088172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKenny, Elise
P.10aBenchmarking Calculations of Excitonic Couplings between Bacteriochlorophylls  ap. 25-32.  aExcitonic couplings between (bacterio)chlorophyll molecules are necessary for simulating energy transport in photosynthetic complexes. Many techniques for calculating the couplings are in use, from the simple (but inaccurate) point-dipole approximation to fully quantum-chemical methods. We compared several approximations to determine their range of applicability, noting that the propagation of experimental uncertainties poses a fundamental limit on the achievable accuracy. In particular, the uncertainty in crystallographic coordinates yields an uncertainty of about 20% in the calculated couplings. Because quantum-chemical corrections are smaller than 20% in most biologically relevant cases, their considerable computational cost is rarely justified. We therefore recommend the electrostatic TrEsp method across the entire range of molecular separations and orientations because its cost is minimal and it generally agrees with quantum-chemical calculations to better than the geometric uncertainty. Understanding these uncertainties can guard against striving for unrealistic precision; at the same time, detailed benchmarks can allow important qualitative questionswhich do not depend on the precise values of the simulation parametersto be addressed with greater confidence about the conclusions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteriochlorophyll 3aenergy 3ageometry 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysical chemistry 3auncertainty1 aKassal, Ivan0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 Jan. 14, v. 120, no. 1 p.25-32dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.5b088173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245010900214300001600323520178700339592002802126650002102154650002602175650002102201650002402222650001502246650002002261650001002281650002202291650002602313650002202339650002202361650001502383650001402398650001702412650001602429650002002445653000902465653002302474653001802497653001702515653002002532653002002552700002002572700002102592700002302613700001902636773010902655856008602764852000902850655001202859IND60540364720221121231828.0190318e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054036472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2015.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalbot, Jennifer M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6424-413310aFunctional guild classification predicts the enzymatic role of fungi in litter and soil biogeochemistry  ap. 441-456.  aLinking community composition to ecosystem function is a challenge in complex microbial communities. We tested the hypothesis that key biological features of fungi - evolutionary history, functional guild, and abundance of functional genes – can predict the biogeochemical activity of fungal species during decay. We measured the activity of 10 different enzymes produced by 48 model fungal species on leaf litter in laboratory microcosms. Taxa included closely related species with different ecologies (i.e. species in different “functional guilds”) and species with publicly available genomes. Decomposition capabilities differed less among phylogenetic lineages of fungi than among different functional guilds. Activity of carbohydrases and acid phosphatase was significantly higher in litter colonized by saprotrophs compared to ectomycorrhizal species. By contrast, oxidoreductase activities per unit fungal biomass were statistically similar across functional guilds, with white rot fungi having highest polyphenol oxidase activity and ectomycorrhizal fungi having highest peroxidase activity. On the ecosystem level, polyphenol oxidase activity in soil correlated with the abundance of white rot fungi, while soil peroxidase activity correlated with the abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in soil. Copy numbers of genes coding for different enzymes explained the activity of some carbohydrases and polyphenol oxidase produced by fungi in culture, but were not significantly better predictors of activity than specific functional guild. Collectively, our data suggest that quantifying the specific functional guilds of fungi in soil, potentially through environmental sequencing approaches, allows us to predict activity of enzymes that drive soil biogeochemical cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid phosphatase 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acatechol oxidase 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aectomycorrhizae 3agenes 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobial culture 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aperoxidase 3aphylogeny 3aplant litter 3asaprotrophs 3awhite-rot fungi 0aSoil 0aFungal communities 0aDecomposition 0aCarbon cycle 0aEctomycorrhizal 0aBiogeochemistry1 aMartin, Francis1 aKohler, Annegret1 aHenrissat, Bernard1 aPeay, Kabir G.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2015 Sept., v. 88 p.441-456dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2015.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014400173520142600317592002801743650001601771650002301787650002601810650001301836650002601849650001601875651001301891653002001904653001901924653001901943653004301962653002202005700002002027773009402047856008602141852000902227655001202236IND60756623220221119152913.0220214e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075662322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e083722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTepakhan, Wanicha10aRapid molecular diagnostics of large deletional β0-thalassemia (3.5 kb and 45 kb) using colorimetric LAMP in various thalassemia genotypes  aβ-thalassemia is an inherited disorder that is reported worldwide. Two common β⁰-thalassemia mutations (3.5 kb and 45 kb deletions) are prevalent in Southeast Asia and Thailand. Identification of these defects is essential to population screening and prenatal diagnosis. We aimed to develop colorimetric LAMP based on a phenol red indicator and validate it on various thalassemia genotypes. Colorimetric LAMP assays for detecting β⁰-thalassemia 3.5- and 45-kb deletions were developed and validated on 254 routine clinical samples. The results of the assays could be interpreted by the naked eye and compared with the gold standard gap-PCR. A total of 254 samples related to seven phenotypes and 27 different genotype groups showed 100% concordance between the colorimetric LAMP assays and gap-PCR for detecting β⁰-thalassemia (3.5- and 45-kb deletions). The sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV were calculated as 100% for both β⁰-thalassemia 3.5- and 45-kb deletion detection. The comparison of the usefulness of colorimetric LAMP assays and conventional methods was demonstrated in this study. The developed colorimetric LAMP assays are rapid, simple, and highly cost effective and can be interpreted by the naked eye. These assays should be applied for screening deletional β⁰-thalassemia in routine settings or small community hospitals in remote areas where thalassemia is highly heterogeneous.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolorimetry 3acost effectiveness 3adiagnostic techniques 3agenotype 3aphenolsulfonphthalein 3athalassemia 3aThailand 0a3.5 kb deletion 0a45 kb deletion 0aβ-thalassemia 0aLoop-mediated isothermal amplification 0aMolecular testing1 aJomoui, Wittaya0 tHeliyon.g2021 Nov., v. 7, no. 11 p.e08372-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e083723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245013800163300001600301520163200317592002801949650002001977650001401997650002302011650002202034650002302056650001102079650002102090650002702111650001202138650001502150700002002165700001702185700001802202700001402220700003602234700001802270773009902288856004802387852000902435655001202444IND4484002020221118040115.0120715e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448400202DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-010-4266-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, WenJue11aAgas chromatography/mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous analysis of 50 phenols in wastewater using deconvolution technology  ap. 275-284.  aPhenolic compounds exist widely in the influents and effluents of sewage treatment plants (STPs) and most are un-regulated. In this study, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method for the simultaneous analysis of 50 phenolic compounds in wastewater was developed. Deconvolution technology was used to identify contaminants that are covered by co-extracted materials. A mass spectral library containing all 50 silylated phenolic compounds was first established and used for deconvolution. Twelve typical phenolic compounds were selected to optimize the sample preparation procedures. Solid-phase extraction using a C18 cartridge coupled with an HLB cartridge was used for pre-concentration and dichloromethane was used for elution. The solutes were derivatized and analyzed by GC-MS. The blank and matrix spike recoveries ranged from 57.46% to 136.4% and 47.87% to 114.8%, respectively. Method detection limits ranged from 3.64 to 97.64 ng Lâ1. The relative standard deviations of all the recovery experiments were lower than 13.6%. The instrument limits of quantification ranged from 0.7 to 87.7 pg. The method has been applied to analyze the influents and effluents of 5 Chinese STPs. Except for regulated phenolic compounds (phenol and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol), three un-regulated phenolic compounds, including 2-chlorophenol, 2,5-dichlorophenol and 2,4-dichloro-3-ethyl-6-nitrophenol were identified in the effluent wastewater. The detected concentrations of un-regulated phenolic compounds could possibly cause environmental effects, indicating that immediate attention is required to prevent complications.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3aeffluents 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amethylene chloride 3aphenol 3asewage treatment 3asolid phase extraction 3asolutes 3awastewater1 aWang, Donghong,1 aXu, Xiaowei,1 aWang, Bingyi,1 aLuo, Qian1 aSenthil Kumaran, Satyanarayanan1 aWang, Zijian,0 tChinese science bulletin.g2011 Jan., v. 56, no. 3 p.275-284dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-010-4266-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245014400161300001600305500001400321520117300335592002801508650000801536650002101544650003001565650002201595650001801617650001601635650002401651650001401675650001401689653003001703653003301733653003701766653004101803653003701844700001901881700001901900700002101919773018301940856007302123852000902196655001202205IND60692254620221122021426.0200502e20070223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069225462DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.605322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTORIGOE, Hidetaka10aMutational Analyses of a Single-Stranded Telomeric DNA Binding Domain of Fission Yeast Pot1: Conflict with X-Ray Crystallographic Structure  ap. 481-490.  aNAL-light  aTo understand the telomere regulation mechanism in relation to cell aging and cancer, we examined the single-stranded telomeric DNA binding domain (ssDBD) of fission yeast telomere-binding protein Pot1 by constructing a series of deletion mutants. We found that Pot1(1–182) (amino acids 1–182) stably expressed in Escherichia coli without any degradation retained a stable folded structure and functional telomeric DNA binding activity, indicating that Pot1(1–182) corresponds to ssDBD. We investigated the amino acids of Pot1(1–182) involved in single-stranded telomeric DNA recognition by constructing a series of site-directed mutants. Although the previously reported X-ray crystallographic structure suggests that 12 amino acids contact the telomeric DNA, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and isothermal titration calorimetry analyses of the binding ability of the site-directed mutants indicated that only five amino acids significantly contributed to telomeric DNA recognition. We conclude that the contribution to recognition is quite different in magnitude among the amino acids judged to contact the target by X-ray crystallographic structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiotechnology 3acalorimetry 3agel electrophoresis 3atelomeres 3atitration 0atelomeric DNA recognition 0atelomeric DNA binding domain 0aX-ray crystallographic structure 0aelectrophoretic mobility shift assay 0aisothermal titration calorimetry1 aDOHMAE, Naoshi1 aHANAOKA, Fumio1 aFurukawa, Ayako,0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2007 Feb. 23, v. 71, no. 2 p.481-490dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.605323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245017600164300001400340520169100354592002802045650001302073650002302086650001102109650003702120650001302157650001202170700002302182700002402205773011302229856004802342852000902390655001202399IND50062425120221119140726.0130322e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006242512DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623604130100252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozin, V.

However, recent studies demonstrated the importance of inductive processes whose significant element is cellular signaling. Our data argue the conditional specification of a number of cell lines at the early stages of development of the mollusk Testudinalia testudinalis (Testudinalia tessellata, Patellogastropoda), including the period when the determination of the 3D cell takes place, which is accompanied by a change in the shape and establishing of contacts with animal micromeres by one of the macromeres of the third quartet. Exactly at this moment activation of MAPK was registered in the 3D blastomere-organizer. An analysis of the influence of the U0126 inhibitor of the MAP kinase pathway on the development of Testudinalia revealed that the greatest effect of the inhibitor was observed if the treatment of embryos was performed until the sixth cycle of cleavage. Notably, the degree of defects correlates with the concentration increase. Absence of the functioning retractor, disorganization of the muscle system, and abnormal structure of the shell (to the extent of complete absence of the shell), as well as velum, foot, and mantle fold, were observed in a considerable part of larvae after a lengthy bathing of the embryos in the U0126 solution. At the same time, none of the experiments showed a complete disruption of the specification of the dorsoventral axis, which produces a larva with a tetramerous radial symmetry. Our data indicate the existence of various molecular mechanisms of determination of the secondary body axis among the animals from the group Spiralia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMollusca 3acell communication 3alarvae 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amolluscs 3amuscles1 aBabakhanova, R.

Here, we examine the responses to H₂O₂ in Gigaspora margarita, an AM fungus containing the endobacterial symbiont Candidatus Glomeribacter gigasporarum (CaGg). Previous studies revealed that G. margarita with its endobacterium produces more ATP and has higher respiratory activity than a cured line that lacks the endobacterium. This higher bioenergetic potential leads to higher production of ROS and to a higher ROS-detoxifying capacity, suggesting a direct or indirect role of the endobacterium in modulating fungal antioxidant responses. To test the hypothesis that the fungal–endobacterial symbiosis may enhance the fitness of the AM fungus in the presence of oxidative stress, we treated the fungus with a sublethal concentration of H₂O₂ and performed RNA-seq analysis. Our results demonstrate that (i) irrespective of the endobacterium presence, G. margarita faces oxidative stress by activating multiple metabolic processes (methionine oxidation, sulfur uptake, the pentose phosphate pathway, activation of ROS-scavenger genes); (ii) in the presence of its endobacterium, G. margarita upregulates some metabolic pathways, like chromatin status modifications and iron metabolism; and (iii) contrary to our hypothesis, the cured line responds to H₂O₂ by activating the transcription of specific ROS scavengers. We confirmed the RNA-seq findings by measuring the glutathione and ascorbate concentration, which was the same in both lines after H₂O₂ treatment. We conclude that both fungal lines may face oxidative stress, but they activate alternative strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGigaspora margarita 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aantioxidant activity 3achromatin 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglutathione 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon absorption 3ametabolism 3amethionine 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3apentose phosphate cycle 3asequence analysis 3asulfur 3asymbionts 3atranscription (genetics) 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 ade Pinto, Maria Concetta1 aNovero, Mara1 aGhignone, Stefano1 aSalvioli, Alessandra1 aBonfante, Paola0 tMycorrhiza.g2017 Nov., v. 27, no. 8 p.747-759dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0940-63607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-017-0790-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245017900173520131000352592002801662650003601690650001301726650001701739650001901756650001601775650001901791650001401810650001201824650002301836650001901859650002401878650001701902650001201919650000901931650001801940650001801958650001701976650001001993700002102003700002202024700002502046700002602071700003802097700003302135773012202168856008102290852000902371655001202380IND60790823320221120094342.0220826e20220731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079082332DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120818222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadzikowska, Dominika 10aAnalysis of Physiological Status in Response to Water Deficit of Spelt (Triticum aestivum ssp. spelta) Cultivars in Reference to Common Wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. vulgare)  aClimate change, including decreasing rainfall, makes cultivating cereals more difficult. Drought stress reduces plant growth and most all yields. On the other hand, consumers’ interest in ancient wheat varieties, including spelt, is growing. The aim of this work is to compare the response to drought stress between spelt (Triticum aestivum ssp. spelta) and common wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. vulgare). Six cultivars of spelt from different European countries and common wheat ‘Bogatka’ as a reference were chosen for research. The photosynthesis process, chlorophyll fluorescence, relative water content, and the content of free proline and anthocyanins in well-watered and drought-stressed plants were measured. It was shown that the spelt cultivars ‘Franckenkorn’ and ‘Badengold’ were much more resistant to water deficit than other cultivars and even common wheat. A slight reduction of CO₂ assimilation (by 27%) and no reduction of transpiration rate, with simultaneous intensive proline (eighteen times fold increase) and anthocyanins accumulation (increase by 222%) along with a slight increase in lipid peroxidation level (1.9%) revealed in ‘Franckenkorn’ prove that this cultivar can cope with drought and can be effectively cultivated in areas with limited water abundance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum subsp. spelta 3aagronomy 3aanthocyanins 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3adrought 3alipid peroxidation 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological state 3aplant growth 3aproline 3arain 3atranspiration 3awater content 3awater stress 3awheat1 aSulewska, Hanna 1 aBandurska, Hanna 1 aRatajczak, Karolina 1 aSzymańska, Grażyna 1 aKowalczewski, Przemysław Łukasz1 aGłowicka-Wołoszyn, Romana 0 tAgronomy.g2022 July 31, v. 12, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120818223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007900171300001600250520181900266592002802085650001902113650002602132650002602158650001502184650002202199650001502221650002202236650001902258650001402277650001702291653001802308653001502326653001402341653001902355653001902374700002202393700001902415773009702434856008402531852000902615655001202624IND60086688720221116175404.0160903e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008668872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2012.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBirkmann, Jörn,10aEnhancing early warning in the light of migration and environmental shocks  ap. S76-S88.  aEarly Warning Systems (EWS) are key elements of risk reduction and adaptation strategies to extreme events. Until now, most EWS have focused mainly on hazard detection and the immediate warning and evacuation processes with an effort of saving lives in the context of an extreme event; however, in the light of climate change and migration more attention must also be paid to the question of how EWS can improve livelihood security. On the one hand, migration patterns, urbanization and population growth are important factors that will modify and in most cases increase exposure, and in some cases increase vulnerability. On the other hand, migration in the context of extreme events and sea level rise might also be an important adaptation strategy. The paper deals with the concept of people-centred early warning and examines how aspects of the so-called Last Mile can be better taken into account. In this regard, the framework conditions and the governance context of early warning are discussed and analysed. Strategies on how to enhance EWS are outlined, particularly regarding the nexus between migration, urbanization, daily mobility and early warning. Up to now, most EWS do not sufficiently consider migration and daily mobility patterns within the information or warning chain. Therefore, the paper examines the importance of migration, urbanization and daily mobility patterns for effective early warning. On the basis of this discussion, the paper identifies new challenges for early warning in the context of climate change and deals with the potential constraints of integrative EWS. Finally, the paper derives conclusions and recommendations on not only how to better account for migration in EWS, but also how to improve the consideration of early warning in migration and adaptation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aearly warning systems 3aenvironmental science 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3apopulation growth 3arisk reduction 3asea level 3aurbanization 0aEarly warning 0aGovernance 0aMigration 0aDaily mobility 0aClimate change1 aChang Seng, Denis1 aSetiadi, Neysa0 tEnvironmental Science and Policy.g2013 Mar., v. 27 p.S76-S88dElsevier Ltdx1462-90117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2012.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01818naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012700160300001600287500001400303520049500317592002800812650001600840650001800856650001200874650001400886650001700900650002600917650001600943653001700959653003800976653002201014653001901036700001901055700002501074700002101099700002301120773018301143856007301326852000901399655001201408IND60692254820221122020933.0200502e20070223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069225482DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.605342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSUGIHARA, Yusuke10aPotencies of Phosphine Peptide Inhibitors of Mammalian Thimet Oligopeptidase and Neurolysin on Two Bacterial Pz Peptidases  ap. 594-597.  aNAL-light  aPz peptidases A and B, from a thermophile Geobacillus collagenovorans MO-1, recognize collagen-specific tripeptide units (Gly-Pro-Xaa).

FTIR and XPS characterizations have confirmed the charge transfer between GO and epoxy that promotes the uniform dispersion and exfoliation of GO. The effects of GO sheets on the curing reaction and interfacial bonding are investigated and correlated with mechanical properties of epoxy nanocomposites. The results show that the GO sheets have a facilitation effect on the curing reaction of epoxy resin, in which the oxygen groups of GO covalently react with epoxy matrix and establish chemical interfacial bonding in epoxy nanocomposites. Therefore, the mechanical properties of nanocomposites are enhanced, showing the highest tensile strength of 88.1 ± 2.5 MPa, flexural strength of 134.2 ± 6.1 MPa and flexural modulus of 3.15 ± 0.11 GPa, respectively. However, GO sheets could simultaneously physically restrict the curing reactivity and reduce the cross-link density in the interface, which results in weakened interfacial property of nanocomposites, especially at high loading. Thus, the reinforcing effect of GO sheets is reduced and the mechanical properties of GO/epoxy nanocomposites decline at relatively higher loading.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3aepoxides 3agraphene oxide 3amodulus of rupture 3ananocomposites 3aoxygen 3atensile strength1 aYang, Cheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9521-33721 aYang, Jiping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7207-02331 aHao, Sijia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5093-14850 tJournal of materials science.g2021 Feb., v. 56, no. 5 p.3723-3737dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-05336-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01969naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011400163300001600277520085800293592002801151650002501179650002001204650001601224650001701240650000901257650001601266700001801282700001901300700001801319700001601337700001401353700002001367773009501387856008101482990002301563852000901586655001201595IND60093492120221119223401.0141103e20130809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009349212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2013.05.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCha, Minjun10aThermodynamic and kinetic hydrate inhibition performance of aqueous ethylene glycol solutions for natural gas  ap. 184-190.  aHydrate formation characteristics have been investigated with synthetic natural gas at different mono-ethylene glycol (MEG) concentrations by measuring hydrate onset time and subcooling temperature. MEG is well known thermodynamic hydrate inhibitor (THI), however there have been little works studying its effect on hydrate formation kinetics. In this paper, we report the hydrate onset is delayed and crystal growth is suppressed significantly at the MEG concentration of 30.0wt%. We also investigate the hydrate formation in the presence of both MEG and poly-vinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). Hydrate onset time is further delayed due to synergistic inhibition effect of two inhibitors. These results suggest that it might be feasible to incorporate the kinetic inhibition performance of MEG into current hydrate inhibition strategy to manage the hydrate risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3aethylene glycol 3anatural gas 3apyrrolidones 3arisk 3atemperature1 aShin, Kyuchul1 aKim, Juneyoung1 aChang, Daejun1 aSeo, Yutaek1 aLee, Huen1 aKang, Seong-Pil0 tChemical engineering science.g2013 Aug. 9, v. 99 p.184-190dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2013.05.0603Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01892naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013300159300001600292500001400308520060000322592002800922650002400950650002300974650001800997650001401015650001901029650001301048650000901061650001601070650000801086653001601094653001601110653002701126653002701153700001701180700002001197773018301217856007301400852000901473655001201482IND60692254920221122021404.0200502e20070223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069225492DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.605362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aICHIYAMA, Kenji10aAugmentation of Antigen-Specific Antibody Production and IL-10 Generation with a Fraction from Rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) Tea  ap. 598-602.  aNAL-light  aRooibos tea was extracted with boiling water.

Furthermore, continuous ingestion of fraction A was found to increase the anti-OVA IgM level in the sera of OVA-immunized mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspalathus linearis 3aantibody formation 3abiotechnology 3aingestion 3ainterleukin-10 3amethanol 3amice 3asplenocytes 3atea 0aRooibos tea 0aHP20 column 0aimmunoglobulin M (IgM) 0ainterleukin-10 (IL-10)1 aTAI, Akihiro1 aYAMAMOTO, Itaru0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2007 Feb. 23, v. 71, no. 2 p.598-602dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.605363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245007900172300001400251520206800265592002802333650001602361650002002377650002302397650002502420700003302445700002402478700002002502700001502522773011602537856008202653852000902735655001202744IND60561652420221116141838.0170121e20160114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056165242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b095482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShenai, Prathamesh
M.10aInternal Conversion and Vibrational Energy Redistribution in Chlorophyll A  ap. 49-58.  aWe have computationally investigated the role of intramolecular vibrational modes in determining nonradiative relaxation pathways of photoexcited electronic states in isolated chlorophyll A (ChlA) molecules. To simulate the excited state relaxation from the initially excited Soret state to the lowest excited state Qy, the approach of nonadiabatic excited state molecular dynamics has been adopted. The intramolecular vibrational energy relaxation and redistribution that accompany the electronic internal conversion process is followed by analyzing the excited state trajectories in terms of the ground state equilibrium normal modes. The time dependence of the normal mode velocities is determined by projecting instantaneous Cartesian velocities onto the normal mode vectors. Our analysis of the time evolution of the average mode energies uncovers that only a small subset of the medium-to-high frequency normal modes actively participate in the electronic relaxation processes. These active modes are characterized by the highest overlap with the nonadiabatic coupling vectors (NACRs) during the electronic transitions. Further statistical analysis of the nonadiabatic transitions reveals that the electronic and vibrational energy relaxation occurs via two distinct pathways with significantly different time scales on which the hopping from Soret to Qₓ occurs thereby dictating the overall dynamics. Furthermore, the NACRs corresponding to each of the transitions have been consistently found to be predominantly similar to a set of normal modes that vary depending upon the transition and the identified categories. Each pathway exhibits a differential time scale of energy transfer and also a differential set of predominant active modes. Our present analysis can be considered as a general approach allowing identification of a reduced subset of specific vibrational coordinates associated with nonradiative relaxation pathways. Therefore, it represents an adequate prior strategy that can particularly facilitates mixed quantum-classical approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3aenergy transfer 3amolecular dynamics 3astatistical analysis1 aFernandez-Alberti, Sebastian1 aBricker, William

However, recent studies reported the possible relations between metal exposure and CKD. This study aims to explore the status of metals in CKD patients compared to their healthy counterparts at Narayanganj, Bangladesh, through a cross-sectional study. In this study, 50 volunteers were involved; 30 CKD patients and 20 healthy controls. Five metals were measured from serum [Copper (Cu) and Zinc (Zn)] and urine [Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), and Chromium (Cr)] using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. Compared to the controls the CKD patients exhibited significantly higher levels of Pb, Cd and Cr levels in their urine samples. This signifies a potential association between heavy metal exposure and CKD. The serum levels of Cu were much higher than expected for CKD patients than controls, and the Zn values were in accordance with established literature. However, the level of Zn in blood was significantly lower in the CKD group compared to the control. This data suggests that the Cu imbalance in the serum of the CKD subjects might have been related to a myriad of reasons, the most plausible of which being exposed to large concentrations of the nephrotoxic metals such as Pb, Cd and Cr in this study. Our study has shed a much needed light on the correlation between CKD and exposure to heavy metals and imbalance of essential metals in blood serum, in a rural locality of Bangladesh.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3ablood serum 3acadmium 3achromium 3across-sectional studies 3adiabetes 3aheavy metals 3ahypertension 3akidney diseases 3akidneys 3anephrotoxicity 3aobservational studies 3arural areas 3aurine 3azinc 3aBangladesh 0aCKD 0aCopper 0aLead1 aZaman, Sk.

The biology results showed the purinyl moiety attached to the pyran ring of 6a–d, substituent at 6′-position of purine base and introduction of a halogen atom at 2′-position of 6′-chloropurine had obviously effect on the evaluated anticancer activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3abreast neoplasms 3ahumans 3aprostatic neoplasms 3auterine cervical neoplasms1 aWang, Yan-Guang1 aXu, Gong1 aZhang, Xiang-Hua1 aZheng, Yong-Fei1 aHe, Hui-Li1 aFu, Wen-Zheng1 aLiu, Hong-Min0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 21, no. 20 p.6203-6205dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.07.0493Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011400170300001600284520183600300592002802136650004402164650001202208650001502220650001102235650001402246650001302260650001002273650001302283650000902296650004402305650001402349650003102363650001202394650001802406650001902424650001302443650002002456650001402476653002402490653005002514653001902564653002602583653002902609700001702638700002202655773011402677856008602791852000902877655001202886IND60583941320221120084004.0210723e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058394132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Vikash10a(UV/Oxidative) dual curing polyurethane dispersion from cardanol based polyol: Synthesis and characterization  ap. 165-178.  aThis study reports the synthesis and property evaluation of UV/oxidative dual curing waterborne polyurethane dispersion prepared from cardanol-based polyol using different mode of curing. Cardanol-based polyol was prepared by reacting epoxidized cardanol with itaconic acid in presence of triphenyl phosphine catalyst. Structures of cardanol-based intermediates (both epoxidized cardanol and polyol) are confirmed by FTIR, ¹H NMR and ¹³C NMR spectroscopy. The intermediates were characterized for various physicochemical properties such as hydroxyl value, acid value, epoxy equivalent weight (EEW), viscosity, color etc. Waterborne polyurethane oligomer was synthesized by reacting polyol, isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), dimethylol propionic acid (DMPA) and 2-hydroxy methyl methacrylate (HEMA) in acetone as solvent. The prepolymer was neutralized with triethyl amine (TEA) and subsequently dispersed in deionized water and oligomer was obtained after removal of acetone. The coating films were formulated using suitable metal drier and/or photoinitiator blend based on different mode of curing, viz. oxidative curing, UV curing and (UV/oxidative) dual curing. The impact of curing process on properties of cured films was evaluated. Influence of curing process has been investigated by DMA, DSC and gel content analysis. The results showed that crosslink density plays an important role in deciding the final performance properties of cured films. The increase in crosslink density of UV/oxidative dual-cured system leads to an improvement in thermal, mechanical, chemical, water and solvent resistance properties along with other coating performance properties. In conclusion, the result of this study confirms that cardanol-based waterborne oligomer is suitable candidate for high performance environment-friendly coatings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetone 3aacid value 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acoatings 3acolor 3aepoxides 3agels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphine 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolyols 3apolyurethanes 3apropionic acid 3asolvents 3astable isotopes 3aviscosity 0aWaterborne coatings 0aUV-curable polyurethane dispersions (UV-PUDs) 0aGreen coatings 0aCardanol-based polyol 0aUV/oxidative dual curing1 aDesai, Jatin1 aPatel, Kalpesh I.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2018 Jan., v. 111 p.165-178dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245008200159300001600241500001900257520102000276592002801296650002101324650001601345650001101361650001601372650001801388650003001406650001801436650001801454650001901472650001301491653002601504653001701530653001201547700001901559700002101578700002301599700002001622700002101642700002001663700002201683773018301705856007301888852000901961655001201970IND60692255020221120111849.0200502e20070223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069225502DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.605372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKONGRIT, Darika10aMolecular Cloning and Functional Expression of Soybean Allene Oxide Synthases  ap. 491-498.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA plant allene oxide synthase (AOS) reacting with 13S-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E,15Z-octadecatrienoic acid (13-HPOT), a lipoxygenase product of α-linolenic acid, provides an allene oxide which functions as an intermediate for jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis, making AOS a key enzyme regulating the JA level in plants. Although AOSs in various plants have been investigated, there is only limited information about AOSs in soybean (Glycine max). In this study, we cloned and characterized two soybean AOSs, GmAOS1 and GmAOS2, sharing 95% homology in the predicted amino acid sequences. GmAOS1 and GmAOS2 were composed of 564 and 559 amino acids respectively, with predicted N-terminal chloroplast-targeting signal peptides. Both AOSs expressed in Escherichia coli were selective for 13S-hydroperoxides of α-linolenic and linoleic acids, suggesting the potential of GmAOS1 and GmAOS2 to contribute to JA synthesis.

The effects of salinity and turbidity on the embryonic stages of red sea bream Pagrus major were examined under controlled laboratory conditions. In the first experiment, eggs of red sea bream were exposed to different salinity stresses [34 (control), 30, 26, 22, 18, 14 psu] for 3 h. In the second experiment, eggs were exposed to higher turbidity levels of 100, 300, 500, and 700 NTU from 0 NTU (control) obtained by dissolving kaolin clay for the same duration as in the first experiment. The results showed that the embryos of red sea bream are tolerant to short-term exposure to low salinity stress. There were no significant differences in the hatching rate, yolk sac consumption of newly hatched larvae, or survival of larvae at 6 days post-hatching. However, the short exposure to turbidity stress reduced the hatching rate, total length, and yolk sac volume of newly hatched larvae, and larval viability of red sea bream.

In order to investigate different aspects of egg production mechanisms in different poultry, in this study we performed a metabolomic analysis of the transcriptomic combination of the ovaries of two chicken breeds, the high-production Ninghai indigenous chickens and the low-production Wuliangshan black-boned chickens, to analyze the biosynthesis and potential key genes and metabolic pathways in the ovaries during egg production. We predicted four genes in the transcriptomic that are associated with egg production, namely P2RX1, INHBB, VIPR2, and FABP3, and identified three important pathways during egg production, “Calcium signaling pathway”, “Neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction” and “Cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction”, respectively. In the metabolomic 149 significantly differential metabolites were identified, 99 in the negative model and 50 in the positive model, of which 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, iloprost, spermidine, and adenosine are important metabolites involved in reproduction. By integrating transcriptomics and metabolomics, the correlation between specific differential genes and differential metabolites identified important gene-metabolite pairs “VIPR2-Spermidine” and “P2RX1-Spermidine” in egg production. In conclusion, these data provide a better understanding of the molecular differences between the ovaries of low- and high-production hens and provide a theoretical basis for further studies on the mechanics of poultry egg production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine 3abiosynthesis 3acalcium 3achickens 3aegg production 3amechanics 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amodels 3aspermidine 3atranscriptomics1 aZhang, Haiyang 1 aCao, Haiyue 1 aZhou, Wei 1 aXiang, Xin 1 aYin, Zhaozheng 0 tAnimals.g2022 Aug. 09, v. 12, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani121620103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011500163300001800278500001900296520156400315592002801879596005901907596005901966596006902025596006602094596006602160650001502226650001302241650002102254650002202275650002402297700002002321700001402341700005502355700001802410773012102428856008202549852000902631655001202640IND60717791420221118174411.0201117e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071779142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-05510-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xufei10aChain structure-dependent electrochemical performance of polyimide cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries  ap. 3900-3910.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOrganic polyimides have received an ever-growing interest in lithium-ion batteries based on the reversible anion stabilization mechanism of redox-active carbonyl groups due to their high theoretical capacities, resource sustainability, and diverse chain structures. Herein, four linear polyimides with different chain structures were synthesized by a facile and green hydrothermal method. The chain structure-electrochemical performance relationship was explored by regulating active anhydride units and diamine linkers. The incorporation of flexible linkers between redox-active anhydrides results in the facile movement of polyimide chains and the formation of porous networks with abundant active sites. In contrast, rigid aromatic linkers with strong π–π conjugation tend to assemble into the orderly-stacked sheets, enabling the efficient electron transfer. When used as the battery cathode, 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride-based polyimide with a relatively flexible linker delivers the largest specific capacity. Such a polyimide also demonstrates the high cycling stability with a capacity retention up to 52% over 10000 cycles. In contrast, pyromellitic dianhydride-based polyimide with a benzene-enriched linker exhibits the lowest capacity and poor rate capability due to its densely-stacked sheets and limited exposure of active groups. The chain structure-dependent performance relationship of polyimides would offer new insights into the rational design of high-performance organic electrodes for the next-generation batteries.  aPublisher supplied data  a51973235cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51902349cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019CFB260cHubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  aCZP19001cFundamental Research Funds for Central Universities  aCZQ19003cFundamental Research Funds for Central Universities 3aanhydrides 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3ahot water treatment1 aQiu, Shengqiang1 aMei, Peng1 aZhang, Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7582-53201 aYang, Yingkui0 tJournal of materials science.g2021 Feb., v. 56, no. 5 p.3900-3910dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-05510-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01949naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245019700167300001800364520059400382592002800976650002001004650003201024650001501056650002001071650001401091700002701105700002401132700002801156700002301184700003501207700002001242700001801262700002201280700001701302773011801319856008201437990002301519852000901542655001201551IND60090958620221120085006.0141103e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009095862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.08.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Cheng Hua10aSynthesis and biological evaluation of 1-substituted-3-(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)-4-([1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-6-yl)pyrazoles as transforming growth factor-β type 1 receptor kinase inhibitors  ap. 6049-6053.  aA series of 1-substituted-3-(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)-4-([1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-6-yl)pyrazoles 14a–ae, 16a, 16b, and 21a–c has been prepared and evaluated for their ALK5 inhibitory activity in an enzyme assay and in a cell-based luciferase reporter assay.

However, to date, minimum steps, data requirements and robust science-based guidelines to estimate CNDCs based on experimental data have not been formalized in the literature to ensure the reliability of an established nutrient dilution curve. In this study, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on CNDCs, described the main characteristics of the datasets used to establish CNDCs in the past, and finally identified a set of criteria specifying the minimum characteristics that a dataset must satisfy to be used to establish an accurate CNDC. Published CNDC studies showed large heterogeneity in the number of experiments (from 1 to 35), fertilizer N rates (from 2 to 7), and sampling times (from 2 to 16) used to fit the CNDCs. Given that, we quantified the sensitivity of the CNDC parameters to five dataset characteristics (number of experiments, N rates, and sampling times, attainment of Wₘₐₓ plateau, and precision of the studies) using a Bayesian statistical model on a case-study estimation for maize. We found that the number of experiments is the main factor affecting the uncertainty of the fitted CNDC. Bootstrapping analyses showed that accurate CNDCs can be fitted with experiments having at least three N rates. Increasing the number of sampling times was more effective than using more than three N rates for reducing the uncertainty in the estimation of the parameters for the CNDCs. We also showed that more reliable CNDCs can be obtained when weighting each data by its precision. We concluded our analysis with formal recommendations of the minimum steps and data requirements to fit CNDC. The criteria established here should serve as a guide for the establishment of reliable dilution curves for N and other nutrients in the agricultural and biological sciences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aagronomy 3acorn 3adata collection 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3astatistical models 3asystematic review 3auncertainty 0aCritical N Dilution Curve 0aCrops 0aNitrogen 0aBayesian statistics 0aSensitivity analysis1 avan Versendaal, Emmanuela1 aLacasa, Josefina1 aMakowski, David1 aLemaire, Gilles1 aCiampitti, Ignacio A.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2022 Sept., v. 139 p.126568-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2022.1265683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245016000169520174500329592002802074650001502102650001802117650001502135650001202150650001502162650001402177650001902191650000902210650002102219650001102240650001502251650002502266651001002291653001602301653002002317653002802337653002302365700002202388700006702410773009402477856008602571852000902657655001202666IND60756623720221119153015.0220214e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075662372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e083852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKodom, Kwadwo10aAssessment of removal efficiency of pharmaceutical products from wastewater in sewage treatment plants: A case of the sewerage systems Ghana limited, Accra  aPharmaceuticals put the environment at high risk when found in products of wastewater treatment plants, hence need to be removed efficiently. This study quantified selected pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) (diclofenac, aspirin, paracetamol, and ibuprofen) in wastewater and evaluated its removal efficiency from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Samples were taken from the WWTP of the Sewerage Systems Ghana Limited (SSGL) for 18 consecutive days. Both effluents and influents were tested in the laboratory to determine the concentrations of the various pharmaceutical products. The results reveal diclofenac as the PhAC with the highest concentration in the influent with an average of 121.31 μg/ml. Paracetamol recorded an average of 65.54 μg/ml, then ibuprofen with an average of 19.54 μg/ml. Aspirin was the PhAC with the lowest concentration in the influent with an average of 0.27 μg/ml. Further assessment was also done on the trickling filter (biological filter) which is part of the process plant at the secondary stage to assess how the trickling filter aids in the removal of these selected pharmaceuticals. The average removal efficiency found were; diclofenac 74%, aspirin 93%, paracetamol 98%, and ibuprofen 99%. The technologies suggested for improvement, particularly for diclofenac, based on comprehensive literature were phototransformation and sorption of diclofenac onto sludge which occurs via absorption and adsorption, that can be adopted by the management of the WWTP at SSGL to help increase the removal efficiency of the selected PhACs. It was also identified that the trickling filter is the stage that substantially aids in the removal of the selected pharmaceuticals due to its special features.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacetaminophen 3aadsorption 3aaspirin 3adiclofenac 3aibuprofen 3aphotochemistry 3arisk 3asewage treatment 3asludge 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aGhana 0aXenobiotics 0aWater pollution 0aPharmaceutical products 0aRemoval efficiency1 aAttiogbe, Francis1 aKuranchie, Francis Atta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7298-92580 tHeliyon.g2021 Nov., v. 7, no. 11 p.e08385-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e083853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245012000215300001500335520137500350592002801725650002701753650002301780650001801803650001601821650002001837650000901857650001801866650001401884650001501898650001401913650001101927650001501938650001201953700002201965700002701987700002602014700002202040700002302062700002602085700002202111773011002133856008302243852000902326655001202335IND60680903120221119145810.0210402e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068090312DNAL7 a10.1007/s12562-019-01367-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaquirang, Jean Rose H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5737-070510aIngestion, digestion, growth and survival of green mussel Perna viridis pediveliger larvae fed different microalgae  ap. 97-105.  aNutrition plays a critical role in the growth and development of green mussel Perna viridis larvae. In this study, three species of tropical microalgae were investigated to determine their efficacy as feed source for the pediveliger stage. Larvae (2 larvae ml⁻¹) were given Isochrysis galbana (Iso), Chaetoceros calcitrans (Cc), and Tetraselmis tetrahele (Tt) at 100,000 cells ml⁻¹. No statistically significant difference in survival was found among treatments. The Cc diet promoted maximum growth in terms of final shell height and shell length, as well as instantaneous growth rate. Filtration rates were high, but were not significantly different. A significantly higher ingestion rate was observed in Cc-fed compared with Iso- and Tt-fed larvae. Moreover, all diets examined were readily ingested and digested by the larvae, with faster cell digestion in Cc-fed larvae based on epifluorescence microscopy. This study demonstrated that C. calcitrans, I. galbana, and T. tetrahele were all acceptable and digestible for the animals, but in terms of growth parameters and filtration and ingestion rates, C. calcitrans performed best. Information on food digestibility and feeding habits of green mussel will provide us with a better understanding of the appropriate food to be given that will suit their feeding biology and improve their production in captivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaetoceros calcitrans 3aIsochrysis galbana 3aPerna viridis 3aTetraselmis 3acaptive animals 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3afiltration 3aingestion 3alarvae 3amicroalgae 3amussels1 aPedroso, Fiona L.1 aApines-Amar, Mary Jane1 aPiñosa, Lily Anne G.1 aRendaje, Donna C.1 aCadangin, Josel F.1 aMero, Fedelia Flor C.1 aBaylon, Carlos C.0 tFisheries science.g2020 Jan., v. 86, no. 1 p.97-105dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3867080x0919-92687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-019-01367-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245008300208520152700291592002801818650001301846650002001859650001101879650001501890651001201905653001001917653001601927653001701943653001401960653001801974700005601992700002302048700005902071700005902130773009402189856008602283852000902369655001202378IND60756623820221119080512.0220214e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075662382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e083862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNann, Dominik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3071-793X10aForecasting the future number of pertussis cases using data from Google Trends  aAlternative methods could be used to enhance the monitoring and forecasting of re-emerging conditions such as pertussis.

Predictions were made by the models, both with and without GTD, and compared with values within the validation dataset over a one-year and for a two-weeks period. Predictions of the traditional model using solely reported case numbers resulted in an RMSE (residual mean squared error) of 192.65 and 207.8, a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 58.59 and 72.1, and a mean absolute error (MAE) 169.53 and 190.53 for the one-year and for the two-weeks period, respectively. The GTD expanded model achieved better forecasting accuracy (RMSE: 144.22 and 201.78), a MAPE 43.86, and 68.54 and a MAE of 124.46 and 178.96. Corrected Akaike Information Criteria also favored the GTD expanded model (1750.98 vs. 1746.73). The difference between the predictive performances was significant when using a two-sided Diebold-Mariano test (DM value: 6.86, p < 0.001) for the one-year period. Internet-based surveillance data enhanced the predictive ability of a traditionally based model and should be considered as a method to enhance future disease modeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3adata collection 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aGermany 0aARIMA 0aForecasting 0aSurveillance 0aPertussis 0aInfodemiology1 aWalker, Mark1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1650-32221 aFrauenfeld, Leonie1 aFerenci, Tamás1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6791-30801 aSulyok, Mihály1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6960-51260 tHeliyon.g2021 Nov., v. 7, no. 11 p.e08386-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e083863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01894naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012400168300001800292520086200310592002801172650002601200650001501226650001401241700002501255700002101280700002401301700002301325773011801348856008201466990002301548852000901571655001201580IND60090958820221120085013.0141103e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009095882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.08.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalmon, Adam J.10aSynthesis of glycoconjugate carbonic anhydrase inhibitors by ruthenium-catalysed azide-alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition  ap. 6058-6061.  aCarbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a recently validated target for the development of new cancer therapies. In this Letter we describe the synthesis and CA inhibition of a novel series of carbohydrate-based 1,5-disubstituted-1,2,3-triazole benzenesulfonamides. The key step of our synthesis is the regioselective Huisgen’s 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction (1,3-DCR) from carbohydrate azide substrates and 4-ethynylbenzenesulfonamide using a ruthenium-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (RuAAC). Our findings identified a number of triazole inhibitors (compounds 18, 19, 21–23, and 26) that block CA IX activity with inhibition constants less than 10nM. One inhibitor (compound 17) possessed very good selectivity for CA IX over off-target CAs. These CA inhibitors have developmental potential to selectively target cancer cells, leading to cell death.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonate dehydratase 3acell death 3atriazoles1 aWilliams, Michael L.1 aMaresca, Alfonso1 aSupuran, Claudiu T.1 aPoulsen, Sally-Ann0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 21, no. 20 p.6058-6061dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.08.0663Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245013900174520100200313592002801315650002401343650002201367650002301389650001701412650001201429650002801441650002001469650001101489650001501500650001601515650000901531650001901540650001901559650001301578650001801591653001801609653003501627653001501662653003101677653002001708700002001728700005701748700005501805700001801860700001701878700002101895700001601916700002001932700005701952773009802009856008802107852000902195655001202204IND60758116220221120024725.0220118e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075811622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2021.1130262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiaw, Chia-Ching10aCucurbitane-type triterpenoids from the vines of Momordica charantia and their anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, and antidiabetic activity  aPhytochemical investigation of the ethanol extract from wild Momordica charantia vines has resulted in isolation of seven cucurbitane-type triterpenoids, including six undescribed compounds, kuguaovins H‒M, and the known compound, momordicoside K.

The effect of fish oils containing omega-3 PUFA in the lipophagy pathway is unknown. In the present study, we examined whether omega-3 PUFA affects anti-inflammatory or lipophagy pathways in high fat diet-induced obesity. There was a significant increase in body weight gain in mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) or HFD with fish oil (HFD-FO), but not in mice fed a normal diet (ND). Although there was no significant difference between body weight gain and plasma insulin levels in the HFD and HFD-FO mice, the intake of HFD-FO prevented glucose intolerance and peripheral insulin resistance induced by HFD. In addition, macrophage infiltration and cytokine levels in white adipose tissue (WAT) in HFD-FO mice were decreased, compared with HFD mice. There were no significant differences between lipophagy related proteins and their mRNA levels in the HFD-FO and HFD groups. These results suggest that supplementation with fish oil might be beneficial in preventing insulin resistance caused by a high fat diet through an anti-inflammatory effect, but not lipophagy activation.  aPublisher supplied data  a18KT0093cKAKENHI 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abody weight changes 3acytokines 3afish oils 3aglucose 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aobesity 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aproteins 3awhite adipose tissue1 aYoshimura, Tomohiro1 aSun, Luchuanyang1 aYang, Min1 aWang, Yao1 aTaniyama, Shigeto1 aHara, Kenji1 aMurayama, Fumihito1 aNikawa, Takeshi1 aTachibana, Katsuyasu1 aHirasaka, Katsuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2645-84500 tFisheries science.g2020 Jan., v. 86, no. 1 p.187-196dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3867080x0919-92687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-019-01374-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009700172300001600269520166200285592002801947650001101975650002501986650001102011650001602022650002202038650001002060650001602070650001402086651001402100651001102114700001202125700002102137700002302158700002302181700002202204773009602226856008102322852000902403655001202412IND60583555820221118040215.0171018e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058355582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00572-017-0797-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrelet, Gwen-Aëlle,12aA plant growth-promoting symbiosis between Mycena galopus and Vaccinium corymbosum seedlings  ap. 831-839.  aTypically, Mycena species are viewed as saprotrophic fungi. However, numerous detections of Mycena spp. in the roots of green plants suggest that a continuum from saprotrophy to biotrophy could exist. In particular, mycenoid species have repeatedly been found in Ericaceae plant roots. Our study asked whether (1) Mycena species are commonly found in the roots of green Ericaceae plants; (2) Mycena sequences are limited to a single group/lineage within the genus; and (3) a Mycena sp. can behave as a beneficial root associate with a typical ericoid mycorrhizal plant (Vaccinium corymbosum), regardless of how much external labile carbon is available. We detected Mycena sequences in roots of all sampled Ericaceae plants. Our Mycena sequences clustered in four different groups distributed across the Mycena genus. Only one group could be assigned with confidence to a named species (M. galopus). Our Mycena sequences clustered with other Mycena sequences detected in roots of ericoid mycorrhizal plant species collected throughout Europe, America, and Australia. An isolate of M. galopus promoted growth of V. corymbosum seedlings in vitro regardless of external carbon supply in the media. Seedlings inoculated with M. galopus grew as well as those inoculated with the ericoid mycorrhizal fungus Rhizoscyphus ericae. Surprisingly, this M. galopus isolate colonized Vaccinium roots and formed distinctive peg-like structures. Our results suggest that Mycena species might operate along a saprotroph–symbiotic continuum with a range of ericoid mycorrhizal plant species. We discuss our results in terms of fungal partner recruitment by Ericaceae plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycena 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3acarbon 3amycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aroots 3asaprotrophs 3aseedlings 3aAustralia 3aEurope1 aBa, Ren1 aGoeke, Dagmar F.1 aHouliston, Gary J.1 aTaylor, Andy F.

As expected, the chimeric SMase hydrolyzed sphingomyelin in vivo to produce ceramide, part of which was converted to glucosylceramide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas 3aacid phosphatase 3abiotechnology 3aceramides 3aglucosylceramides 3alysosomes 3amammals 3asphingomyelins 0asphingomyelin 0aNiemann-Pick disease 0asphingomyelinase 0alysosomal acid phosphatase1 aSUEYOSHI, Noriyuki1 aItō, Makoto,0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2007 Feb. 23, v. 71, no. 2 p.603-606dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.605443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03744naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245010200165520218400267592002802451650001302479650001602492650001602508650001602524650001602540650003102556650001802587650001502605650001502620650001302635650002102648650001802669650001802687650001302705650001402718650001102732650001202743653000902755653001402764653001102778653001902789700001702808700001302825700001902838700001502857700001802872700001402890700006002904700001302964773011702977856008703094852000903181655001203190IND60742216420221120071654.0210812e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074221642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2021.1053782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Jing10aEffects of group size on the behaviour, heart rate, immunity, and growth of Holstein dairy calves  aThis study investigated the effect of group size on the behaviour, heart rate, immunity, and growth of Holstein calves. A total of 132 calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments from birth to 46 days of age. These included single housed (S) or group housed with three (G3), six (G6), or twelve calves (G12) with six replicates for each. Behavioural responses were observed at 15, 30, and 45 days of age, and then physiological activities, including heart rate (HR) and saliva secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) levels, were measured. The serum immune indices of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and growth were measured at 16, 31, and 46 days of age. Group-housed calves exhibited significantly increased self-grooming, allogrooming, locomotive play, social play, exploration, standing, and walking behaviours and decreased lying behaviour (P < 0.05). In contrast, S calves exhibited increased tongue-rolling behaviour than group-housed calves (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant HR difference among the treatments, except for G12 calves at 15 days of age, which yielded the highest HR (118.13 ± 10.73 times/min; P < 0.05) level. Levels of saliva secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) were highest in G12 calves (28.69 ± 1.58 ng/mL), which first decreased and then considerably increased as the S calves (27.41 ± 1.09, 20.60 ± 1.36, and 26.79 ± 1.31 ng/mL; P < 0.05) increased in age. Concentrations of serum IL-2, IL-6, and TNT-α in the group-housed calves were higher than those in the S group (P < 0.05). Body weight (BW) in G12 calves was lower than that of other groups (57.25 ± 1.50 kg; P < 0.05). S calves displayed lower voluntary solid feed intake (VFI) and higher body length (BL) than grouped calves (2.02 ± 0.20 kg, 84.32 ± 0.83 cm; P < 0.05). The withers height (WH) was higher in S and G3 calves than G6 and G12 calves at 46 days of age (90.23 ± 2.21, 89.65 ± 2.18 cm vs 87.88 ± 1.59, 87.25 ± 1.53 cm; P < 0.05). Taken together, our study suggests that before weaning, group-housed calves exhibit more natural behaviours, higher levels of immunity, and solid feed intake than solitary calves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3ablood serum 3abody length 3abody weight 3afeed intake 3agrooming (animal behavior) 3agroup housing 3agroup size 3aheart rate 3aimmunity 3aimmunoglobulin A 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-6 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3asaliva 3awithers 0aCalf 0aBehaviour 0aGrowth 0aAnimal welfare1 aZhao, Xun-Wu1 aSu, Hang1 aWang, Zhi-Peng1 aWang, Chao1 aLi, Jian-Hong1 aLi, Xiang1 aZhang, Run-Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6315-93991 aBao, Jun0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2021 Aug., v. 241 p.105378-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2021.1053783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010100173520150400274592002801778650001901806650001601825650002201841650001501863650001701878650001401895650000901909650001701918650002101935650001801956650001201974650002301986650002402009650002302033650002602056650001002082650002202092653003102114653001802145700002302163700002502186700002702211700002102238700001402259700002802273700002802301700002802329773010902357856008202466852000902548655001202557IND60756624120221119080507.0211219e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075662412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vas.2021.1002142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardoso-Gutierrez, E.10aEffect of tannins from tropical plants on methane production from ruminants: A systematic review  aMethane (CH₄) is a greenhouse gas generated during the feed fermentation processes in the rumen. However, numerous studies have been conducted to determine the capacity of plant secondary metabolites to enhance ruminal fermentation and decrease CH₄ production, especially those plants rich in tannins. This review conducted a descriptive analysis and meta-analysis of the use of tannin-rich plants in tropical regions to mitigate CH₄ production from livestock. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of tannins supplementation in tropical plants on CH₄ production in ruminants using a meta-analytic approach and the effect on microbial population. Sources of heterogeneity were explored using a meta-regression analysis. Final database was integrated by a total of 14 trials. The ‘meta’ package in R statistical software was used to conduct the meta-analyses. The covariates defined a priori in the current meta-regression were inclusion level, species (sheep, beef cattle, dairy cattle, and cross-bred heifers) and plant. Results showed that supplementation with tropical plants with tannin contents have the greatest effects on CH₄ mitigation . A negative relationship was observed between the level of inclusion and CH₄ emission (−0.09), which means that the effect of CH₄ mitigation is increasing as the level of tannin inclusion is higher. Therefore, less CH₄ production will be obtained when supplementing tropical plants in the diet with a high dose of tannins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal science 3abeef cattle 3acomputer software 3acrossbreds 3adairy cattle 3adatabases 3adiet 3afermentation 3agreenhouse gases 3ameta-analysis 3amethane 3amethane production 3aregression analysis 3arumen fermentation 3asecondary metabolites 3asheep 3asystematic review 0aEnteric methane mitigation 0aMeta-analyses1 aAranda-Aguirre, E.1 aRobles-Jimenez, L.E.1 aCastelán-Ortega, O.A.1 aChay-Canul, A.J.1 aFoggi, G.1 aAngeles-Hernandez, J.C.1 aVargas-Bello-Pérez, E.1 aGonzález-Ronquillo, M.0 tVeterinary and Animal Science.g2021 Dec., v. 14 p.100214-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23501x2451-943X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vas.2021.1002143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245016600172520160000338592002801938650002101966650001901987650001002006650001002016650001402026650001002040650001502050650001102065650001502076653001202091653001402103653002902117653000802146653001502154700002402169700002102193700002002214700002502234700001902259700002002278773010902298856008202407852000902489655001202498IND60756624220221119080451.0211219e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075662422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vas.2021.1002172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMourand, Gwénaëlle10aImpact of Escherichia coli probiotic strains ED1a and Nissle 1917 on the excretion and gut carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli in pigs  aWe evaluated the impact of the administration of two Escherichia coli probiotic strains (ED1a and Nissle 1917) to pigs on the gut carriage or shedding of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli. The probiotics were given to four sows from 12 days before farrowing to the weaning day, and to the 23 piglets (infected treated group (IPro)) from birth to the age of 49 days. Four other sows and their 24 piglets (infected non-treated group (INT)) did not receive the probiotics. IPro and INT piglets (n = 47) were orally inoculated with the strain E. coli 17–348F-RifR carrying the blaCTX₋M₋₁ gene and resistant to rifampicin. Cefotaxime-resistant (CTXᴿ) E. coli and rifampicin-resistant (Rifᴿ) E. coli were cultured and excretion of probiotics was studied using PCR on individual faecal and post-mortem samples, and from manure collected after the challenge with resistant E. coli. CTXᴿ and RifᴿE.coli isolates were characterized to detect transfer of the blaCTX₋M₋₁ to other strains.. Overall, there was no significant reduction in faecal excretion of CTXᴿ and RifᴿE. coli in IPro pigs compared with INT pigs, although the CTXᴿ and RifᴿE. coli titres were slightly, but significantly lower in the colon, caecum and rectum at post mortem. Excretion of the probiotics decreased with age, but Nissle 1917 was detected in most pigs at post-mortem. No transfer of the blaCTX₋M₋₁ gene to probiotic and other E. coli strains was detected. In conclusion, in our experimental conditions, the used probiotics did not reduce shedding of the challenge strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aanimal science 3acecum 3acolon 3aexcretion 3agenes 3aprobiotics 3arectum 3arifampicin 0aE. coli 0aProbiotic 0aCephalosporin resistance 0aPig 0aMicrobiota1 aPaboeuf, Frédéric1 aGrippon, Pauline1 aLucas, Pierrick1 aBougeard, Stéphanie1 aDenamur, Erick1 aKempf, Isabelle0 tVeterinary and Animal Science.g2021 Dec., v. 14 p.100217-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23501x2451-943X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vas.2021.1002173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015500172300001400327520162400341592002801965650001401993650002602007650001802033650001102051650002202062650001302084650001502097653001502112653001602127653005102143653003802194653002802232653001502260700001702275773009502292856008402387852000902471655001202480IND60086689620221116175421.0160903e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008668962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2012.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTàbara, J. David10aCoupling Human Information and Knowledge Systems with social–ecological systems change: Reframing research, education, and policy for sustainability  ap. 71-81.  aThe rapid acceleration and intensity of global environmental change places great demands on humanity for developing innovative views and processes for the integration of knowledge in ways that are conducive to sustainability learning. In this paper, we argue that in order to develop robust sustainability learning feedbacks between knowledge and action we need the coupling of Human Information and Knowledge Systems (HIKS) with social–ecological systems (SES) dynamics. In particular, a substantial change in core worldviews and understandings about the nature of HIKS and how they relate to SES is required. Changing such epistemological and ontological assumptions of the quality of robust social–ecological knowledge is a first step for the emergence of transformative pathways towards sustainability in research, education, and policy. To enhance our understanding of such complexity, we describe two general ideal-type worldviews of HIKS and their relationships with SES in Western culture. One worldview understands information and knowledge systems as evolving in a closed, ahistorical, social-ecologically disembodied linear space, in ways which can be reduced to a single form of representation. The other worldview understands information and knowledge systems as operating in an open space composed of multiple and diverse patterns of hybrid social–ecological practices and configurations, inevitably embedded in specific times, spaces and contextual conditions. We argue that the open, but socio-ecologically embodied worldview is better suited to support sustainability learning and transformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeducation 3aenvironmental science 3aglobal change 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3alearning 3aopen space 0aComplexity 0aIdeal types 0aHuman Information and Knowledge Systems (HIKS) 0aSocial–ecological systems (SES) 0aSustainability learning 0aWorldviews1 aChabay, Ilan0 tEnvironmental Science and Policy.g2013 Apr., v. 28 p.71-81dElsevier Ltdx1462-90117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2012.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03384naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245020900170300001600379520165000395592002802045650004402073650002802117650002302145650002302168650001002191650002302201650001402224650001402238650001202252650002102264650001302285650002102298650001402319650004402333650000702377650001502384650001802399650001902417650001902436653004402455653001802499653001602517653001602533653001502549653002202564700002702586700002702613773010602640856008702746852000902833655001202842IND60583942020221120225725.0201125e20180120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058394202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbasi, Sahar10aPolyacrylamide–b-copolypeptide hybrid copolymer as pH-responsive carrier for delivery of paclitaxel: Effects of copolymer composition on nanomicelles properties, loading efficiency and hemocompatibility  ap. 217-226.  aIn the current study, a series of pH-responsive di/tri-block copolymers of poly N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide–b-poly histidine/poly leucine (pHPMA-pHis/pLeu) were developed through sequential RAFT and ring-opening polymerization. Chemical structure of the synthesized copolymers was studied by FT-IR and ¹H NMR spectroscopy and their molecular weight was characterized by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The study of dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealed that copolymers could self-assemble into nanomicelles with particle size (PS) of 96–233nm which increased in acidic media. Higher fₚLₑᵤ and fₚLₑᵤ/fₚHᵢₛ led to significantly smaller PS and CMC values, respectively. Higher CMC values, together with zeta potential reversal at acidic pH and having buffering activity at pH range of about 6–8 were indications of protonation of imidazole groups of histidine residues and pH-sensitiveness of hybrid copolymers. Atomic force microscopy also proved the DLS data. Hemocompatibility assay demonstrated that while only tri-block copolymers caused hemolysis at neutral pH, all copolymers caused significant hemolysis at low concentrations at pH 5.2 and pLeu had opposite effects on hemolysis percent at different pH values. Paclitaxel was efficiently loaded in nanomicelles with highest loading efficiency (LE) of 75% which was influenced by the composition of the copolypeptide block. PTX-loaded micelles of tri-block copolymer 5-5-3 showed accelerated PTX release in endosomal pH. In conclusion, the optimum designed copolymer can be considered as a good pH-sensitive candidate for drug delivery to solid tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3achemical structure 3acomposite polymers 3adrugs 3agel chromatography 3ahemolysis 3ahistidine 3aleucine 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3amolecular weight 3aneoplasms 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apaclitaxel 3aparticle size 3apolymerization 3azeta potential 0aPoly N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide 0aPolyhistidine 0aPolyleucine 0aNanomicelle 0aPaclitaxel 0aHemocompatibility1 aYousefi, Gholamhossein1 aTamaddon, Ali-Mohammad0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Jan. 20, v. 537 p.217-226dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245007800161300001600239520122900255592002801484650001501512650001601527650001401543650001501557650001301572650001101585650001101596650002001607650002601627650001101653700001401664700001401678700001501692700001501707700001701722700001301739700001701752700001701769700001701786773010101803856004801904852000901952655001201961IND4484002220221118040328.0120715e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448400222DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-010-4311-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jing13aTherole of human ADA2a in the regulation of p53 acetylation and stability  ap. 397-405.  aThe tumor suppressor protein p53 is a well-known transcription factor that functions as a critical component of the genotoxic stress response via regulating the expression of effector proteins that control cellular fate following DNA damage. The human p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF)-containing histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex is important for the stability and activity of p53 via its acetylation. The human homolog of yeast alteration/deficiency in activation 2a (ADA2a) is a stable component of the human PCAF-containing HAT complex. In this study, we demonstrated that p53 and hADA2a physically interact with each other in human HEK 293T cells. Using overexpression and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown, we demonstrated that hADA2a stabilizes p53 via promoting its acetylation at lysine 320 â a PCAF-dependent acetylation site. Furthermore, hADA2a can potentiate the transcriptional activity of p53 at the BAX and p21 promoters to induce cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Overall, our results establish that hADA2a, a component of the PCAF-containing histone acetyltransferase co-activator complex, is a mediator of acetylation-dependent stabilization and activation of p53 in mammalian cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aacetylation 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3ahistones 3ahumans 3alysine 3astress response 3atranscription factors 3ayeasts1 aZhang, Li1 aXiao, Lin1 aXu, LanJun1 aHu, FanLei1 aShao, WenWei1 aLiu, Wei1 aMo, XiaoNing1 aShi, TaiPing1 aQiu, XiaoYan0 tChinese science bulletin.g2011 Feb., v. 56, no. 4-5 p.397-405dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-010-4311-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245008800171300001800259500001900277520123900296592002801535596007201563596007201635596007201707596007201779596007201851650004401923650003701967650002102004650001402025650001302039650001902052650002802071650001802099650001302117650001702130650001302147650001702160650002102177700001602198700002202214700002002236700001902256700002102275700002202296700006202318773012102380856008202501852000902583655001202592IND60717792320221119100805.0201117e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071779232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-05504-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMai, Ngoc Xuan Dat10aReducing particle size of biodegradable nanomaterial for efficient curcumin loading  ap. 3713-3722.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPeriodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) are well known as highly potential materials in biomedical applications. In this work, biodegradable PMO nanoparticles, named E4S, which was incorporated of redox-responsive tetrasulfide bonds, were successfully synthesized with particle size smaller than 50 nm. We study the effect of synthetic conditions, especially the amounts of an alkaline catalyst on particle size and porosity of the nanomaterial. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, N₂ isotherm sorption, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and thermogravimetric analysis techniques were applied to define structural characteristics. Curcumin, a highly hydrophobic, bioactive natural product, was chosen for loading onto the porous structure of E4S. The material exhibited high efficiency for curcumin loading with the capacity up to 1984 mg g⁻¹. According to the loading investigation of the nanoparticles with various sizes, it is noted that the smallest particle shows the highest curcumin loading capacity which may result from small particle sizes and high specific surface area. These results suggest that ethane-tetrasulfide BPMO could be used as an excellent nanomaterial for curcumin loading.  aPublisher supplied data  aVNU-A-562-2018-50-01cViet Nam National University Ho Chi Minh City  aVNU-A-562-2018-50-01cViet Nam National University Ho Chi Minh City  aVNU-A-562-2018-50-01cViet Nam National University Ho Chi Minh City  aVNU-A-562-2018-50-01cViet Nam National University Ho Chi Minh City  aVNU-A-562-2018-50-01cViet Nam National University Ho Chi Minh City 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abiodegradability 3acatalysts 3acurcumin 3ahydrophobicity 3aorganosilicon compounds 3aparticle size 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asorption 3asurface area 3athermogravimetry1 aDang, Y Thi1 aTa, Hanh Kieu Thi1 aBae, Jong-Seong1 aPark, Sungkyun1 aPhan, Bach Thang1 aTamanoi, Fuyuhiko1 aDoan, Tan Le Hoang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6312-95710 tJournal of materials science.g2021 Feb., v. 56, no. 5 p.3713-3722dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-05504-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014900166520120400315592002801519650002201547650002501569650001801594650000901612650001901621650002401640650002201664653002201686653001801708653002001726653002601746700001601772700001401788700002801802700002401830700005501854700001501909773012201924856008102046852000902127655001202136IND60744297920221119024428.0211030e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074429792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1121112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Zhanmei10aComparisons of characteristics, kinetics and biological activities of glycosylated α-lactalbumin produced by microwave and conventional heating  aThe characteristics, kinetic mechanisms and biological activities of glycosylated α-lactalbumin prepared under microwave heating (MH) and conventional heating (CH) at 85 °C for 1–3 h were compared and investigated. Glycosylated α-lactalbumin prepared by microwave heating showed a higher degree of browning and more free amino groups as compared to preparation by conventional heating. Studies of the reaction kinetics demonstrated that microwave heating induced a higher rate constant at 75 °C, 85 °C and 95 °C. Similarly, the activation energy of the microwave-mediated process was 8.27 kJ/mol lower than under conventional heating, indicating that microwave heating accelerated the glycosylation of α-lactalbumin. The glycosylated α-lactalbumin produced in the microwave showed greater surface hydrophobicity after 3 h than the conventionally heated product. Glycosylated α-lactalbumin produced via microwave heating also showed higher total antioxidant capacity and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Therefore, microwave heating effectively promotes α-lactalbumin glycosylation and enhances the functional properties and biological activities of glycosylated α-lactalbumin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aantioxidant activity 3aglycosylation 3aheat 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrowave treatment 3areaction kinetics 0aMicrowave heating 0aRate constant 0aCharacteristics 0aBiological activities1 aYu, Haiying1 aChen, Wei1 aGantumur, Munkh-Amgalan1 aBilawala, Akhunzada1 aHou, Juncai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6375-756X1 aWang, Huan0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Nov., v. 151 p.112111-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1121113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012300168300001600291520107900307592002801386650001101414650002401425650001901449650001101468650001201479650001801491650001501509650001901524650001601543650001101559650003201570650002201602650001301624650001301637650001201650650002301662650001901685650000701704650001101711650001801722700001601740700001801756700002601774700005901800773012401859856008101983852000902064655001202073IND60680904020221119150110.0200110e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068090402DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-018-0385-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagare, Mayur E.13aAn Integrated Process of Value Addition to Citrus Waste and Performance of Fenton Process for Its Conversion to Biogas  ap. 165-172.  aCitrus fruits are commercially important fruit crop all over the world. About 50–60% of citrus fruit is considered waste including peels and its handling is costly at municipal and industry levels. Citrus wastes in general show a low pH (3–4), relatively high water content and organic matter. Its composting is not recommended, as it has inherent low pH and presence of high concentration of limonene in essential oils that slow down its biological decomposition due to inhibitory activity. Anaerobic digestion for biogas production seems to be a technically sustainable way to valorise by suitable pre-treatment methods. Present study shows extraction of essential oil in minimum requirement of water (1:1 w/v) for hydro-distillation that yields about 2% essential oil from fresh peels. Further, pre-treatment of left over de-oiled biomass with of 30% Fenton’s reagent treatment show biogas and methane production up to 322.63 ml biogas/g VS feed and 122.48 ml methane/g VS feed, respectively under mesophilic condition which is superior to conventional treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradation 3abiogas 3abiomass 3acitrus fruits 3acomposting 3aessential oils 3afruit crops 3afruits 3agas production (biological) 3ahydrodistillation 3aindustry 3alimonene 3amethane 3amethane production 3aorganic matter 3apH 3awastes 3awater content1 aSahu, Nidhi1 aKanade, G.

However, the groundwater traditional models and field measurements are limited due to the fluctuations in hydrological cycles and the difficulty in the accurate quantification of associated parameters. Here, we hypothesized that maximum potential tree height could be used to predict groundwater depth due to the hydraulic limitation of water transportation. To address this hypothesis, we measured two proxy indicators of maximum potential tree height, i.e., the maxima of heights and volumes, of three common dominant tree species in northwest China to construct classical measurement error (CME) model for predicting groundwater depth in an arid region. Our results showed that the optimal model based on maximum tree height had the best predictive performance of groundwater depth, particularly the tallest plant species. The CME model showed that maximum tree height played a vital role in predicting groundwater depth. Mathematically the model can be expressed as: [Eln(Dw)lnTh,θ)=7.11-1.85ExlnTh,θ), where Dw and Th are respectively the theoretical values of groundwater depth and maximum tree height; x is the measured maximum tree height; θ = {7.11, −1.85, 7.19, 0.15, 1.91, 13.45}; R2 = 0.82; Marginal log-Likelihood = −131.04; RMSE = 0.33]. In addition, Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation together with correlation analysis indicated that groundwater depth prediction based on maximum tree height in arid regions was an accurate and promising approach. In conclusion, our study showed that the hydraulic limitation of water transportation led to a negative relationship between maximum tree height and groundwater depth. Our developed model for predicting groundwater depth with maximum tree height has provided the important basis for the conservation and management of groundwater resources in arid regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic cycle 3amodels 3aprediction 3atree height 3atrees 3awater table 3aChina 0aArid region 0aGroundwater depth 0aPredictive model 0aMaximum tree height 0aTallest plant species1 aQie, Ya-Dong1 aTeng, De-Xiong1 aʻAlī, Arshad,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9966-29171 aXu, Yilu1 aBolan, Nanthi1 aLiu, Wei-Guo1 aLv, Guang-Hui1 aMa, Li-Gang1 aYang, Sheng-Tian1 aZibibula, Simayi0 tJournal of hydrology.g2019 July, v. 574 p.46-52dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.04.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011400172300001800286520109100304592002801395650002701423650002201450650001201472650006601484650001301550650001501563773012001578856008101698852000901779655001201788IND60583556320221118035939.0171018e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058355632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-017-0865-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Lorenzo, Flaviana14aThe lipopolysaccharide lipid A structure from the marine sponge-associated bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. 2A  ap. 1401-1412.  aSuberites domuncula is a marine demosponge harbouring a large bacterioflora, including commensal, opportunistic and pathogenic bacteria, among which, species of the Gram-negative genus Pseudoalteromonas were identified.

Successful on-farm adoption of measures is contingent upon farmer perception of the relative practicality of implementing the measure and associated incentives and advice. In the absence of a comprehensive evidence base we utilised Best–Worst Scaling, a discrete choice survey method, to elicit expert and farmer opinion on the relative effectiveness and practicality of mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from sheep production systems. The method enabled individual mitigation measures to be ranked on a ratio scale of effectiveness (expert opinion) and practicality (farmer opinion). Six measures were identified as possessing the combined qualities of effectiveness and practicality and are considered priority candidates for policy promotion. The overall preferred measure was the use of legumes in pasture reseed mixes. Estimation and analysis of the distribution of individual respondent scores revealed heterogeneity in farmers’ perceptions of practicality, suggesting that flexible policies are required to enable farmers to select mitigation measures most suited to their farm type and locality. Practical measures with below average effectiveness may be widely adopted with limited regulation, incentivisation or advice, whilst some highly effective measures with lower practicality are likely to present greater obstacles to adoption.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aenvironmental science 3aexpert opinion 3afarmers 3afarms 3aforage legumes 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3aproduction technology 3asheep 3asheep industry 3asurveys 3auncertainty 0aRed meat 0aLamb production 0aCarbon footprint 0aClimate change 0aFarmer attitudes 0aMax-diff1 aJones, D.L.1 aEdwards-Jones, G.1 aCross, P.0 tEnvironmental Science and Policy.g2013 May, v. 29 p.46-56dElsevier Ltdx1462-90117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2013.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011300168300001400281520131400295592002801609650001201637650002601649650002401675650002001699650001501719650001901734650001101753650000701764650002501771650001901796653002601815653003301841653001801874653002301892700001301915700002401928700001401952700001601966773010401982856008702086852000902173655001202182IND60583942320221120225846.0201125e20180120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058394232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.09.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Kailin10apH-responsive liposomes self-assembled from electrosprayed microparticles, and their drug release properties  ap. 20-27.  aIn this work, composite Eudragit L100/phosphatidyl choline microparticles were fabricated through electrospraying. pH-responsive liposomes were found to self-assemble from these when the microparticles were added into aqueous media. The microparticles and the liposomes were both approximately spherical in shape according to electron microscopy, but the liposomes have much smaller diameters (200–300nm) than the electrosprayed particles (1.6–1.7μm). The zeta potential of the liposomes is approximately −30mV, which suggests the formation of stable suspensions. Varying the pH conditions used for self-assembly causes the liposomes to change their shape and structure, due to the influence of the Eudragit molecules. Microparticles comprising Eudragit, phosphatidyl choline and the model drug ketoprofen were also prepared. Upon their addition to water, ketoprofen was found to be loaded into the liposomes self-assembled from the particles with an entrapment efficiency of 75%. pH-dependent release was observed from the drug-loaded liposomes. At pH 4.5, only 58% of the drug loaded was released after 12h, while 80% was released at pH 7.4. Overall, these results demonstrate that the pH-dependent liposomes developed have great potential for application as stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholine 3adrug delivery systems 3aelectron microscopy 3aelectrospraying 3aketoprofen 3amicroparticles 3amodels 3apH 3aphosphatidylcholines 3azeta potential 0apH-dependent liposome 0aElectrosprayed microparticle 0aSelf-assembly 0aOral drug delivery1 aLi, Heyu1 aWilliams, Gareth R.1 aWu, Junzi1 aZhu, Li-Min0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Jan. 20, v. 537 p.20-27dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.09.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245011200202300001800314500001900332520151000351592002801861596005901889596005901948596005902007596006502066650002102131650001602152650001802168650003102186650002102217650001502238650001702253650001102270650001902281650001302300650001702313700001702330700001902347700001802366700001602384700001902400700001602419700001802435700001502453700001202468773012102480856008202601852000902683655001202692IND60717792720221119100306.0201117e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071779272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-05540-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Minyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4752-841412aA strategy to prepare activated carbon fiber membranes for flexible solid-state supercapacitor applications  ap. 3911-3924.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe development of flexible supercapacitors is highly desired for electrode materials with good flexibility and a high specific surface area. The electrospun carbon fiber membranes (CFMs) have the possibility of being used as flexible electrodes due to their one-dimensional fiber structure. The pristine CFMs generally have poor porosity, and the activation process is of the essence. However, the conventional blending activation process will produce an uneven pore distribution and destroy the fiber membrane structure, which is not conducive to maintaining the flexibility of CFMs and hindering the application in flexible supercapacitors. Herein, by treating the electrospun CFMs with KOH impregnation activation process, we have succeeded in making the activation of CFMs more uniform and avoiding the occurrence of local over-activation. On the premise of ensuring that the fiber structure of CFMs is not damaged, the specific surface area of activated CFMs (ACFMs) was increased to 2408 m² g⁻¹, and the mechanical flexibility of CFMs was well maintained. As a result, the optimal ACFMs delivers a specific capacitance of 289.2 F g⁻¹ at a current density of 0.5 A g⁻¹ in aqueous electrolyte and an energy density of 14.8 Wh kg⁻¹ in neutral electrolyte. In addition, the flexible solid-state symmetric supercapacitor also shows excellent electrochemical performance, making it have great potential in energy storage applications for wearable, foldable, and portable electronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data  a61604089cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a61704098cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a11904209cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aZR2017BF025cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province 3aactivated carbon 3acapacitance 3acarbon fibers 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3aporosity 3asurface area1 aGeng, Shitao1 aJiang, Qinting1 aXu, Chengrong1 aZhang, Ying1 aYin, Guangchao1 aJia, Fuchao1 aWang, Xiaomei1 aZhou, Tong1 aLiu, Bo0 tJournal of materials science.g2021 Feb., v. 56, no. 5 p.3911-3924dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-05540-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245010300191300001700294500001100311520110000322592002801422650001401450650001501464650001001479650001201489650002501501650001801526650001401544650001301558650002901571650002201600650001201622650001801634650002501652650003001677650003601707650001101743650003101754650001101785650004001796650003301836650002501869650003601894650002701930650002401957700001901981700002202000700002502022700002002047700002202067773012002089852000902209856008902218655001202307IND4424505520221118042046.0210417e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442450552DNAL7 a195584222pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02922.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDodds, Peter N.10aEffectors of biotrophic fungi and oomycetes: pathogenicity factors and triggers of host resistance  ap. 993-1000.  aREVIEW  aMany biotrophic fungal and oomycete pathogens share a common infection process involving the formation of haustoria, which penetrate host cell walls and form a close association with plant membranes. Recent studies have identified a class of pathogenicity effector proteins from these pathogens that is transferred into host cells from haustoria during infection. This insight stemmed from the identification of avirulence (Avr) proteins from these pathogens that are recognized by intracellular host resistance (R) proteins. Oomycete effectors contain a conserved translocation motif that directs their uptake into host cells independently of the pathogen, and is shared with the human malaria pathogen. Genome sequence information indicates that oomycetes may express several hundred such host‐translocated effectors. Elucidating the transport mechanism of fungal and oomycete effectors and their roles in disease offers new opportunities to understand how these pathogens are able to manipulate host cells to establish a parasitic relationship and to develop new disease‐control measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOomycetes 3acell walls 3afungi 3amalaria 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aproteins 2aAlgal Proteinsxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Motifs 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Transport 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aFungixgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aGenome 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aHumans 2aOomycetesxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlantsxmicrobiology 2aPlasmodium falciparumxgenetics 2aTranslocation, Genetic 2aVirulencexgenetics1 aRafiqi, Maryam1 aGan, Pamela H.

However, very little is known about long-term (decades–centuries) structural changes in these communities. The development of aboveground–belowground linkages during century-scale succession is also poorly understood. Our study addressed this knowledge gap by investigating SMC and plant communities undergoing primary succession on an 850-year chronosequence of lava flows in Iceland. We hypothesised that communities of microfungi and bacteria would respond to progressive changes in vegetation and that SMC diversity would increase with terrain age. Soil samples were collected from three lava flows at different stages of primary succession (165, 621 and 852 years after lava flow emplacement). Plant community composition was surveyed as the samples were collected. The composition of the SMCs present in the soil was determined using amplicon pyrosequencing. The physical and chemical properties of the soil were also analysed. The results of the study indicated changes in plant and fungal communities with increasing terrain age. Distinct plant and fungal assemblages were identified on the three sites and both communities became richer and more diverse with increasing terrain age. There was also evidence to suggest the development of mycorrhizal associations on older sites. In contrast, the composition and structure of the bacterial communities did not change systematically with terrain age. Similarly, there were few changes in soil properties: SOM concentrations and pH, both of which have been demonstrated to be important to SMCs, were constant across the chronosequence. These results suggest that plant community composition is significant for fungal communities, but less relevant for bacterial communities. This finding has implications for studies of primary succession and the biogeochemical impact of vegetation change in high-latitude ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abotanical composition 3acarbon cycle 3achronosequences 3afungal communities 3afungi 3alatitude 3alava 3anutrients 3apH 3aplant communities 3aprimary succession 3asequence analysis 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil sampling 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3avegetation 3aIceland 0aIceland 0aSoil ecology 0aCommunity assembly 0aPlant–soil interactions 0aAboveground–belowground linkages 0aMycorrhizal fungi1 aChaput, Dominique L.1 avan der Gast, Christopher J.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2014 Feb., v. 69 p.359-370dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2013.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04074naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245013100199300001600330500002000346506007600366520193900442592002802381596003202409596003202441596003102473596003202504596004502536596003802581506003702619650003002656650002502686650003202711650002602743650001902769650003302788650001802821650002202839650001002861650003502871650001102906650001502917650001102932650003002943650001802973650001302991650002103004650002203025650001603047650002303063650001403086650001203100700002203112700002003134700006303154773012503217856007303342852000903415655001203424IND60632436220221207081950.0190314e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063243622DNAL7 a10.1111/mpp.127642doi7 aPMC66379002pmcid7 a303751502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEskelin, Katri10aRibosome profiles and riboproteomes of healthy and Potato virus A‐ and Agrobacterium‐infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants  ap. 392-409.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNicotiana benthamiana is an important model plant for plant–microbe interaction studies. Here, we compared ribosome profiles and riboproteomes of healthy and infected N. benthamiana plants. We affinity purified ribosomes from transgenic leaves expressing a FLAG‐tagged ribosomal large subunit protein RPL18B of Arabidopsis thaliana. Purifications were prepared from healthy plants and plants that had been infiltrated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying infectious cDNA of Potato virus A (PVA) or firefly luciferase gene, referred to here as PVA‐ or Agrobacterium‐infected plants, respectively. Plants encode a number of paralogous ribosomal proteins (r‐proteins). The N. benthamiana riboproteome revealed approximately 6600 r‐protein hits representing 424 distinct r‐proteins that were members of 71 of the expected 81 r‐protein families. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD011602. The data indicated that N. benthamiana ribosomes are heterogeneous in their r‐protein composition. In PVA‐infected plants, the number of identified r‐protein paralogues was lower than in Agrobacterium‐infected or healthy plants. A. tumefaciens proteins did not associate with ribosomes, whereas ribosomes from PVA‐infected plants co‐purified with viral cylindrical inclusion protein and helper component proteinase, reinforcing their possible role in protein synthesis during virus infection. In addition, viral NIa protease‐VPg, RNA polymerase NIb and coat protein were occasionally detected. Infection did not affect the proportions of ribosomal subunits or the monosome to polysome ratio, suggesting that no overall alteration in translational activity took place on infection with these pathogens. The riboproteomic data of healthy and pathogen‐infected N. benthamiana will be useful for studies on the specific use of r‐protein paralogues to control translation in infected plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a1138329cAcademy of Finland  a1298254cAcademy of Finland  a127969cAcademy of Finland  a1258978cAcademy of Finland  a4704372cJane and Aatos Erkko Foundation  cJenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPotato virus A 3abacterial diseases of plants 3acoat proteins 3acomplementary DNA 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aleaves 3aluciferase 3amodels 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aplant viruses 3apotatoes 3aprotein subunits 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteinases 3aribosomal proteins 3aribosomes 3aviruses1 aVarjosalo, Markku1 aRavantti, Janne1 aMäkinen, Kristiina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8233-89420 tMolecular plant pathology.g2019 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.392-409dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60298x1464-67227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.127643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008800171300001600259520163900275592002801914650002701942650001701969650002101986650001702007650000702024650001102031650001802042700001702060700001902077700002002096700002102116700001702137773008002154856008602234852000902320655001202329IND60084956620221118150223.0141101e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008495662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei-Ting10aSilver recovery and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal from waste fixer solutions  ap. 187-192.  aThis study focused on the silver recovery from waste fixer solutions by electrolysis under different experimental conditions.

Additionally, the pH values of the waste fixer solutions were adjusted prior to treatment by electrolysis, and the silver recovery was 100% for a solution with pH 8 that underwent electrolysis for 8h at an electric current of 0.9A. The recovery efficiency of silver was 88.64% for an electric current of 3A and a duration of 3.5h, but the recovery efficiency of silver decreased to 83.72% for an electrolytic time of 6h. Furthermore, the recovery efficiency of silver increased to 99.55% with a decreased electrolysis time of 2.5h when the solution was adjusted to pH 8 at an electric current of 3A. These results suggest that the most suitable experimental conditions were an electric current of 3A, pH 8, and 2.5h of electrolysis. The treated waste fixer solutions still had high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD) after electrolysis. The addition of 30mL of sulfuric acid to 1000mL of waste fixer solution resulted in a COD removal efficiency of 42%. Furthermore, when the waste fixer solutions were treated by distillation to remove COD, the removal efficiency of COD was 99.3%. Although a higher COD removal efficiency was obtained by employing distillation, the cost of the distillation treatment was more expensive.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical oxygen demand 3adistillation 3aelectric current 3aelectrolysis 3apH 3asilver 3asulfuric acid1 aMa, Chin-Chi1 aLee, Ming-Hsun1 aChu, Yung-Chuan1 aTsai, Lung-Chang1 aShu, Chi-Min0 tApplied energy.g2012 Dec., v. 100 p.187-192dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015600173520124100329592002801570650004401598650002201642650001301664650002401677650001601701650003701717650002801754650001701782650003901799650001101838650001601849650001101865650000701876650002701883650003201910650001301942650003701955650002501992653001702017653003102034653001002065653002802075653004302103700002302146700002302169700002502192773009102217856008602308852000902394655001202403IND60727043420221120100341.0220124e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072704342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1221672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlyami, Bandar A.10aNiFe2O4 nanospheres functionalized with 2-(2, 4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-3, 5, 7-trihydroxychromen-4-one for selective solid-phase microextraction of aluminium  aHerein, a rational combination of dispersive solid-phase sorbent and 2-(2, 4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-3, 5, 7-trihydroxychromen-4-one (morin) was proposed for sensitive and selective determination of Al³⁺ ion. Nickel ferrite nanospheres (NiFe₂O₄ NS) functionalized with morin was used to preconcentrate and estimate Al³⁺ via the formation of fluorescent complex at pH 7.0. The functionalization was assisted by anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and ultrasonication. The results revealed that the fluorescence intensity of Al-morin/SDS@ NiFe₂O₄ NS is higher than Al-morin. Functionalization of NiFe₂O₄ NS with morin was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), powder X-ray diffractometer (PXRD), and fluorescence spectroscopy. Under the optimum conditions, the fluorescence intensity increased with increasing of Al³⁺ concentrations in the range of 0.28–500.0 ng mL⁻¹ with LOD (S/N = 3) of 0.09 ng mL⁻¹.

This feeding results in discoloration and distortion of the leaf tissue. Although damage from thrips feeding on foliage is common and appears substantial, recent studies have demonstrated little impact on cowpea yield. Caging up to ten F. fusca per cowpea seedling failed to significantly reduce number of pods, seed number, or seed weight when compared to cowpea seedlings caged with no thrips. Also, no significant differences in the days to initial flowering were detected among the treatments, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 5, or 10 thrips per seedling. In field studies, the insecticide, bifenthrin, applied to cowpea seedlings effectively reduced the number of thrips and significantly reduced foliar damage when compared to non-treated seedlings. At harvest however, no significant differences were detected among the other variables tested, i.e., pods per plant, seed per plant, seed per pod, seed weight per plant, nor weight per seed. Thus, data indicate that the impact of F. fusca on cowpea produced in the US is likely less than previously thought and early season thrips management is of little value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrankliniella fusca 3abifenthrin 3acowpeas 3acrop yield 3adiscoloration 3aflowering 3aleaves 3apods 3aseed weight 3aseedlings 3aSoutheastern United States1 aRashid, Tahir0 tPlant health progress.g2012, v. 13, no. 1dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:6160x1535-10257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHP-2012-1019-01-RS3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245005600173520130600229592002801535650002901563650001601592650001601608650002101624650001101645650001301656650002101669653001201690653001401702653002701716653001901743700002201762700006001784700002301844773009101867856008601958852000902044655001202053IND60727043620221120100332.0220124e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072704362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1221692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelinte, Gheorghe10aAptasensors for lysozyme detection: Recent advances  aLysozyme is an enzyme existing in multiple organisms where it plays various vital roles. The most important role is its antibacterial activity in the human body; in fact, it is also called “the body's own antibiotic”. Despite its proven utility, lysozyme can potentially trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals, even in trace amounts. Therefore, lysozyme determination in foods is becoming of paramount importance. Traditional detection methods are expensive, time-consuming and they cannot be applied for fast in-situ quantification. Electrochemical and optical sensors have attracted an increasing attention due to their versatility and ability to reduce the disadvantages of traditional methods. Using an aptamer as the bioreceptor, the sensor selectivity is amplified due to the specific recognition of the analyte. This review is presenting the progresses made in lysozyme determination by means of electrochemical and optical aptasensors in the last five years. A critical overview on the methodologies employed for aptamer immobilization and on the strategies for signal amplification of the assays will be described. Different optical and electrochemical aptasensors will be discussed and compared in terms of analytical performances, versatility and real samples applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aaptasensors 3aelectrochemistry 3ahumans 3alysozyme 3aoligonucleotides 0aAptamer 0aAllergens 0aElectrochemical sensor 0aOptical sensor1 aSelvolini, Giulia1 aCristea, Cecilia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4158-33241 aMarrazza, Giovanna0 tTalanta.g2021 May 01, v. 226 p.122169-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1221693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01449naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245008800167520042000255592002800675650001600703650002100719650002200740650000900762650001900771650001500790650002200805651001400827651001300841700002000854700002600874773011800900856008401018852000901102655001201111IND60622468820221118082740.0181130s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062246882DNAL7 a10.1094/PHP-2012-1023-01-BR2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLockhart, Ben10aAssociation of Spirea Stunt Phytoplasma with a Disease of Spiraea spp. in Minnesota  aSpireas (Spiraea spp.) are woody perennial ornamentals that are widely grown throughout Minnesota and in other states due to their cold hardiness and adaptability to a variety of low-maintenance landscape settings.

The PF experiments were performed in a lab-scale compound parabolic collector (CPC) photoreactor using artificial solar radiation. The photocatalytic reaction rate was determined while varying the total dissolved iron concentration (20–100 mg Fe2+/L), solution pH (2.0–3.6), operating temperature (10–50 °C), type of acid used for acidification (H2SO4, HCl and H2SO4 + HCl) and UV irradiance (22–68 W/m2). This work also tries to elucidate the role of ferric hydroxides, ferric sulphate and ferric chloride species, by taking advantage of ferric speciation diagrams, in the efficiency of the PF reaction when applied to leachate oxidation. The molar fraction of the most photoactive ferric species, FeOH2+, was linearly correlated with the PF pseudo-first order kinetic constants obtained at different solution pH and temperature values. Ferric ion speciation diagrams also showed that the presence of high amounts of chloride ions negatively affected the PF reaction, due to the decrease of ferric ions solubility and scavenging of hydroxyl radicals for chlorine radical formation. The increment of the PF reaction rates with temperature was mainly associated with the increase of the molar fraction of FeOH2+. The optimal parameters for the photo-Fenton reaction were: pH = 2.8 (acidification agent: H2SO4); T = 30 °C; [Fe2+] = 60 mg/L and UV irradiance = 44 WUV/m2, achieving 72% mineralization after 25 kJUV/L of accumulated UV energy and 149 mM of H2O2 consumed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aactivated sludge 3achlorine 3aenergy 3aferric chloride 3aferric sulfate 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxides 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aions 3airon 3alandfill leachates 3alandfills 3amineralization 3aoxidation 3apH 3asolar radiation 3asolubility 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 0aSanitary landfill leachate 0aPhoto-Fenton parameters 0aLab-scale prototype 0aFerric ion speciation diagrams1 aFerreira, Rui1 aSoares, Petrick A.1 aManenti, Diego R.1 aFonseca, Amélia1 aSaraiva, Isabel1 aBoaventura, Rui A.R.1 aVilar, Vítor J.P.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 164 p.32-40dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.08.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245008200161300001600243520150800259592002801767653001301795653001001808653001101818653002301829653002401852700001701876700002501893773009101918856008402009852000902093655001202102IND60126306820221119040206.0151105e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012630682DNAL7 a10.1675/1524-4695-31.4.6452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Lei14aThe Declining Importance of the Fujian Coast, China, for Wintering Waterbirds  ap. 645-650.  aEast China is a very important wintering region for many migratory waterbirds, but many species have suffered large population declines over recent decades. However, the limited information available on the current and historical abundances of waterbirds in the region seriously limits our ability to assess the magnitude of these declines. The first comprehensive count of the complete Fujian coastline, conducted over a three-week period in February 2006, provided the opportunity to compare data from this count with historical information on waterbird abundances along the Fujian coast obtained during the second half of the 1800s and early-1990s. Our count total of nearly 110,000 birds of 65 species shows that the Fujian coast is still very important for waterbirds during the wintering period. We obtained abundance comparisons for 28 species of which 19 had declined greatly in the last 100-150 years; four of these are globally threatened. The Anatidae group, in particular, has suffered seriously in diversity and numbers during the last century and this finding is consistent with observed decreases in breeding numbers. Given population declines and the great importance of east China as a wintering area for waterbirds (including some globally threatened species), an important priority should be to determine the current status of the different species throughout the region. This information will be useful in proposing effective conservation measures including monitoring in east China.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAnatidae 0aChina 0aFujian 0apopulation decline 0awaterbird abundance1 aBarter, Mark1 aLewthwaite3, Richard0 tWaterbirds.g2008 Dec., v. 31, no. 4 p.645-650dThe Waterbird Societyx1524-46957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1675%2F1524-4695-31.4.6453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012300172300001600295520144400311592002801755650002501783650001201808650001901820650002901839650002201868650001101890650001301901650001101914650001401925650001201939773008001951856008602031852000902117655001202126IND60084956920221118150225.0141101e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008495692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.02.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsu, Chiung-Wen10aUsing a system dynamics model to assess the effects of capital subsidies and feed-in tariffs on solar PV installations  ap. 205-217.  aTo achieve national CO₂ emission reduction targets, the Taiwanese government is planning to adopt policies, such as feed-in tariffs (FITs) and capital subsidies, in order to attract the public as well as companies to invest in and use solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. However, a huge budget is necessary for the government to implement such policies. Therefore, it is important that it fully recognizes which policy, or combination of policies, promoting solar PV applications has the greatest economic benefit. This study uses the system dynamics approach to develop a simulation for assessing these promotion policies. Using this simulation system, policymakers can carry out cost/benefit analyses for different combinations of promotion policies, CO₂ emission reduction goals, and budget limitations. In addition, the simulation scenarios include different FIT prices, subsidies, and upper limits of annual ROI (return of investment). The simulation period is from 2011 to 2030. We find that when adopting only FITs or capital subsidies with a fixed upper limit of ROI, increasing the FIT price or subsidy is a good approach. When the upper limit of ROI is fixed, the effect of different combinations of FIT prices and subsidies on the accumulation of solar PV applications is insignificant. Nevertheless, the promotion policy with the higher subsidy and lower initial FIT price has a lower average cost of CO₂ emission reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acapital 3acarbon dioxide 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aplanning 3aprices 3asubsidies 3atariffs0 tApplied energy.g2012 Dec., v. 100 p.205-217dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.02.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245012000175300001600295520140400311592002801715650002801743650001201771650001401783650001701797650000901814650001001823650001601833650002501849650001201874650001401886650002201900650005201922650001301974650001001987650001801997700002302015700002502038700001802063700001802081773011502099856008202214852000902296655001202305IND60083555320221122050105.0141101e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008355532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoretz, Christopher A.10aSkeletal tissues in Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) express the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor  ap. 311-318.  aMolecular phylogenetic analysis suggests that the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) emerged evolutionarily in association with the chordate-vertebrate lineage. Our studies overall explore the evolution of CaSRs, and the possible historical linkage of CaSRs to vertebrate skeleton as functional components of calcium homeostasis through regulated storage and/or release. We applied both reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate Casr gene and CaSR protein expression, respectively, in skeletal tissues of a cichlid teleost, the Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus). By RT-PCR, CaSR gene (Casr) expression was observed in skull and vertebral column (including notochordal tissues). Relative to skeleton, IHC revealed CaSR protein expression in notochordal sheath cells within the vertebral canal, in scleroblasts associated with body surface scales, and in chondrocytes within hyaline cartilage. Although closely apposed cells border the acellular bone in tilapia, these cells were only weakly immunostained. We conclude, therefore, that CaSR is expressed in skeletal tissues of tilapia, an advanced teleost fish, and that Casr may be part of a genetic network associated with vertebrate skeletal system. Our immunohistochemical examination also newly revealed CaSR protein expression in epidermis and red muscle of fishes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis mossambicus 3acalcium 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3afish 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amuscles 3aphylogeny 3aprotein synthesis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3askeleton 3askull 3aspine (bones)1 aPollina, Catherine1 aHerberger, Amanda L.1 aHyodo, Susumu1 aTakei, Yoshio0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2012 Nov., v. 163, no. 3-4 p.311-318dElsevier Inc.x1095-64337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245010900181300001800290520175600308592002802064650001502092650001902107650001602126650002002142650001602162650003502178650001602213650001102229650001202240650001702252650001502269650001102284650002502295650001002320653002102330653001302351653002302364653000902387653001202396700001702408700002302425700002402448700002202472700002102494700001502515773013802530856008202668852000902750655001202759IND60516253620221118035614.0190726e20130528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051625362DNAL7 a230064542pmid7 a10.1017/S000711451200387X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yulan10aValidation of FFQ-based assessment of dietary lignans compared with serum enterolactone in Swedish women  ap. 1873-1880.  aThe validity of using FFQ to assess dietary lignans is uncertain. We aimed to validate the use of FFQ for the assessment of dietary intake of lignans compared to the serum biomarker enterolactone, the main product of dietary lignans' metabolism in human subjects. A random sample of women, aged 55–75 years, from the Swedish Mammography Cohort was selected. Information from two FFQ, the FFQ-87 (sixty-seven food items) and the FFQ-97 (ninety-three food items), and blood samples were collected. Dietary intake of lignans (secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, lariciresinol, pinoresinol, medioresinol and syringaresinol) was assessed by the FFQ. Serum concentrations of enterolactone were analysed by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay. The correlation coefficient between energy-adjusted lignan intake and serum enterolactone was estimated in crude and multivariable-adjusted models, taking into account the factors potentially influencing the serum enterolactone. Among the 135 participants aged 55–75 years, with a mean BMI of 26·7 kg/m², the average energy-adjusted intake of total lignans was 1616 (sd 424) and 1516 (sd 409) μg/d according to the FFQ-87 (forty-five food items containing lignans) and the FFQ-97 (sixty-five food items containing lignans), respectively. The mean concentration of serum enterolactone was 23·2 (sd 15·4) nmol/l. The adjusted Pearson's correlation between dietary intake of lignans assessed by the FFQ-97 and serum enterolactone was statistically significant (r 0·22, P= 0·01). No significant correlation was observed for the FFQ-87 (r 0·09, P= 0·30). The present study indicates that the FFQ-97 might be better than the FFQ-87 for assessing dietary intake of lignans, although the correlation was low.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3acorrelation 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afood intake 3ahumans 3alignans 3amatairesinol 3ametabolism 3amodels 3anutrition assessment 3awomen 0aPlant oestrogens 0aValidity 0aBiological markers 0aDiet 0aLignans1 aWolk, Alicja1 aHåkansson, Niclas1 aPeñalvo, Jose Luis1 aLagergren, Jesper1 aAdlercreutz, H.,1 aLu, Yunxia0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2013 May 28, v. 109, no. 10 p.1873-1880dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000711451200387X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05162naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245013700162300001100299500000900310520344200319592002803761650001003789650000903799650002303808650001203831650000903843650001003852650002003862650001903882650001803901650001803919650002003937650001303957650002303970650001803993650001304011650002004024650002604044650002304070650001004093650001404103650001104117650001104128650001604139650002104155650001204176650001904188650001404207700001504221700001404236700001804250700001504268700001804283700002104301773012804322856007704450852000904527655001204536IND60677221220221121054902.0191123e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067722122DNAL7 a10.221751/rmc2017.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPringle, T. D.14aThe Impact of Selection Using Residual Average Daily Gain and Marbling Epds on Growth Performance and Carcass Traits in Angus Cattle  ap. 90.  aepub  aObjectivesAngus steers (n = 191) over a 3-yr period were used to compare growth performance, feed efficiency, body composition, and carcass characteristics from bulls divergently selected for feed efficiency. Angus sires were selected with high and low residual average daily gain (RADG) EPDs and high and average marbling (MARB) EPDs. Materials and MethodsSteer weight and body composition, via ultrasound, were measured at weaning and yearling ages. Steers entered the feedlot at 454 d of age and completed a 70-d GrowSafe Beef test to determine DMI, ADG, and RFI. Steers were then slaughtered under federal inspection as they reached a backfat thickness of 1.3 cm. Carcasses were chilled for 48 h at 2°C, ribbed, and USDA yield and quality grade data were collected. The right side of the carcass was fabricated and primal and subprimal weights were collected. A 2.5-cm longissimus steak was removed, vacuum-packaged, aged for 14 d, and frozen for slice shear force determination. Additionally, a 1.3 cm longissimus steak was removed from yr 3 steers for proximate analysis. The GLM procedure of SAS (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC) was used and the main effects of RADG and MARB and their interaction were tested by SIRE(RADG*MARB). Year was evaluated as a replicate. ResultsSteer weaning and yearling weights and ultrasound body composition were not affected (P ≥ 0.30) by RADG selection, except for the Lo RADG steers having higher (P ≤ 0.02) IMF values than the Hi RADG steers at both measurement times. For MARB selection, weaning weight, backfat and REA were higher (P ≤ 0.05) in the Hi vs. Lo MARB steers; however, no differences in weight or composition were noted at yearling. Feedlot gain, ADG, DMI and daily DMI were not affected (P > 0.20) by selection using RADG or MARB EPDs. However, feed efficiency measured by RFI (P = 0.05) and DM Gain:Feed (P = 0.11) was improved in the Hi RADG steers compared to their Lo RADG counterparts. Selection for increased marbling did not significantly affect feed efficiency measures. Slaughter and hot carcass weights were heavier (P ≤ 0.03) in the Hi vs. Lo RADG groups; however, no other carcass traits were impacted (P ≥ 0.14). Marbling score and adjusted 12th rib backfat tended to be higher (P = 0.10) in the Hi vs. Avg MARB groups. An interaction (P = 0.05) between RADG and MARB selection was found for marbling score, with the Lo RADG/Hi MARB steers having significantly higher marbling scores than all other groups which did not differ (P > 0.05) from each other. The distribution of quality grades across MARB groups revealed a higher percentage of low and average Prime carcasses in the Hi MARB group and a higher percentage of low Choice carcasses in the Avg MARB groups. No major differences were observed across the RADG and MARB groups in primal and subprimal yields or meat tenderness. Longissimus proximate composition from yr 3 steers showed that lipid content was higher in the Hi MARB and Lo RADG groups compared to the Lo MARB and Hi RADG groups, respectively. ConclusionThese findings suggest that selection using RADG or MARB EPDs has minimal impact on carcass yield, and positive selection pressure placed on these genetic values can potentially improve efficiency and carcass quality, respectively. Furthermore, it appears that improvements in feed efficiency can be attained without negatively impacting beef carcass merit, especially USDA quality grade.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngus 3aUSDA 3aaverage daily gain 3abackfat 3abeef 3abulls 3acarcass quality 3acarcass weight 3acarcass yield 3afat thickness 3afeed conversion 3afeedlots 3agrowth performance 3alipid content 3amarbling 3ameat tenderness 3aproximate composition 3aselection pressure 3asires 3aslaughter 3asteaks 3asteers 3aultrasonics 3avacuum packaging 3aweaning 3aweaning weight 3ayearlings1 aSegers, J.1 aWells, J.1 aDetweiler, R.1 aRekaya, R.1 aGilleland, H.1 aThinguldstad, B.0 tMeat and muscle biology.g2017 Jan., v. 1, no. 3 p.90-90dAmerican Meat Science AssociationwJournal:27149x2575-985X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.221751/rmc2017.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014300170300001600313520115200329592002801481650001901509650000901528650001201537650001901549650001101568650002201579650001601601651001001617653001901627653002801646653002301674653002401697653002801721653002701749653001801776653002001794700001801814700001901832700001801851700001601869700002001885700001701905700001701922700001801939700001801957700001701975773010801992856008602100852000902186655001202195IND60114136620221119081555.0190318e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011413662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Jichuang10aNon-additive effect of species diversity and temperature sensitivity of mixed litter decomposition in the alpine meadow on Tibetan Plateau  ap. 841-847.  aFew studies of the effects of litter diversity on the temperature sensitivity of mixed litter mass loss (MLML) are available. We tested the hypothesis that high litter diversity would reduce the magnitude of effects of climate and environmental change on MLML with 0.5/1 mm litter bags and sampling once after 1 yr of decomposition, using 51 combinations of litter mixtures from 25 dominant species at 3200 and 3800 m elevations on the Tibetan Plateau. Generally, our study supported our hypothesis. High temperature (i.e. lower elevation) reduced the dependency of MLML and non-additive effects on species richness. Species composition significantly affected MLML and its Q10 (i.e. the ratio of litter mass loss rate at a temperature T1 that is 10 °C lower than a temperature T2) when species richness was less than 8. Shrubs significantly decreased the Q10 of MLML when the species richness of litter mixture was less than 4. These findings suggest that the influence of future warming on MLML may depend on the balance between the magnitude of the impacts of climate change on shrub invasion and loss of species diversity in alpine region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine meadows 3abags 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3aChina 0aGlobal warming 0aLitter species richness 0aLitter composition 0aNon-additive effect 0aTemperature sensitivity 0aMixed litter mass loss 0aAlpine region 0aTibetan Plateau1 aWang, Shiping1 aZhang, Zhenhua1 aXu, Guangping1 aLuo, Caiyun1 aChang, Xiaofeng1 aZhu, Xiaoxue1 aCui, Shujuan1 aZhao, Xinquan1 aWang, Wenying1 aDu, Mingyuan0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2013 Feb., v. 57 p.841-847dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012000162300001600282500002000298520139800318592002801716650002201744650001601766650001201782650001601794650001401810650001401824650002401838650001401862650001001876650001601886650000901902650001501911650001201926650002901938650002401967650001801991650002002009650001102029650001702040650002102057650001402078700002002092700002302112773013302135856007402268961001302342852000902355655001202364IND60580843820221120182454.0171003e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058084382DNAL7 a10.1111/jwas.123992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNezafatian, Elham10aShort‐term Effects of Genistein on the Reproductive Characteristics of Male Gibel Carp, Carassius auratus gibelio  ap. 810-820.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of this study was to determine the effects of genistein or 17β‐estradiol (E2) on the reproductive physiology in male gibel carp, Carassius auratus gibelio. Maturing male gibel carp received intraperitoneal injections of E2 (10 µg/g body weight), one of two genistein doses (5 µg/g body weight, G5, or 50 µg/g body weight, G50), or the injection vehicle every other day for 10 d. Disruptions in reproductive capacity were determined by measuring indices of sperm quality, plasma metabolites and sex steroids, histological analyses of testes, fertilization rate, and offspring viability. E2 and genistein treatment reduced gonadosomatic index and milt volume, while reduction in spermatozoa concentration and spermatocrit occurred only in E2 and G50‐treated males. Histological examination of the testes indicates that E2 and genistein inhibited reproductive capacity through disruption of the spermatogenesis in males. Genistein reduced fertilization rate and offspring viability at 6 d after hatch (d.a.h.). Plasma testosterone and E2 decreased and increased, respectively, with E2 and G50 treatment. E2 and G50 treatment altered plasma metabolite phosphorus, calcium, cholesterol, and triglyceride. These findings indicate that genistein can negatively affect reproductive capacity in male gibel carp, suggesting that high dietary genistein may impair gonad development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarassius gibelio 3abody weight 3acalcium 3acholesterol 3aestradiol 3agenistein 3agonadosomatic index 3ahistology 3amales 3ametabolites 3amilt 3aphosphorus 3aprogeny 3areproductive performance 3asperm concentration 3asperm quality 3aspermatogenesis 3atestes 3atestosterone 3atriacylglycerols 3aviability1 aZadmajid, Vahid1 aCleveland, Beth M.0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2017 Oct., v. 48, no. 5 p.810-820dWiley Subscription Services, Inc.x0893-88497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jwas.123993Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01201naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245013800160300001600298520011600314592002800430650002000458650002100478650001900499650001300518650001000531700002700541700002100568700002300589700002100612700002400633773012500657856007200782852000900854655001200863IND60657760420221120234130.0190816e20060208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065776042DNAL7 a10.1039/b513662h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondière, Régis10aBoron-mediated polymerization of ylides derived from allylic arsonium salts: influence of the double bond substitution on the outcome  ap. 723-725.  aNew oligomers or polymers are prepared by polymerization of arsonium ylides in the presence of boron compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron compounds 3achemical bonding 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asalts1 aGoddard, Jean-Philippe1 aHuiban, Mickaël1 aCarrot, Géraldine1 aGall, Thierry Le1 aMioskowski, Charles0 tChemical communications.g2006 Feb. 8, , no. 7 p.723-725dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b513662h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245012400205300001000329520149300339592002801832596005501860650001501915650001601930650001001946650001501956650001101971650005001982650001602032650001302048650002102061650001402082650001502096650001902111650001902130650001502149650002602164650001402190650001802204650001502222651001102237700002102248773012502269856008202394852000902476655001202485IND60586827320221118182102.0200424e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058682732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00027-017-0559-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoliti, Eirini1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4005-860814aThe potential of Earth Observation in modelling nutrient loading and water quality in lakes of southern Québec, Canada  ap. 8.  aPhosphorus and nitrogen are key nutrients that affect abundance and growth of aquatic primary producers but cannot be directly remotely sensed as their dissolved or organic forms do not interact with the remote sensing signal. In addition, other lake water quality variables such as chlorophyll a and Secchi disk depth, have been previously successfully estimated with remote sensing, but the retrieval algorithms are site-, season-, and/or scene-specific. Such algorithms do not take into account lake typological features, which can affect the sensitivity of lake to change, or catchment characteristics, for example, land cover that is a major driver of lake water quality change. Here we propose a novel approach that utilises remotely sensed land cover information in the catchment to estimate phosphorus, nitrogen and chlorophyll a concentrations in lake waters. We use land cover type-specific nutrient export coefficients and the NASA MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Land Cover Type product showing that nutrient loading based on remote sensing can explain up to 75% of variability in lake nutrient concentrations and 58% of variability in lake chlorophyll a concentrations. In addition, we show that land cover information, supplemented by satellite measurements and lake morphometry data are good predictors of chlorophyll a (R² = 0.77) and Secchi disk depth (R² = 0.87) in lakes with different trophic statuses and in different months and years.  aPublisher supplied data  aNE/J024279/1cNatural Environment Research Council 3aalgorithms 3achlorophyll 3alakes 3aland cover 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amorphometry 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3apollution load 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3atrophic relationships 3aturbidity 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aQuebec1 aPrairie, Yves T.0 tAquatic sciences.g2018 Jan., v. 80, no. 1 p.8-8dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000051x1015-16217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-017-0559-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245014700178300001600325520136300341592002801704650002201732650002101754650002601775650002801801650001801829650001101847650002101858650002001879650001701899650001101916650001701927653000801944653002601952653001801978653001601996653001702012653002802029653002602057700001902083700001902102700002002121773009402141856008502235852000902320655001202329IND50060594620221120201642.0161020e20130210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006059462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2012.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Jakob Michael10aDevelopment of fed-batch strategies for the production of streptavidin by Streptomyces avidinii based on power input and oxygen supply studies  ap. 325-332.  aStreptavidin is a tetrameric protein with an extremely high affinity to biotin and different biotin-like peptide-tags. This characteristic causes its widespread use in biotechnology. Streptavidin is produced by the fermentation of wild type Streptomyces avidinii or by recombinant Streptomyces lavendulae, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis strains. However, little is known about the influence of power input and oxygen supply as well as feeding strategies on the production of streptavidin by S. avidinii. This paper provides a systematic analysis of the effect of rotary frequency of the stirrer, leading to a plateau-like streptavidin formation behaviour between 400 and 700min−1. This plateau was characterized by specific power inputs between 79 and 107WL−1 and corresponding maximal product concentrations of 6.90μM in 6 days. Lower as well as higher rotary frequencies were not beneficial. Subsequently, a linear fed-batch procedure could be established reproducibly yielding 39.20μM streptavidin in 14 days, characterized by a constant productivity of 114nMh−1. Fed-batch procedures based on dissolved oxygen were less efficient. The linear feeding strategy presented in this paper led to the highest streptavidin concentration ever reported and exceeded the maximal product level given in the literature drastically by a factor of 8.5.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aStreptomyces avidinii 3aStreptomyces lavendulae 3abiotechnology 3abiotin 3adissolved oxygen 3afeeding methods 3afermentation 3aoxygen 3astreptavidin 0aSAV 0aFed-batch cultivation 0aOxygen supply 0aPower input 0aShear stress 0aStreptavidin production 0aStreptomyces avidinii1 aRisse, Joe Max1 aJussen, Daniel1 aFlaschel, Erwin0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2013 Feb. 10, v. 163 p.325-332dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2012.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01291naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245015100156300001800307520024600325592002800571650002300599650002300622650002000645700001800665700001600683700002500699700002400724700001900748773012800767856007300895852000900968655001200977IND60657760520221120234004.0190816e20060301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065776052DNAL7 a10.1039/b513700d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran, Ngon T.10aVariation in crystallization conditions allows the isolation of trimeric as well as dimeric and monomeric forms of [(alkyl isocyanide)₄Rhᴵ]⁺  ap. 1130-1132.  aTrimeric green [(i-PrNC)₁₂Rhᴵ₃]Cl₃·4.5H₂O, monomeric [(C₆H₁₁NC)₄Rhᴵ](BPh₄) and [(i-PrNC)₄Rhᴵ](BPh₄) (both yellow), and red, dimeric [(C₆H₁₁NC)₈Rhᴵ₂]Cl₂·0.5C₆H₆·2H₂O have been crystallized.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3acrystallization1 aStork, Jay R.1 aPham, David1 aOlmstead, Marilyn M.1 aFettinger, James C.1 aBalch, Alan L.0 tChemical communications.g2006 Mar. 1, , no. 10 p.1130-1132dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b513700d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245011600157300002000273520147600293592002801769650001101797650001801808650002201826650003001848650003401878650001501912650001501927650001101942653002001953653002501973653002301998653002302021700001802044700001602062700001402078700005502092700005502147773014202202856007902344852000902423655001202432IND60753927420221122231629.0211020e20211011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075392742DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c130182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMo, Lulu10aAsymmetric Sodiophilic Host Based on a Ag-Modified Carbon Fiber Framework for Dendrite-Free Sodium Metal Anodes  ap. 48634-48642.  aSodium (Na) metal is considered a promising anode material for high-energy Na batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and abundant resources. However, uncontrollable dendrite growth during the repeated Na plating/stripping process leads to the issues of low Coulombic efficiency and short circuits, impeding the practical applications of Na metal anodes. Herein, we propose a silver-modified carbon nanofiber (CNF@Ag) host with asymmetric sodiophilic features to effectively improve the deposition behavior of Na metal. Both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiment results demonstrate that Na metal can preferentially nucleate on the sodiophilic surface with Ag nanoparticles and uniformly deposit on the whole CNF@Ag host with a “bottom-up growth” mode, thus preventing unsafe dendrite growth at the anode/separator interface. The optimized CNF@Ag framework exhibits an excellent average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% for 500 cycles during Na plating/stripping at 1 mA cm–² for 1 mAh cm–². Moreover, the CNF@Ag-Na symmetric cell displays stable cycling for 500 h with a low voltage hysteresis at 2 mA cm–². The CNF@Ag-Na//Na₃V₂(PO₄)₃ full cell also presents a high reversible specific capacity of 102.7 mAh g–¹ for over 200 cycles at 1 C. Therefore, asymmetric sodiophilic engineering presents a facile and efficient approach for developing high-performance Na batteries with high safety and stable cycling performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon fibers 3acarbon nanofibers 3adensity functional theory 3aelectric potential difference 3ahysteresis 3ananosilver 3asodium 0aelectrospinning 0aasymmetric structure 0asodiophilic silver 0asodium metal anode1 aChen, Ai-Long1 aOuyang, Yue1 aZong, Wei1 aMiao, Yue-E1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3660-029X1 aLiu, Tianxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5592-73860 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 11, v. 13, no. 41 p.48634-48642dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c130183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245012600181300001800307500001500325520080300340592002801143650001401171650001701185650001701202650001401219650002801233650007201261650004901333650002101382650003701403650003901440650003701479650003701516650001101553650001501564650009901579650003601678653001701714700001801731700001701749700001401766700001701780700001701797700001601814700001701830773010901847856008101956990002302037852000902060655001202069IND60090703820221120053939.0141102e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009070382DNAL7 a224295092pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2012.02.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Xiaoke10aSynthesis and biological evaluation of bifendate–chalcone hybrids as a new class of potential P-glycoprotein inhibitors  ap. 2540-2548.  a2019-12-06  aOverexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the major problems to successful cancer chemotherapy. To find novel effective P-gp inhibitors, a series of bifendate–chalcone hybrids were synthesized and evaluated. Among them, the most active compound 8g had little intrinsic cytotoxicity (IC₅₀>200μM), and could increase accumulation of Rhodamine 123 in K562/A02 cells more potently than bifendate and verapamil (VRP) by inhibiting P-gp efflux function. And 8g displayed potent chemo-sensitizing effect and persisted for much longer time (>24h) compared with VRP (<6h). In addition, 8g, unlike VRP, showed no stimulation on the P-gp ATPase activity, suggesting it is not a P-gp substrate. Therefore, 8g may represent a promising lead to develop MDR reversal agents for cancer chemotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3adrug therapy 3acytotoxicity 3averapamil 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aBiphenyl Compoundsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aChalconexchemistryxpharmacology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Screening Assays, Antitumor 2aHumans 2aK562 Cells 2aATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1xantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 0achemotherapy1 aRen, Zhiguang1 aTang, Xiaobo1 aPeng, Hui1 aMa, Yuanfang1 aLai, Yisheng1 aPeng, Sixun1 aZhang, Yihua0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 20, no. 8 p.2540-2548dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2012.02.0503Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245017200171300001800343520205900361592002802420650001302448650001702461650001602478650002102494650002102515650001402536650001402550650000902564650001302573650001902586650001802605650001402623650001702637650003702654650001002691700002002701700001802721700001902739700002602758700002002784700002402804700002902828773010902857856008102966990002303047852000903070655001203079IND60090703920221120053956.0141102e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009070392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2012.02.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPsimadas, Dimitrios10aSynthesis and comparative assessment of a labeled RGD peptide bearing two different ⁹⁹ᵐTc-tricarbonyl chelators for potential use as targeted radiopharmaceutical  ap. 2549-2557.  aDuring the past decade radiolabeled RGD-peptides have been extensively studied to develop site-directed targeting vectors for integrins. Integrins are heterodimeric cell-surface adhesion receptors, which are upregulated in cancer cells and neovasculature during tumor angiogenesis and recognize the RGD aminoacid sequence. In the present study, we report the synthesis and development of two derivatives of the Nε-Lys derivatized cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Lys peptide, namely of cRGDfKHis and cRGDfK-CPA (CPA: 3-l-Cysteine Propionic Acid), radiolabeled via the [⁹⁹ᵐTc(H₂O)₃(CO)₃]⁺ metal aquaion at a high yield even at low concentrations of 10–5M (>87%) for cRGDfK-10–5M (>93%) for cRGDfK-CPA. Radiolabeled peptides were characterized with regard to their stability in saline, in His/Cys solutions, as well as in plasma, serum and tissue homogenates and were found to be practically stable. Internalization and efflux assays using αvβ3-receptor-positive MDA-MB 435 breast cancer cells showed a good percentage of quick internalization (29.1±9.8% for ⁹⁹ᵐTc-HiscRGDfK and 37.0±0.7% for ⁹⁹ᵐTc-CPA-cRGDfK at 15min) and no retention of radioactivity for both derivatives. Their in vivo behavior was assessed in normal mice and pathological SCID mice bearing MDA-MB 435 ανβ3 positive breast tumors. Both presented fast blood clearance and elimination via both the urinary and hepatobiliary systems, with ⁹⁹ᵐTc-His-cRGDfK remaining for a longer time than ⁹⁹ᵐTc-CPA-cRGDfK in all organs examined. Tumor uptake 30min pi was higher for ⁹⁹ᵐTc-CPAcRGDfK (4.2±1.5% ID/g) than for ⁹⁹ᵐTc-His-cRGDfK (2.8±1.5% ID/g). Dynamic scintigraphic studies showed that the tumor could be visualized better between 15 and 45min pi for both radiolabeled compounds but low delineation occurred due to high abdominal background. It was finally noticed that the accumulated activity on the tumor site was depended on the size of the experimental tumor; the smaller the size, the higher was the radioactivity concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aangiogenesis 3ablood serum 3abreast neoplasms 3achelating agents 3achemistry 3aintegrins 3amice 3apeptides 3apropionic acid 3aradiolabeling 3areceptors 3ascintigraphy 3asevere combined immunodeficiency 3awater1 aFani, Melpomeni1 aGourni, Eleni1 aLoudos, George1 aXanthopoulos, Stavros1 aZikos, Christos1 aBouziotis, Penelope1 aVarvarigou, Alexandra D.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 20, no. 8 p.2549-2557dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2012.02.0513Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014100168300001600309520106300325592002801388650002701416650001301443650002301456650001301479650002001492650002001512650001201532650002401544700002301568700002101591773011801612856008101730852000901811655001201820IND60586827720221118182031.0171214e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058682772DNAL7 a10.1007/s00427-017-0596-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHills, Arthur J.10aMutation independently affects reproductive traits and dauer larvae development in mutation accumulation lines of Caenorhabditis elegans  ap. 411-414.  aDevelopmental decisions are important in organismal fitness. For the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which is naturally found in the ephemeral food patches formed by rotting plant material, correctly committing to dauer or non-dauer larval development is key to genotype survival. To investigate the link between reproductive traits, which will determine how populations grow, and dauer larvae formation, we have analysed these traits in mutation accumulation lines of C. elegans. We find that reproductive traits of individual worms—the total number of progeny and the timing of progeny production—are highly correlated with the population size observed in growing populations. In contrast, we find no relationship between reproduction traits and the number of dauer larvae observed in growing populations. We also do not observe a mutational bias in dauer larvae formation. These results indicate that the control of dauer larvae formation is distinct from the control of reproduction and that differences in dauer larvae formation can evolve rapidly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3agenotype 3alarval development 3amutation 3anematode larvae 3apopulation size 3aprogeny 3areproductive traits1 aGreen, James W.

They are rarely, if ever, exposed to light and experience muted temperature ranges. Despite these constant conditions, the presence of a functional circadian clock capable of entraining to external light cues has been reported for a number of species. In this study, we examine a social mole-rat species, Cryptomys hottentotus mahali, to determine if it possesses a functional circadian clock that is capable of perceiving light and ambient temperature cycles, and can integrate these cues into circadian rhythms of locomotor activity and core body temperature. Eight male and eight female, non-reproductive individuals were subjected to six cycles of varying light and temperature regimes. The majority of the individuals displayed daily rhythms of locomotor activity and body temperature that are synchronised to the external light and temperature cycles. Furthermore, endogenous rhythms of both locomotor activity and core body temperature were displayed under constant conditions. Thus, we can conclude that C. h. mahali possesses a functional circadian clock that can integrate external light and temperature cues into circadian rhythms of locomotor activity and core-body temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptomys hottentotus 3aambient temperature 3abody temperature 3acircadian clocks 3acircadian rhythm 3afemales 3alight intensity 3alocomotion 3amales 3amole rats 0aTb 0aTc 0aTn 0aLDs 0aLDn 0aDD 0aBody temperature 0aC. h. mahali 0aCircadian rhythms 0aLocomotor activity 0aMahali mole-rat1 aBennett, Nigel C.1 aHart, Daniel W.1 aOosthuizen, Maria K.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2019 Jan., v. 79 p.24-32dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245010500173300001400278520179000292592002802082650002602110650001302136650001302149650001402162650001702176650001502193650003002208650002202238650002402260650002102284650001802305650001402323650001702337650001302354650001502367650001702382650001702399650004002416650001402456653000902470653002602479653001502505653002202520653002902542653002302571700002902594700002102623700002502644700003002669700002502699700002802724773008902752856008302841852000902924655001202933IND60554675420221118014714.0161024e20141205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055467542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2014.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolaños, Verónica14aThe flavonoid (−)-epicatechin affects cytoskeleton proteins and functions in Entamoeba histolytica  ap. 74-85.  aHuman amoebiasis is an intestinal disease with a global distribution. Due to reports of parasite resistance or susceptibility reduction to metronidazole treatment, there is a renewed interest for the search of new molecules with antiamoebic activity. The flavonoid (−)-epicatechin that was isolated from the Mexican medicinal plant Geranium mexicanum HBK has an in vitro activity against E. histolytica trophozoites, however its molecular effects have been poorly documented. Using a proteomic approach based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) analysis, we evidenced that E. histolytica cytoskeleton proteins exhibit differential abundance in response to (−)-epicatechin treatment. Moreover, functional assays revealed modification on pathogenic mechanisms associated with cytoskeleton functionality, namely, adhesion, migration, phagocytosis and cytolysis. Consequently, these data suggested that (−)-epicatechin could affect virulence properties of this human pathogen.This work contributes with some advances in the action mechanisms involved in the antiamoebic effect of the flavonoid (−)-epicatechin. We found that this flavonoid has an unusual effect on trophozoites growth that is dependent of its concentration. Additionally, we reported that (−)-epicatechin affects mainly amebic cytoskeleton proteins, which results in alteration on important virulence mechanisms, like adhesion, migration, phagocytosis and cytolysis. This study provides new knowledge about a potential alternative therapy directed to the treatment of amoebiasis.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteomics, mass spectrometry and peptidomics, Cancun 2013.

During storage, samples were taken at 7, 14, 30, 90 and 180 days and the following characteristics were determined: betalain content, ability to limit chemical mutations induced by N-methyl, N'nitro, N- nitrosoguanidine in the Ames test, and the size of the population of Lactobacillus bacteria. After 7 days of refrigerated storage of fermented beet juice, betalain content was found to be 88% as against the initial content. For up to 30 days of fermented beet juice storage, betalain content remained at the same level. After 90 and 180 days of storage, the level of betalains falls drastically and amounts to 32% and 25%, respectively, as compared to the initial level. The ability to limit chemical mutations in the Ames test is 57% for Salmonella TA 98 and 58% for Salmonella TA 100 at the starting point. The antimutagenic activity of fermented beet juice is preserved at the same level for 30 days. After 90 and 180 days, antimutagenic activity decreases to 32% and 41% for Salmonella TA 98 and to 41% and 22% for Salmonella TA 100. The population of Lactobacillus bacteria sp. after fermentation is at a level of 9.11 Log₁₀ cfu/mL. After 30 days of storage, the population of bacteria falls to 8.15 Log₁₀ cfu/mL. Further storage leads to a decrease in the population of Lactobacillus sp. bacteria to 6.80 Log₁₀ cfu/mL after 180 days. Fermented beet juice preserves its high biological activity for up to 30 days in refrigerated storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmes test 3aLactobacillus brevis 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3aSalmonella 3aantimutagenic activity 3abacteria 3abeets 3abetalains 3acold storage 3afermentation 3ajuices 3amutation 3apopulation size 3astorage time 0abeetroot juice 0alactic fermentation 0abetalains 0aLactobacillus sp1 aCzyżowska, Agata0 tPolish journal of food and nutrition sciences.g2011 Oct. 21, v. 61, no. 4 p.251-256dVersitax2083-60077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10222-011-0028-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02287naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013900171300001400310520108500324592002801409650001701437650001201454650001701466650001501483650002001498650002301518653000801541653000801549653000801557653003201565653003101597653002001628653001601648653002101664700001801685773009101703856008601794852000901880655001201889IND60623689320221119202513.0190402e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062368932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Sabine14aThe role of farmers’ trust, risk and time preferences for contract choices: Experimental evidence from the Ghanaian pineapple sector  ap. 67-81.  aWe study the role of trust, risk and time preferences for farmers’ contract choices in a discrete choice experiment among Ghanaian pineapple farmers. We find that experimental measures of trust, risk and time preferences can predict preferences for contract attributes. Especially trust has economically important negative effects on the willingness to pay for high transparency in quality controls. Differences in preferences for timing of payment and timing of agreement making are partly explained by trust preferences and partly by time preferences. The importance of risk-sharing in form of lower quality grades accepted by the buyer increases with farmers’ risk-aversion, while risk preferences do not seem to be related to the timing of agreement making. Our results indicate that preferences affect farmers’ participation constraints and argue that a diversification of contract offers might increase the willingness of farmers to participate in contract farming. This has implications for companies who aim at developing stable long-term relationships with farmers.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarm tenancy 3afarmers 3alegal trusts 3apineapples 3aquality control 3awillingness to pay 0aO13 0aQ12 0aQ13 0aLab in the field experiment 0aDiscrete choice experiment 0aContract choice 0aPreferences 0aContract farming1 aWollni, Meike0 tFood policy.g2018 Dec., v. 81 p.67-81dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl9768x0306-91927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04187naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006600149245017000215300001600385520271700401592002803118650002503146650002403171650002803195650001003223650001503233650001103248650001303259650001303272650001503285650001303300650001603313650001903329650001103348650001803359650002203377653002503399653002903424653001303453653002703466700002303493700001803516773009103534856008303625852000903708655001203717IND60554675520221118014704.0161024e20141205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055467552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2014.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVera-Estrella, Rosario1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5173-333010aComparative 2D-DIGE analysis of salinity responsive microsomal proteins from leaves of salt-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana and salt-tolerant Thellungiella salsuginea  ap. 113-127.  aHalophytes have evolved unique molecular strategies to overcome high soil salinity but we still know very little about the main mechanisms that these plants use to complete their lifecycle under salinity stress. One useful approach to further our understanding in this area is to directly compare the response to salinity of two closely related species which show diverse levels of salt tolerance. Here we present a comparative proteomic study using DIGE of leaf microsomal proteins to identify salt-responsive membrane associated proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana (a glycophyte) and Thellungiella salsuginea (a halophyte). While a small number of distinct protein abundance changes were observed upon salt stress in both species, the most notable differences were observed between species and specifically, in untreated plants with a total of 36 proteins displaying significant abundance changes. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis showed that the majority of these proteins were distributed into two functional categories; transport (31%) and carbohydrate metabolism (17%). Results identify several novel salt responsive proteins in this system and support the theory that T. salsuginea shows a high degree of salt-tolerance because molecular mechanisms are primed to deal with the stress. This intrinsic ability to anticipate salinity stress distinguishes it from the glycophyte A. thaliana.There is significant interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms that plants use to tolerate salinity as soil salinization is becoming an increasing concern for agriculture with high soil Na+ levels leading to reduced yields and economic loss. Much of our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms employed by plants to combat salinity stress has come from work on salt-sensitive plants, but studies on naturally occurring highly salt-resistant plants, halophytes, and direct comparisons between closely related glycophytes and halophytes, could help to further our understanding of salinity tolerance mechanisms. In this study, employing two closely related species which differ markedly in their salt-tolerance, we carried out a quantitative proteomic approach using 2D-DIGE to identify salt-responsive proteins and compare and contrast the differences between the two plant species. Our work complements a previous study using iTRAQ technology (34) and highlights the benefits of using alternative technologies and approaches to gain a broader representation of the salt-responsive proteome in these species.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteomics, mass spectrometry and peptidomics, Cancun 2013.

The device was chiefly made up of a conjugate pad labeled with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-coated gold nanoparticles (CTAB-Au NPs) and a sensing pad modified by ratiometric probes (red-emission quantum dots@SiO₂ nanoparticles@green-emission quantum dots, rQDs@SiO₂@gQDs probe), which was assembled through a disposable syringe and reusable plastic filter. In the detection system, thiocholine (Tch), the hydrolysis product of thioacetylcholine (ATch) by acetylcholinesterase (AchE), could trigger the aggregation of CTAB-Au NPs, resulting in a significant color change from red to purple. Then, CTAB-Au NPs flowed vertically upward and bound to the rQDs@SiO₂@gQDs probe on the sensing pad, reducing the fluorescence resonance energy transfer effect between CTAB-Au NPs and gQDs. Meanwhile, rQDs embedded in SiO₂ NPs remained stable as internal reference fluorescence, achieving a color transition from red to green. Thus, based on the inhibition of AChE activity by OPs, a colorimetric and fluorescent dual-mode platform was constructed for on-site detection of OPs. Using glyphosate as a model, with the support of a color recognizer application (APP) on a smartphone, the ratio of red and green channel values could be utilized for accurate OP quantitative analysis ranging from 0 to 10 μM with a detection limit of 2.81 nM (recoveries, 90.8–122.4%; CV, 1.2–3.4%). Overall, the portable lab-in-a-syringe device based on a smartphone sensing platform integrated sample monitoring and result analysis in the field, implying great potential for on-site detection of OPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholinesterase 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3aglyphosate 3ahydrolysis 3amobile telephones 3amodels 3ananogold 3aquantitative analysis 3asyringes 0arapid detection 0acolorimetric 0aratiometric fluorescence 0adual-mode 0aorganophosphorus pesticide 0alab-in-a-syringe 0asmartphone1 aWang, Ying1 aZhu, Nuanfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4726-67091 aXiao, Jiaxuan1 aLi, Xuesong1 aXu, Ting1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7956-73221 aHu, Xialin1 aZhang, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4926-347X1 aYin, Daqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9998-00340 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 08, v. 13, no. 41 p.48643-48652dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c132733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245007900173300001600252520090300268592002801171650002301199650001901222650002801241650002401269650001701293650001701310650001501327650001201342650001201354650001301366650001501379650001101394653001301405653001401418653001201432653001601444653001501460700002101475700002101496700002401517700002301541773011501564856008101679852000901760655001201769IND60520530220221119194214.0160521e20111021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052053022DNAL7 a10.2478/v10222-011-0030-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKosińska, Agnieszka,10aSE-HPLC-DAD Analysis of Flaxseed Lignan Macromolecule and its Hydrolysates  ap. 263-271.  aA lignan macromolecule (LM) was extracted from defatted flaxseeds using an ethanol-dioxan system (1:1, v/v) and purified using Amberlite column chromatography with water and methanol as mobile phases.

Therefore, the engineering design concept of an ecosystem-based coastal reclamation has aroused great interest. However, the inconsistency of standards and the unclear understanding of ecological processes are the difficulties in this field. In this paper, we selected eco-seawall as object to determine and optimize the 4 engineering parameters (including L₁, L₂, a, and h₁). We set up 20 groups of working conditions under analyzing, and applying a computational framework to optimize eco-seawall designing processes. The computational efficiency would be enhanced by this developed method from the following aspects: (a) establishing surrogate model for eco-seawall to replace the high cost of simulation process; (b) searching engineering control parameters to optimize eco-seawall design; (c) obtaining the Petro curve set of optimal parameters for coastal reclamation management and ecological restoration. The design domain of the related parameters was determined by analyzing simulated and experimental data. As the results, the design domain were obviously reduced through optimization process: L1∈[0.1, 0.3]; L2∈[0.2, 0.8]; a∈(30,60]; h1∈[0.2,0.4]. Additionally, according to pilot-scale experiment, it can be concluded that the overtopping frequency for the low slope angle dam is 66.7%; the overtopping frequency for the high slope angle dam is 44.4%. The optimal design range for the practical engineering design can be provided by the optimal solution set of eco-seawall obtained from the optimization results. The calculation approach used in this research will provide reference for other engineering optimization work.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleaning 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3adams (hydrology) 3aecological restoration 3aengineers 3afields 3ajournals 3amethodology 3amodels 3aprocess design 3asolutions 3awills 3aworking conditions 0aEcosystem-based engineering 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aKriging model 0aFlume experiment 0aCoastal reclamation1 aCai, Yanpeng1 aSun, Tao1 aYin, Xin’An1 aTan, Qian1 aSun, Jun1 aPeng, Jianfeng0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 May 10, v. 296 p.126515-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1265153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001300166245011900179300001800298520062800316592002800944650001500972650001600987650001701003650001101020650001101031650002701042650003701069650001701106650001401123650001201137650006901149650001401218650003201232650004501264650007801309650001601387650003601403650005801439650004301497650000901540650002901549650003301578650003601611700001901647700002001666700001901686700001701705700002101722700001401743700002001757700001801777700001801795700001801813700001701831700002001848700002001868773010701888856008101995990002302076852000902099655001202108IND60090704320221121040319.0141102e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009070432DNAL7 a224948442pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2012.03.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Bit10aDesign and synthesis of 4-O-methylhonokiol analogs as inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and PGF₁ production  ap. 2860-2868.  aA series of novel 4-O-methylhonokiol analogs were synthesized in light of revealing structure–activity relationship for inhibitory effect of COX-2 enzyme.

An obstacle for a closer inspection of the five or six O-glycosylation sites is the close spacing of several sites on the same tryptic peptide. The advent of ion-trap instruments with electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) capability and – for the type of instrument – high resolution prompted us to probe this technology for the investigation of the intricate posttranslational modifications O-glycosylation and phosphorylation. Much information could be obtained by direct-infusion ETD analysis of the fully sialylated tryptic 61-residue peptide harboring 8 hydroxyl amino acids of which four were indeed found to be, if only partially, glycosylated. The middle-down approach allowed recognizing an order of action of O-GalNAc transferase(s). No such hierarchy could be observed for phosphorylation.ETD fragmentation on an ion trap thus allowed in-depth analysis of a large, multiply O-glycosylated peptide, however, only by data accumulation over several minutes by direct infusion of a prefractionated sample. O-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites re-defined and their occupancy including that of N-glycans were defined by this study.O-glycosylation of natural or recombinant proteins poses a challenge because of the lack of unambiguous consensus sites, the agglomeration of several O-glycans in close proximity and the lack of efficient O-glycosidases. Even bovine fetuin, a frequently used test glycoprotein for glycosylation analysis, has hitherto not been fully characterized in terms of site occupancy. This gap shall hereby be closed by application of electron-transfer dissociation mass spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglycosylation 3arecombinant proteins 3acattle 3amodels 3aelectron transfer 3adissociation 3aamino acids 3afetuins 3aphosphorylation 3amass spectrometry 3aglycoproteins 0aElectron-transfer dissociation 0aO-glycosylation 0aFetuin 0aGlycoprotein 0aPhosphorylation 0apost-translational modification1 aAltmann, Friedrich0 tJournal of proteomics.g2014 Aug. 28, v. 108 p.258-268dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2014.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03967naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245017500169300001600344520207900360592002802439650001802467650001602485650001202501650001802513650000902531650001202540650001802552650001102570650001002581650001402591650001002605650001502615650001102630650002802641650002002669650001502689650001302704650001602717650002002733650001102753650001002764650001802774650001402792650001502806653000702821653000802828653000802836653000902844653000702853653000702860653000802867653000802875653001802883653003202901653003102933653001202964653000902976700001302985700001502998700001303013700001503026773011803041856008903159852000903248655001203257IND60587028920221120074748.0190403e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058702892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2017.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Z.K.14aThe combination of carbohydrases and phytase to improve nutritional value and non-starch polysaccharides degradation for growing pigs fed diets with or without wheat bran  ap. 138-146.  aThe objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of supplementation of phytase and carbohydrases individually or in combination on digestibility of proximate constituents, amino acids (AA), phytic acid and non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) at different intestinal sites in growing pigs fed diets with or without wheat bran (WB). Sixteen pigs (initial body weight: 18.12±0.74kg) surgically equipped with a T-cannula in the distal ileum were randomly assigned to 8 diets, in a 2×2×2 factorial arrangement including phytase (0 vs. 1000 FTU/kg), carbohydrases (0 vs. 300mg/kg), and WB (0 vs. 20%). Pigs were arranged in a doubly replicated 8×3 incomplete Latin square design (8 diets with 3 periods) with 6 pigs per treatment. Each period lasted 7-d. Feces were collected on d 5 and ileal digesta were collected on d 6–7. Regardless of WB addition, phytase supplementation improved (P<0.05) AID and ATTD of ash, calcium, and total phosphorus, as well as AID of phytic acid, threonine, aspartic acid, and glycine. For pigs fed diets with phytase, supplementation of carbohydrases increased (P<0.05) AID of phytic acid only in WB diets, but not in WBF diets. There were interactions effects (P<0.05) between WB and carbohydrases on AID of histidine, isoleucine, lysine, threonine, aspartic acid, glycine, serine, dry matter (DM), energy, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and NSP constituents, as well as ATTD of DM and CP. They were improved (P<0.05) by supplementing carbohydrases in WB diets, whereas, no positive effects were observed in WBF diets. Furthermore, the addition of carbohydrases to WB diets improved (P<0.05) AID of NSP and its constituents, but ATTD of NSP were not affected by carbohydrases inclusion. In conclusion, carbohydrases improved digestibility of energy, proximate constituents, AA, phytic acid, and NSP in the ileum for pigs fed WB diets, but did not affect the ATTD of energy and NSP constituents. The magnitude of phytase and carbohydrases supplementation on nutrient digestibility depended on the addition of WB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspartic acid 3abody weight 3acalcium 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigesta 3adigestibility 3aenergy 3afeces 3ahistidine 3aileum 3aisoleucine 3alysine 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutritive value 3aphosphorus 3aphytases 3aphytic acid 3apolysaccharides 3aserine 3aswine 3aswine feeding 3athreonine 3awheat bran 0aAA 0aADF 0aAID 0aATTD 0aCP 0aDM 0aNDF 0aNSP 0aMulti-enzymes 0aDigestibility of amino acid 0aNon-starch polysaccharides 0aPhytase 0aPigs1 aLi, Q.Y.1 aTian, Q.Y.1 aXu, Y.T.1 aPiao, X.S.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2018 Jan., v. 235 p.138-146dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2017.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04742naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245009900160300001200259500000900271520344400280592002803724650000903752650002003761650001903781650001203800650002303812650000803835650001203843650001403855650001803869650001003887650001403897650001103911650001603922650001403938651001603952651001803968700002003986700001504006700001804021700001704039773013004056856007704186852000904263655001204272IND60677222320221121043535.0191123e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067722232DNAL7 a10.221751/rmc2017.1582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBryan, E. E.10aEvaluation of Alternative Fabrication Specifications to Increase Gross Value of Pork Carcasses  ap. 163.  aepub  aObjectivesModifying fabrication specifications in domestic processing facilities to reflect specifications in key export markets may increase demand for U.S. pork abroad. Changes in specifications may also yield value-added cuts to increase total domestic value. The objective was to evaluate differences in economic value of carcasses fabricated using either U.S cutting specifications, or specifications derived from those used in South Korea. Materials and MethodsPaired sides (30 sides total; n = 15) were weighed and fabricated into primals and subprimals according North American Meat Processors (NAMP) or Korean-style specifications. Korean carcasses were separated into shoulder (4th/5th rib separation), loin, belly, and ham (sirloin-on) primals. For Korean carcasses, the butt-tender was partially removed, and the ham was separated from the loin with a saw-cut through the last lumbar vertebrae, perpendicular to the long axis of the spine. The loin, belly, and ham of Korean carcasses were further fabricated into subprimals corresponding with NAMP specifications. Korean shoulders were fabricated into a cellar-trimmed (CT) butt, cushion, boneless picnic, and into a pork brisket (Kalbi). Individual primals and subprimals were weighed to calculate cutting yield. Fabricated carcass value was calculated using the AMS Carlot Report values from the week of 19 to 25 March, 2017. Value for the pork brisket was estimated based on relative value of the beef brisket compared to the beef shoulder clod primal resulting in a value of $112.83/cwt. Comparisons between yields and value of analagous primals and subprimals from each side and total carcass value were conducted using a Paired t test. Means were considered different at P ≤ 0.05. ResultsWhole Bone-in (BI) loin yields of Korean carcasses were 6.23 units less (P < 0.0001) than NAMP carcasses, with 5.20, 1.62, 0.50, and 0.35 unit reductions (P < 0.01) in 1/4 trim BI loin, boneless (BNLS) strap-on, BNLS strap-off, and backrib yields, respectively. However, tenderloin and sirloin yields of Korean carcasses were increased (P < 0.01) by 0.14 and 0.82 units compared to NAMP carcasses. Similarly, yields of whole belly (spareribs-in), natural fall belly (rind-on), skinned natural fall, and trimmed and squared bellies of Korean carcasses were reduced compared with NAMP carcasses by 1.43, 1.10, and 0.83 units, respectively,. There was no effect (P > 0.08) of fabrication specifications on ham subprimals with the exception of inside hams where NAMP carcasses had 0.14 units greater (P = 0.04) yield than Korean carcasses. The pork brisket cut fabricated from the shoulder of Korean carcasses represented 3.97% of carcass weight and the CT butt represented 4.82% of carcass weight. Despite reductions in the yield of loin and belly subprimals, Korean carcasses had 2.7% more added value based on subprimal values reported in the Carlot Report. ConclusionUsing Korean-style specifications reduced the yield, and therefore the value of the loin and belly, with minimal effect on the ham. However, added value from the pork brisket and CT butt adds sufficient value to the shoulder to offset lost value from the loin and belly. These data suggest that using fabrication methods based on Korean cutting specifications increases carcass value for export markets and may yield novel cuts like the pork brisket from the shoulder to increase the value of domestic pork sales.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3acarcass quality 3acarcass weight 3acutting 3aeconomic valuation 3aham 3amarkets 3ameat cuts 3apig carcasses 3asales 3ashoulders 3at-test 3avalue added 3avertebrae 3aSouth Korea 3aUnited States1 aOverholt, M.

Most of the 2D semiconductors grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods suffer from rather low carrier mobility, small single-crystal size, and instability under ambient conditions. Here, we develop an improved CVD method with controllable reverse-gas flow to realize the direct growth of quality Bi₂O₂Se 2D single crystals on a mica substrate. The applied reverse flow significantly suppresses the random nucleation and thus promotes the lateral size of 2D Bi₂O₂Se crystals up to ∼750 μm. The Bi₂O₂Se field-effect transistors display high-room-temperature electron mobility up to ∼1400 cm²·V–¹·s–¹ and a well-defined drain current saturation. The on/off ratio of the Bi₂O₂Se transistor is larger than 10⁷, and the sub-threshold swing is about 90 mV·dec–¹. The responsivity, response time, and detectivity of Bi₂O₂Se photodetectors approach up to 60 A·W–¹, 5 ms, and 2.4 × 10¹⁰ Jones at room temperature, respectively. Our results demonstrate large-size and high-quality Bi₂O₂Se grown by reverse-flow CVD as a high-performance channel material for next-generation transistors and photodetectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abismuth 3amica 3atransistors 3avapors 0aBi2O2Se 0a2D semiconductors 0achemical vapor deposition 0afield-effect transistor 0acarrier mobility 0aphotodetector1 aZhang, Qi1 aSong, Yingchao1 aFan, Yansong1 aHe, Yuwen1 aZhu, Zhihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3199-93231 aBai, Zongqi1 aLuo, Qing1 aWang, Guang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0139-16751 aPeng, Gang1 aZhu, Mengjian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7863-26601 aQin, Shiqiao1 aNovoselov, Kostya0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 11, v. 13, no. 41 p.49153-49162dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c134913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245006800184520129000252592002801542650001701570650001701587650001501604650001701619650001101636650000901647650002801656650001901684650001701703650001001720650002101730653002201751653002701773653002001800700002701820700003801847700003401885773011201919856008602031852000902117655001202126IND60729072320221119084522.0220110e20210510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072907232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1265172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Oliveira, Ualison Rébula10aRisk management applied to the reverse logistics of solid waste  aSince few articles address risk issues related to solid waste management, although it is evident that waste management is not immune to risks, the present research aims to analyze the risk management process in programming and loading of solid waste from a company in the steel sector, based on the ISO 31000. Methodologically, the research was supported by a case study, that applied documentary research, direct observation and semi-structured interviews with professionals with extensive experience. As main results, it was observed that the risk identification stage pointed out the “bad segregation or contamination of the waste” as the risk with the greatest potential impact on the operations, since in the event of its occurrence, it may compromise a relevant percentage of the company’s revenue with co-products from the sale of solid waste, in addition to environmental impacts through the release of a wide variety of polluting products, endangering human health and biodiversity. As a main conclusion, it is observed that the risk management process applied to the reverse logistics of steel residues has the ability to organize proactive actions so that risks are identified, analyzed and evaluated, minimizing their occurrence and promoting risk mitigation actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3acoproducts 3ahuman health 3aincome 3arisk 3arisk management process 3arisk reduction 3asolid wastes 3asteel 3awaste management 0aReverse logistics 0aSolid waste management 0aRisk management1 aAparecida Neto, Lilian1 aAbreu, Poliana Aparecida Ferreira1 aFernandes, Vicente Aprigliano0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 May 10, v. 296 p.126517-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1265173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03889naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245014400172300001600316520192300332592002802255650002602283650002702309650002602336650003102362650004002393650003102433650003202464650002702496650002602523650003302549650002602582650002802608650002702636650002702663650001202690650001102702650003702713650001802750650001702768650001002785650001102795650001302806650001902819650000902838650001402847650003002861650001702891650001802908650001402926651001002940700002102950700003002971700002103001700002003022700002003042773009903062856008103161852000903242655001203251IND60124364720221120031727.0160327e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012436472DNAL7 a10.1007/s13594-015-0214-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertelloni, Fabrizio10aDetection of genes encoding for enterotoxins, TSST-1, and biofilm production in coagulase-negative staphylococci from bovine bulk tank milk  ap. 341-352.  aCoagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) represent common skin commensals in humans and other mammals. They are opportunistic microorganisms and, in dairy production, are considered as minor pathogens, often associated to subclinical mastitis. It has been recently demonstrated that CNS can produce Staphylococcus aureus superantigens, as well as biofilm. In our study, 74 CNS were isolated from Tuscan (Central Italy) bovine bulk tank milk and phenotypically identified as Staphylococcus xylosus (28.4 %), Staphylococcus chromogenes (20.3 %), Staphylococcus sciuri (12.2 %), Staphylococcus hominis (9.4 %), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (6.8 %), Staphylococcus capitis (5.4 %), Staphylococcus cohnii ssp. cohnii (4.1 %), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (4.1 %), and Staphylococcus simulans (4.1 %). Moreover, one isolate (1.3 %) was detected for each of the following species: Staphylococcus caprae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus lentus, and Staphylococcus warneri. All isolates were screened by PCR for the presence of genes encoding classical enterotoxins (sea-see), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (tst), and biofilm (icaA/D). Forty isolates (54.1 %) presented at least one gene encoding for enterotoxin production, 15 (20.3 %) harbored two or more genes in association. The most frequently detected gene was sea (41.9 %), followed by sec-1 (25.7 %). None of the tested isolates presented genes encoding for enterotoxin B or D. Fifteen isolates (20.3 %) presented genes encoding for biofilm production. Among these, 11 isolates also harbored genes encoding for enterotoxin production. Our results suggest that enterotoxigenic CNS could represent a potential reservoir of pathogenicity factors, which could substantially contribute to enhance S. aureus virulence when present in milk and milk products. Further investigations are required for the evaluation of enterotoxins and biofilm production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStaphylococcus capitis 3aStaphylococcus caprae 3aStaphylococcus chromogenes 3aStaphylococcus cohnii subsp. cohnii 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aStaphylococcus haemolyticus 3aStaphylococcus hominis 3aStaphylococcus lentus 3aStaphylococcus saprophyticus 3aStaphylococcus sciuri 3aStaphylococcus simulans 3aStaphylococcus warneri 3aStaphylococcus xylosus 3abiofilm 3acattle 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3adairy science 3aenterotoxins 3agenes 3ahumans 3amastitis 3amicroorganisms 3amilk 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseptic shock 3asuperantigens 3avirulence 3aItaly1 aFratini, Filippo1 aEbani, Virginia Valentina1 aGaliero, Alessia1 aTurchi, Barbara1 aCerri, Domenico0 tDairy science & technology.g2015 May, v. 95, no. 3 p.341-352dSpringer Parisx1958-55867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13594-015-0214-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009500168300001600263520177600279536014002055592002802195596001802223650002002241650002902261650002402290650001402314650002502328650001702353650001202370650002502382650002602407650001502433653001602448653003102464653001502495653000802510653002002518700002002538700001902558700002602577773011802603856008602721852000902807655001202816IND60764145520221118231138.0220216e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076414552DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2020.17861662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNunes, R.

The present study investigated the simultaneous effect of the initial persulfate concentration ([PS]₀) and specific photon emission rate (E P,₀) on NPEO degradation by UVA/PS following a Doehlert experimental design. The results for [NPEO]₀ = (4.65 ± 0.15) mg L⁻¹ indicated more than 97.8% NPEO removal after 2 h, with pseudo first-order specific degradation rate (k ₒbₛ) of 0.0320 min⁻¹, for [PS]₀ = 7.75 mmol L⁻¹ and E P,₀ = 0.437 μmol photons L⁻¹ s⁻¹. Under these conditions, NPEO half-life time was about 22 min, and the EC₅₀-48 h (% v/v) values for Daphnia similis before and after treatment did not differ significantly. Higher values of E P,₀ would influence NPEO removal for [PS]₀ not higher than 8–10 mmol L⁻¹, although lower degradation efficiencies were obtained with higher [NPEO]₀ or real wastewater, except for longer reaction times. Additionally, UVA/PS showed to be efficient for tensoactivity removal, despite the negligible total organic carbon (TOC) removal achieved. Finally, UVC and UVA resulted in NPEO degradation higher than 96% and similar tensoactivity removals when UVA/PS was conducted under optimal conditions ([PS]₀ = 10 mmol L⁻¹; E P,₀ = 0.324 μmol photons L⁻¹ s⁻¹), suggesting that UVA radiation available in solar light could be advantageously employed for NPEO removal at concentrations usually found in wastewater.  aThis work was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq, Brazil) [grant number 140657/2018-5].  aPublisher supplied data  a140657/2018-5 3aDaphnia similis 3aenvironmental technology 3aexperimental design 3ahalf life 3anonionic surfactants 3anonylphenols 3aphotons 3atotal organic carbon 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater 0aSurfactants 0anonylphenol polyethoxylate 0apersulfate 0aUVA 0asurface tension1 aTominaga, F.

This was sustained through agro-ecological biodiversity, the production of surpluses which enabled food preservation and storage to be practiced and underpinned networks of exchange and mutual support that were particularly important during times of hardship such as disruptive extreme natural events, the use of resilient crops and using ‘famine’ foods. Colonisation, the introduction of new religions, the spread of capitalism, most recently in the context of globalisation, has seen many of these practices decline (some have disappeared altogether) as crop diversity has been reduced (making way for export products such as copra), food storage and preservation are now rarely practised, resilient crops have been replaced, famine foods have lost their importance in the face of disaster relief, and many traditional networks have declined. Food imports have become critical, not only in the growing urban areas, but also in rural communities. The paper concludes by addressing key challenges facing Pacific Island countries in order to revitalise those traditional elements of food security in ways that are likely to find acceptance in contemporary society and enable them to adapt to the effects of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisaster recovery 3arural communities 3achemical elements 3aislands 3afamine 3aglobalization 3afood storage 3aurban areas 3acapitalism 3afood preservation 3aclimate change 3aimports 3afood security 3asoil 3aatolls 3atraditional foods 3abiodiversity 3awater resources 3asurpluses 3acrops 0aelements0 tRegional environmental change.g2015 Oct., v. 15, no. 7 p.1313-1324dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-014-0697-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245008700174300001400261520178300275592002802058650002202086650002202108650001902130650001602149650001402165650001702179650001102196650001302207650001502220650001702235650001402252650001302266650001402279650000902293650001302302650001902315650001302334650001002347650001402357651001502371653003402386653001202420653000902432653002102441700006502462700002202527773009902549856008302648852000902731655001202740IND60612503420221118060324.0190411e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061250342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actao.2018.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchubert, Spencer C.10aContext-dependent post-dispersal predation of acorns in a California oak community  ap. 52-58.  aSeed dispersal and predation play important roles in plant life history by contributing to recruitment patterns in the landscape. Mast-seeding – extensive synchronized inter-annual variability in seed production – is known to influence the activity of acorn consumers at source trees, but little is known about its effect on post-dispersal predation. We conducted a planting experiment over three years to investigate the relationship between habitat-level post-dispersal predation and landscape-wide acorn production of three sympatric oak species (Quercus spp.). We measured post-dispersal predation in three oak-dominated habitats – savanna (under Q. lobata), forest edge (under Q. agrifolia), and woodland (under Q. douglasii) – as well as in chaparral and open fields. Overall, landscape-level predation was similarly high among study years, averaging 61.4%. Neither species nor mass of planted acorns affected predation. Habitat had a significant effect on post-dispersal predation risk with acorns disappearing most rapidly in chaparral and least rapidly in woodlands. However, a significant interaction between year and habitat (Z = −4.5, P < 0.001) showed that the hierarchy of predation risk among habitats was inconsistent among years. Using annual acorn census data from local populations of each oak species, we found that predation risk in oak-dominated habitats was significantly and positively related to acorn production of the overstory species (Z = −9.53, P = 0.009). Our findings add to growing evidence that seed dispersal, predation, and regeneration are context-dependent on annual variation in community-level seed production, and we discuss the potential consequences of these dynamics on oak recruitment and animal behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus agrifolia 3aQuercus douglasii 3aQuercus lobata 3acensus data 3achaparral 3aedge effects 3afruits 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3alife history 3aoverstory 3aplanting 3apredation 3arisk 3asavannas 3aseed dispersal 3asympatry 3atrees 3awoodlands 3aCalifornia 0aPost-dispersal seed predation 0aMasting 0aOaks 0aIndirect effects1 aPesendorfer, Mario B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7994-70901 aKoenig, Walter D.0 tActa oecologica.g2018 Oct., v. 92 p.52-58dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2018.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245008700174300001400261520143200275592002801707650002601735650000901761650001801770650002201788650001301810650001701823650001501840650002401855650001401879650002101893650001401914650001401928650001101942650000901953650001601962650001701978653001701995653002102012653002902033653001602062700001902078773011602097856008502213852000902298655001202307IND50087779620221118110559.0180607e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008777962DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2012.7278772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanda, Bhuban Mohan10aMicropropagation of Semecarpus anacardium L.: A medicinally important tree species  ap. 61-68.  aSemecarpus anacardium L., a deciduous forest tree, is a source of medicinal compounds. Poor seed-viability restricts the conventional propagation. Micropropagation protocol is standardized for this species. Shoot culture-derived nodal explants were cultured in woody plant media supplemented with thidiazuron (TDZ). Shoot differentiation from meristem was limited. Meristems swelled to form meristematic mass in higher concentrations of TDZ. Swelling of meristem was attributed to the proliferation of meristematic cells. Development of shoots from meristematic mass on withdrawal of TDZ in culture medium indicated the inhibitory influence of TDZ on differentiation of buds to form shoots. Harvesting the primary shoot, leads to appearance of additional shoot buds which elongated on repeated transfer of explants in a medium devoid of growth regulator every four weeks. Optimum (17) number of shoots obtained from each meristem in explants pre-cultured in TDZ 2.27 μM and re-cultured in growth regulator free medium for seven cycles (28 weeks). This confirms the stimulatory influence of TDZ on proliferation of meristem and inhibitory influence on shoot differentiation. All shoots, rooted in the medium with Indole butyric acid 2.46 μM. Plantlets survived on transfer to sand: soil (1:1) mixture and acclimatized. This is the first report on micropropagation of S. anacardium from seedling derived nodal buds using TDZ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSemecarpus anacardium 3abuds 3aculture media 3adeciduous forests 3aexplants 3aforest trees 3aharvesting 3aindole butyric acid 3ameristems 3amicropropagation 3aplantlets 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asoil 3athidiazuron 3awoody plants 0aMeristematic 0amicropropagation 0aSemecarpus anacardium L. 0athidiazuron1 aHazra, Sulekha0 tPlant biosystems.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 146, no. sup1 p.61-68dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000133x1724-55757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2012.7278773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04626naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003300134024002200167024001900189024001200208040001800220100001800238245009300256300002000349506007600369506017300445520158300618592002802201506003702229650002902266650001702295650001902312650001602331650001202347650001902359650001502378650001302393650001502406650001102421650001702432650001502449650001102464650001502475650001902490650002002509650002502529650001902554650002002573650001702593650001102610650001602621650002102637651002102658651001802679653002202697653001802719653002202737653002002759653002802779700002102807700001702828700001902845700002202864700002102886700002702907700002202934700002402956700001802980700002002998700002803018700002003046700002503066700001903091700002203110700001803132700002503150700001903175700002403194773017503218856011403393856008003507956008303587961000903670852000903679655001203688IND60178547520221214223520.0150604e20140408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017854752DNAL7 a2978852aris7 a10113/17854752hdl7 a10.1073/pnas.13200081112doi7 aPMC39861872pmcid7 a247068672pmid8 ans15112  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuanter, Luis10aGlobal and time-resolved monitoring of crop photosynthesis with chlorophyll fluorescence  ap.

It is the primary source of energy for all life on Earth; hence it is important to understand how this process responds to climate change and human impact. However, model-based estimates of gross primary production (GPP, output from photosynthesis) are highly uncertain, in particular over heavily managed agricultural areas. Recent advances in spectroscopy enable the space-based monitoring of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from terrestrial plants. Here we demonstrate that spaceborne SIF retrievals provide a direct measure of the GPP of cropland and grassland ecosystems. Such a strong link with crop photosynthesis is not evident for traditional remotely sensed vegetation indices, nor for more complex carbon cycle models. We use SIF observations to provide a global perspective on agricultural productivity. Our SIF-based crop GPP estimates are 50–75% higher than results from state-of-the-art carbon cycle models over, for example, the US Corn Belt and the Indo-Gangetic Plain, implying that current models severely underestimate the role of management. Our results indicate that SIF data can help us improve our global models for more accurate projections of agricultural productivity and climate impact on crop yields. Extension of our approach to other ecosystems, along with increased observational capabilities for SIF in the near future, holds the prospect of reducing uncertainties in the modeling of the current and future carbon cycle.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorophyll 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3acropland 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3agrasslands 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aphotosynthesis 3aplants (botany) 3aprimary productivity 3aremote sensing 3asolar radiation 3aspectroscopy 3asugars 3auncertainty 3avegetation index 3aCorn Belt region 3aUnited States 0acrop productivity 0acarbon fluxes 0aEarth observation 0acarbon modeling 0aspaceborne spectroscopy1 aZhang, Yongguang1 aJung, Martin1 aJoiner, Joanna1 aVoigt, Maximilian1 aBerry, Joseph A.1 aFrankenberg, Christian1 aHuete, Alfredo R.1 aZarco-Tejada, Pablo1 aLee, Jung-Eun1 aMoran, M.

Multivariate statistical methods such as principal component analysis and cluster analysis, coupled with correlation coefficient analysis, were used to analyze the data and to apportion the possible sources of elements in soils of a metal mining area. Soils in this area have elevated heavy metal concentrations especially Pb, Zn, Mn, Cu, As, and Tl. Using principal component (PC) analysis, six components were extracted, out of which two PCs explaining 50.12% of total variance are more important. The first principal component with a high contribution of Ag, As, Be, Cd, Co, Cu, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn was deemed to be technogenic/anthropogenic component, and the second principal component, with high loadings for the five discerning variables (Al, Be, Cr, K, Li), was considered as lithogenic component. The third component having strong loadings of Ba, Ca, K, and Na is supposed to have a mixed origin (lithogenic as well as technogenic). Electrical conductivity and total organic matter were not correlated with any element and also have a strong loading in the fifth component which is probably the biomass and ions present in these soils. The findings of the principal component analysis were also substantiated by the cluster analysis. The present study would not only enhance our knowledge regarding the soil pollution status in the study area but would also provide us information to manage the sources of these elements in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3aelectrical conductivity 3aemissions 3aheavy metals 3aions 3amining 3amultivariate analysis 3aorganic matter 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoil pollution 3asoil sampling 3asoil texture 3aspectroscopy 3avariance 2aCluster Analysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxstatistics & numerical data 2aLeadxanalysis 2aMining 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aZincxanalysis 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aBanerjee, D.

Microwave cooking affected the biological activities in different vegetables different ways. Rat intestinal α-glucosidase inhibitory activity was not affected by cooking in yellow cucumber, ridge gourd, radish root and bladder dock juice, however, it was reduced in bottle gourd. On the other hand, an increase in α-glucosidase inhibitory potential was noticed after cooking in green amaranthus. Similarly, free radical scavenging activity increased due to cooking in vegetable juice except in bladder dock and palak. Antihaemolytic activity increased in bottle gourd, radish root, palak and green amaranthus, and decreased in yellow cucumber and bladder dock juice after cooking. However, it was not affected in ridge gourd and radish leaves. Cooking augmented antiglycation properties in the juice of ridge gourd, radish root and leaves, but mitigated those properties in yellow cucumber and bladder dock. No change in antiglycation potential was noticed due to cooking in bottle gourd and green amaranthus leaf juice. Cooking increased total polyphenol content in vegetable juice, however, varied results were obtained for total flavonoid content. Substantial loss in protein content due to cooking was recorded in all vegetables. Although among the studied vegetables, the juice of ridge gourd and radish root displayed a majority of biological activities, the juice of raw yellow cucumber displayed better α-glucosidase inhibition, free radical scavenging and antihaemolytic and antiglycation activities. Therefore, raw yellow cucumber juice may become a cost-effective nutrafood helpful in mitigating disorders of glycaemic overload and oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus 3aLagenaria siceraria 3aLuffa acutangula 3aalpha-glucosidase 3abioactive properties 3abladder 3acost effectiveness 3acucumbers 3aflavonoids 3afree radical scavengers 3aleaves 3amicrowave cooking 3aoxidative stress 3aprotein content 3aradishes 3arats 3avegetable juices1 aAnusha, Sanga Venkata1 aOruganti, Swathi1 aDeshpande, Manaswini1 aZehra, Amtul1 aTiwari, A.

The objective of this paper was to document and analyse current states, trajectories of changes and their major drivers of households in a highly populated maize-based agroecosystem of Western Kenya. In 2013, we revisited 20 rural households that were surveyed, analysed and categorised 10 years ago (2003) in order to describe major changes in livelihood strategies, land use and soil fertility status. The household-level analysis was complemented with the analysis of secondary data on changes in drivers at the national level for the study period. The diachronic study showed a close association between drivers such as market and transport development, and the structure of rural households in terms of demographic shifts, land and labour exchanges, increased costs of agricultural inputs and better connectivity to markets. Between 2003 and 2013, the surveyed households experienced an increase in non-agricultural income by 30 %; intensity of land cultivation by 60 %; use of hybrid maize seeds by 35 %; and of synthetic fertilisers by almost 50 %. Local households increase their number of cross-bred livestock in detriment of local breeds and used less manure to fertilise their soils. In contrast, there were few changes in terms of food self-sufficiency (around 9 months per year) and in soil conditions (soil fertility was already poor in 2003). In terms of livelihood strategies, better-endowed households tended to diversify and acquire land that enabled them to adapt and benefit from the major changes observed in external drivers. In contrast, more vulnerable households sold labour and land to cope with such changes, remaining in a poverty trap. Households combine and explore diverse strategies to act, cope and adapt to fast-changing local and regional drivers. Policy or development programmes need to account for such diversity and dynamics to support the co-development of more adaptive and sustainable smallholder agroecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3abreeds 3acorn 3adevelopment policy 3afertilizers 3ahouseholds 3ahybrids 3aincome 3alabor 3aland use 3alivelihood 3alivestock 3amarkets 3apoverty 3aseeds 3asmall-scale farming 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3aKenya1 aGroot, Jeroen C.

This has led to increased emphasis on alternative P recovery (APR) from secondary streams like wastewater sludge (WWS). However, WWS end-use is a contentious topic, and EU member states prefer different end-use pathways (land application/incineration/valorisation in cement kilns). Previous Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) on APRs from WWS reached contrasting conclusions; while most considered WWS as waste and highlighted a net benefit relative to PR mining and beneficiation, others viewed WWS as a resource and highlighted a net burden of the treatment. We used a combined functional unit (that views WWS from a waste as well as a resource perspective) and applied it on a Flemish wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) with struvite recovery as APR technology. Firstly, a retrospective comparison was performed to measure the WWTP performance before and after struvite recovery and the analysis was complemented by uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses. The results showed struvite recovery provides marginal environmental benefits due to improved WWS dewatering and reduced polymer use. Secondly, a prospective LCA approach was performed to reflect policy changes regarding WWS end-use options in Flanders. Results indicated complete mono-incineration of WWS, ash processing to recover P and the subsequent land application appears to be less sustainable in terms of climate change, human toxicity, and terrestrial acidification relative to the status quo, i.e., co-incineration with municipal solid waste and valorisation at cement kilns. Impacts on fossil depletion, however, favour mono-incineration over the status quo.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEuropean Union 3aacidification 3acement 3aclimate change 3adewatering 3afossils 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3aland application 3alife cycle assessment 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3amunicipal solid waste 3apolymers 3araw materials 3arock phosphate 3asludge 3atoxicity 3auncertainty 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aBelgium 0aLCA 0aPhosphorus recovery 0aWastewater sludge treatment 0aProspective LCA, Global sensitivity analysis1 aBeyers, Miriam1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4908-80851 aBruun, Sander1 aMeers, Erik0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2022 July, v. 182 p.106325-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1063253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010300156300001600259520182400275592002802099650001902127650001902146650001702165650001702182650001902199650001402218650001902232700001502251700001502266700001702281700001802298700001902316700001602335700001602351700001402367700001202381700001802393700001202411773014002423856007502563852000902638655001202647IND60764338120221116201803.0220128e20220126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076433812DNAL7 a10.1039/d1tb02349g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Saisai14aThe influence of surface charge on the tumor-targeting behavior of Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles for MRI  ap. 646-655.  aNanomedicine-based tumor-targeted therapy has emerged as a promising strategy to overcome the lack of specificity of conventional chemotherapeutic agents. “Passive” targeting caused by the tumor EPR effect and “active” targeting endowed by the tumor-targeting moieties provide promising biomedical utilities and cancer therapy strategies for nanomedicine. However, as the nanoparticles are exposed to biological fluids, a large number of protein molecules will be adsorbed on their surface, known as protein corona, which may alter the targeting ability of the nanoparticles. The impact of different protein corona on the “passive” and “active” targeting behaviors is still ambiguous. Herein, three kinds of aqueous soluble Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles with different surface modifications were synthesized and applied to explore the correlation between their protein corona and passive/active tumor-targeting abilities. In the in vitro and in vivo studies, the protein corona exhibited completely different effects on the active and passive cancer-targeting capability of the particles. The particles presented active cancer-targeting ability if there was enough interaction time between the particles and cells. This was mainly due to the dynamic evolution of the protein corona, the proteins of which may be outcompeted by the cancer cell membrane and determine the targeting abilities. Unfortunately, the protein corona also inevitably accelerated RES/MPS uptake after the particles were injected into the body, which almost completely disabled the active targeting abilities of the particles. We believe that this in-depth understanding of protein corona will provide new ideas on the tumor-targeting mechanisms of nanoparticles and present a feasible approach to designing targeted drugs in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3acancer therapy 3acell membranes 3adrug therapy 3ananomedicine 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aprotein corona1 aZhang, Xin1 aXu, Yuping1 aZhu, Lichong1 aCheng, Junwei1 aQiao, Yuanyuan1 aDai, Suyang1 aZhu, Jialin1 aJiang, Ni1 aWu, Hao1 aZhang, Peisen1 aHou, Yi0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2022 Jan. 26, v. 10, no. 4 p.646-655dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1tb02349g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013400162300001600296520153100312592002801843650001901871650001701890650002301907650002401930650001701954650002001971650001801991650001002009650001502019650002602034650002202060650004402082650002002126650001602146650001902162650001002181650001502191650001302206653001002219653001502229653001102244653001402255700001502269700001702284773012202301856008302423852000902506655001202515IND60605333020221122120435.0200128e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060533302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2018.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, H.10aIsolation, characterization and quantification of a bioactive compound from Cleome viscosa L. seeds by HPTLC-Densitometric method  ap. 169-173.  aThe current study presents the first report of isolation of bioactive compound (salicylic acid) from seeds of Cleome viscosa L. confirmed by its characterization by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR and ¹³C NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy. The present work is the first report of HPTLC densitometric method, which has been developed and validated for quantification of a marker compound (salicylic acid) from ethyl acetate extract using the solvent system of ethyl acetate: acetonitrile (1.1:0.9, v/v).TLC glass plates pre-coated with silica gel F₃₆₆ (stationary phase) were used. Densitometric analysis of salicylic acid was performed in reflectance mode at 366 nm.The developed compact spot for salicylic acid at Rf 0.51. ICH guidelines were used to validate this method in terms of precision, repeatability and accuracy. Linearity range for salicylic acid was 10–50 ng/spot and the content of salicylic acid was found to be 0.9 ± 0.04 μg/g of seed. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quanitification (LOQ) values for salicylic acid were 4 ng and 8 ng, respectively. Better resolution from other present constituents present in the extract were obtained by this developed simple, precise and accurate method.The study concluded the presence of Salicylic acid as active compound present in seeds of C viscosa. The present HPTLC-densitometric method may be used for routine quality control analysis for salicylic acid quantification from Cleome viscosa L.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCleome viscosa 3aacetonitrile 3aactive ingredients 3abioactive compounds 3adensitometry 3adetection limit 3aethyl acetate 3aglass 3aguidelines 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aquality control 3areflectance 3asalicylic acid 3aseeds 3asilica gel 3asolvents 0aHPTLC 0aExtraction 0aMarker 0aBioactive1 aMishra, A.1 aMishra, A.K.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2018 July, v. 117 p.169-173dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2018.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013400167300001600301520097000317592002801287650001101315650001401326650001601340650000901356650001101365650001301376650001101389650002201400650001401422650002101436650001001457650001101467650001001478653001601488653001401504653001301518653002101531653002101552700001201573700001301585700001601598700001301614700001601627700001301643773011801656856008501774852000901859655001201868IND50087779920221118110615.0180607e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008777992DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2012.7278802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xunjing,10aRelationships between ion and chlorophyll accumulation in seeds and adaptation to saline environments in Suaeda salsa populations  ap. 142-149.  aThe importance of ion and chlorophyll accumulation was evaluated in brown seeds of a Suaeda salsa population from an intertidal zone and one from a saline inland zone during seed development. The results showed that more NO₃ ⁻ and K⁺, but less Cl⁻ and Na⁺ in leaves and stems were translocated to the embryos in the intertidal population than the inland population; more Cl⁻ and Na⁺ were compartmentalized in the pericarps of the intertidal population compared to the inland population, which indicates that the two populations have different ability to accumulate ions in different plant parts. The embryos of fresh premature seeds contained chlorophyll and the embryos could release oxygen. The content of chlorophyll markedly decreased, and there was no oxygen production in the embryos of dry mature seeds in both populations. These characteristics may affect the distributions of the two S. salsa populations in their natural saline environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuaeda 3achlorides 3achlorophyll 3aions 3aleaves 3anitrates 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3apotassium 3aseed development 3aseeds 3asodium 3astems 0aChlorophyll 0ahalophyte 0asalinity 0aseed development 0aseed germination1 aLiu, Y.1 aChen, M.1 aSong, Y.

What factors deserve the most consideration during the planning and execution phases of mining and what can be done to mitigate those abnormal conditions when they are encountered? To help answer these questions, and to determine some of the relevant factors influencing the conditions of room and pillar (R & P) retreat mining entries, four consecutive R & P retreat panels were evaluated. This evaluation was intended to reinforce the influence of topographic changes, depth of cover, multiple-seam interactions, geological conditions, and mining geometry. This paper details observations were made in four consecutive R & P retreat panels and the data were collected from an instrumentation site during retreat mining. The primary focus was on the differences observed among the four panels and within the panels themselves. The instrumentation study was initially planned to evaluate the interactions between primary and secondary support, but produced rather interesting results relating to the loading encountered under the current mining conditions. In addition to the observation and instrumentation, numerical modeling was performed to evaluate the stress conditions. Both the LaModel 3.0 and Rocscience Phase 2 programs were used to evaluate these four panels. The results of both models indicated a drastic reduction in the vertical stresses experienced in these panels due to the full extraction mining in overlying seams when compared to the full overburden load. Both models showed a higher level of stress associated with the outside entries of the panels. These results agree quite well with the observations and instrumentation studies performed at the mine. These efforts provided two overarching conclusions concerning R & P retreat mine planning and execution. The first was that there are four areas that should not be overlooked during R & P retreat mining: topographic relief, multiple-seam stress relief, stress concentrations near the gob edge, and geologic changes in the immediate roof. The second is that in order to successfully retreat an R & P panel, a three-phased approach to the design and analysis of the panel should be conducted: the planning phase, evaluation phase, and monitoring phase.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRoom and pillar 0aRetreat mining 0aDeep cover 0aSafety 0aMultiple seam1 aSears, Morgan M.1 aTulu, Ihsan B.0 tInternational Journal of Mining Science and Technology.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x2095-26867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmst.2016.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012300170300001800293500001500311520218300326592002802509650001602537650001702553650003002570650002502600650001002625650001302635650001402648650001802662650001202680650001502692650001902707650001502726650001702741650002102758653001802779700001702797773011402814856008102928852000903009655001203018IND60124365420221120023241.0150427e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012436542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-014-6160-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuchart, Vladimír10aRedistribution of acetyl groups on the non-reducing end xylopyranosyl residues and their removal by xylan deacetylases  ap. 3865-3873.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: Monoacetylated xylosyl residues of the main hardwood hemicellulose acetylglucuronoxylan undergo acetyl group migration between positions 2 and 3, and predominantly to position 4 of the non-reducing end xylopyranosyl (NRE-Xylp) residues which are amplified by saccharifying enzymes. On monoacetylated non-reducing end xylopyranosyl (NRE-Xylp) residues of xylooligosaccharides the acetyl group migrates predominantly to position 4 and hinders their hydrolysis by β-xylosidase. METHODS: Acetyl migration on the NRE-Xylp residues and their enzymatic deacetylation by various xylan deacetylases was followed by¹H-NMR spectroscopy and TLC. RESULTS: A 5-min heat treatment of 4-nitrophenyl 3-O-acetyl-β-D-xylopyranoside was sufficient to establish equilibrium between monoacetate derivatives acetylated at positions 2, 3 and 4. Rapid acetyl migration along the NRE-Xylp ring at elevated temperature was confirmed in derivatives of methyl β-1,4-xylotrioside (Xyl₃Me) monoacetylated solely on the NRE-Xylp residue, the analogues of naturally occurring acetylated xylooligosaccharides. The Xyl₃Me monoacetates were used as substrates to study regioselectivity of the NRE-Xylp residue deacetylation by various acetylxylan esterases (AcXEs) of distinct carbohydrate esterase (CE) families. CE1, CE4 and CE6 AcXEs hydrolyzed considerably faster the 2″-O-acetyl derivative than the 3″-O-acetyl derivative. In contrast, the CE16 acetyl esterase preferred to attack the ester bond at position 3 followed by position 4. CONCLUSIONS: Redistribution of acetyl group on the NRE-Xylp residues is extremely rapid at elevated temperature and includes the formation of 4-acetate. Regioselectivity of AcXEs and CE16 acetyl esterase on these monoacetates is complementary. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The formation of all isomers of acetylated xylosyl residues must be taken into account after a long-term incubation of acetylxylan and acetylated xylooligosaccharides solutions or upon their treatment at elevated temperatures. This phenomenon emphasizes requirement of both types of xylan deacetylases to enable a rapid saccharification of xylooligosaccharides by glycoside hydrolases.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3amicrobiology 3axylan 1,4-beta-xylosidase 3axylooligosaccharides 3axylan 3ahardwood 3aesterases 3abiotechnology 3aisomers 3ahydrolysis 3aheat treatment 3aglycosides 3aspectroscopy 3asaccharification 0ahemicellulose1 aBiely, Peter0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2015 May, v. 99, no. 9 p.3865-3873dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-014-6160-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245007200172300001600244520152100260592002801781650002601809650001401835650002001849650001701869650001701886650001101903650002401914650002301938650001901961650001801980650002301998650000902021650002502030650001202055650001102067653002002078653002002098653001802118653002202136653002302158653002502181700002202206700005002228700001602278700002202294773009102316856008402407852000902491655001202500IND60584743220221119212543.0171028e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058474322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2017.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrueitt, Robyn L.10aDermal exposure to toluene diisocyanate and respiratory cancer risk  ap. 181-192.  aHuman exposure to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) occurs mainly through inhalation of vapors in occupational settings where TDI is produced or used, but dermal exposure to TDI is also possible during some operations. Because of a recent epidemiology study reporting a possible association with lung cancer risk in workers with potential dermal exposure to TDI, we evaluated the evidence from epidemiological, toxicological, and toxicokinetic studies to assess whether it is likely that dermal exposure to TDI can cause human respiratory cancers. We found that the reported associations with respiratory cancers in the epidemiology studies do not support TDI as a causal factor, as there are other explanations that are more likely than causation, such as confounding by smoking and low socioeconomic status. Experimental animal and genotoxicity studies indicate that the carcinogenic potential of TDI depends on its conversion to toluene diamine (TDA), and there is no evidence of systemic availability of TDA after dermal or inhalation exposure to TDI. Also, systemic uptake of TDI is very low after dermal exposure, and any absorbed TDI is more likely to react with biomolecules on or below the skin surface than to form TDA. Even if some TDA formation occurred after dermal exposure to TDI, TDA does not induce respiratory tract tumors in experimental animals after either dermal or oral exposure. We conclude that the available evidence indicates that dermal TDI exposure does not cause respiratory cancers in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical compounds 3abreathing 3adermal exposure 3aepidemiology 3agenotoxicity 3ahumans 3ainhalation exposure 3alaboratory animals 3alung neoplasms 3aoral exposure 3arespiratory system 3arisk 3asocioeconomic status 3atoluene 3avapors 0aCarcinogenicity 0aDermal exposure 0aDiisocyanates 0aPolyurethane foam 0aRespiratory cancer 0aToluene diisocyanate1 aLynch, Heather N.1 aZu, Ke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8399-77791 aShi, Liuhua1 aGoodman, Julie E.0 tEnvironment international.g2017 Dec., v. 109 p.181-192dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2017.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010000168300001500268520111100283592002801394650001801422650001601440650001101456650001001467650001101477653001401488653001701502653001401519653001101533653002301544700001801567700002301585773014501608856008601753852000901839655001201848IND60764146020221120203748.0220125e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076414602DNAL7 a10.1080/21551197.2022.20259712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayne, David10aSensory-Enhanced, Fortified Snacks for Improved Nutritional Intake Among Nursing Home Residents  ap. 92-101.  aThe present study aimed to determine if providing sensory-enhanced, fortified snacks changed nutrient consumption among nursing home residents. Nursing home residents were provided typical facility snacks or sensory-enhanced, fortified snacks across two separate 8-week time blocks. The enhanced snack supplements included quick-dissolving (transitional-state) crisps, puree dips, and dry soup blends that are intended to be accessible for individuals with a wide range of masticatory and swallowing abilities (e.g., oral frailty). Snacks were weighed before and after sessions using a food scale. Calories, fat, carbohydrates, protein, sodium, sugar, and fiber consumed were calculated daily. Despite consuming a smaller percentage of snack weight, participants consumed increased protein and fat, and fewer carbohydrates and sugar in the enhanced snack condition, with no significant difference in caloric intake. Sensory-enhanced, fortified snacks may be viable options for increasing the quality of nutritional intake among nursing home residents, particularly in light of decreased quantity of intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy intake 3agerontology 3asodium 3asoups 3asugars 0aDysphagia 0anursing home 0anutrition 0asnacks 0atransitional foods1 aBarewal, Reva1 aShune, Samantha E.0 tJournal of nutrition in gerontology and geriatrics.g2022 Jan. 2, v. 41, no. 1 p.92-101dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11872x2155-12007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21551197.2022.20259713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011200167500002200279520113100301592002801432650001401460650001001474650001901484650001801503650002001521650002201541650001601563650001001579650001101589650001901600650001901619650001901638650001501657650002301672650002101695650001701716650002101733653003001754653002201784653001901806653001901825653003201844653001801876700002001894700001701914700001801931700001801949700001701967773009701984856008602081852000902167655001202176IND60657088720221118154026.0190815e20190810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065708872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1180132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Ji Won10aFacile synthesis of amorphous Ti-peroxo complex for photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation  aPre-press version  aIn this paper, amorphous Ti-peroxo complexes (ATPC) were successfully synthesized by a facile exothermic sol-gel method without annealing process. The TiH2 and H2O2 are used as starting precursor and oxidative polymerization agent. The color of prepared ATPC powder was changed from green to yellow with increase of H2O2 which directly induce the formation of small flakes on the ATPC, resulted in high surface area (154.1 m2/g). Raman and FT-IR spectra shows that the more peroxo groups such as Ti–OOH, Ti–O–O–Ti and -O-Ti-O- in yellow colored ATPC are formed than that of green colored ATPC. These peroxo groups not only accelerate the photocatalytic activity by abundant superoxide anion radicals, but also induce the formation of oxygen vacancies which can lead the visible-light activity. The prepared yellow colored ATPC shows remarkable visible-light induced photocatalytic activity with 95% decolorization of Rhodamine B within 30 min. Compare with previous researches related with titania based photocatalyst, the yellow colored ATPC shows excellent recycling property with maintained decolorization rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acolor 3adecolorization 3afree radicals 3aheat production 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airradiation 3alight 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apolymerization 3arhodamines 3asol-gel processing 3asuperoxide anion 3asurface area 3atitanium dioxide 0aEnergy saving application 0aSurface oxidation 0aPeroxo complex 0aOxygen vacancy 0aVisible-light photocatalyst 0aRecyclability1 aJeong, Rak Hyun1 aKim, Dong In1 aYu, Jung-Hoon1 aNam, Sang-Hun1 aBoo, Jin-Hyo0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Aug. 10, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1180133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03543naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245017800171300001400349520192000363592002802283650001702311650001802328650001502346650001402361650002702375650002402402650001302426650001302439650002502452650001302477650001302490650000802503650001502511650001102526650001702537651001202554653001702566653001502583653001502598653001102613653003202624653001602656653001602672700002502688700002002713700001902733700002002752700001702772773010902789856008202898852000902980655001202989IND60612503920221118060259.0190411e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061250392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2018.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRueda-Ayala, Victor10aImpact of nutrient supply on the expression of genetic improvements of cereals and row crops – A case study using data from a long-term fertilization experiment in Germany  ap. 34-46.  aImpacts of nutrient supply and different cultivars (genotypes) on actual yield levels have been studied before, but the long-term response of yield trends is hardly known. We present the effects of 24 different fertilizer treatments on long-term yield trends (1953–2009) of winter wheat, winter rye, sugar beet and potato, with improved cultivars changing gradually over time. Data was obtained from the crop rotation within the long-term fertilization experiment at Dikopshof, Germany. Yield trends were derived as the slope regression estimates between adjusted yield means and polynomials of the first year of cultivation of each tested cultivar, when tested for more than two years. A linear trend fitted best all data and crops. Yields in highly fertilized treatments increased linearly, exceeding 0.08 t ha−1 a−1 for both, winter wheat and winter rye, and ≥0.30 and ≥0.20 t ha−1 a−1 for sugar beet and potato fresh matter yields. Yield trends of winter cereals and sugar beet increased over time at N rates ≥40 kg ha−1 a−1, being 0.04–0.10 t ha−1 a−1 for cereals and 0.26–0.34 t ha−1 a−1 for sugar beet, although N rates >80 kg ha−1 a−1 produced a stronger effect. Nitrogen was the most influential nutrient for realisation of the genetic yield potential. Additional supply of P and K had an effect on yield trends for rye and sugar beet, when N fertilization was also sufficient; high K rates benefited potato yield trends. We highlight the importance of adequate nutrient supply for maintaining yield progress to actually achieve the crop genetic yield potentials. The explicit consideration of the interaction between crop fertilization and genetic progress on a long-term basis is critical for understanding past and projecting future yield trends. Long-term fertilization experiments provide a suitable data source for such studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acrop rotation 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3afertilizer application 3agenetic improvement 3agenotype 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apotatoes 3arowcrops 3arye 3asugar beet 3awinter 3awinter wheat 3aGermany 0aWinter wheat 0aWinter rye 0aSugar beet 0aPotato 0aFertilizer application rate 0aMixed model 0aYield trend1 aAhrends, Hella Ellen1 aSiebert, Stefan1 aGaiser, Thomas1 aHüging, Hubert1 aEwert, Frank0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2018 May, v. 96 p.34-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2018.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04073naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006700150245013500217500002200352520219200374592002802566650001602594650001502610650001302625650001502638650001402653650001902667650002402686650001702710650002302727650001402750650001802764650001402782650002402796650001402820650002502834651001002859653001302869653002902882653002102911653002102932653002002953653001002973700002702983700001803010700002503028700002103053700002203074700001803096700002203114700006703136700002103203700002203224700002003246700001803266773007003284856008403354852000903438655001203447IND60584743320221119212624.0171028s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058474332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2017.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillanueva, Cristina M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0783-125910aDrinking water disinfection by-products during pregnancy and child neuropsychological development in the INMA Spanish cohort study  aPre-press version  aDisinfection by-products (DBPs) constitute a complex mixture of prevalent chemicals in drinking water and there is evidence of neurotoxicity for some of them.We evaluated the association between estimates of DBP exposure during pregnancy and child neuropsychological outcomes at 1 and 4–5years of age.We conducted a population-based mother-child cohort study in Spain with recruitment at first trimester of gestation (INMA Project, 2003–2008). Neuropsychological development was measured at 1year of age using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and at 4–5years with the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Modeled tap water concentrations of trihalomethanes (THM) were combined with personal ingestion, showering and bathing habits to estimate exposure as ingestion uptake, all route (showering, bathing, ingestion) uptake (μg/day) and crude levels (μg/l) in the residence. Chloroform, brominated THMs (bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, bromoform) and total THMs (chloroform and brominated THMs) were analysed separately. Nine haloacetic acids levels were available in one of the areas. Linear regression was used to estimate associations in 1855 subjects adjusting for covariables.The median concentration of total THMs, chloroform, brominated THMs, total haloacetic acids, dichloroacetic acid, and trichloroacetic acid were, respectively 30.3μg/L, 9.4μg/L, 11.6μg/L, 10.5μg/L, 2.7μg/L, and 3.1μg/L. The associations between THM exposure and neuropsychological outcomes were null, except for total and brominated THM uptake though all routes and the general cognitive score at 4–5years, with a decrease in −0.54 points (95%CI −1.03, −0.05) and −0.64 (95%CI −1.16, −0.12), respectively, for doubling total and brominated THM uptake. A positive association found between dichloroacetic acid and the mental score at 1year did not persist at 4–5years.Minor associations observed between DBP exposure during gestation and child neuropsychological development at 1year disappeared at 4–5years. Although a suggestive association is identified for exposure to brominated THMs and the cognitive score at 4–5years, chance cannot be ruled out.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromination 3abyproducts 3achildren 3achloroform 3acognition 3acohort studies 3adichloroacetic acid 3adisinfection 3ainfant development 3aingestion 3aneurotoxicity 3apregnancy 3aregression analysis 3atap water 3atrichloroacetic acid 3aSpain 0aChildren 0aDisinfection by-products 0aHaloacetic acids 0aNeurodevelopment 0aTrihalomethanes 0aWater1 aGracia-Lavedan, Esther1 aJulvez, Jordi1 aSanta-Marina, Loreto1 aLertxundi, Nerea1 aIbarluzea, Jesús1 aLlop, Sabrina1 aBallester, Ferran1 aFernández-Somoano, Ana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8135-90791 aTardón, Adonina1 aVrijheid, Martine1 aGuxens, Mònica1 aSunyer, Jordi0 tEnvironment international.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0160-41207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2017.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245011300170506010400283506007600387520111800463592002801581506003701609650001601646650002501662650001501687650002001702650000901722650001101731650001401742650001701756650001801773653001801791653001701809653002501826653001901851653001401870653002701884700001701911700002201928700002101950700002701971700002601998700001802024700002602042700002402068700002102092700001802113700001902131700002302150700001802173700002102191700001902212773010902231856008802340852000902428655001202437IND60772478420221207054925.0220614e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077247842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2022.1037962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCox, Jana R.12aA global synthesis of the effectiveness of sedimentation-enhancing strategies for river deltas and estuaries  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDeltas worldwide are at risk of elevation loss and drowning due to relative sea-level rise. Management strategies to restore or enhance sedimentation on delta plains, Sedimentation-Enhancing Strategies (hereafter SES), are now being pursued in many deltas but there has been limited cross-disciplinary and cross-delta review. Here we compare 21 existing and planned SES, synthesizing their physical characteristics, funding, governance arrangements, stakeholder engagement, process of implementation, environmental impact, land use change, and potential for upscaling. Strategies exist at various scales, from ~0.05 km² - 500 km². 79% of strategies are capable of outpacing high rates of sea-level rise. Cheaper strategies are limited to short term impacts and small spatial scales, while more expensive strategies can have longer lifetimes. Most strategies create wetlands and flood water storage. Some create opportunities for agriculture, aquaculture, housing, or recreational land use. Combinations of SES will likely be the most effective and sustainable method for maintaining elevation in river deltas.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaquaculture 3aenvironmental impact 3agovernance 3aland use change 3arisk 3arivers 3asea level 3astakeholders 3awater storage 0aSedimentation 0aRiver deltas 0aDelta sustainability 0aSea-level rise 0aLand gain 0aRiver delta management1 aPaauw, Mandy1 aNienhuis, Jaap H.1 aDunn, Frances E.1 avan der Deijl, Eveline1 aEsposito, Christopher1 aGoichot, Marc1 aLeuven, Jasper R.F.W.1 aMaren, Dirk S. van,1 aMiddelkoop, Hans1 aNaffaa, Safaa1 aRahman, Munsur1 aSchwarz, Christian1 aSieben, Eline1 aTriyanti, Annisa1 aYuill, Brendan0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2022 July, v. 214 p.103796-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2022.1037963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01739naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245003400159300001600193500002000209520093400229592002801163650001901191650001701210650001101227650002301238773011701261856007401378852000901452655001201461IND60788292320221118002848.0220812e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078829232DNAL7 a10.1136/inp.k22452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, David10aCleft palate in boxer puppies  ap. 214-215.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTHIS series gives readers the opportunity to consider and contribute to discussion of some of the ethical dilemmas that can arise in veterinary practice.

In this work, we prepared efficient solid acid catalysts, namely, SnO₂, WO₃/SnO₂, MoO₃/SnO₂, and SO₄²–/SnO₂ for the production of bioadditive fuels from bioglycerol under ecofriendly conditions. The synthesized samples were meticulously analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, Barrett–Joyner–Halenda pore size distribution, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, FT-IR analysis of adsorbed pyridine, NH₃-temperature programmed desorption, and other techniques. The catalytic efficiency of these solid acids was investigated for esterification and acetalization of glycerol with acetic acid and benzaldehyde, respectively. Characterization studies revealed that the textural properties (crystallite size and BET surface area) of pristine SnO₂ were outstandingly improved after the addition of promoters to it. Remarkably, large amounts of acidic sites were found for promoted SnO₂ samples as compared to pristine SnO₂, attributed to a synergetic effect between SnO₂ and promoters. The SO₄²–/SnO₂ sample shows superior concentration of acidic sites accompanied by adequate superacidic sites. Concurrently, the promoters showed a favorable effect on the catalytic performance of pristine SnO₂ toward glycerol valorization. The observed activity order for both esterfication and acetalization of glycerol was SO₄²–/SnO₂ > MoO₃/SnO₂ > WO₃/SnO₂ > SnO₂. The high activity of the SO₄²–/SnO₂ is due to the presence of enhanced acidic sites, along with ample superacidic sites. Interestingly, the activity of SO₄²–/SnO₂ catalyst was decreased with repeated use due to the reduced concentration of acidic sites along with leaching of sulfur content, decreased BET surface area, and formation of larger crystallites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacetic acid 3aadditives 3abenzaldehyde 3abiofuels 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrystallites 3adesorption 3aengineering 3aesterification 3afossil fuels 3aglycerol 3aleaching 3aporosity 3apyridines 3asulfur 3asurface area 3asynergism 3atexture 3atin dioxide1 aSudarsanam, Putla1 aReddy, Benjaram M.0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 53, no. 49 p.18775-18785dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie501133c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03787naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245010800161300001600269500001400285520242900299592002802728650002502756650001802781650001902799650001602818650000902834650001502843650001302858650001302871650001202884650001802896650002102914650002002935653001602955653001302971653002602984700002503010700001803035700002003053700002703073700002303100773011003123856007503233852000903308655001203317IND60655498720221118161115.0190801e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065549872DNAL7 a10.1051/alr/20130492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenhaïm, David10aImpact of a plant-based diet on behavioural and physiological traits in sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax)  ap. 121-131.  aNAL-light  aReplacing aquaculture feeds based on fisheries-derived resources with plant-based diets could be a relevant strategy to improve the sustainability of aquaculture. Recent studies on sea bass have shown that the total and early replacement of marine products by plant products would have a moderate effect on fish growth and body lipid content. Whether a plant-based diet impacts behavioural and physiological traits possibly linked to fish welfare, is not known, however. Here, we studied the effect of a totally plant-based diet introduced at an early stage of sea bass development on self-feeding behaviour, learning ability in a T-maze and stress biomarkers. We first compared learning processes in self-feeding conditions, between naive fish fed a plant-based diet (PBF) and fish fed a classic marine diet (MF). Then, we tested fish individually in a T-maze to compare the two feed groups for swimming activity, exploration and the ability to learn to discriminate between two two-dimensional objects associated with a reward. Blood physiological variables, including stress indicators (cortisol and glucose concentrations), were also determined. We did not find any indications of differences in self-feeding behaviour between PBF and MF in the first 30 days. A second experiment showed similar swimming activities in both fish categories. The “no-choice” percentage was high in both fish categories (~60%), but all the fish moved preferentially toward the reward. Their first turns indicated an ability to discriminate between two two-dimensional objects to complete a simple task. However, the high percentage of “no-choice” responses in both fish categories could have rendered the results non significant. The T-maze test procedure induced the production of high concentrations of cortisol, indicating acute stress in fish of both groups during testing. Plasma cortisol concentration was higher in MF than PBF, suggesting that the plant-based diet may affect the short-term release of cortisol. This study provides the first insight into the impact of a plant-based diet on sea bass behavioural traits, and confirms the effect of this diet on cortisol release in response to stress. Overall, in this first experiment, we did not find any major impact of a plant-based diet on sea bass behavioural traits, which is an interesting point for the development potential of such a sustainable aquaculture strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aanimal growth 3aanimal welfare 3aaquaculture 3abass 3abiomarkers 3abody fat 3acortisol 3aglucose 3alipid content 3aplant-based diet 3astress response 0aSelf-feeder 0aLearning 0aExploratory behaviour1 aBégout, Marie-Laure1 aPéan, Samuel1 aManca, Michaël1 aPrunet, P.q(Patrick),1 aChatain, Béatrice0 tAquatic living resources.g2013 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.121-131dEDP ScienceswJournal:2112x1765-29527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/alr/20130493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245005600172500002200228520179900250592002802049653001602077653001102093653001302104653001302117653001202130653002202142773010002164856008302264852000902347655001202356IND60559957220221119062847.0161216s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055995722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijmst.2016.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKyslinger, Bill A.10aDevelopment of a six drillhead roof bolting machine  aPre-press version  aIn underground mining, machine design is predominantly dictated by mine conditions and individual customer desires. In partnership with Foresight Energy, J. H. Fletcher & Company was tasked to design and manufacture a new roof bolting machine with six independent drilling apparatus on board capable of drilling and bolting the roof and ribs with material handling. The objective was to produce a machine capable of drilling and installing six bolts simultaneously with a limited number of operators. The goal of the mine is to decrease the time to bolt a cut to improve the safety level of the current roof bolting method, improve efficiency and to improve the bottom line cost of entry development. The customer wanted four drills at the front of the machine dedicated to installing roof bolts and then another two drills behind them dedicated to rib bolts. This dictated the requirement of latched controls, which would allow the operator to start drilling one hole and then latch the controls to be able to move on to the next. The result of the design is a machine with a single platform and six independent masts with drillheads: four masts strictly for drilling and installing roof bolts on the front of the platform and two masts on the back of the platform for rib bolts. The controls at each operator’s station include a latch control for drilling. The six-head roof bolter allows fewer operators to drill and install roof and rib bolts, which in turn lowers the miners’ roof exposure per cut. This design reduces the operator’s exposure from the inherent pinch points and rotary hazards once he has engaged the latch drilling. Therefore, the machine will help to decrease the time to bolt a cut, improving productivity while enhancing the ability to operate the machine safely.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRoof bolter 0aMining 0aSix-head 0aFletcher 0aLatched 0aMaterial handling0 tInternational Journal of Mining Science and Technology.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x2095-26867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmst.2016.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01609naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245006200160300001600222500002000238520057200258592002800830650001600858650002300874650001300897700001900910700002100929700002000950700002100970700002400991700002601015700001801041773011701059856007401176852000901250655001201259IND60788292420221118004325.0220812e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078829242DNAL7 a10.1136/inp.k21662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHermans, Kristof10aInterpretation and visualisation of data from dairy herds  ap. 195-203.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aVets often use key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the actual performance status of a dairy herd.

Using the 400 MHz antenna on clay laden soils, the GPR system, under controlled conditions was confirmed to have the capability to evaluate the presence of buried roots positioned at various orientations and at various depths in the ground but accurate detection was limited to roots that had a diameter greater than 0.05 m. The GPR was also tested for its ability to map entire tree root systems in the field. Two surveys involving different tree species (Khaya senegalensis and Swietenia macrophylla) were used to test the capability of the GPR system to detect roots in the soil at various depths. This study further confirmed that only coarse roots (with diameters greater than 0.05 m) were detected by the GPR system. Following the survey, S. macrophylla was excavated with an air spade to remove soil from the roots for the purpose of evaluation. The findings suggest that the presence of fine roots in the soil was generally not detected by the radar. The GPR was also not able to distinguish between roots that were crossing over each other from those that were simply branching away.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKhaya senegalensis 3aSwietenia macrophylla 3abranching 3aclay 3acrossing over 3afine roots 3aground-penetrating radar 3aroot systems 3asoil 3asurveys 3atrees 0aground penetrating radar 0aroot mapping 0aexcavation 0aRADAN 0aKhaya senegalensis 0aSwietenia macrophylla1 aSim, Eng Koon0 tPlant biosystems.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 146, no. sup1 p.288-297dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000133x1724-55757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2012.7310183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011500161300002000276520103900296592002801335650002201363650001401385650001501399650002001414650001501434650001601449650001301465650001301478650001401491650001401505650001301519650003301532650001701565650001401582650001601596650002401612650003701636650000901673650001501682700001701697700002101714700002101735773013601756856007501892852000901967655001201976IND60538206520221122001007.0160815e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053820652DNAL7 a10.1021/ie50115642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Dheerendra10aZinc/Lanthanum Mixed-Oxide Catalyst for the Synthesis of Glycerol Carbonate by Transesterification of Glycerol  ap. 18786-18795.  aZnO/La₂O₃ mixed oxides are prepared by a coprecipitation method at different molar ratios and used as catalysts for the synthesis of glycerol carbonate by transesterification of glycerol with dimethyl carbonate (DMC). X-ray diffraction, N₂ adsorption, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and thermal-programmed desorption methods were used for characterization of the catalysts. The surface area and porosity of the catalysts prepared by the precipitation method proved to be better than those prepared by combustion and modified-citrate methods. Zn4La1 and Zn2La1 (mole ratio Zn:La of 4:1 and 2:1, respectively) were found to be the best proportions in view of both higher activity and higher selectivity. The rates offered by these catalysts were substantially high compared to reported Mg/La and other catalysts. The effects of parameters such as the temperature, catalyst loading, and mole ratio of DMC to glycerol were examined, and a suitable kinetic model was proposed for the Zn4La1 catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acatalysts 3acombustion 3acoprecipitation 3adesorption 3aengineering 3aglycerol 3akinetics 3alanthanum 3amagnesium 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3asynthesis 3atemperature 3atransesterification 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc 3azinc oxide1 aReddy, Bhoja1 aGanesh, Anuradda1 aMahajani, Sanjay0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 53, no. 49 p.18786-18795dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie50115643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245013400159520114800293592002801441650001801469650002001487650001601507650002001523650000901543650002201552650001301574650001601587700001801603700002001621700005901641773009601700856007701796852000901873655001201882IND60764146320221120182757.0220125e20220112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076414632DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/16199362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Wonjong10aDetermination of the Chemical Stability of Cyanocobalamin in Medical Food by a Validated Immunoaffinity Column-Linked HPLC Method  aCyanocobalamin, which plays an essential role in the body, is a synthetic form used in medical food. This present study aimed to develop an HPLC analysis method for determination cyanocobalamin and investigate the stability of cyanocobalamin in medical food. Validation of the developed method for cyanocobalamin was evaluated with linearity, LOD, LOQ, and accuracy. The linearity of this method was calculated with a value of the coefficient of determination (R²) ≥ 0.999. LOD and LOQ were 0.165 and 0.499 μg/kg, respectively. The recovery of medical food matrixes for accuracy was more than 97.63%. The validated method was applied for determining cyanocobalamin from medical foods. The developed method was used to examine the additives for cyanocobalamin protection. Ferric chloride and sorbitol alleviated cyanocobalamin degradation from heat and ascorbic acid. Especially, sorbitol showed a superior protective effect during the medical food production process. Therefore, this study suggests that sorbitol is a sweetener additive that prevents cyanocobalamin degradation by heat and the food matrix in medical food processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3aferric chloride 3afood matrix 3afood production 3aheat 3aprotective effect 3asorbitol 3avitamin B121 aLee, Yoon-Bok1 aHuh, Moon Haeng1 aChoi, Jae-Kwon,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4963-76890 tJournal of food quality.g2022 Jan. 12, v. 2022dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x1745-45577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/16199363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245011000181500002200291520155600313592002801869650001301897650002101910650001701931650001701948650002401965650002101989650001602010650001802026650001602044653002602060653002402086653002302110653002302133653002202156700001802178700001702196773009702213856008602310852000902396655001202405IND60657089020221118154022.0190815e20190811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065708902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1180182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovita, Felicia Januarlia10aDesign and control of a hybrid reactive extraction configuration for the production of tert-butyl alcohol  aPre-press version  aIn this study, the design and control of the hydration process for the production of tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) through a hybrid reactive extraction configuration was proposed. Firstly, TBA production by using a reactive distillation configuration and a hybrid reactive extraction configuration without the inert n-butene (NC4) was investigated. Due to the azeotrope between TBA and water (H2O), azeotropic distillation is required in the separation section with cyclohexane (CyH) as the entrainer. Compared to the reactive distillation configuration, the hybrid reactive extraction configuration was superior in terms of the total annual cost (TAC) and energy savings for the production of 99.9 mol% of TBA. Subsequently, the feed composition with the inert NC4 for a more realistic feeding condition was also investigated while using the hybrid reactive extraction configuration. The major differences in the two feed conditions were the compositions in the outlet of the reactive extraction section and the functions of the C1 column. Then, two control structures [a single-point temperature control (CS1) and a dual-point temperature control (CS2)] with three inventory control loops (inventory A–C) of the hybrid reactive extraction configuration with the inert NC4 were proposed. The simulation results revealed that both stoichiometric balance and liquid–liquid equilibrium (inventory C) in the RE column should be used for the dynamic operation. The CS2 with inventory C (CS2C) was found to be the optimal control strategy in this process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3acarbon disulfide 3acyclohexanes 3adistillation 3aenergy conservation 3afeed composition 3ainventories 3astoichiometry 3atemperature 0aReactive distillation 0aReactive extraction 0aTert-butyl alcohol 0aDynamic simulation 0aEnergy efficiency1 aZou, Bing-You1 aLee, Hao-Yeh0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Aug. 11, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1180183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245009800160300001600258500001400274520172300288592002802011650001902039650001202058650001602070650001202086650001502098650001102113650001402124650001302138650001502151650001202166650001102178650002302189650001502212651001102227653001202238653001702250653001602267653001502283653001602298653002002314700002102334700001502355700002502370773010502395856007502500852000902575655001202584IND60655498820221118161110.0190801s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065549882DNAL7 a10.1051/alr/20130502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrento, Sara10aMetabolic rate of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) under varying post-harvest holding conditions  ap. 241-247.  aNAL-light  aThe mussel (Mytilus edulis) is successfully grown in aquaculture in Europe. Mussels are usually sold live and wet storage is becoming more common. In this study, oxygen demand and ammonia excretion were assessed at increasing water temperatures and different post-harvest situations. This information was used to calculate minimal flow rates per unit biomass of live mussels sufficient to keep oxygen above 5 mg L⁻¹ or 50% saturation, and avoid accumulation of ammonia in commercial wet storage. In this study, rope-grown mussels were kept out of water for 8 h to simulate harvesting conditions and then re-immersed in holding tanks at 5, 10 and 15 °C. Oxygen and ammonia concentrations were measured immediately after mussels were re-immersed (0 h), after 6 h and then every day for 3 days. After this period, the mussels were again kept out of water for 48 h to simulate long-distance transport and once again re-immersed for the same period as before. In the first 6 h after re-immersion, the oxygen consumption was between 7.5 and 12.2 μmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹ (dry flesh) and after this period it decreased to a standard level of around 4.0 ± 0.9 μmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹ and was independent of temperature. There were no major differences in oxygen consumption between mussels having spent 8 and 48 h out of water at any of the subsequent water temperatures used for re-immersion. In contrast, the ammonia excretion showed greater differences according to temperature and time out of water. Ammonia excretion was lowest at 5 °C (<0.01 μmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹). The implications of these results for the industry and authorities are discussed considering the water flow rate, depuration specifications and energy costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus edulis 3aammonia 3aaquaculture 3abiomass 3adepuration 3aenergy 3aexcretion 3aindustry 3ametabolism 3amussels 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3awater flow 3aEurope 0aholding 0aair exposure 0atemperature 0aphysiology 0alive mussel 0abivalve mollusc1 aLupatsch, Ingrid1 aKeay, Alex1 aChristophersen, Gyda0 tAquatic living resources.g2013, v. 26, no. 3 p.241-247dEDP ScienceswJournal:2112x1765-29527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/alr/20130503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01831naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245007700175506002800252520078400280592002801064506003701092650001001129650001301139650001101152650001101163650002001174650001401194650001701208700002201225700002501247700002101272773009601293856008301389852000901472655001201481IND60739790320221207070243.0200716s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073979032DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202021000232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLudmila, Dyadiuchenko14aThe study of natural essential oils as growth regulators of winter wheat  aResource is Open Access  aGrowth regulators are rather important for obtaining high yields of agricultural crops.

Our study is aimed at the search for winter wheat growth regulators among essential oils. In three-year field small-plot experiments, the growth-regulating activity of anise, fenchel and apricot oils was studied. When we treated the vegetating plants with the water emulsions of the above mentioned oils (dose – 30 g/ha) twice in the tillering and the flag leaf phases, the yield increase of Grom winter wheat variety was 8.6–10.8 %.

Due to the complications, uncertainties, overestimations and double counting in ecosystem services accounting frameworks, (1) this study establishes a non-monetary “donor side” ecosystem services valuation methods constructing the emergy-based agriculture ecosystem services framework, propose the ecosystem services calculations method and classify the services into direct, indirect and existing services. (2) Further, it assess the sustainability of agriculture ecosystem nature's and human's contribution in the services through RNP % (renewability) and NRP% (non-renewability). Taking the case of agriculture ecosystem in Bahawalnagar, Pakistan, five agriculture cultivating ecosystems including wheat, rice, sugarcane, maize and cotton are selected for services and disservices valuation. (3) A total of eleven ecosystem services were evaluated in which four belongs to direct services category such as biomass increase, carbon sequestration, soil building and groundwater recharge; four are included in indirect services category (dis-services) such as human health and ecosystem quality losses due to greenhouse gases emissions, soil, water pollutions and soil erosion increase; existing services includes climate regulation, agro-tourism & recreational, cultural and educational values. (4) The results indicate that the green revolution in agriculture ecosystem encourage and increase dependency of human inputs such as synthetic fertilizers, pesticides and energy which produces higher productions but on other side it produces dis-services which is harmful for humans and other ecosystems diversity. The method proposed by this study can deliver improved theoretical and policy insights to ecosystem services accounting for agriculture ecosystem, as the agriculture ecosystem is the major source of food but along with it drive's significant environmental degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3acorn 3acotton 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agroundwater recharge 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3amineral fertilizers 3apesticides 3arice 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3asugarcane 3auncertainty 3awheat 3aPakistan 0aAgriculture ecosystems 0aDis-services 0aEmergy1 aLiu, Gengyuan1 aYang, Qing1 aWang, Xueqi1 aCasazza, Marco1 aAgostinho, Feni1 aLombardi, Ginevra Virginia1 aGiannetti, Biagio F.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Aug. 11, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1180193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008500168300001600253520136000269592002801629650001201657650002001669650001801689650001201707650001101719650001201730650001101742650000901753650002001762650001501782650001901797650000901816650001701825650002201842650001201864650001101876650001001887650001801897650001501915650000901930650001301939650001001952650001101962650001101973650002601984651001802010773010202028856008102130852000902211655001202220IND60439096620221119115735.0151024e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043909662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-006-0015-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno, Ana Rosa10aClimate change and human health in Latin America: drivers, effects, and policies  ap. 157-164.  aMany people would be increasingly affected by living under critical conditions in Latin America if, as expected, global warming aggravates disease and pest transmission processes. Heat waves and air pollution would increase heat-related diseases and illness episodes in large cities. Fire smoke has been associated with irritation of the throat, lung and eyes, and respiratory problems. Climate extreme increases associated with climate change would cause physical damage, population displacement, and adverse effects on food production, freshwater availability and quality. It would also increase the risks of infectious and vector-borne diseases. Climate change impacts the geographical range, seasonality, and the incidence rate of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria. Climate-related ecological changes may expand cholera transmission, particularly among populations in low-laying tropical coastal areas. El Niño conditions may affect the incidence of infectious diseases, such as malaria. Ocean warming would increase temperature-sensitive toxins produced by phytoplankton, which could cause more frequent contamination of seafood. A clearer understanding on the current role of climate change in disease patterns will be able to improve forecasts of potential future impacts of projected climate change and support action to reduce such impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aadverse effects 3aair pollution 3acholera 3acities 3aclimate 3acoasts 3aeyes 3afood production 3afreshwater 3aglobal warming 3aheat 3ahuman health 3aissues and policy 3amalaria 3apeople 3apests 3aphytoplankton 3apopulation 3arisk 3aseafoods 3asmoke 3athroat 3atoxins 3avector-borne diseases 3aLatin America0 tRegional environmental change.g2006 May, v. 6, no. 3 p.157-164dSpringer-Verlagx1436-37987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-006-0015-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014200159300002000301520104900321592002801370650004401398650001901442650001401461650001401475650002201489650001601511650001601527650001301543650002401556650001501580650002601595650001901621650004401640650002801684650001601712650001401728700001901742700002201761700002101783773013601804856007501940852000902015655001202024IND60538206720221120111955.0160815e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053820672DNAL7 a10.1021/ie50118382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoshi, Sunil S.10aEfficient Conversion of Cellulose to Levulinic Acid by Hydrothermal Treatment Using Zirconium Dioxide as a Recyclable Solid Acid Catalyst  ap. 18796-18805.  aConversion of cellulose into platform chemicals is essential for sustainable development of the chemical industry. With this aim, single step hydrothermal conversion of cellulose to industrially important levulinic acid using zirconium dioxide as a catalyst has been investigated. A remarkably high yield (53.9 mol %) of levulinic acid with excellent accountability and total conversion of cellulose has been achieved at 180 °C reaction temperature and reaction time of 3 h with 2 wt % of catalyst and 2 g of cellulose. The major products identified were levulinic acid (LA), formic acid (FA), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), furfural, and humins. Formation of humins during cellulose hydrolysis and dehydration was observed and is also confirmed by NMR and FTIR analysis. The effect of various reaction parameters such as temperature, time, substrate concentration, and catalyst loading on conversion and selectivity has been studied. The catalyst has been regenerated and recycled several times without any loss of activity and selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaccountability 3acatalysts 3acellulose 3achemical industry 3aengineering 3aformic acid 3afurfural 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrolysis 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3alevulinic acid 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asustainable development 3atemperature 3azirconium1 aZodge, Amit D.1 aPandare, Kiran

In this study, AFLP came out as a better polymorphic marker than RAPD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPhyllanthus 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aherbal medicines 3aherbs 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 0aAFLP 0adendrogram 0aPhyllanthus 0aRAPD 0aSCAR1 aRaychaudhuri, S S.0 tPlant biosystems.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 147, no. 1 p.12-20dTFx1724-55757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2011.6357143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009000156300002000246520094900266592002801215650001601243650001301259650001301272650001601285650001201301650000901313650002401322650001801346650001301364700001901377700001701396700001701413700001101430700001501441700002001456700001801476700002001494700002001514773013601534856007501670852000901745655001201754IND60538206820221120102527.0160815e20141210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053820682DNAL7 a10.1021/ie501248y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Mei-Hua10aRapid Preparation of Acid-Stable and High Dehydration Performance Mordenite Membranes  ap. 19168-19174.  aHighly intergrown mordenite membranes were rapidly prepared on seeded aluminum supports by microwave-assisted synthesis. Both the thicknesses of the zeolite layer and the sizes of the zeolite crystals of the mordenite membranes were highly dependent on the synthesis time. With a SiO₂:0.08Al₂O₃:0.2Na₂O:0.1NaF:35H₂O precursor synthesis gel, a compact and 0.75 μm thick mordenite crystal layer was successfully prepared on the aluminum support at 170 °C for 3 h. The as-synthesized mordenite membrane exhibited excellent water perm-selectivity and long-term stability for dehydration of alcohol/water, acetic acid/water, and acetic acid/ethanol/water/ethyl ester mixtures by pervaporation. For dehydration of 90 wt % acetic acid/water solution, the corresponding flux and separation factor (water over acetic acid) of the membrane remained at 0.44 kg·m–²·h–¹ and 2300, respectively, at 75 °C even after 59 days of immersion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aaluminum 3acrystals 3aengineering 3aethanol 3agels 3amicrowave treatment 3apervaporation 3azeolites1 aXia, Shui-Lian1 aHua, Xue-Mei1 aFeng, Zi-Jun1 aHu, Na1 aZhang, Fei1 aKumakiri, Izumi1 aLu, Zhang-Hui1 aChen, Xiang-Shu1 aKita, Hidetoshi0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Dec. 10, v. 53, no. 49 p.19168-19174dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie501248y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008700169300001400256520180600270592002802076650002102104650002602125650001502151650002302166650002102189650002502210650002402235650002002259650002902279650002002308650001602328650001002344651001702354653002102371653001302392653002002405653001602425653001502441653000902456700001302465700001602478700001502494700001502509700001602524773015402540856008302694852000902777655001202786IND60605333820221121194847.0200128e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060533382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2018.04.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu Plessis, S.P.10aAssessment and management of the invasive shrub, Cistus ladanifer, in South Africa  ap. 85-94.  aThis research provides the first detailed assessment of Cistus ladanifer, a woody, perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean, as an invasive species in South Africa. Three small naturalising populations (all less than 0.1 ha) of this species were discovered in 2012 in native heathland vegetation (“Fynbos”) of the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Prior to this discovery, C. ladanifer had not previously been recorded or recognised as an invasive species in South Africa. It poses a significant threat to the local endemic vegetation, largely due to its pre-adaptation to similar environmental conditions, and, if left unmanaged, it has the potential to invade further. However, given the small size of currently known populations and its ease of management, we propose that eradication of C. ladanifer is feasible in South Africa. Here we provide insights into options for the management of C. ladanifer, in particular its eradication from South Africa. Based on the weed risk assessment presented here, we recommend that C. ladanifer be listed as an invasive species under national legislation, thus requiring compulsory management. The results of this study provide detailed information on the extent of the invasion by C. ladanifer and the aspects of its biology pertinent to management (e.g. its reproductive ability, soil-stored seed banks). We show that complete removal of C. ladanifer populations is feasible and results in a steady decline in population size over time. Local extirpation of populations of C. ladanifer can be enhanced through fire-stimulation of the seed bank, but this may not be feasible in an urban setting. Our study emphasises the importance of scientific research in the development and evaluation of species-based management plans for invasive species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCistus ladanifer 3aenvironmental factors 3aheathlands 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3alaws and regulations 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3areproductive performance 3arisk assessment 3aurban areas 3aweeds 3aSouth Africa 0aCistus ladanifer 0aInvasive 0aRisk assessment 0aEradication 0aManagement 0aFire1 aRink, A.1 aGoodall, V.1 aKaplan, H.1 aJubase, N.1 aVan Wyk, E.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2018 July, v. 117 p.85-94dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2018.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245014600155300001600301500002000317520159900337592002801936650003401964650003001998650002902028650002602057650002502083650001302108650001802121650004302139650003202182650001602214650004802230650003702278650001302315650001402328700002102342700001702363700001602380700001702396700002602413700001502439700002202454700001602476700001902492773013202511856007302643852000902716655001202725IND60587899220221120094650.0180102e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058789922DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.134002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeiga, R.S.10aArtepillin C and phenolic compounds responsible for antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of green propolis and Baccharis dracunculifolia DC  ap. 911-920.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: This study investigates the antimicrobial activity in Staphylococcus aureus isolates (methicillin‐sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin‐resistant S. aureus (MRSA)) and antioxidant activity of green propolis, Baccharis dracunculifolia DC extracts and Artepillin C™. METHODS AND RESULTS: The amount of Artepillin C in different extracts was determined by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Minimum inhibitory concentration 90 (MIC90) was determined using 40 isolates of S. aureus inoculated in Müeller–Hinton agar culture medium containing the green propolis and B. dracunculifolia DC extracts. PVEE (green propolis ethanolic extract) and BDEH (B. dracunculifolia hexanic extract) showed the greatest antimicrobial activity with MIC90 values of 246·3 and 295·5 μg ml⁻¹ respectively. Green propolis ethanolic and hexanic extracts (PVEE and PVEH respectively) showed the greatest antioxidant activity assessed by DPPH (1,1‐diphenyl‐2‐picryl hydrazyl radical) with IC₅₀ values of 13·09 and 95·86 μg ml⁻¹ respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Green propolis ethanolic displays better antimicrobial and antioxidant activities compared to other extracts. These activities may be related to the presence of Artepillin C in synergism with the other constituents of the extracts. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In this study, the antimicrobial activity of the extracts of green propolis and B. dracunculifolia DC demonstrated in MRSA and MSSA clinical isolates indicated that they can be important tools to treat infections caused by these bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aBaccharis dracunculifolia 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantioxidant activity 3abacteria 3aculture media 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apropolis 3asynergism1 aDe Mendonça, S.1 aMendes, P.B.1 aPaulino, N.1 aMimica, M.J.1 aLagareiro Netto, A.A.1 aLira, I.S.1 aLópez, B.G.‐C.1 aNegrão, V.1 aMarcucci, M.C.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2017 Apr., v. 122, no. 4 p.911-920dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.134003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245011800189300001600307520111900323592002801442650003001470650001601500650001101516650001001527650001401537650001201551650002101563650002301584650002101607650002001628650001501648650001901663650001001682650001401692650001101706650001201717650001601729650002901745650002701774650002301801650001701824650002501841650004101866651001001907651001001917700002501927700002601952700001801978773012401996856008102120852000902201655001202210IND50074535920221122222229.0151123e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007453592DNAL7 a245228292pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-014-1227-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdhikari, Subhendu10aNutrient Budgets and Effluent Characteristics in Giant Freshwater Prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) Culture Ponds  ap. 509-513.  aIt is important to understand nutrient budgets of aquaculture practices for efficiency of input resources and to utilize all output nutrient sources. The aim of the present study was to develop a nutrient budget for giant freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) culture ponds. The study was conducted in farmer’s ponds (0.25–0.5 ha) of Odisha, India, and the results showed that feed accounted 97 % total nitrogen (N), 98.7 % total phosphorus (P) and 90 % total organic carbon (OC), respectively. The harvested prawn accounted for recovery of 37 % N, 10 % P and 15 % OC, respectively. The N, P and OC accumulated in sediment were 52 %, 76 %, and 65 %, respectively. Nutrient loads in the effluents were 2.22 ± 0.66 kg inorganic N, 0.40 ± 0.15 kg P, and 21.01 ± 6.4 kg OC per ton of prawn production. The present study implicated that high nutrient values observed in both water and sediment provide important opportunities for nutrient reuse through pond sediment applications to croplands as an organic manure, as well as pond water irrigation to crops as a “liquid fertilizer”.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrobrachium rosenbergii 3aaquaculture 3acarbon 3acrops 3aeffluents 3afarmers 3airrigation water 3aliquid fertilizers 3anitrogen content 3anutritive value 3aphosphorus 3apollution load 3aponds 3asediments 3ashrimp 2aAnimals 2aAquaculture 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aPalaemonidae 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aSahu, Bharat Chandra1 aMahapatra, Abhijit S.1 aDey, Lambodar0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2014 May, v. 92, no. 5 p.509-513dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-014-1227-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02003naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007000171300001600241520065000257536012300907592002801030596001801058650002201076650001101098650001801109650001001127651001201137651001201149651001101161651001101172653001701183653001701200653001401217653001201231653001101243653001101254653001201265653001801277700002101295700002301316773011101339856008601450852000901536655001201545IND60788292920221118004351.0220907e20220704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078829292DNAL7 a10.1080/02508060.2022.20721492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuuti, Petri S.10aBoldly boring: public banks and public water in the Nordic region  ap. 791-809.  aPublic banks in Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark have played a critical role in financing the costs of public water services in the Nordic region for over a century.

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of 4DTBP‐6,8 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a prevalent hospital pathogen. METHODS AND RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 4DTBP‐6,8, CPC and BAC against P. aeruginosa were measured. 4DTBP‐6,8 exhibited strong antibacterial activity. We assessed the bactericidal effects of QACs against P. aeruginosa under certain conditions and their cytotoxicities in human epithelial cells using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. 4DTBP‐6,8 exerted excellent bactericidal effects against high concentrations of bacteria, biofilm cells and even in the presence of contaminated proteins. Cellular LDH was not released by the treatment with 4DTBP‐6,8. CONCLUSIONS: 4DTBP‐6,8 exhibited the strongest bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa among the three QACs tested without any cytotoxicity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The potent bis‐QAC, 4DTBP‐6,8 has the potential to be an effective disinfectant in preventing hospital infections caused by P. aeruginosa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3abenzalkonium chloride 3abiofilm 3abromides 3acationic surfactants 3acetylpyridinium chloride 3acytotoxicity 3adisinfectants 3aepithelial cells 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apathogens 3aproteins 3aquaternary ammonium compounds1 aYumoto, H.1 aMurakami, A.1 aAmoh, T.1 aViducic, D.1 aHirota, K.1 aTabata, A.1 aNagamune, H.1 aKourai, H.1 aMatsuo, T.1 aMiyake, Y.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2017 Apr., v. 122, no. 4 p.893-899dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.133923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245007100165520131900236592002801555650000801583650002601591650001501617650001101632650000901643650001501652650001301667650002201680650002601702650002501728650002001753650001101773650001501784650003501799650003401834650001801868650001101886650001701897650001901914653002801933653001701961653001801978653002201996700001602018700001502034700001602049700001402065700001902079773011202098856008602210852000902296655001202305IND60729068020221119090139.0220103e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072906802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1264562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Yu10aMunicipal sewage sludge incineration and its air pollution control  aMunicipal sewage sludge is a significant by-product in the conventional treatment of municipal wastewater. Its output has greatly increased with the progress of urbanization and industrialization. The harmless disposal and resource utilization of municipal sewage sludge has become an urgent problem to be solved in the environment field. Incineration is a relatively mature technology for harmless disposal of municipal sewage sludge but faces pollutant emission and high cost problems. In this work, the latest research progress on municipal sewage sludge incineration and its pollutant control is summarized and analyzed systematically. Sludge co-combustion in municipal solid waste incinerators, coal-fired power plants and cement kilns does not require new sludge incineration equipments and flue gas treatment equipments. At the same time, co-combustion is also more environmentally friendly under certain circumstances. Staged air combustion, low oxygen dilution combustion and other methods can optimize combustion and effectively control nitrogen oxide emission during sludge combustion. Ca-based additives have significant effect on sulfur removal. Cl-containing compounds affect the volatilization of heavy metals and the formation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution control 3abyproducts 3acement 3acoal 3acombustion 3aflue gas 3aindustrialization 3amunicipal solid waste 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxygen 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3asewage sludge 3asulfur 3aurbanization 3avolatilization 0aMunicipal sewage sludge 0aIncineration 0aCo-combustion 0aPollutant control1 aXu, Donghai1 aFeng, Peng1 aHao, Botian1 aGuo, Yang1 aWang, Shuzhong0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 May 01, v. 295 p.126456-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1264563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011600170300001600286520205500302592002802357650001902385650001102404650002502415650003202440650002602472650002902498650001102527650002402538650002202562650002202584651001002606653001802616653000902634653002302643653002702666700005802693700002002751700001602771700001802787773009802805856008702903852000902990655001202999IND60623686520221119175031.0210108e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062368652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.11.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qianqian10aExamining the effects of income inequality on CO2 emissions: Evidence from non-spatial and spatial perspectives  ap. 163-171.  aOver the past three decades, China has witnessed spectacular economic growth. However, behind this economic success, the country also faces serious challenges, including pressures to reduce emissions and to address imbalances in its growth. Increasing attention is thus being paid to the task of exploring the relationship between income inequality and CO₂ emissions. The majority of previous studies have engaged with this question on the basis of conventional inequality measurements, neglecting the use of indexes that explicitly take into account spatial effects. In this paper, we employed two measures, the Gini coefficient and Global Moran’s I, in order to estimate income inequality from non-spatial and spatial perspectives, using income data for 403 prefecture-level cities. Under the framework of Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis, we investigated how the level of income distribution within 30 Chinese provinces influenced that province’s CO₂ emissions, using panel data from 1996 to 2014 to estimate both the Gini coefficient and Global Moran’s I. The empirical results show that income growth increased China’s CO₂ emissions during the study period, but that an inverted U-shaped relationship existed between income and emissions, thereby confirming the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. The continuously widening income gap, and especially the uneven spatial distribution of income, can thus be expected to deteriorate environmental quality and increase CO₂ emissions. The effect of the self-reinforcing agglomeration of income on emissions was clearly evident. Other control factors were also shown to maintain a positive relation with CO₂ emissions. Our results shed new light on the relationship between income inequality and CO₂ emissions and provide support for policy makers in tackling the dual tasks of income redistribution and emissions mitigation. A more equitable income distribution, our findings suggest, may exert positive effects in relation to the mitigation of CO₂ emissions in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acities 3aeconomic development 3aenvironmental Kuznets curve 3aenvironmental quality 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aincome 3aincome distribution 3aissues and policy 3asocial inequality 3aChina 0aCO2 emissions 0aGini 0aGlobal Moran’s I 0aPanel regression model1 aWang, Shaojian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9082-85621 aZhang, Wenzhong1 aLi, Jiaming1 aKong, Yunlong0 tApplied energy.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 236 p.163-171dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.11.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01415naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245013100159300001600290520039300306592002800699650002100727650002300748650002500771650001200796650002800808650001400836700002100850700002200871773012600893856007301019852000901092655001201101IND60657758120221121164436.0190816e20051221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065775812DNAL7 a10.1039/b513339d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimizu, Daisuke10aUnusual carbon–sulfur bond cleavage in the reaction of a new type of bulky hexathioether with a zerovalent palladium complex  ap. 177-179.  aThe reaction of a bulky hexathioether, TbtS(o-Phen)S(o-Phen)SS(o-Phen)S(o-Phen)STbt (o-Phen = o-phenylene, Tbt = 2,4,6-tris[bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl]phenyl) (1), with 3 molar amounts of Pd(PPh₃)₄ afforded trinuclear palladium complex 4 bridged by two benzenedithiolato ligands via a three-step palladium insertion reaction into one sulfur–sulfur and two carbon–sulfur bonds of 1.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3achemical reactions 3acleavage (chemistry) 3aligands 3aorganosilicon compounds 3apalladium1 aTakeda, Nobuhiro1 aTokitoh, Norihiro0 tChemical communications.g2005 Dec. 21, , no. 2 p.177-179dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b513339d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001200149245015300161300001600314520122900330592002801559650002601587650001201613650001401625650002201639650001501661650001001676650000901686650002701695650002501722700001601747700001501763700001701778700001601795700001701811700001701828773009801845856008501943852000902028655001202037IND4451710520221122044059.0141112e20110510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445171052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2011.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Wen10aDevelopment of novel chloroplast microsatellite markers for Dendrobium officinale, and cross-amplification in other Dendrobium species (Orchidaceae)  ap. 485-489.  aNine pairs of polymorphic chloroplast microsatellite primers were developed for Dendrobium officinale Kimura et Migo, an endangered herb. Levels of polymorphism were tested across a total of 55 individuals from four natural populations (12–15individuals per population). Allele numbers varied from two to four per locus, while the number of haplotypes ranged from four to six per population. Transferability of the nine polymorphic chloroplast microsatellite primers was checked on an additional set of 51 Dendrobium individuals (belonging to 17 different species). Three markers could be transferable to all the species tested, while the remaining six markers successfully cross-amplified in most species tested. Moreover, polymorphism of the nine chloroplast microsatellite primers was tested across Dendrobium moniliforme (L.) Sw. and Dendrobium loddigesii Rolfe. All of them were polymorphic in D. moniliforme, while seven of which were polymorphic in D. loddigesii. These polymorphic chloroplast microsatellite primers developed for D. officinale will be a useful tool for the study of genetic diversity, population genetic structure, evolution of D. officinale and establishment of effective conservation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendrobium officinale 3aalleles 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aherbs 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure1 aZhang, Feng1 aLu, Beibei1 aCai, Xiaoyan1 aHou, Beiwei1 aFeng, Zhenyu1 aDing, Xiaoyu0 tScientia horticulturae.g2011 May 10, v. 128, no. 4 p.485-489dElsevier B.V.x0304-42387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2011.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011500175300001600290520132800306592002801634650002201662650001401684650001101698650001101709650002301720650001701743650002001760650001301780650004301793650001701836650001301853650002001866650000901886700002601895700002701921700002401948773011901972856008502091990002302176852000902199655001202208IND60094863720221121181602.0141104e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009486372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diabres.2011.03.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValerio, Melissa A.12aA qualitative examination of patient awareness and understanding of type 2 diabetes and oral health care needs  ap. 159-165.  aAIMS: The study examined awareness and understanding of the bidirectional relationship between type 2 diabetes and oral health care in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Focus groups were held with 30 participants with type 2 diabetes. Groups were comprised of African Americans (n=16), Hispanics (n=6), and Caucasians (n=8). A grounded theory approach was used to analyse and interpret findings. RESULTS: Participants were unaware of the relationship between type 2 diabetes and oral health but were concerned about the influence of poor oral health on quality of life. Having diabetes was reported as a potential challenge for the coordination and receipt of dental care. Patient-provider communication of diabetes and oral health needs were perceived to be inadequate. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 diabetes are at-risk for poor oral health, yet have limited awareness and understanding of the specific oral health care needs and risks associated with type 2 diabetes. This lack of awareness and understanding of the relationship between diabetes and oral health may be an indicator of inadequate oral health literacy. Addressing the relationship between diabetes and oral health with patients may improve dental outcomes, increase quality of life, and promote oral health literacy in at-risk populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aHispanics 3aWhites 3aadults 3aat-risk population 3afocus groups 3ahealth services 3aliteracy 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoral hygiene 3apatients 3aquality of life 3arisk1 aKanjirath, Preetha P.1 aKlausner, Christine P.1 aPeters, Mathilde C.0 tDiabetes research and clinical practice.g2011 Aug., v. 93, no. 2 p.159-165dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0168-82277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2011.03.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04579naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245010500163300001200268500000900280520330800289592002803597650001203625650002503637650000903662650000903671650001603680650002103696650001003717650001503727650002203742650001003764650001803774650001603792650001903808650001803827651001203845700002303857700001703880700002003897773013003917856007704047852000904124655001204133IND60677219520221120113757.0191123e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067721952DNAL7 a10.221751/rmc2018.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, F.

Materials and MethodsA total of 16 beef loins (8 pairs), from Nellore intact males, were collected at a commercial plant and sent to the meat lab. Each pair was cut in 8 equal parts and used to one of each treatment combination (2 RH: 65% or 85%; 2 aging times: 21 or 42 d; unpackaged and packaged). The aging chambers were set to the desired RH and the temperature was set at 2°C. Samples were deboned and packaged samples were put in dry aging bags (Tublin 10, TUB-EX ApS, Denmark) using vacuum to seal the bags to get contact between the bag and the meat. Samples were weighed and position within the aging chamber was rotated every 3 d. Aging loss (evaporation and trimming), moisture content and surface water activity, were determined. The statistical analysis was performed using a factorial ANOVA, and means (± SEM) were tested by Tukey test at 5% significance. ResultsAt 21 d of aging it was verified the presence of a bad smell and slime on samples aged without bag at 85% of RH. These samples were analyzed, however the same treatment (unpackaged), assigned to 42 d, were discarded. At 65% of RH, a greater evaporation loss (P < 0.05) was found for samples aged without bag compared with packaged samples. At 21 d 85% RH there was no effect on evaporation loss for samples aged with or without bag (P > 0.05). Evaporation loss of packaged samples at 42 d/85% RH was 19.2 ± 0.4%. At 21 d, evaporation loss of samples at 85% RH was lower (P < 0.05) than at 65% RH, in both packaged and unpackaged. There was an interaction (P < 0.05) between aging type and relative humidity for trimming loss (crust removal). Trimming was not affected (P > 0.05) by type or time of aging of samples aged at 65% RH. On the other hand, at 21 d/85% RH, non-packaged samples had higher (P < 0.05) trimming than samples in a bag, mainly due to the presence of slime that was removed. The moisture content was lower (P < 0.05) on samples aged in a bag for 42 d at 65% RH than at 85% RH and on samples aged without bag for 21 d at 65% RH than 85% RH. The increase in aging time decreased (P < 0.05) moisture content of samples aged at 65% RH with or without bag, with no effect (P > 0.05) on packaged samples aged at 85% RH. A lower surface water activity was verified for samples aged at 65% RH, independent of time or type of aging, when compared with samples aged at 85% RH (P < 0.05). At 65% RH, non-packaged samples had lower (P < 0.05) water activity than packaged samples, at 21 and 42 d. At 21 d/85% RH, water activity was not affected by the type of aging (P > 0.05). The increase of aging time decreased water activity of samples aged at 65% RH without bag, as well as for samples aged at 85% RH with bag (P < 0.05), with no effect (P > 0.05) on packaged samples aged at 65% RH. ConclusionThe higher relative humidity used in this experiment (85%) was unable to produce a viable dry aged beef, mainly without the use of a permeable bag.

Factorial design and response surface methodology (RSM) were used to evaluate and optimize the effects of pH, ozone flow rate, and contact time on the treatment process. A Box–Behnken design was successfully applied for modeling and optimizing the removal of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs). The results showed that ozonation is an efficient technique for removing diesel from aqueous solution. The determination coefficient (R2) was found to be 0.9437, indicating that the proposed model was capable of predicting the removal of TPHs by ozonation. The optimum values of experimental initial pH, degree of O3, and reaction time were 7.0, 1.5, and 35min, respectively, which could contribute to approximately 60% of TPH removal. This result is in good agreement with the predicted value of 57.28%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3ahydrocarbons 3amodels 3aozonation 3aozone 3apH 3apetroleum 3aprediction 3aresponse surface methodology 3awater pollution 0aOzone 0aDiesel 0aTPH 0aWater treatment 0aRSM1 aKhezri, Seyed-Mostafa1 aKalantary, Roshanak Rezaei0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 104, no. 1-2 p.240-245dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245010500160300002000265520140100285592002801686650002401714650002201738650001301760650001301773650001601786653000901802653002201811653001501833653001701848653001401865700001501879700005501894700001601949700001801965700001401983700001801997700001402015700001802029700001402047700005702061700001902118700005102137773014202188856007902330852000902409655001202418IND60753925220221123010027.0211020e20211007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075392522DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c114932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Wanlei10aAbove 15% Efficient Directly Sputtered CIGS Solar Cells Enabled by a Modified Back-Contact Interface  ap. 49414-49422.  aThe Schottky back-contact barrier at the Mo/Cu(In,Ga)Se₂ (CIGS) interface is one of the critical issues that restrict the photovoltaic performance of CIGS solar cells. The formation of a MoSe₂ intermediate layer can effectively reduce this back-contact barrier leading to efficient hole transport. However, the selenium-free atmosphere is unfavorable for the formation of the desired MoSe₂ intermediate layer if the CIGS films are prepared by the commonly used direct sputtering process. In this work, high-efficiency CIGS solar cells with a MoSe₂ intermediate layer were fabricated by the direct sputtering process without a selenium atmosphere. This is enabled by an intermediate CIGS layer deposited on the Mo substrate at room temperature before being ramped to a high temperature (600 °C). The room-temperature-deposited amorphous CIGS intermediate layer is Se rich, which reacts with the Mo substrate and forms very thin MoSe₂ at the interface during the high-temperature process. The formed MoSe₂ decreased the CIGS/Mo barrier height for better hole transport. Consequently, the CIGS solar cell with an 80 nm intermediate layer achieved a power conversion efficiency of up to 15.8%, which is a benchmark efficiency for the direct sputtering process without Se supply. This work provides the industry a new approach for commercialization of directly sputtered CIGS solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acommercialization 3aindustry 3aselenium 3asolar cells 0aCIGS 0aquaternary target 0asputtering 0aback contact 0athin film1 aGao, Zeran1 aLi, Jianjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2872-96481 aQin, Shumin1 aWang, Ruobing1 aXu, Haoyu1 aWang, Xinzhan1 aGao, Chao1 aTeng, Xiaoyun1 aZhang, Yu1 aHao, Xiaojing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5903-44811 aWang, Yinglong1 aYu, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8913-59850 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 07, v. 13, no. 41 p.49414-49422dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c114933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001700167245018100184300001600365520141200381592002801793650001901821650001501840650001901855650001901874650001101893650001301904650001501917650001801932650001701950650001901967650003001986650005402016650001202070650003602082650003202118650003002150650002002180650001102200650003102211650001102242650000902253650006302262700001502325700001602340700001502356700002102371700001802392700001902410773012002429856008402549852000902633655001202642IND4470159720221119084709.0141111e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447015972DNAL7 a218395212pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPascucci, L.10aFlow cytometric characterization of culture expanded multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from horse adipose tissue: Towards the definition of minimal stemness criteria  ap. 499-506.  aIn the last decades, multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells have been isolated from many adult tissues of different species. The International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) has recently established that multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is the currently recommended designation. In this study, we used flow cytometry to evaluate the expression of several molecules related to stemness (CD90, CD44, CD73 and STRO-1) in undifferentiated, early-passaged MSCs isolated from adipose tissue of four donor horses (AdMSCs). The four populations unanimously expressed high levels of CD90 and CD44. On the contrary, they were unexpectedly negative to CD73. A small percentage of the cells, finally, showed the expression of STRO-1. This last result might be due to the existence of a small subpopulation of STRO-1+ cells or to a poor cross-reactivity of the antibody. A remarkable donor-to-donor consistency and reproducibility of these findings was demonstrated. The data presented herein support the idea that equine AdMSCs may be easily isolated and selected by adherence to tissue culture plastic and exhibit a surface profile characterized by some peculiar differences in comparison to those described in other species. Continued characterization of these cells will help to clarify several aspects of their biology and may ultimately enable the isolation of specific, purified subpopulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aantibodies 3across reaction 3aflow cytometry 3ahorses 3aplastics 3astem cells 3astromal cells 3atherapeutics 3atissue culture 2a5'-Nucleotidasexanalysis 2aAdipose Tissuexcytologyximmunologyxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aHyaluronan Receptorsxanalysis. 2aAntigens, Surfacexanalysis 2aThy-1 Antigensxanalysis. 2aCells, Cultured 2aFemale 2aFlow Cytometryxveterinary 2aHorses 2aMale 2aMultipotent Stem Cellsxchemistryximmunologyxphysiology.1 aCurina, G.1 aMercati, F.1 aMarini, C.1 aDall’Aglio, C.1 aPaternesi, B.1 aCeccarelli, P.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 144, no. 3-4 p.499-506dElsevier B.V.x0165-24277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013700169300001600306520148200322592002801804650001201832650001201844650002001856650002701876650001201903650001401915650001101929650001401940650001101954653003701965653001202002653002302014653002002037653002402057700001702081700001302098700002002111700001902131700002002150773011202170856008502282852000902367655001202376IND60587026220221122035755.0200913e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058702622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.11.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Qing-Bai10aDevelopment of recovering lithium from brines by selective-electrodialysis: Effect of coexisting cations on the migration of lithium  ap. 408-420.  aThe process for separating and purifying lithium in brines based on electrodialysis with monovalent selective ion exchange membranes was investigated in our previous work. The migration of coexisting cations in brines was competitive with lithium ions, especially monovalent cations (Na⁺ and K⁺). The aim of this study was to examine the influence of major coexisting cations in brines on lithium recovery in the selective-electrodialysis (S-ED) process. Considering the factors of coexisting cations, such as concentration and type, some migration laws of lithium ion were found as follows: the concentration of coexisting cations had negative effect on the migration of lithium ion; the influence order of coexisting cations on lithium migration was contrary to their hydrated radius sequence: K⁺>Na⁺>Ca²⁺>Mg²⁺. In order to characterize the migration process of cations through monovalent selective cation exchange membrane in microcosmic theory, a partial dehydration conceptual model based on charge capillary column theory and ionic potential was proposed. And the model was used to characterize the ions migration process. Simultaneously, considering the hydration potential which indicates how strongly an ion would attract water molecules, the influence sequence of coexisting cations was explained legitimately. These observations might provide some theoretical basis and technological support for the relevant research of recovering lithium from brines.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acations 3aelectrodialysis 3aion-exchange membranes 3alithium 3amagnesium 3amodels 3apotassium 3asodium 0aSelective-electrodialysis (S-ED) 0aLithium 0aCoexisting cations 0aIonic potential 0aPartial dehydration1 aJi, Zhi-Yong1 aLiu, Jie1 aZhao, Ying-Ying1 aWang, Shi-Zhao1 aYuan, Jun-Sheng0 tJournal of membrane science.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 548 p.408-420dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.11.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245015000179520087300329592002801202650001901230650001101249650001201260650002501272650002001297651001301317653002701330653001201357653002401369653002501393653001901418700002601437700003001463700002901493700003001522700002101552773011201573856008601685852000901771655001201780IND60729068520221119090357.0220110e20210510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072906852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1264622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz-Vargas, Carlos A.10aAlternatives for cocaine disposal: An experimental, techno-economic, and environmental comparison between incineration and biological degradation  aWorldwide trends in the area under coca crops cultivation have been primarily motivated by illegal advances in Colombia around cocaine production. Thus, alternative ways for the final disposal of cocaine are needed and the evaluation of their possible economic and environmental advantages. This work aimed to compare incineration and biological degradation of cocaine by considering techno-economic and environmental aspects. There was a cocaine removal efficiency of 99.7% when bacterial C1T consortium was grown using cocaine as the sole carbon source. The biological degradation process exhibited a specific energy consumption and total potential environmental impact, 5 and 10 fold lower than the incineration process, respectively. The biological degradation process can also reach similar disposition unit prices as the incineration process (i.e., 1.00 USD/kg).  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3acocaine 3aenvironmental impact 3aspecific energy 3aColombia 0aBiological degradation 0aCocaine 0aEconomic assessment 0aEnvironmental impact 0aFinal disposal1 aSolarte-Toro, Juan C.1 aVeloza, Liz Wendy Cuadros1 aAlzate, Carlos A.Cardona1 aRestrepo-Parra, Elisabeth1 aHiguita, Juan C.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 May 10, v. 296 p.126462-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1264623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01014naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245010300159300001800262520010400280592002800384650002300412650002300435650002300458700002200481700002300503773012800526856007300654852000900727655001200736IND60657758520221121133233.0190816e20051206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065775852DNAL7 a10.1039/b513408k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaas, Clemens H.10aBinding properties of cavitands in aqueous solution—the influence of charge on guest selectivity  ap. 6044-6045.  aThe charge of the upper rim has influences on the binding properties of cavitands in aqueous media.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding properties 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions1 aBiros, Shannon M.1 aRebek, Jr., Julius0 tChemical communications.g2005 Dec. 6, , no. 48 p.6044-6045dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b513408k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01453naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245017200163300001600335520020500351592002800556596007600584596005900660650001300719650002000732650002300752650001600775650001600791651001000807700002000817700002000837700001700857700001400874773011200888856008201000852000901082655001201091IND60593581220221118210200.0190210e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059358122DNAL7 a10.1007/s12600-018-0646-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZu, Guo-Hao12aA new species of Anagyrus (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) from China, parasitoid of Phenacoccus solani Ferris (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) on Lycoris radiata (L’Her.)

There is increasing evidence that the quantity of these proteins per lipoprotein particle determines lipoprotein function including redox, inflammatory and thrombotic properties and may impact on lipoprotein-related risks for developing heart disease. However, only limited information on the relative quantity of these proteins has been published and no comprehensive absolute quantitative data providing the stoichiometry of proteins associated with lipoproteins is available to date. To address this, we performed extensive absolute quantification by mass spectrometry of 17 lipoprotein-associated proteins on VLDL, LDL, Lp(a) and HDL from healthy subjects. For the first time we show the exact stoichiometry of apolipoproteins on different lipoprotein classes. The most distinct differences were seen in the abundance of all apoCs, apoE and apoF. We further revealed strong variations between individual samples, which indicates the complexity of the protein complement of lipoproteins and can provide additional insights into lipoprotein-related risk factors. This approach has the potential to determine alterations in the protein profiles of lipoproteins in disease states such as CVD or diabetes and, if performed on large cohorts, to translate into a tool for identifying new candidate biomarkers for risk of disease.A more comprehensive picture about the protein complement on individual lipoprotein classes is the goal of lipoprotein proteomics analyses. Despite many such studies, there is a lack of absolute quantitative data on lipoproteins isolated from individual subjects. The stoichiometry of lipoprotein-associated proteins rather than their presence or absence could provide insights into an individual's predisposition for disease such as heart disease or diabetes. Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the absolute quantity of proteins on the major apolipoprotein classes VLDL, LDL, Lp(a) and HDL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapolipoproteins 3abiomarkers 3adiabetes 3aheart diseases 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahumans 3alow density lipoprotein 3amass spectrometry 3aproteomics 3arisk factors 3astoichiometry 3avery low density lipoprotein 0aAbsolute protein quantification 0aLipoproteins 0aCardiovascular disease 0aStoichiometry of apolipoproteins1 aWilliams, Michael1 aMcCormick, Sally1 aKleffmann, Torsten0 tJournal of proteomics.g2014 June 25, v. 106 p.181-190dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2014.04.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010500164300001600269520126500285592002801550650002501578650001401603650002401617650001901641650001101660650001701671650001601688653000801704653003201712653001601744653001101760653002401771700002601795700001401821700002401835700001901859700002701878700002101905700002001926700002501946700001901971773011201990856008502102852000902187655001202196IND60587026420221122035738.0200913e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058702642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.11.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Wen10aAsymmetric tubular CaTi0.6Fe0.15Mn0.25O3-δ membranes: Membrane architecture and long-term stability  ap. 372-379.  aThree architectures of asymmetric tubular oxygen transport membranes (OTM) based on CaTi₀.₆Fe₀.₁₅Mn₀.₂₅O₃₋δ were fabricated with various thicknesses of the tubular porous supports and the dense membrane layers. This was achieved by a two-step firing method combining water based extrusion and dip-coating. The oxygen flux of the tubular membranes was characterized as a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure on both feed and sweep sides for the different architectures. The flux exhibits different functional dependencies with respect to the oxygen partial pressure gradient and the membrane architecture. Numerical simulations using a Dusty-gas model were conducted to evaluate the effect of the porous support microstructure and thickness on oxygen partial pressure gradient inside the porous media. Results from this work were used to establish dependency of the flux with respect to bulk transport properties of the material, surface kinetics and architecture of the porous support. Furthermore, long-term stability of the produced tubular asymmetric membrane operated in CO₂-containing atmospheres was assessed over half a year. The membrane exhibited a stable oxygen flux without showing significant flux degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetric membranes 3aextrusion 3amathematical models 3amicrostructure 3aoxygen 3aporous media 3atemperature 0aOTM 0aAsymmetric tubular membrane 0aOxygen flux 0aCaTiO3 0aLong-term stability1 aFontaine, Marie-Laure1 aLi, Zuoan1 aPolfus, Jonathan M.1 aLarring, Yngve1 aDenonville, Christelle1 aNonnet, Emmanuel1 aStevenson, Adam1 aHenriksen, Partow P.1 aBredesen, Rune0 tJournal of membrane science.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 548 p.372-379dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.11.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245012300184300001800307520154000325592002801865650002401893650002401917650002101941650001701962650001101979650001901990650001002009650001302019650001302032650002102045650002602066650001502092650002102107650002102128650003602149650003202185650003502217650002602252650005202278650001502330650004002345650002702385700002302412700001902435773011602454856008102570852000902651655001202660IND50073481420221120232332.0150213e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007348142DNAL7 a242335442pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-013-0634-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoh, Lay-Koon10aEnhancement of Stress Tolerance in the Polyhydroxyalkanoate Producers without Mobilization of the Accumulated Granules  ap. 1585-1598.  aPoly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)], a polymer belonging to the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) family, is accumulated by numerous bacteria as carbon and energy storage material. The mobilization of accumulated P(3HB) is associated with increased stress and starvation tolerance. However, the potential function of accumulated copolymer such as poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) [P(3HB-co-3HV)] remained unknown. In this study, Delftia acidovorans DS 17 was used to evaluate the contributions of P(3HB) and P(3HB-co-3HV) granules during simulated exogenous carbon deprivation on cell survival by transferring cells with PHAs to carbon-free mineral salt medium supplemented with 1 % (w/v) nitrogen source. By mobilizing the intracellular P(3HB) and P(3HB-co-3HV) at 11 and 40 mol% 3HV compositions, the cells survived starvation. Surprisingly, D. acidovorans containing P(3HB-co-94 mol% 3HV) also survived although the mobilization was not as effective. Similarly, recombinant Escherichia coli pGEM-T::phbCAB Cₙ (harboring the PHA biosynthesis genes of Cupriavidus necator) containing P(3HB) granules had a higher viable cell counts compared to those without P(3HB) granules but without any P(3HB) mobilization when exposed to oxidative stress by photoactivated titanium dioxide. This study provided strong evidence that enhancement of stress tolerance in PHA producers can be achieved without mobilization of the previously accumulated granules. Instead, PHA biosynthesis may improve bacterial survival via multiple mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCupriavidus necator 3aDelftia acidovorans 3aEscherichia coli 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3acell viability 3agenes 3agranules 3anitrogen 3aoxidative stress 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3astarvation 3astress tolerance 3atitanium dioxide 2aDelftiaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHydroxybutyratesxchemistry 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aPolyestersxchemistry 2aPolyhydroxyalkanoatesxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aStarvation 2aStress, Physiologicalxdrug effects 2aTitaniumxpharmacology1 aPurama, Ravi Kiran1 aKumar, Sudesh,0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2014 Feb., v. 172, no. 3 p.1585-1598dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-013-0634-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02211naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009900159300001800258520096500276592002801241650001401269650002701283650001101310650001701321650001401338650002101352650001801373650001401391650002201405650001701427700002601444700002201470700001801492700002301510700002301533700002101556773014101577856007401718852000901792655001201801IND60641942220221121231733.0190506e20170307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064194222DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta10650a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIndra, Arindam12aA facile corrosion approach to the synthesis of highly active CoOₓ water oxidation catalysts  ap. 5171-5177.  aUltra-small rock salt cobalt monoxide (CoO) nanoparticles were synthesized and subjected to partial oxidation (‘corrosion’) with ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) to form mixed-valence CoOₓ (1 < x < 2) water oxidation catalysts. Spectroscopic, microscopic and analytical methods evidenced a structural reformation of cubic CoO to active CoOₓ with a spinel structure. The superior water oxidation activity of CoOₓ has been established in electrochemical water oxidation under alkaline conditions. Electrochemical water oxidation with CoOₓ was recorded at a considerably low overpotential of merely 325 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm⁻² in comparison to 370 mV for CoO. Transformation of both octahedral Coᴵᴵ and Coᴵᴵᴵ sites into amorphous Co(OH)₂–CoOOH is the key to high electrochemical activity while the presence of a higher amount of octahedral Coᴵᴵᴵ sites in CoOₓ is imperative for an efficient oxygen evolution process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aceric ammonium nitrate 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production 3aspectroscopy1 aMenezes, Prashanth W.1 aDas, Chittaranjan1 aGöbel, Caren1 aTallarida, Massimo1 aSchmeiβer, Dieter1 aDriess, Matthias0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Mar. 7, v. 5, no. 10 p.5171-5177dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta10650a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03901naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245007500164300001600239520213200255592002802387650002102415650002502436650001402461650001202475650001302487650006602500650002102566650003902587650001502626650005802641650002002699650001302719650001102732650002002743650001102763651000902774653002502783653001902808653001502827653002202842653003002864653002102894700001702915700001602932700001402948700001702962700001702979700001902996700001903015700001703034700001803051700002003069700001503089773009103104856008303195852000903278655001203287IND60554673220221118014806.0161024e20140625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055467322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2014.04.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiaobo10aProteomic analysis of the venom from the scorpion Mesobuthus martensii  ap. 162-180.  aThe scorpion Mesobuthus martensii is the most populous species in eastern Asian countries, and several toxic components have been identified from their venoms. Nevertheless, a complete proteomic profile of the venom of M. martensii is still not available. In this study, the venom of M. martensii was analyzed by comprehensive proteomic approaches. 153 fractions were isolated from the M. martensii venom by 2-DE, SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC. The ESI-Q-TOF MS results of all fractions were used to search the scorpion genomic and transcriptomic databases. Totally, 227 non-redundant protein sequences were unambiguously identified, composed of 134 previously known and 93 previously unknown proteins. Among 134 previously known proteins, 115 proteins were firstly confirmed from the M. martensii crude venom and 19 toxins were confirmed once again, involving 43 typical toxins, 7 atypical toxins, 12 venom enzymes and 72 cell associated proteins. In typical toxins, 7 novel-toxin sequences were identified, including 3 Na+-channel toxins, 3K+-channel toxins and 1 no-annotation toxin. These results increased 230% (115/50) venom components compared with previous studies from the M. martensii venom, especially 50% (24/48) typical toxins. Additionally, a mass fingerprint obtained by MALDI-TOF MS indicated that the scorpion venom contained more than 200 different molecular mass components.This work firstly gave a systematic investigation of the M. martensii venom by combined proteomics strategy coupled with genomics and transcriptomics. A large number of protein components were unambiguously identified from the venom of M. martensii, most of which were confirmed for the first time. We also contributed 7 novel-toxin sequences and 93 protein sequences previously unknown to be part of the venom, for which we assigned potential biological functions. Besides, we obtained a mass fingerprint of the M. martensii venom. Together, our study not only provides the most comprehensive catalog of the molecular diversity of the M. martensii venom at the proteomic level, but also enriches the composition information of scorpion venom.  aPublisher supplied data 3aButhus martensii 3aamino acid sequences 3adatabases 3aenzymes 3agenomics 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteomics 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asodium channels 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3atranscriptomics 3avenoms 3aAsia 0aMesobuthus martensii 0aScorpion venom 0aProteomics 0aMass spectrometry 0aComponents identification 0aMass fingerprint1 aDuan, Zhigui1 aDi, Zhiyong1 aHe, Yawen1 aLi, Jianglin1 aLi, Zhongjie1 aXie, Chunliang1 aZeng, Xiongzhi1 aCao, Zhijian1 aWu, Yingliang1 aLiang, Songping1 aLi, Wenxin0 tJournal of proteomics.g2014 June 25, v. 106 p.162-180dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2014.04.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245008100215300001600296520091100312592002801223650001901251650001101270650002501281650001501306650001401321650001101335650002001346653001401366653001801380653002901398653002301427653002101450773011601471856008801587852000901675655001201684IND60525019920221119192132.0190318e20160830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052501992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.01.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbier, Edward B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5354-399514aThe protective service of mangrove ecosystems: A review of valuation methods  ap. 676-681.  aConcern over the loss of mangrove ecosystems often focuses on their role in protecting coastal communities from storms that damage property and cause deaths and injury. With climate change, mangrove loss may also result in less protection against coastal storms as well as sea-level rise, saline intrusion and erosion. Past valuations of the storm protection benefit of mangroves have relied on the second-best replacement cost method, such as estimating this protective value with the cost of building human-made storm barriers. More reliable methods instead model the production of the protection service of mangroves and estimate its value in terms of reducing the expected damages or deaths avoided by coastal communities. This paper reviews recent methods of valuing the storm protection service of mangroves and their role in protecting coastal areas and communities of tropical developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3adeveloping countries 3aecosystems 3asea level 3astorms 3awater pollution 0aMangroves 0aMangrove loss 0aStorm protection service 0aEconomic valuation 0aWave attenuation0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2016 Aug. 30, v. 109, no. 2 p.676-681dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.01.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245015100198300001800349506007600367520195000443592002802393506003702421650002102458650001602479650001902495650001502514650001402529650001002543650001202553650001302565650001402578650001702592650001302609650001502622650001502637650001602652650002402668700002902692700002202721700004002743700002902783700002202812700002602834773013302860856008002993852000903073655001203082IND4488231020221207095903.0120320e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448823102DNAL7 a10.1128/AAC.00178-112doi7 aPMC31869572pmcid7 a217884582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRipoll, Aida10aIn Vitro Selection of Variants Resistant to Î²-Lactams plus Î²-Lactamase Inhibitors in CTX-M Î²-Lactamases: Predicting the In Vivo Scenario?  ap. 4530-4536.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCTX-M Î²-lactamases are the most prevalent group of enzymes within the extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases (ESBL). The therapeutic options for CTX-M-carrying isolates are scarce, forcing the reexamination of the therapeutic possibilities of Î²-lactams plus Î²-lactamase inhibitors (BBLIs). Inhibitor-resistant CTX-M Î²-lactamases (IR-CTX-M) have not hitherto been described in natural isolates. In this study, 168 cultures of the hypermutagenic Escherichia coli GB20 strain carrying plasmid pBGS18 with different blaCTX-M genes were submitted to parallel experimental evolution assays in the presence of increasing concentrations of a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate. Fourteen CTX-M Î²-lactamases belonging to the three most representative clusters (CTX-M-1, -2, and -9) and the two main phenotypes (cefotaxime resistance and cefotaxime-ceftazidime resistance) were studied. Three types of IR-CTX-M mutants were detected, having mutations S130G, K234R, and S237G, which are associated with different resistance patterns. The most frequently recovered mutation was S130G, which conferred the highest resistance levels to BBLIs (reaching 12 Âµg/ml for amoxicillin-clavulanate and 96 Âµg/ml for piperacillin-tazobactam when acquired by CTX-M-1 cluster enzymes). The S130G change also provided a clear antagonistic pleiotropy effect, strongly decreasing the enzyme's activity against all cephalosporins tested. A double mutation, S130G L169S, partially restored the resistance against cephalosporins. A complex pattern observed in CTX-M-58, carrying P167S and S130G or K234R changes, conferred ESBL and IR phenotypes simultaneously. The K234R and S237G changes had a smaller effect in providing inhibitor resistance. In summary, IR-CTX-M enzymes might evolve under exposure to BBLIs, and the probability is higher for enzymes belonging to the CTX-M-1 cluster. However, this process could be delayed by antagonistic pleiotropy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aamoxicillin 3abeta-lactamase 3acefotaxime 3aevolution 3agenes 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3apiperacillin 3aplasmids 3apleiotropy 3aprediction 3aprobability 3avarietal resistance1 aBaquero, F.q(Fernando),1 aNovais, Ãngela1 aRodrÃ­guez-DomÃ­nguez, Mario J.1 aTurrientes, Maria-Carmen1 aCantÃ³n, Rafael1 aGalÃ¡n, Juan-Carlos0 tAntimicrobial agents and chemotherapy.g2011 Oct., v. 55, no. 10 p.4530-4536dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0066-48047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AAC.00178-113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle01749naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013700163300001600300500002000316520065500336592002800991650001301019650001701032650001301049650002001062650001301082650000901095650001301104650001101117650002601128700002001154700001901174773011101193856007401304852000901378655001201387IND60586825920221118093050.0171214e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058682592DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.288982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurutani, Masahiro12aA dismantlable photoadhesion system fabricated by an anionic UV curing of epoxy resins with a base amplifier having a disulfide bond  ap. 237-241.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA base amplifier (BA) that autocatalytically generates a diamine having a disulfide bond has been developed.

Improving the critical properties of the electron transport layer (ETL) is an effective way to enhance the performance of p-PSC devices. Here, a brand-new method is developed to relieve the contact recombination caused by the rough fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) surface and further boosts the electrical concentration of the ETL. A SnO₂–ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) acylamide compound (SEAC) with hydrogen bond-induced adjustable cluster size is reported for the first time. The rational choice of the SEAC cluster size is the key for obtaining the smooth interfacial morphology of the ETL on the rugged FTO substrate. In addition, the energy band gap decreases with the increasing cluster size, and consequently, results in improved electrical conductivity of the SEAC. The upshifted Fermi energy level leads to higher electron concentration, which is an important physical quantity of the ETL. The PSC devices based on the optimized SEAC achieve an improved power conversion efficiency of 21.29% with negligible J–V hysteresis due to significantly enhanced electron transport and reduced contact charge recombination at the ETL/perovskite interface. In general, this paper comes up with a unique strategy to improve the quality of the SnO₂-based ETL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3ahysteresis 3atin dioxide 0aelectron transport layer 0acontrollable cluster size 0aSnO2−EDTA acylamide compound 0aDFT calculations 0aperovskite solar cells1 aSang, Hongqian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2738-88611 aJiang, Yun1 aWang, Yuan1 aXiong, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7640-33031 aYu, Yanhua1 aHe, Rongxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3937-06611 aChen, Bolei1 aZhao, Xingzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4886-23421 aLiu, Yumin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5198-36740 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 07, v. 13, no. 41 p.48555-48568dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c119903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01037naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245006800160300001600228520017000244592002800414650002300442650002300465650001800488700002200506700002300528773012600551856007300677852000900750655001200759IND60657759020221122083740.0190816e20060110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065775902DNAL7 a10.1039/b513458g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParnham, Emily R.14aThe ionothermal synthesis of SIZ-6—a layered aluminophosphate  ap. 380-382.  aA new layered open framework aluminophosphate has been prepared by ionothermal synthesis using an ionic liquid as the reaction solvent and structure-directing agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aionic liquids1 aWheatley, Paul S.1 aMorris, Russell E.0 tChemical communications.g2006 Jan. 10, , no. 4 p.380-382dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b513458g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012000162300002000282520082300302592002801125650002101153650001001174650001601184650002001200650002001220653003901240653002401279653001701303653002701320700001601347700001501363700001701378700001401395700001601409700001601425700001401441700001801455700005201473700005501525773014201580856007901722852000901801655001201810IND60753926020221122233950.0211020e20211008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075392602DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c120612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Tianpei10aEngineering the Redox-Driven Channel for Precisely Regulating Nanoconfined Glutathione Identification and Transport  ap. 49137-49145.  aBioinspired artificial nanochannels for molecular and ionic transport have extensive applications. However, it is still a huge challenge to achieve an intelligent transport system with high selectivity/efficiency and controllability. Inspired by glutathione transport across the plasma membrane via redox regulation, we herein designed and fabricated a redox-reactive artificial nanochannel based on the host–guest chemical strategy. The nanochannel platform achieved high selectivity/efficiency for the identification and transmission of glutathione in the confined space. In addition, this nanochannel can switch between the ON and OFF states through the redox reaction. This redox-regulated system can provide a potential application for detection/binding of biological analytes and redox-controlled drug release.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical species 3adrugs 3aglutathione 3aplasma membrane 3aredox reactions 0aartificial intelligent nanochannel 0aselective transport 0ahost−guest 0aredox-regulated switch1 aCheng, Ming1 aZeng, Lisi1 aChen, Xiaoya1 aXie, Yuan1 aLei, Ziying1 aRuan, Qiang1 aWang, Jin1 aCui, Shuzhong1 aSun, Yao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6519-74361 aLi, Haibing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6374-46940 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 08, v. 13, no. 41 p.49137-49145dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c120613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245016800187300001600355500001500371520139500386592002801781650001401809650002301823650000801846650002601854650001001880650001801890650001701908650001701925650002401942650002501966650002201991650001302013650002002026650003602046650001102082650001502093650001002108650000902118650002202127650002802149650002002177650005302197650001102250650001102261650000902272650001902281650001602300650005502316650001402371650003602385650001602421653000902437700001302446700001502459773009902474856005502573852000902628655001202637IND4491806720221120161610.0150209e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449180672DNAL7 a221069272pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00952.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshwell, M.10aWaist‐to‐height ratio is a better screening tool than waist circumference and BMI for adult cardiometabolic risk factors: systematic review and meta‐analysis  ap. 275-286.  a2019-12-04  aOur aim was to differentiate the screening potential of waist‐to‐height ratio (WHtR) and waist circumference (WC) for adult cardiometabolic risk in people of different nationalities and to compare both with body mass index (BMI). We undertook a systematic review and meta‐analysis of studies that used receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves for assessing the discriminatory power of anthropometric indices in distinguishing adults with hypertension, type‐2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome and general cardiovascular outcomes (CVD). Thirty one papers met the inclusion criteria. Using data on all outcomes, averaged within study group, WHtR had significantly greater discriminatory power compared with BMI. Compared with BMI, WC improved discrimination of adverse outcomes by 3% (P < 0.05) and WHtR improved discrimination by 4–5% over BMI (P < 0.01). Most importantly, statistical analysis of the within‐study difference in AUC showed WHtR to be significantly better than WC for diabetes, hypertension, CVD and all outcomes (P < 0.005) in men and women. For the first time, robust statistical evidence from studies involving more than 300 000 adults in several ethnic groups, shows the superiority of WHtR over WC and BMI for detecting cardiometabolic risk factors in both sexes. Waist‐to‐height ratio should therefore be considered as a screening tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3ascreening 3ametabolic syndrome 3amen 3awaist-to-height ratio 3awomen 3ameta-analysis 3ahypertension 3arisk factors 3awaist circumference 3astatistical analysis 3asystematic review 3adiabetes 3abody mass index 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aadults 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aBody Heightxphysiology 2aBody Mass Index 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMass Screening 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxclassificationxcomplicationsxdiagnosis. 2aROC Curve 2aWaist Circumferencexphysiology 2aYoung Adult 0arisk1 aGunn, P.1 aGibson, S.0 tObesity reviews.g2012 Mar., v. 13, no. 3 p.275-286dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-78817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00952.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015100172300001600323520142400339592002801763650001701791650001301808650001301821650001601834650001401850650004101864650002301905650001901928650001901947650001901966650001901985650001002004650002402014650001702038650001702055650002102072650002702093650001602120650001702136650002102153650001602174650001902190650001402209653001402223653001202237653001302249653001802262653004102280773011602321856008102437852000902518655001202527IND60520528520221116224140.0160521e20110922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052052852DNAL7 a10.2478/v10222-011-0013-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBortnowska, Grażyna10aEffect of Composition, Stability and Microstructure of O/W Emulsions on the Retention and Release Characteristics of Diacetyl and (-)-Alpha-Pinene  ap. 125-135.  aThe influence of natural emulsifiers or their mixtures with synthetic emulsifiers (surfactants) on the retention, release characteristics and odor intensity of hydrophilic diacetyl and hydrophobic (-)α-pinene in oil-in-water emulsions was examined. A lipid fraction was composed of rapeseed oil, whereas sodium caseinate, concentrate of soy proteins, dried egg yolk, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60) and polyoxyethylene sorbitan tristearate (Tween 65) were used as emulsifiers. The hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) of surfactants was within the range of 11-40. The thermodynamic study showed that natural emulsifiers and surfactants affected more retention of hydrophobic aroma compound than the one of hydrophilic odorant. Release rate constants of (-)-α-pinene were observed to decrease mainly with lowering the HLB value of surfactants or their mixtures, whereas the ones of diacetyl with increasing viscosity of the system. Microstructural properties of the emulsions i.e. surface area of the oil-water interface, surface protein concentration and the dispersion index, had no statistically significant effect on the release rate of hydrophobic aroma compound. Odour intensity detected orthonasally was higher correlated with headspace concentration of aroma compounds, measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, in relation to (-)-α-pinene than diacetyl.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-pinene 3adiacetyl 3aegg yolk 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrostructure 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aoil-water interface 3apolysorbates 3arapeseed oil 3asodium caseinate 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asoy protein 3asurface area 3asurface proteins 3asurfactants 3athermodynamics 3aviscosity 0aretention 0arelease 0adiacetyl 0a(-)-α-pinene 0ahydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB)0 tPolish journal of food and nutrition sciences.g2011 Sept. 22, v. 61, no. 2 p.125-135dVersitax2083-60077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10222-011-0013-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245009000179300001600269520093700285592002801222650001701250650001601267650001101283650001001294650002301304650002001327651001101347651001401358653001501372653001201387653001601399653001501415653001101430700002601441700002401467700002201491700002601513773011801539856008801657852000901745655001201754IND60525020320221123015445.0190318e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052502032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErni Cassola, Gabriel10aDecline in abundance and health state of an Atlantic subtropical gorgonian population  ap. 329-334.  aLosses in coral cover have been widely reported for the Caribbean. In contrast, much less is known about the health state of the Brazilian reef fauna, which was declared as a priority for Atlantic biodiversity conservation due to its high degree of endemism. In the present study, we assessed the general health state of Phyllogorgia dilatata assemblages at the subtropical reefs of Arraial do Cabo (southeastern Brazil), where observations suggest that the abundance of this endemic gorgonian species has declined. We found that about 49% of the sampled colonies were dead, and 73% of the living colonies were affected by tissue loss. Tissue loss initially manifested as multifocal holes in the planar colonial coenenchyme and peripheral tissue retraction leaving denuded skeletal axes. In combination with other recent studies, our results raise the awareness for an increasingly threatened Southwestern Atlantic reef coral fauna.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3afauna 3aindigenous species 3awater pollution 3aBrazil 3aCaribbean 0aGorgonians 0aDisease 0aSubtropical 0aRocky reef 0aBrazil1 aPacheco, Matheus S.C.1 aBarbosa, Moysés C.1 aHansen, Dennis M.1 aFerreira, Carlos E.L.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 104, no. 1-2 p.329-334dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005200171300001600223520148100239592002801720650002601748650002401774650002001798650002201818650002901840650000901869650001601878653000901894653001701903653003401920700002001954773010801974856008602082852000902168655001202177IND60114135520221119082944.0190318e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011413552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWixon, Devin L.10aToward conceptual clarity: PLFA in warmed soils  ap. 769-774.  aStudies assessing shifts in soil nutrient cycling with warming benefit from microbial data collection with clear ecological hypotheses. However, the fact that many organisms alter their lipids to adjust to temperature complicates interpretation of the widely-used method of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Changes in PLFA profiles may reflect shifts in community composition (i.e. relative abundance of microbial groups) or physiological change (i.e. the same groups after membrane optimization) or both. The various approaches presently used to interpret results from warming studies expose a need for greater conceptual clarity. We compile the various data metrics commonly used for PLFA and discuss their interpretations in the context of temperature-based studies. We propose that certain lipid ratios are likely to at least partially reflect decreased unsaturation and other warming-induced physiological shifts. A change in community composition may underlie warming results for both whole-community ordination and certain indicator lipids, provided that the effect of lipids commonly re-synthesized to maintain membrane fluidity are considered. Overall, conclusions in warming studies would be strengthened by explicit consideration of temperature-dependent lipid effects in data analysis. Further research is needed toward substantiating the interpretation of PLFA-based temperature response data as indicating community compositional or physiological change.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acommunity structure 3adata collection 3amembrane fluidity 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3asoil 3atemperature 0aPLFA 0aSoil warming 0aMicrobial community structure1 aBalser, Teri C.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2013 Feb., v. 57 p.769-774dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014900155300001800304520102400322592002801346650001901374650001401393650002301407650002101430650002401451650001201475650002201487650001801509650001501527650001301542700001501555700001801570700001901588700001801607700001301625773014001638856007401778852000901852655001201861IND60641943020221121221548.0190506e20170207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064194302DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta10700a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Ling10aSpecific synthesis of CoS₂ nanoparticles embedded in porous Al₂O₃ nanosheets for efficient hydrogen evolution and enhanced lithium storage  ap. 2861-2869.  aCoS₂ nanoparticles embedded in Al₂O₃ nanosheets (CoS₂ NP/Al₂O₃ NSs) have been designed and fabricated using a controllable hydrothermal process followed by a simple low-temperature sulfurization step. The as-prepared CoS₂ NP/Al₂O₃ NSs display combined properties of high nanoporosity, thin thickness and good structural stability. When used as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the composite demonstrates high catalytic activity, including a small overpotential of ∼53 mV, a small Tafel slope of 50.9 mV dec⁻¹ and remarkable stability. Moreover, the CoS₂ NP/Al₂O₃ NSs have a promising lithium-storage capability with high specific capacity (∼1150 mA h g⁻¹ at 100 mA g⁻¹ in the first cycle) and enhanced cycling stability (coulombic efficiency of around 96% for 150 cycles). The facile strategy used to synthesize the unique architecture could be expanded to the preparation of other transition metal sulfides for the HER and lithium ion batteries (LIBs).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrogen production 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3asulfides1 aZhang, Yan1 aGuan, Yongxin1 aZhang, Huijuan1 aWang, Shilong1 aWang, Yu0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Feb. 7, v. 5, no. 6 p.2861-2869dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta10700a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04145naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245017200163300002000335520189600355592002802251650001402279650001902293650003002312650002002342650001902362650001002381650001802391650001602409650001302425650001302438650002102451650001202472650001702484650001302501650003202514650001802546650001802564650001402582650001102596653003602607653002302643653001702666653003202683700002202715700005802737700002502795700005702820700005602877700005702933700005702990700006803047700002203115700005903137700002103196700006003217773014203277856007903419852000903498655001203507IND60753926220221122231708.0211020e20211011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075392622DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c121962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorad, Nagy L.10aPhenyl-Modified Carbon Nitride Quantum Nanoflakes for Ultra-Highly Selective Sensing of Formic Acid: A Combined Experimental by QCM and Density Functional Theory Study  ap. 48595-48610.  aFormic acid (HCOOH) is an important intermediate in chemical synthesis, pharmaceuticals, the food industry, and leather tanning and is considered to be an effective hydrogen storage molecule. Direct contact with its vapor and its inhalation lead to burns, nerve injury, and dermatosis. Thus, it is critical to establish efficient sensing materials and devices for the rapid detection of HCOOH. In the present study, we introduce a chemical sensor based on a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor capable of detecting trace amounts of HCOOH. This sensor is composed of colloidal phenyl-terminated carbon nitride (Ph-g-C₃N₄) quantum nanoflakes prepared using a facile solid-state method involving the supramolecular preorganization technology. In contrast to other synthetic methods of modified carbon nitride materials, this approach requires no hard templates, hazardous chemicals, or hydrothermal treatments. Comprehensive characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the QCM sensor designed and prepared here exhibits enhanced detection sensitivity and selectivity for volatile HCOOH, which originates from chemical and hydrogen-bonding interactions between HCOOH and the surface of Ph-g-C₃N₄. According to DFT results, HCOOH is located close to the cavity of the Ph-g-C₃N₄ unit, with bonding to graphitic carbon and pyridinic nitrogen atoms of the nanoflake. The sensitivity of the Ph-g-C₃N₄-nanoflake-based QCM sensor was found to be the highest (128.99 Hz ppm–¹) of the substances studied, with a limit of detection (LOD) of HCOOH down to a sub-ppm level of 80 ppb. This sensing technology based on phenyl-terminated attached-g-C₃N₄ nanoflakes establishes a simple, low-cost solution to improve the performance of QCM sensors for the effective discrimination of HCOOH, HCHO, and CH₃COOH vapors using smart electronic noses.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreathing 3acarbon nitride 3adensity functional theory 3adetection limit 3adirect contact 3adrugs 3afood industry 3aformic acid 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3aleather 3anerve tissue 3anitrogen 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3arapid methods 3askin diseases 3asynthesis 3avapors 0acolloidal phenyl carbon nitride 0aquantum nanoflakes 0aHCOOH vapors 0asensitivity and selectivity1 aEl-Hosainy, Hamza1 aEsmat, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1465-09551 aEl-Kelany, Khaled E.1 aTahawy, Rafat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8426-47451 aNa, Jongbeom1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3890-78771 aIde, Yūsuke,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6901-69541 aFukata, Naoki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0986-84851 aChaikittisilp, Watcharop1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3240-08211 aHill, Jonathan P.1 aZhang, Xiaogang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4464-672X1 aEl-Kemary, Maged1 aYamauchi, Yusuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7854-927X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 11, v. 13, no. 41 p.48595-48610dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c121963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03412naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245010200202300001600304520171700320592002802037596005902065596005902124596005902183596007902242650001202321650000802333650001902341650001902360650001702379650000802396650001902404650002002423650001102443650001202454651001502466651001402481700001802495700001902513700001402532700001702546700001702563700001702580700001402597700002002611700001602631700002002647773012402667856008202791852000902873655001202882IND60632458120221121025839.0190512e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063245812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-018-4161-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Keyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0207-011213aAn interdecadal climate dipole between Northeast Asia and Antarctica over the past five centuries  ap. 765-775.  aClimate models emphasize the need to investigate inter-hemispheric climatic interactions. However, these models often underestimate the inter-hemispheric differences in climate change. With the wide application of reanalysis data since 1948, we identified a dipole pattern between the geopotential heights (GPHs) in Northeast Asia and Antarctica on the interdecadal scale in boreal summer. This Northeast Asia/Antarctica (NAA) dipole pattern is not conspicuous on the interannual scale, probably in that the interannual inter-hemispheric climate interaction is masked by strong interannual signals in the tropics associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Unfortunately, the instrumental records are not sufficiently long-lasting to detect the interdecadal variability of the NAA. We thus reconstructed GPHs since 1565, making using the proxy records mostly from tree rings in Northeast Asia and ice cores from Antarctica. The strength of the NAA is time-varying and it is most conspicuous in the eighteenth century and after the late twentieth century. The strength of the NAA matches well with the variations of the solar radiation and tends to increase in along with its enhancement. In boreal summer, enhanced heating associated with high solar radiation in the Northern Hemisphere drives more air masses from the South to the North. This inter-hemispheric interaction is particularly strong in East Asia as a result of the Asian summer monsoon. Northeast Asia and Antarctica appear to be the key regions responsible for inter-hemispheric interactions on the interdecadal scale in boreal summer since they are respectively located at the front and the end of this inter-hemispheric trajectory.  aPublisher supplied data  a41471172cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41690114cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41430531cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2015J06008cFellowship for Distinguished Young Scholars of Fujian Province 3aEl Nino 3aair 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3agrowth rings 3aice 3amonsoon season 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3atropics 3aAntarctica 3aEast Asia1 aChen, Deliang1 aGuo, Zhengtang1 aZhao, Yan1 aFrank, David1 aHe, Maosheng1 aZhou, Feifei1 aShi, Feng1 aSeppä, Heikki,1 aZhang, Peng1 aNeukom, Raphael0 tClimate dynamics.g2019 Jan., v. 52, no. 1-2 p.765-775dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4161-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02113naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009400158300001600252500002000268520103800288592002801326650001701354650001101371650002101382650001901403650001301422650002101435650001601456700001601472700001801488700001401506700001701520773013101537856007401668852000901742655001201751IND60592404820221117224831.0180403e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059240482DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.245902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuang, Yiwei10aResilient collapse of thermal sensitive polymer on the surface of the optical fiber taper  ap. 778-785.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this work, collapse of poly(N‐isopropyl‐acrylamide) (pNIPAM) grafted on the surface of the optical fiber taper is probed by measuring fluorescence of rhodamine B solution at various temperatures. It is observed that the fluorescence intensity through the taper shows a nonlinear response to temperature. According to the optical model for the special designed taper, it is realized that the nonlinear response results from changing in effective refractive index of interfacial layer between taper and solution. Analysis on relationship between signal change and collapse process reveals a springback process during the collapse of pNIPAM chains. Such a novel phenomenon is further investigated on method for fluorescence measurement and molecular weight of the polymer. These results have not only revealed details of the collapse, but also establish a novel technique for study the collapse of thermal sensitive polymers on the surface. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The development of a commercial GAS vaccine is hampered due to high strain and serotype diversity in different geographical regions, and the generation of cross-reactive antibodies that may induce autoimmune disease. There is an urgent need to search for alternative vaccine candidates. High throughput multigenome data mining coupled with proteomics seems to be a promising approach to identify the universal vaccine candidates. In the present study, in silico analysis led to prediction of 147 proteins as universal vaccine candidates. Distribution pattern of these predicted candidates was explored in nonsequenced Indian GAS strains (n = 20) by using DNA array hybridization validating in silico analysis. High throughput analyses of surface proteins using 1D-SDS-PAGE coupled with ESI–LC–MS/MS was applied on highly (M49) and less (M1) invasive GAS strains of Indian origin. Comparative proteomics analysis revealed that highly invasive GAS M49 had metabolically more active membrane associated protein machinery than less invasive M1. Further, by overlapping proteomics data with in silico predicted vaccine candidate genes, 52 proteins were identified as probable universal vaccine candidates, which were expressed in these GAS serotypes. These proteins can further be investigated as universal vaccine candidates against GAS. Moreover, this robust approach may serve as a model that can be applied to identify the universal vaccine candidates in case of other pathogenic bacteria with high strain and genetic diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus pyogenes 3aantibodies 3aautoimmune diseases 3abacteria 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahuman diseases 3amodels 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aprediction 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aserotypes 3asurface proteins 3avaccines 0agroup A Streptococcus 0abioinformatics 0aDNA array 0auniversal vaccine candidates1 aArya, Deepak

The paralytic effect is generated by the enzymatic activity of the light chain (LC) that cleaves specifically one of the SNARE proteins responsible for neurotransmitter exocytosis. The activity of the LC in a BoNT-containing therapeutic can be compromised by denaturing agents present during manufacturing and/or in the cell. Stabilization of the LC by reducing vulnerability towards denaturants would thus be advantageous for the development of BoNT-based therapeutics. In this work, we focused on increasing the stability of LC of BoNT/A1 (LC/A1) towards oxidative stress. We tackled this task by rational design of mutations at cysteine and methionine LC/A1 sites. Designed mutants showed improved oxidative stability in vitro and equipotency to wildtype toxin in vivo. Our results suggest that suitable modification of the catalytic domain can lead to more stable BoNTs without impairing their therapeutic efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSNARE proteins 3aactive sites 3aaesthetics 3abotulinum toxin 3acysteine 3aenzyme activity 3aexocytosis 3ahumans 3amanufacturing 3amethionine 3amuscles 3amutants 3amutation 3anervous system diseases 3aneurotransmitters 3aoxidative stability 3aoxidative stress 3aparalysis 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 0aLight chain 0aBoNT/A 0aToxin 0aOxidative stability 0aProtein stability 0aProtein design1 aScheps, Daniel1 aJurk, Marcel1 aHofmann, Fred1 aFrevert, Jürgen0 tToxicon.g2018 June 01, v. 147 p.54-57dElsevier LtdwJournal:6279x0041-01017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2017.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013900170300001600309520144900325592002801774650001501802650002101817650001001838650001901848650001001867650001301877650001101890650001301901650001701914650001101931650002501942650001001967651001201977651001201989653001402001653002102015653001202036653001002048700001802058700003002076700002302106700001802129700005702147700002702204700002002231700002002251700002602271700001602297700002102313700002602334773010702360856008202467852000902549655001202558IND60526333520221118020717.0190405e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052633352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2016.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRakszegi, Marianna10aComparison of quality parameters of wheat varieties with different breeding origin under organic and low-input conventional conditions  ap. 297-305.  aThe processing quality of 37 wheat varieties grown in Hungary and Austria (2011–2013) were assessed under organic and conventional low input management.

Furthermore, properties were identified that could characterize wheat quality and be used effectively for selection under both types of growing conditions.Strong year and genotype effects were found for all the quality traits (protein, starch, gluten, GI, Zeleny, Farinograph water absorption, development time, stability and quality number, falling number, flour yield, hardness index) of the studied varieties, while the effect of the management was significant for the physical properties (test weight, thousand-kernel weight, hardness) and gluten quality characters (gluten spread, GI, dough stability) of the grain. The standard deviation of the gluten quality traits characterized the differences between the breeding strategies. It proved possible to pre select organic varieties for quality traits with high broad-sense heritability under conventional growing conditions, but direct selection in organic fields is suggested for gluten quality characters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abreeding methods 3adough 3afalling number 3aflour 3agenotype 3agluten 3ahardness 3aheritability 3astarch 3astatistical analysis 3awheat 3aAustria 3aHungary 0aLow input 0aOrganic breeding 0aQuality 0aWheat1 aMikó, Péter1 aLöschenberger, Franziska1 aHiltbrunner, Jürg1 aAebi, Rosalie1 aKnapp, Samuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7223-72131 aTremmel-Bede, Karolina1 aMegyeri, Mária1 aKovács, Géza,1 aMolnár-Láng, Márta1 aVida, Gyula1 aLáng, László,1 aBedő, Z.q(Zoltán),0 tJournal of cereal science.g2016 May, v. 69 p.297-305dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2016.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245013300208300001800341500001900359520147800378592002801856650001301884650001101897650001101908650001901919650001101938650001301949650001801962650002401980650001102004650001302015700002002028700005302048773011902101856008702220852000902307655001202316IND60707701820221118180835.0200820e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070770182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c017192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Tengfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0141-481410aBio-oil Upgrading via Ether Extraction, Looped-Oxide Catalytic Deoxygenation, and Mild Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation Techniques  ap. 9725-9733.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo overcome the disadvantages of primary bio-oil, two technical routes, namely, bio-oil ether extraction coupled with ether-soluble fraction microwave-assisted catalytic esterification (ES-MACE) and looped-oxide catalytic deoxygenation/mild electrocatalytic hydrogenation (MECH)/catalytic cracking to produce hydrocarbons, were conducted for bio-oil upgrading. With the first route, it was found that the highest ether extraction efficiency was achieved when the volume ratio of bio-oil/ether was 1:2 and the ES quality was effectively improved in comparison to primary bio-oil; after the ES-MACE, the relative content of acids in the ES decreased dramatically, while that of esters increased. With the second route, the oxygen content in the bio-oil deoxidized by a Zn powder decreased by 23.92%. Moreover, the relative contents of acids, alcohols, and sugars diminished, while those of esters, carbonyls, and phenols rose. Then, the MECH step further refined the deoxidized bio-oil; the relative contents of acids, esters, carbonyls, phenols, sugars, and furans decreased, and that of alcohols increased substantially. At the same time, the hydrogen/carbon effective ratio greatly improved after the refining process. Finally, catalytic cracking by proton-exchanged zeolite Socony Mobil-5 of the obtained bio-oil was carried out to produce hydrocarbons; the carbon yield of aromatics, olefins, and total chemicals increased along with the hydrogen/carbon effective ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3aenergy 3aesterification 3afurans 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3amicrowave treatment 3aoxygen 3azeolites1 aZhong, Zhaoping1 aZhang, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1219-14790 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 July 01, v. 34, no. 8 p.9725-9733dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c017193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245013700169300001600306520139100322592002801713650002101741650002501762650001501787650001301802650000901815650002001824650001101844650001101855650001601866650002601882650001101908651001901919653003001938653001301968653004801981653001202029653002602041653000802067653000802075653000902083653000802092653000702100653000902107700001802116700001202134700001502146700005402161773009102215856008902306852000902395655001202404IND60609805320221118052739.0180824e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060980532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.11.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, M.10aRelease of 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) from polymer-bonded explosives (PBXN-109) into water by artificial weathering  ap. 604-608.  aPolymer-bonded explosives (PBX) fulfil the need for insensitive munitions. However, the environmental impacts of PBX are unclear, even though it is likely that PBX residues from low-order detonations and unexploded ordnance are deposited on military training ranges. The release of high explosives from the polymer matrix into the environment has not been studied in detail, although as polymers degrade slowly in the environment we anticipate high explosives to be released into the environment. In this study, PBXN-109 (nominally 64% RDX) samples were exposed to variable UK climatic conditions reproduced in the laboratory to determine the effects of temperature, UV irradiation and rainfall on the release of RDX from the polymer binder. The most extreme conditions for spring, summer and winter in the UK were artificially reproduced. We found that up to 0.03% of RDX was consistently released from PBXN-109. The rate of RDX release was highest in samples exposed to the summer simulation, which had the lowest rainfall, but the highest temperatures and longest UV exposure. This was confirmed by additional experiments simulating an extreme summer month with consistently high temperatures and long periods of sunlight. These results probably reflect the combination of polymer swelling and degradation when samples are exposed to higher temperatures and prolonged UV irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic factors 3aenvironmental impact 3aexplosives 3apolymers 3arain 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 3awinter 3aUnited Kingdom 0aPolymer-bonded explosives 0aPBXN-109 0a1,3,5-Trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) 0aRelease 0aArtificial weathering 0aPBX 0aRDX 0aHTPB 0aDOA 0aUV 0aHPLC1 aLadyman, M.K.1 aMai, N.1 aTemple, T.1 aCoulon, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4384-32220 tChemosphere.g2017 Feb., v. 169 p.604-608dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.11.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245007900199300001800278500002000296520163100316592002801947596004101975596003602016596005502052650002502107650001202132650002502144650002502169650001502194700006302209700002202272700005902294773011902353856007402472852000902546655001202555IND60768050820221118072422.0220225e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076805082DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.163292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBush, Stephen J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9341-256210aContrasting gene‐level signatures of selection with reproductive fitness  ap. 1515-1526.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSelection leaves signatures in the DNA sequence of genes, with many test statistics devised to detect its action. While these statistics are frequently used to support hypotheses about the adaptive significance of particular genes, the effect these genes have on reproductive fitness is rarely quantified experimentally. Consequently, it is unclear how gene‐level signatures of selection are associated with empirical estimates of gene effect on fitness. Eukaryotic data sets that permit this comparison are very limited. Using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, for which these resources are available, we calculated seven gene‐level substitution and polymorphism‐based statistics commonly used to infer selection (dN/dS, NI, DOS, Tajima's D, Fu and Li's D*, Fay and Wu's H, and Zeng's E) and, using knockout lines, compared these to gene‐level estimates of effect on fitness. We found that consistent with expectations, essential genes were more likely to be classified as negatively selected. By contrast, using 379 Arabidopsis genes for which data was available, we found no evidence that genes predicted to be positively selected had a significantly different effect on fitness than genes evolving more neutrally. We discuss these results in the context of the analytic challenges posed by Arabidopsis, one of the only systems in which this study could be conducted, and advocate for examination in additional systems. These results are relevant to the evaluation of genome‐wide studies across species where experimental fitness data is unavailable, as well as highlighting an increasing need for the latter.  aPublisher supplied data  a1052262cNational Science Foundation  aIN200920cPAPPIT‐DGAPA‐UNAM  aNE/P004121/1cNatural Environment Research Council 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aecology 3anucleotide sequences 3areproductive fitness 3astatistics1 aMurren, Courtney J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0361-17901 aUrrutia, Araxi O.1 aKover, Paula X.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9872-28660 tMolecular ecology.g2022 Mar., v. 31, no. 5 p.1515-1526dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.163293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02329naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245011900175300001600294520101300310592002801323650002201351650001001373650001701383650001701400650001201417650001001429650001001439650001801449650003001467650002201497650001101519650002301530650001201553653000801565653001201573653001501585653000801600653001101608653001401619700002301633700003101656773008101687856008201768852000901850655001201859IND60520289620221119170233.0160519e20130227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052028962DNAL7 a10.1515/mammalia-2011-01232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCervantes, Fernando A.14aThe SRY gene of the Y chromosome successfully identifies gender of endemic Mexican shrews (Mammalia: Soricomorpha)  ap. 335-339.  aIn shrews, it is difficult to identify the gender of an individual if it is not reproductively active. An alternative that has already been successfully tested in other mammals is using a molecular marker such as the SRY gene of the Y chromosome of males. This study aims to identify the sex in shrews through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the SRY gene of Mexican endemic shrews (Cryptotis, Sorex and Megasorex). PCR products were sequenced and compared through the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST). Male tissues produced a 202-bp DNA fragment for Cryptotis, a 155-bp fragment for Sorex and a 189-bp fragment for Megasorex; no female sample of any of the three species produced a positive amplification. Therefore, the sex of these shrew species was successfully identified. This is particularly useful for immature individuals or incomplete specimens found in pitfall traps. These results may be valuable to ecological studies and benefit conservation actions of threatened taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aSorex 3aSoricomorpha 3aY chromosome 3afemales 3agenes 3amales 3apitfall traps 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3ashrews 3athreatened species 3atissues 0aDNA 0aMéxico 0asequencing 0asex 0ashrews 0aSoricidae1 aArcangeli, Jésica1 aMorales, Rogelio A.

Large amounts of monitoring data on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in various environmental media have been accumulated, which allows us to conduct a fairly comprehensive assessment of the region around the Bohai and Yellow Seas to elucidate spatial patterns of pollution on a regional scale. This review summarized distributions of traditional and new POPs, including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), in various environmental media. In general, due to their physico-chemical properties (poor solubility in water), OCPs and PCBs were mainly detected in sediments, PBDEs and HBCDs were mainly detected in sediments and soils. PFASs, which have greater solubility, were mainly detected in the hydrosphere. For conventional POPs, such as OCPs and PCBs, Bohai Bay and Haihe River in China, Gyeonggi Bay and Lake Sihwa in South Korea were found to be most polluted areas. While for new POPs, such as PBDEs, HBCDs and PFASs, some areas were heavily polluted due to local production and applications. Estuarine and coastal areas of the Bohai Sea were more severely contaminated by POPs than coastal regions of the Yellow Sea. Overall, the present review will guide identification of key areas for strengthening risk assessment of POPs and management practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3ahexabromocyclododecane 3alakes 3amonitoring 3aorganochlorine pesticides 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3arivers 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3asoil 3asolubility 3awater pollution 3aChina 3aSouth Korea 3aYellow Sea 0aPOPs 0aDistribution 0aSediment 0aWater 0aRisk assessment 0aAsia1 aHong, Seongjin1 aWang, Tieyu1 aLi, Qifeng1 aYoon, Seo Joon1 aLü, Yonglong,1 aGiesy, John P.1 aKhim, Jong Seong0 tChemosphere.g2017 Feb., v. 169 p.503-515dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.11.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001800183245004300201300002000244506007600264520129300340592002801633506003701661650001201698650001101710650001301721650001901734650001901753650000801772650001901780650001101799700001701810700001601827700002301843700002301866700005901889773014901948856007702097852000902174655001202183IND60622011620221207121151.0181127e20181029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062201162DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b087962doi7 aPMC62576282pmcid7 a303710762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Chenfang10aIce Nucleation on a Corrugated Surface  ap. 15804-15811.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHeterogeneous ice nucleation is a key process in many environmental and technical fields and is of particular importance in modeling atmospheric behavior and the Earth’s climate. Despite an improved understanding of how water binds at solid surfaces, no clear picture has emerged to describe how 3D ice grows from the first water layer, nor what makes a particular surface efficient at nucleating bulk ice. This study reports how water at a corrugated, hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface restructures from a complex 2D network, optimized to match the solid surface, to grow into a continuous ice film. Unlike the water networks formed on plane surfaces, the corrugated Cu(511) surface stabilizes a buckled hexagonal wetting layer containing both hydrogen acceptor and donor sites. First layer water is able to relax into an “icelike” arrangement as further water is deposited, creating an array of donor and acceptor sites with the correct spacing and corrugation to stabilize second layer ice and allow continued commensurate multilayer ice growth. Comparison to previous studies of flat surfaces indicates nanoscale corrugation strongly favors ice nucleation, implying surface corrugation will be an important aspect of the surface morphology on other natural or engineered surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate 3acopper 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aice 3aice nucleation 3amodels1 aCorem, Gefen1 aGodsi, Oded1 aAlexandrowicz, Gil1 aDarling, George R.1 aHodgson, Andrew1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8677-74670 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Oct. 29, v. 140, no. 46 p.15804-15811dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b087963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245009700201300001800298520170000316592002802016650002802044650001202072650001102084650001602095650001302111650001202124650001102136650002302147650002302170650000902193650001302202650001502215650001602230650001602246651001202262651001202274700002102286773012602307856008202433852000902515655001202524IND60632458920221121005344.0190512e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063245892DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-018-4180-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Kunhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9433-806610aCharacteristics of Eurasian snowmelt and its impacts on the land surface and surface climate  ap. 1115-1138.  aThe local hydrological and climatic impacts of Eurasian snowmelt are studied using advanced land surface and atmospheric data. It is found that intense melting of snow is located at mid-high latitudes in April and May. Snowmelt plays an important role in determining the seasonal cycles of surface runoff and soil moisture (SM). Specifically, melting is accompanied by sharp responses in surface runoff and surface SM while the impacts are delayed for deeper-layer of soil. This is particularly significant in the western sector of Eurasia. On interannual timescales, the responses of various surface parameters to snowmelt in the same month are rather significant. However, the persistence of surface SM anomalies is weak due to the strong soil evaporation anomalies and surplus of surface energy for evaporation. Strong impacts on the sensible heat flux, planetary boundary layer height and precipitation in the next month following the melting of snow are identified in west Russia and Siberia. Downward propagation of surface SM anomalies is observed and a positive evaporation–convection feedback is identified in west Russia. However, the subsequent impacts on the local convective precipitation in late spring-summer and its contribution to the total precipitation are seemingly weak. The atmospheric water vapor convergence has strong control over the total precipitation anomalies. Overall, snowmelt-produced SM anomalies are not found to significantly impact the late spring-summer local climate anomalies in Northern Eurasia. Therefore, the delayed remote-responses of atmospheric circulation and climate to the melting of Eurasian snow may be only possible near the melting period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric circulation 3aclimate 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3alatitude 3amelting 3arunoff 3aseasonal variation 3asensible heat flux 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3asoil water 3atroposphere 3awater vapor 3aEurasia 3aSiberia1 aLau, Ngar-Cheung0 tClimate dynamics.g2019 Jan., v. 52, no. 1-2 p.1115-1138dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4180-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03960naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245015600175300001700331500001900348520159500367536066601962592002802628596003602656596004202692596003802734596012002772596007202892650002402964650002802988650002803016650002303044650002503067650001803092650001703110650002803127650001103155650001603166653000903182653002503191653001803216700002603234773013603260856008503396852000903481655001203490IND60666269320221122001551.0190917e20191126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066626932DNAL7 a10.1080/10826068.2019.16503772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawee-ai, Arthitaya10aOptimization of fermented Perilla frutescens seeds for enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid and bioactive compounds by Lactobacillus casei TISTR 1500  ap. 997-1009.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSelect LAB, including Lactobacillus fermentum TISTR 950, Lactobacillus plantarum TISTR 2265 and Lactobacillus casei TISTR 1500 were investigated for their ability to enhance GABA, TPC and the antioxidant activity of perilla seed juice. L. casei TISTR 1500 produced higher GABA and TPC contents and presented higher antioxidant activity than other strains. Furthermore, the optimal fermentation condition to perilla seeds inoculated with L. casei TISTR 1500 to improve the GABA, TPC and antioxidant activity was performed using 3³ full factorial design. The final optimal values for perilla fermentation was found at fermentation time of 4.82 days (4 days 19 h 40 min), initial substrate of 5% (w/v) and fermentation temperature of 30.07 °C. Under the optimal fermentation condition, an observed values of GABA, TPC, ABTS, DPPH and FRAP were 71.46 µg/g, 3175.00 µg GAE/g, 1991.40 µg TEAC/g, 9178.29 µg TEAC/g and 7753.34 µg TEAC/g, respectively, which was 3.3, 0.9, 2.9, 10.8 and 10.2 times higher than that of unfermented perilla seeds, and 2.1, 0.8, 0.9, 10 and 9.2 times of fermented perilla seeds before the optimization. These results may provide the foundation to further target in industrial application for the production of plant-based and develop functional perilla seed products containing GABA.HighlightsImproved GABA, TPC and antioxidant contents were found using Lactobacillus casei TISTR 1500 Full factorial design applied to optimize fermented perilla seeds by lactic acid fermentation The optimized conditions dramatically increased GABA and TPC contents  aThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial and/or in-kind support from the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, Thailand, Research Administrative Center, Chiang Mai University, School of Agro-Industry, Faculty of Agro-Industry, Chiang Mai University (CMU), Thailand, as well as the Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technological Research (TISTR) for microbial strain support for this project.

Capturing thermal heat of a SGSP for cogeneration of electricity and freshwater for residential applications can lead to outstanding outcomes. To address this need, theoretical analysis of two cogeneration systems driven by a SGSP under the same conditions is carried out to produce freshwater and electricity by integrating an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and a Kalina cycle (KC) with a reverse osmosis (RO) desalination unit. Also, a thermoelectric generator (TEG) with a heat exchanger is used as a potential device to improve performance of the systems in order to generate more power, using heat from upper convective zone. The energy and exergy balance equations are employed to different components of the systems for the Urmia lake in Iran, and the findings are credited by the available numerical and experimental data. The results of simulation demonstrated that the SGSP-ORC/RO system can provide freshwater and net electricity of 4 m³/h and 29.6 kW, respectively, when R600a is used in the ORC, while the SGSP-KC/RO system can produce freshwater and net output electricity of 3.3 m³/h and 15.5 kW, respectively. Under this condition, the cogeneration-based Gain-Output-Ratio (CGOR) and exergy efficiency for the SGSP-ORC/RO system are calculated 8.3 and 47.2%, respectively, whereas the CGOR and exergy efficiency for the SGSP-KC/RO system are calculated 6.9 and 26.0%, respectively. At last, a comprehensive parametric study is carried out to provide a technical enlightenment for designers of the systems. In comparison with the previous model, where a flat plate collector (FPC) with surface area of 21110 m2 was used to produce 145.8 m3h fresh water, it is found that the same fresh water amount can be attained with a solar pond with 35500 m2, hence obviously increasing pond area from this value will increase fresh water capacity of the proposed plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3acogeneration systems 3adesalination 3aelectricity 3aequations 3aexergy 3afreshwater 3aheat 3aheat exchangers 3alakes 3amodels 3areverse osmosis 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asurface area 3athermoelectric generators 3aIran 0aSolar pond 0aThermoelectric-generator 0aORC 0aKC 0aRO 0aThermodynamics1 aRostamzadeh, Hadi0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Aug., v. 156 p.748-767dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.04.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245014000185300001600325520079200341592002801133650002501161650001601186650001901202650001001221650001601231650002401247650001901271650001301290650001201303650001801315650003601333650002801369650002301397650002401420650002901444650001901473650006201492650002901554651001201583651000901595700002301604700001901627700002101646773009601667856004801763852000901811655001201820IND4473706320221119235058.0121003e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447370632DNAL7 a220861582pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-011-1171-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKörbelin, Jakob14aThe complete sequence of tobacco mosaic virus isolate Ohio V reveals a high accumulation of silent mutations in all open reading frames  ap. 387-389.  aTMVOhioV was first described 1969 by [1] because it did break resistance of tomato breeding lines containing Tm-1- and Tm-2 resistance genes.

The connection is statistically insignificant during 1957/58–1979/80 (P1), which becomes statistically significant during 1989/90–2011/12 (P2). The possible causes are further investigated. Associated with positive December AO during P2, significant anomalous anticyclone emerges over the central North Atlantic, which is accompanied with significant westerly and easterly anomalies along 45°−65°N and 20°−40°N, respectively. This favors the significant influence of December AO on the subsequent January SAT and atmospheric circulation over Eurasia and North Africa via triggering the North Atlantic tripole sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly that persists into the subsequent January. By contrast, the December AO-related anomalous anticyclone during P1 is weak and is characterized by two separate centers located in the eastern and western North Atlantic. Correspondingly, the westerly and easterly anomalies over the North Atlantic Ocean are weak and the-related tripole SST anomaly is not well formed, unfavorable for the persistent impact of the December AO into the subsequent January. Further analyses indicate that the different anomalous anticyclone associated with the December AO over the North Atlantic may be induced by the strengthened synoptic-scale eddy feedbacks over the North Atlantic, which may be related to the interdecadal intensification of the storm track activity. Additionally, the planetary stationary wave related to the December AO propagates from surface into upper stratosphere at mid-latitudes during P2, which further propagates downward to the troposphere and causes anomalous atmospheric circulation in the subsequent January.  aPublisher supplied data  a41505073cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41605059cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41375083cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a244166/E10cResearch Council of Norway  a2016QNRC001cChina Association for Science and Technology 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric circulation 3aclimate 3alatitude 3astorms 3astratosphere 3asurface water temperature 3atroposphere 3aArctic region 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aEurasia 3aNorthern Africa1 aWang, Huijun1 aGao, Yongqi1 aLi, Fei0 tClimate dynamics.g2019 Jan., v. 52, no. 1-2 p.1077-1094dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4182-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245013800197300001800335500002000353520137300373592002801746650001801774650002201792650001401814650000901828650002101837650001401858650002101872650001901893650001201912650001601924651001801940700001701958700002001975700001801995700002502013773011902038856007402157852000902231655001202240IND60768051220221118071751.0220225e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076805122DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.163322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrban, Paulina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3823-596X10aDNA metabarcoding reveals the importance of gelatinous zooplankton in the diet of Pandalus borealis, a keystone species in the Arctic  ap. 1562-1576.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInformation about the dietary composition of a species is crucial to understanding their position and role in the food web. Increasingly, molecular approaches such as DNA metabarcoding are used in studying trophic relationships, not least because they may alleviate problems such as low taxonomic resolution or underestimation of digestible taxa in the diet. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding with universal primers for cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) to study the diet composition of the northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), an Arctic keystone species with large socio‐economic importance. Across locations, jellyfish and chaetognaths were the most important components in the diet of P. borealis, jointly accounting for 40%–60% of the total read abundance. This dietary importance of gelatinous zooplankton contrasts sharply with published results based on stomach content analysis. At the same time, diet composition differed between fjord and shelf locations, pointing to different food webs supporting P. borealis in these two systems. Our study underlines the potential of molecular approaches to provide new insights into the diet of marine invertebrates that are difficult to obtain with traditional methods, and calls for a revision of the role of gelatinous zooplankton in the diet of the key Arctic species P. borealis, and in extension, Arctic food webs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aPandalus borealis 3aScyphozoa 3adiet 3afood composition 3afood webs 3akeystone species 3asocioeconomics 3astomach 3azooplankton 3aArctic region1 aPræbel, Kim1 aBhat, Shripathi1 aDierking, Jan1 aWangensteen, Owen S.0 tMolecular ecology.g2022 Mar., v. 31, no. 5 p.1562-1576dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.163323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03585naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013400168300001800302500001900320520205200339536011002391592002802501596006502529650002002594650002102614650002202635650001202657650001602669650001602685650002002701650002402721650000702745650001102752650002102763650001202784650001502796653001302811653001802824653002802842700002102870773014202891856008503033852000903118655001203127IND60666269520221122001735.0190917e20190919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066626952DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2019.15946872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeniz, Fatih10aTaguchi DoE methodology for modeling of synthetic dye biosorption from aqueous effluents: parametric and phenomenological studies  ap. 1065-1071.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiosorption technology has been acknowledged as one of the most successful treatment approaches for colored industrial effluents. The problems such as its high manufacturing cost and poor regeneration capability in the use of activated carbon as a biosorbent have prompted the environmental scientists to develop alternative biosorbent materials. In this context, as a sustainable green generation alternative biosorbent source, the discarded seed biomass from pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) processing industry was explored for the biotreatment of colored aqueous effluents in this study. To test the wastewater cleaning ability of biosorbent, Basic red 46 was selected as a typical model synthetic dye. Taguchi DoE methodology was employed to study the effect of important operational parameters, contact time, pH and synthetic dye concentration, on the biosorption process and to develop a mathematical model for the estimation of biosorption potential of biosorbent. The percentage contribution of each of these process variables on the dye biosorption was found to be 19.31%, 41.39%, and 38.74%, respectively. The biosorption capacity under the optimum environmental conditions, contact time of 360 min, pH of 8 and dye concentration of 30 mg L⁻¹, was estimated to be 92.878 mg g⁻¹ (R²: 99.45). This value was very close to the experimentally obtained dye removal performance value (92.095 mg g⁻¹). These findings indicated the high ability of Taguchi DoE technique in the optimization and simulation of dye biosorption system. The kinetic and equilibrium modeling studies showed that the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models were the best models for the elucidation of dye removal behavior of biosorbent. The thermodynamic studies displayed that the dye biosorption was a feasible, spontaneous and exothermic process. This parametric and phenomenological survey revealed that the discarded pepper seed biomass can be introduced as a potential and efficient biosorbent for the bioremediation of colored industrial effluents.  aThis work was supported by the Scientific Research Project Fund of Harran University [Project no: 18005].  aPublisher supplied data  a18005cScientific Research Project Fund of Harran University 3aCapsicum annuum 3aactivated carbon 3aartificial colors 3abiomass 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3aheat production 3amathematical models 3apH 3apepper 3aphytoremediation 3asurveys 3awastewater 0amodeling 0asynthetic dye 0aTaguchi DoE methodology1 aYıldız, Hakan,0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2019 Sept. 19, v. 21, no. 11 p.1065-1071dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2019.15946873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012000169300001600289520144400305592002801749650001601777650001901793650001001812650002401822651001001846651001101856651001001867651001201877653002601889653002101915653002801936653002201964653002601986773008102012856008202093852000902175655001202184IND60520290020221122232915.0160519e20130111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052029002DNAL7 a10.1515/mammalia-2012-00352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShenbrot, Georgy10aGeographic range, morphometric variation and niche differentiation in greater Egyptian jerboa, Jaculus orientalis1)  ap. 317-328.  aGeographic range, morphometric skull variation and niche differentiation were analyzed in the greater Egyptian jerboa, Jaculus orientalis, and compared with published data on the species’ phylogeographic structure. The species occurs in 15 separate areas, which are grouped into two main blocks and divided by a wide gap. The first block goes from Morocco to western Libya and the second from eastern Libya to Israel; the second block is subdivided into two sub-blocks, eastern Libya and Egypt and Israel and Sinai. Analysis of niche similarity indicated niche convergence within the eastern and western parts of the species’ geographic range and niche divergence between these two major parts of the geographic range. There was a strong congruence among distributional, genetic and ecological patterns. Morphological variation in J. orientalis did not completely coincide with the distribution, genetic and ecological patterns. Three morphologically well-differentiated population groups were found within the geographic range of the species. The same level of morphological differentiation was demonstrated between highly isolated geographically and deeply diverged genetically and ecologically western and eastern groups of populations and between the weakly geographically isolated and ecologically similar populations of Egypt/Libya and Israel/Sinai. A taxonomic revision of the sub-specific division of J. orientalis is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3amorphometry 3aphylogeography 3askull 3ataxonomic revisions 3aEgypt 3aIsrael 3aLibya 3aMorocco 0adistribution modeling 0aecological niche 0ageographic distribution 0askull morphometry 0asub-specific taxonomy0 tMammalia.g2013 Jan. 11, v. 77, no. 3 p.317-328dDe Gruyterx1864-15477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mammalia-2012-00353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03406naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002400166245007400190300001400264520202400278592002802302650001702330650000902347650000902356650002602365650001202391650001502403650001302418650002302431650002302454650001902477650001502496650002202511650001002533651001002543653001602553653001002569653002802579653001402607653002102621653002002642700001502662700001702677773010702694856011402801852000902915655001202924IND50065165220221118013555.0151127e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006516522DNAL7 a10.1658/1100-9233(2007)18[35:RAOPIA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontserrat, Vilàà10aRegional assessment of plant invasions across different habitat types  ap. 35-42.  aQuestions: 1. Which habitats have the highest degree of invasion? 2. Do native species-rich communities have also a high degree of invasion? 3. Do the patterns of association between native and alien species richness vary between habitats.Location: Catalonia region (NE Spain).Methods: We conducted a large regional analysis of 15 655 phytosociological relevéés to detect differences in the degree of invasion between European Nature Information System (EUNIS) habitats representative of temperate and Mediterranean European areas.Results: Alien species were present in less than 17 %% of the relevéés and represented less than 2%% of the total number of species per habitat. The EUNIS habitats with the highest alien species richness were arable land and gardens followed by anthropogenic forb-rich habitats, riverine and lakeshore scrubs, southern riparian galleries and thickets and trampled areas. In contrast, the following habitats had never any alien species: surface running waters, raised and blanket bogs, valley mires, poor fens and transition mires, base-rich fens, alpine and sub-alpine grasslands, sub-alpine moist or wet tall-herb and fern habitats, alpine and sub-alpine scrub habitats and spiny Mediterranean heaths. There was a unimodal relationship between the mean native and mean alien species richness per EUNIS habitat with a high number of aliens in habitats with intermediate number of native species and a low number of aliens at both extremes of the native species gradient. Within EUNIS habitats, the relationship was positive, negative or non-significant depending on the habitat type without any clear pattern related to the number of native species. Alien species richness was not related to plot size, neither between habitats nor within habitats.Conclusions: The analysis emphasised that the habitats with a higher degree of invasion were the most disturbed ones and that in general habitats rich in native species did not harbour less invaders than habitats poor in native species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarable soils 3abogs 3afens 3aferns and fern allies 3agardens 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aphytosociology 3ashrublands 3aspecies diversity 3awater 3aSpain 0aAlien plant 0aEUNIS 0aMediterranean community 0aRelevéé 0aSpecies richness 0aVegetation type1 aJoan, Pino1 aXavier, Font0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2007 Feb., v. 18, no. 1 p.35-42dOpulus Press Uppsalax1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1658%2F1100-9233%282007%2918%5B35%3ARAOPIA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245011700197300001800314500002000332520143100352592002801783596003501811596003401846650002001880650002001900650001301920650001401933650002001947650002101967650003001988650001502018650001402033700001802047700005802065700002002123700001802143700002402161773011902185856007402304852000902378655001202387IND60768051320221118072430.0220225e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076805132DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.163442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHahn, Megan A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9266-823210aHost phenotype and microbiome vary with infection status, parasite genotype, and parasite microbiome composition  ap. 1577-1594.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA growing literature demonstrates the impact of helminths on their host gut microbiome. We investigated whether the stickleback host microbiome depends on ecoevolutionary variables by testing the impact of exposure to the cestode parasite Schistocephalus solidus with respect to infection success, host genotype, parasite genotype, and parasite microbiome composition. We observed constitutive differences in the microbiome of sticklebacks of different origin, and those differences increased when sticklebacks exposed to the parasite resisted infection. In contrast, the microbiome of successfully infected sticklebacks varied with parasite genotype. More specifically, we revealed that the association between microbiome and immune gene expression increased in infected individuals and varied with parasite genotype. In addition, we showed that S. solidus hosts a complex endomicrobiome and that bacterial abundance in the parasite correlates with expression of host immune genes. Within this comprehensive analysis we demonstrated that (i) parasites contribute to modulating the host microbiome through both successful and unsuccessful infection, (ii) when infection is successful, the host microbiome varies with parasite genotype due to genotype‐dependent variation in parasite immunomodulation, and (iii) the parasite‐associated microbiome is distinct from its host and impacts the host immune response to infection.  aPublisher supplied data  cEppley Foundation for Research  cLaurie Landeau Foundation LLC 3aSchistocephalus 3agene expression 3agenotype 3ahelminths 3aimmune response 3aimmunomodulation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amicrobiome 3aphenotype1 aPiecyk, Agnes1 aJorge, Fátima1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3138-17291 aCerrato, Robert1 aKalbe, Martin1 aDheilly, Nolwenn M.0 tMolecular ecology.g2022 Mar., v. 31, no. 5 p.1577-1594dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.163443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012400172300001800296520160100314592002801915650001701943650001601960650001301976650001601989650001802005650001102023650002502034650001402059650001602073650001802089650001202107650001002119653001202129653002202141653001302163653002502176653001802201700001602219700002402235700002602259700002102285700002002306700002102326700001802347773010302365856008502468961000902553852000902562655001202571IND60553316720221119083737.0161021e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055331672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolt, Roberta R.10aEffects of short-term walnut consumption on human microvascular function and its relationship to plasma epoxide content  ap. 1458-1466.  aImproved vascular function after the incorporation of walnuts into controlled or high-fat diets has been reported; however, the mechanism(s) underlying this effect of walnuts is(are) poorly defined. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the acute and short-term effects of walnut intake on changes in microvascular function and the relationship of these effects to plasma epoxides, the cytochrome-P450-derived metabolites of fatty acids. Thirty-eight hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women were randomized to 4 weeks of 5 g or 40 g of daily walnut intake. All outcomes were measured after an overnight fast and 4 h after walnut intake. Microvascular function, assessed as the reactive hyperemia index (RHI), was the primary outcome measure, with serum lipids and plasma epoxides as secondary measures. Compared to 5 g of daily walnut intake, consuming 40 g/d of walnuts for 4 weeks increased the RHI and Framingham RHI. Total cholesterol and low- and high-density cholesterol did not significantly change after walnut intake. The change in RHI after 4 weeks of walnut intake was associated with the change in the sum of plasma epoxides (r=0.65, P=.002) but not with the change in the sum of plasma hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids. Of the individual plasma epoxides, arachidonic-acid-derived 14(15)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid was most strongly associated with the change in microvascular function (r=0.72, P<.001). These data support the concept that the intake of walnut-derived fatty acids can favorably affect plasma epoxide production, resulting in improved microvascular function.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood lipids 3acholesterol 3aepoxides 3afatty acids 3ahigh fat diet 3ahumans 3ahypercholesterolemia 3ahyperemia 3ametabolites 3apostmenopause 3awalnuts 3awomen 0aWalnuts 0aVascular function 0aOxylipin 0aalpha-Linolenic acid 0aLinoleic acid1 aYim, Sun J.1 aShearer, Gregory C.1 aHackman, Robert Mark,1 aDjurica, Dragana1 aNewman, John W.1 aShindel, Alan W.1 aKeen, Carl L.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2015 Dec., v. 26 p.1458-1466dElsevier Inc.x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245010900208520139300317592002801710650001801738650002401756650001301780650001001793653002601803653001501829653002501844653003301869653003301902700001301935700001701948700001501965700001501980700001401995773009002009856008502099852000902184655001202193IND60753766220221117194456.0220205e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075376622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1222632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, ZhaoCheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4302-470X10aAnti-cavitation optimal design and experimental research on tidal turbines based on improved inverse BEM  aTo capture tidal current energy to the greatest extent possible, the turbines must to be large in-scale. When the turbine is close to the free surface, with high energy-flow density, unsteady cavitation on the blade surface has a large negative impact on the efficiency and life of the turbine. This paper presents a revised theoretical analysis of hydrodynamics optimization of horizontal-axis tidal turbines, including cavitation effects, based on improved inverse blade element momentum (BEM) theory. The cavitation performance is reflected by the minimum pressure coefficient peak value on the blade surface, based on which the cavitation prediction model is established. The cavitation prediction model and improved inverse BEM theory are combined; additionally, the mathematical model of multi-objective optimization is established. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, a 10-kW current turbine was designed, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to validate the hydrodynamics characteristics of the resulting turbine blades. The experimental model was designed according to the similarity theory, and a cavitation mechanism visualization experiment and a performance parameter test experiment were carried out in a cavitation water tunnel. The simulation and experimental results revealed that the proposed design method achieves the optimization goal.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrodynamics 3amathematical models 3amomentum 3atides 0aTidal current turbine 0aCavitation 0aBlade element theory 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aMulti-objective optimization1 aLi, Dong1 aMao, Yufeng,1 aFeng, Long1 aZhang, Yue1 aLiu, Chao0 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 239 p.122263-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1222633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001900164245011200183300001600295500001500311520153900326592002801865650003201893650000901925650001401934650001701948650001601965650001201981650005301993650000902046650005202055650003502107650003802142650004302180650006602223650002202289653003102311700001802342700002002360700001802380700001902398773010602417852000902523856008202532655001202614IND8604570120221119205240.0181009e198511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND860457012DNAL7 a30019962pmid7 a10.1177/0300985885022006172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeunier, P.

Two or three dogs were necropsied on days 1 through 6 after inoculation. Tissues were collected for virus isolation, immunofluorescence testing, and light microscopy. Virus was isolated from, and fluorescent cells were seen in the tonsil, retropharyngeal and mesenteric lymph nodes one and two days after inoculation. Virus infection of systemic and intestinal lymphoid tissues occurred as early as three days after inoculation and was associated with viremia. Intestinal epithelial infection was first seen four days after oral inoculation. All dogs were viremic before intestinal epithelial infection was found. Fecal virus excretion first occurred four days after oral virus inoculation. Intestinal virus infection and lesions became progressively more severe between four and six days after inoculation. The severity of intestinal lesions was variable and related to the severity of systemic lymphoid tissue lesions and the magnitude and duration of viremia. Four littermates of virus-infected dogs were passively immunized against canine parvovirus with convalescent canine serum 24 hours after oral virus inoculation. Neither clinical signs, lymphopenia, nor fecal virus excretion occurred in passively immunized dogs. Intestinal epithelial infection was not demonstrable by immunofluorescence testing when passively immunized dogs were necropsied four, five, and six days after virus inoculation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarnivore protoparvovirus 1 3adogs 3aenteritis 3aimmunization 3alymph nodes 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxetiologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aDogs 2aEnteritisxmicrobiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aImmunization, Passivexveterinary 2aParvoviridaexisolation & purification 2aParvoviridae Infectionsxmicrobiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aVirus Replication 0aFeline panleukopenia virus1 aCooper, B.

Two experiments were conducted using satellite-derived realistic areal fraction land cover data in 2010 and 1990 as well as localized parameters (e.g. albedo and leaf area index). Without considering anthropogenic heat, experimental differences indicated a regional biogeophysical warming of 0.15 °C (0.16 °C) in summer Tₐ (Tₛ), but a negligible warming in winter Tₐ (Tₛ). Sensitivity analyses also showed a stronger magnitude of local warming in summer than in winter. Along with an increase of 10% in the urban fraction, local Tₐ (Tₛ) increases of 0.185 °C (0.335 °C), 0.212 °C (0.464 °C), and 0.140 °C (0.220 °C) were found at annual, summer, and winter scales, respectively, according to a space-for-time substitution method. The sensitivity analyses will be beneficial to get a rough biogeophysical warming estimation of future urbanization projections. Furthermore, a decomposed temperature metric (DTM) method was applied for the attribution analyses of the change in Tₛ induced by urbanization. Our results showed that the decrease in evapotranspiration-induced latent heat played a dominate role in biogeophysical warming due to urbanization in BTH, indicating that increasing green space could alleviate warming effects, especially in summer.  aPublisher supplied data  aQYZDB-SSW-DQC005cKey Research Program of Frontier Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences  a41501484cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41671425cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41701501cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aair temperature 3aclimate 3agreen infrastructure 3aheat 3aland cover 3alatent heat 3aleaf area index 3askin temperature 3asummer 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aweather research and forecasting model 3awinter 3aChina1 aDong, Jinwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5687-803X1 aCui, Yaoping1 aLiu, Jiyuan1 aZhai, Jun1 aHe, Tian1 aZhou, Yuyu1 aXiao, X.q(Xiangming),0 tClimate dynamics.g2019 Jan., v. 52, no. 1-2 p.1231-1245dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4189-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245013000208500001900338520138600357592002801743650001601771650001201787650001101799650001401810650000901824650001301833650001101846651001001857653001701867653001401884653001201898653001001910653001201920653001201932653001201944653001901956653001901975700002201994700002202016700001802038700002702056700005602083773011002139856008502249852000902334655001202343IND60730707720221122010213.0210428e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073070772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1169192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamas, J.Pablo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6104-403710aGymnodimine A in mollusks from the north Atlantic Coast of Spain: Prevalence, concentration, and relationship with spirolides  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGymnodimine A has been found in mollusks obtained along the whole northern coast of Spain from April 2017 to December 2019. This is the first time that this toxin is detected in mollusks from the Atlantic coast of Europe. The prevalence of the toxin was, in general, low, being detected on average in approximately 6% of the obtained samples (122 out of 1900). The concentrations recorded were also, in general, low, with a median of 1.3 μg kg⁻¹, and a maximum value of 23.93 μg kg⁻¹. The maxima of prevalence and concentration were not geographically coincident, taking place the first at the easternmost part of the sampled area and the second at the westernmost part. In most cases (>94%), gymnodimine A and 13-desmethyl spirolide C were concurrently detected, suggesting that Alexandrium ostenfeldii could be the responsible producer species. The existence of cases in which gymnodimine A was detected alone suggests also that a Karenia species could also be involved. The geographical heterogeneity of the distribution suggests that blooms of the producer species are mostly local. Not all bivalves are equally affected, clams being less affected than mussels, oysters, and razor clams. Due to their relatively low toxicity, and their low prevalence and concentration, it seems that these toxins do not pose an important risk for the mollusk consumers in the area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlexandrium 3aKarenia 3acoasts 3apollution 3arisk 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3aSpain 0aGymnodimines 0aShellfish 0aMussels 0aClams 0aOysters 0aCockles 0aGalicia 0aAtlantic ocean 0aCantabrian sea1 aArévalo, Fabiola1 aMoroño, Ángeles1 aCorrea, Jorge1 aRossignoli, Araceli E.1 aBlanco, Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2123-77470 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 June 15, v. 279 p.116919-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1169193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02267naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245015800159300001600317520097700333592002801310650001601338650001701354650001001371650001101381650001201392650001401404650000701418650001301425650001301438650001501451653002601466653002601492653002101518653002201539653001501561700001801576700001701594700002201611773011601633856007501749852000901824655001201833IND60568267920221120222146.0170503e20130104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056826792DNAL7 a10.1021/pr300758c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaurer, Andreas12aA Periodate-Cleavable Linker for Functional Proteomics under Slightly Acidic Conditions: Application for the Analysis of Intracellular Aspartic Proteases  ap. 199-207.  aSpecific elution of captured proteins greatly improves the quality of proteomic data obtained from pull-downs by avoiding signals from nonspecific proteins, thus allowing more sensitive identification of target proteins. This is important in activity-based proteomics or drug target identification. However, commonly used chemically cleavable linkers can only be cleaved at close to neutral pH, which prevents them from being used for proteins binding only at lower pH when no cross-linking is applied. On the other hand, elution of common acid-cleavable labels can also coelute proteins bound by ionic interactions. Here, we report the synthesis and application of a label readily cleavable by mild oxidation at moderately acidic pH for the noncovalent labeling and pull-down of intracellular aspartic proteases. Using specific release, target proteins cathepsin D and napsin A were identified from human kidney with much higher confidence and without any nontarget hits.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathepsin D 3acrosslinking 3adrugs 3ahumans 3akidneys 3aoxidation 3apH 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 0aactivity-based probes 0aaffinity purification 0acleavable linker 0amass spectrometry 0aproteomics1 aZeyher, Claus1 aAmin, Bushra1 aKalbacher, Hubert0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2013 Jan. 04, v. 12, no. 1 p.199-207dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fpr300758c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245012000157300002000277520134600297592002801643650001501671650001101686650001401697650002301711650001101734650002301745650001101768650001201779650001001791650002801801650002001829650001401849700001501863700001701878700001301895700001601908700001401924700005301938773014901991856007602140852000902216655001202225IND60622012320221122112558.0181123e20181016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062201232DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b092512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yanjun10aCopper(II)-Catalyzed Asymmetric Photoredox Reactions: Enantioselective Alkylation of Imines Driven by Visible Light  ap. 15850-15858.  aAsymmetric photoredox catalysis offers exciting opportunities to develop new synthetic approaches to chiral molecules through novel reaction pathways. Employing the first-row transition metal complexes as the chiral photoredox catalysts remains, however, a formidable challenge, although these complexes are economic, environmentally friendly, and often exhibit special reactivities. We report in this Article the development of one class of highly efficient asymmetric/photoredox bifunctional catalysts based on the copper(II) bisoxazoline complexes (Cuᴵᴵ–BOX) for the light-induced enantioselective alkylation of imines. The reactions proceed under very mild conditions and without a need for any other photosensitizer. The simple catalytic system and readily tunable chiral ligands enable a significantly high level of enantioselectivity for the formation of chiral amine products bearing a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter (36 examples, up to 98% ee). Overall, the Cuᴵᴵ–BOX catalysts initiate the radical generation, and also govern the subsequent stereoselective transformations. This strategy utilizing chiral complexes comprised of a first-row transition metal and a flexible chiral ligand as the asymmetric photoredox catalysts provides an effective platform for the development of green asymmetric synthetic methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3aenantioselectivity 3aimines 3aligands 3alight 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aredox reactions 3asynthesis1 aZhou, Kexu1 aWen, Zhaorui1 aCao, Shi1 aShen, Xiang1 aLei, Meng1 aGong, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4478-68800 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Oct. 16, v. 140, no. 46 p.15850-15858dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b092513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03347naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245013700175300001600312520161500328592002801943650002501971650001801996650001902014650001902033650001102052650001302063650002002076650001602096650001102112650000902123650001402132650002202146650001402168650002202182650001802204650001102222650001402233650001102247650002202258650001902280653003102299653003402330653002002364653002702384653002502411700001502436700002102451700002402472700005802496700002602554773009102580856008902671852000902760655001202769IND60609806120221118052605.0180824e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060980612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.11.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarkas, Júlia,10aCharacterisation of fine-grained tailings from a marble processing plant and their acute effects on the copepod Calanus finmarchicus  ap. 700-708.  aSubmarine tailing disposal (STD) of mining waste is practiced as an alternative to land fill disposal in several countries. Knowledge regarding the environmental implications of STD on fjord and other marine ecosystems, including the pelagic environment, is scarce. In this study, we characterised the particle shape, size and metal content of the fine-grained fraction of tailings (FGT) from a Norwegian marble processing plant and investigated their acute toxicity and impact on feeding rate in adult Calanus finmarchicus. Initial tailing dispersions with a concentration of 1 mg mL⁻¹ contained approximately 72 million particles, with 62% of particles between 0.6 and 1 μm in size. After a sedimentation time of 1 h, 69% of the particles between 0.6 and 5 μm remained dispersed, decreasing to 22% after 6 h. When subjected to low energy turbulence in exposure experiments, the formation of fragile agglomerates was observed. The FGT contained Al, Mn, Fe and Ni, with no detectable dissolution occurring during the 48 h exposure period. Acute exposure (up to 5 g L⁻¹) to FGT caused no mortality in C. finmarchicus. Similarly, feeding rates determined during a 40 h depuration period, were not significantly impacted. However, surface attachment and uptake of FGT into the digestive tract of the copepods was observed. This indicates that, whilst marble FGT are not acutely toxic to copepods, chronic effects such as impacts on organism's energy budgets could occur, highlighting the need for further research on potential sublethal effects in organisms exposed to fine inorganic particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalanus finmarchicus 3aacute effects 3aacute exposure 3aacute toxicity 3aadults 3aaluminum 3adigestive tract 3adispersions 3aenergy 3airon 3alandfills 3along term effects 3amanganese 3amarine ecosystems 3amine tailings 3amining 3amortality 3anickel 3asublethal effects 3aturbulent flow 0aSubmarine tailing disposal 0aFine-grained tailing fraction 0aSmall particles 0aPelagic filter feeders 0aCalanus finmarchicus1 aAltin, Dag1 aHammer, Karen M.1 aHellstrøm, Kaja C.1 aBooth, Andy M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4702-22101 aHansen, Bjørn Henrik0 tChemosphere.g2017 Feb., v. 169 p.700-708dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.11.1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245017700161300001800338500001900356520096100375592002801336650001501364650003601379650001401415650002301429650001701452650001301469650001401482650001101496650001701507650001801524653001601542653002001558653002801578653001601606653002201622700002501644700005901669700005801728700001701786700005801803700006201861773013901923856007802062852000902140655001202149IND60726268520210831000000.0210203e20210125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072626852DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c204902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahin, Yesim10aPrecious Metal-Free LaMnO₃ Perovskite Catalyst with an Optimized Nanostructure for Aerobic C–H Bond Activation Reactions: Alkylarene Oxidation and Naphthol Dimerization  ap. 5099-5110.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this article, we describe the development of a new aerobic C–H oxidation methodology catalyzed by a precious metal-free LaMnO₃ perovskite catalyst. Molecular oxygen is used as the sole oxidant in this approach, obviating the need for other expensive and/or environmentally hazardous stoichiometric oxidants. The electronic and structural properties of the LaMnO₃ catalysts were systematically optimized, and a reductive pretreatment protocol was proved to be essential for acquiring the observed high catalytic activities. It is demonstrated that this newly developed method was extremely effective for the oxidation of alkylarenes to ketones as well as for the oxidative dimerization of 2-naphthol to 1,1-binaphthyl-2,2-diol (BINOL), a particularly important scaffold for asymmetric catalysis. Detailed spectroscopic and mechanistic studies provided valuable insights into the structural aspects of the active catalyst and the reaction mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-naphthol 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adimerization 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aspectroscopy 3astoichiometry 0aalkylarenes 0aC−H oxidation 0aheterogeneous catalysis 0aperovskites 0asurface chemistry1 aSika-Nartey, Abel T.1 aErcan, Kerem E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4650-79771 aKoçak, Yusuf,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4511-13211 aSenol, Sinem1 aOzensoy, Emrah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4352-38241 aTürkmen, Yunus E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9797-28200 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Jan. 25, v. 13, no. 4 p.5099-5110dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c204903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245008200155300002000237520124000257592002801497650002301525650002501548650002401573650001201597650001601609700001301625700001901638700001701657700001501674700001701689700001801706700005901724700001201783700005601795700005401851773014901905856007602054852000902130655001202139IND60622012420221122190534.0181123e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062201242DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b092772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yu10aDNA-Encoded Dynamic Chemical Library and Its Applications in Ligand Discovery  ap. 15859-15867.  aDynamic combinatorial library (DCL) has emerged as an efficient tool for ligand discovery and become an important discovery modality in biomedical research. However, the applications of DCLs have been significantly hampered by low library diversity and limited analytical methods capable of processing large libraries. Here, we report a strategy that has addressed this limitation and can select cooperatively binding small-molecule pairs from large-scale dynamic libraries. Our approach is based on DNA-mediated dynamic hybridization, DNA-encoding, and a photo-cross-linking-based decoding scheme. To demonstrate the generality and performance of this approach, a 10 000-member DNA-encoded dynamic library has been prepared and selected against six protein targets. Specific binders have been identified for each target, and we have validated the biological activities of selected ligands for the targets that are implicated in important cellular functions including protein deacetylation and sumoylation. Notably, a series of novel and selective sirtuin-3 inhibitors have been developed. Our study has circumvented a major obstacle in DCL and may provide a broadly applicable method for ligand discovery against biological targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abioactive properties 3abiomedical research 3aligands 3asumoylation1 aLi, Chen1 aPeng, Jianzhao1 aXie, Liangxu1 aMeng, Ling1 aLi, Qingrong1 aZhang, Jianfu1 aLi, Xiang David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2797-41341 aLi, Xin1 aHuang, Xuhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7119-93581 aLi, Xiaoyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8907-67270 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 140, no. 46 p.15859-15867dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b092773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008900166300001600255520153200271592002801803650001601831650001301847650002601860650000901886650002201895650001201917650002701929650001301956650001501969650001101984700001701995700002102012700001802033700002002051700001802071773012602089856008102215852000902296655001202305IND60439456720221120124710.0151024e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043945672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-006-9123-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamirez, Oscar10aGenetic assessment of the Iberian wolf Canis lupus signatus captive breeding program  ap. 861-878.  aThe main goal of ex situ conservation programs is to improve the chances of long term survival of natural populations by founding and managing captive colonies that can serve as a source of individuals for future reintroductions or to reinforce existing populations. The degree in which a captive breeding program has captured the genetic diversity existing in the source wild population has seldom been evaluated. In this study we evaluate the genetic diversity in wild and captive populations of the Iberian wolf, Canis lupus signatus, in order to assess how much genetic diversity is being preserved in the ongoing ex situ conservation program for this subspecies. A sample of domestic dogs was also included in the analysis for comparison. Seventy-four wolves and 135 dogs were genotyped at 13 unlinked microsatellite loci. The results show that genetic diversity in Iberian wolves is comparable in magnitude to that of other wild populations of gray wolf. Both the wild and the captive Iberian wolf populations have a similarly high genetic diversity indicating that no substantial loss of diversity has occurred in the captive-breeding program. The effective number of founders of the program was estimated as ∼ ∼16, suggesting that all founders in the studbook pedigree were genetically independent. Our results emphasize also the genetic divergence between wolves and domestic dogs and indicate that our set of 13 microsatellite loci provide a powerful diagnostic test to distinguish wolves, dogs and their hybrids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis lupus 3abreeding 3aconservation programs 3adogs 3agenetic variation 3ahybrids 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apedigree 3apopulation 3awolves1 aAltet, Laura1 aEnseñat, Conrad1 aVilà, Carles1 aSanchez, Armand1 aRuiz, Alfredo0 tConservation genetics.g2006 Dec., v. 7, no. 6 p.861-878dKluwer Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl3870040x1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-006-9123-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245014900158300001600307520152000323592002801843650001501871650002001886650001401906650002701920650001301947650002901960650001301989650001502002650002302017650002902040653003702069653002902106653002202135700002002157700001602177700001702193700001602210700001602226773011602242856007502358852000902433655001202442IND60568268120221120211851.0170503e20130104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056826812DNAL7 a10.1021/pr300781t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Chuan-Le10aBinomial Probability Distribution Model-Based Protein Identification Algorithm for Tandem Mass Spectrometry Utilizing Peak Intensity Information  ap. 328-335.  aMass spectrometry has become one of the most important technologies in proteomic analysis. Tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is a major tool for the analysis of peptide mixtures from protein samples. The key step of MS data processing is the identification of peptides from experimental spectra by searching public sequence databases. Although a number of algorithms to identify peptides from MS/MS data have been already proposed, e.g. Sequest, OMSSA, X!Tandem, Mascot, etc., they are mainly based on statistical models considering only peak-matches between experimental and theoretical spectra, but not peak intensity information. Moreover, different algorithms gave different results from the same MS data, implying their probable incompleteness and questionable reproducibility. We developed a novel peptide identification algorithm, ProVerB, based on a binomial probability distribution model of protein tandem mass spectrometry combined with a new scoring function, making full use of peak intensity information and, thus, enhancing the ability of identification. Compared with Mascot, Sequest, and SQID, ProVerB identified significantly more peptides from LC-MS/MS data sets than the current algorithms at 1% False Discovery Rate (FDR) and provided more confident peptide identifications. ProVerB is also compatible with various platforms and experimental data sets, showing its robustness and versatility.

In 2008, pellet groups were sampled in strip-transects during the dry season to estimate population density in five locations. Habitat variables (physical, vegetation, and human) were obtained during field sampling and through the use of geographic information systems. Principal component analysis and stepwise multiple regression were used to analyze the habitat-density relationships. The mean population density of white-tailed deer for the region was 6.7 ind/km²; however, this varied significantly among sites (1.9–11.3 ind/km²). Higher densities were found in sites with lower human activity, irregular topography, dense understory cover, and well-developed tree strata. In contrast, sites with lower deer density presented high human activities such as livestock and crop production, which act to modify the tropical dry forest. We discuss the management and conservation implications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aconservation areas 3acrop production 3adeer 3adry forests 3adry season 3ageographic information systems 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3apopulation density 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3atopography 3atrees 3aunderstory 3aMexico 0adensity 0ahabitat 0ahuman activities 0amanagement 0apellet group count1 aYañez-Arenas, Carlos A.1 aGonzález-Zamora, Arturo1 aPérez-Arteaga, Alejandro0 tMammalia.g2013 Mar. 05, v. 77, no. 4 p.381-389dDe Gruyterx1864-15477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mammalia-2012-00383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01919naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245004700178300001800225520072800243592002800971650000900999650002501008650001701033650001301050650001201063650002101075650001301096650001301109650001601122653000901138653001601147653002201163653002101185653001901206653002001225700002201245700003201267773010301299856008601402852000901488655001201497IND50072243020221118041551.0190402e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007224302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2013.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCzerwonka, Małgorzata10aVitamin B12 content in raw and cooked beef  ap. 1371-1375.  aThe aim of this work was to evaluate the vitamin B12 content and profile of cobalamin bioactive forms in raw and cooked beef. The study showed that vitamin B12 distribution is unequal among beef muscles. The content of this nutrient ranges from 0.7 to 1.5μg/100g of tissue. In beef, three biologically active forms of vitamin B12 were determined, i.e.: methylcobalamin, adenosylcobalamin and hydroxycobalamin; the dominating form of vitamin B12 was adenosylcobalamin (68% of total cobalamins). The process of roasting and grilling had little effect on the vitamin B12 content in the final product as compared to the raw meat. The fried product was characterised by about a 32% lower content of cobalamins than in raw meat.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3abioactive properties 3acooked foods 3agrilling 3amuscles 3anutrient content 3araw meat 3aroasting 3avitamin B12 0aBeef 0aVitamin B12 0aAdenosylcobalamin 0aHydroxycobalamin 0aCyanocobalamin 0aMethylcobalamin1 aSzterk, Arkadiusz1 aWaszkiewicz-Robak, Bożena,0 tMeat science.g2014 Mar., v. 96, no. 3 p.1371-1375dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2013.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245011300206300002000319506007600339520141900415592002801834506003701862650002001899650001201919650001001931650002201941650001501963650001101978650001101989650002502000650002202025651001802047700002702065700002002092700001502112773017702127856008302304852000902387655001202396IND4481607820221207082041.0120502e20110913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448160782DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11004731082doi7 aPMC31745932pmcid7 a218761262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPringle, James M.10aAsymmetric dispersal allows an upstream region to control population structure throughout a species’ range  ap. 15288-15293.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn a single well-mixed population, equally abundant neutral alleles are equally likely to persist. However, in spatially complex populations structured by an asymmetric dispersal mechanism, such as a coastal population where larvae are predominantly moved downstream by currents, the eventual frequency of neutral haplotypes will depend on their initial spatial location. In our study of the progression of two spatially separate, genetically distinct introductions of the European green crab (Carcinus maenas) along the coast of eastern North America, we captured this process in action. We documented the shift of the genetic cline in this species over 8 y, and here we detail how the upstream haplotypes are beginning to dominate the system. This quantification of an evolving genetic boundary in a coastal system demonstrates that novel genetic alleles or haplotypes that arise or are introduced into upstream retention zones (regions whose export of larvae is not balanced by import from elsewhere) will increase in frequency in the entire system. This phenomenon should be widespread when there is asymmetrical dispersal, in the oceans or on land, suggesting that the upstream edge of a species’ range can influence genetic diversity throughout its distribution. Efforts to protect the upstream edge of an asymmetrically dispersing species’ range are vital to conserving genetic diversity in the species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCarcinus maenas 3aalleles 3acrabs 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3alarvae 3aoceans 3apopulation structure 3aspecies diversity 3aNorth America1 aBlakeslee, April M.

Comparative study of six methods of protein extraction for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of proteomic profiling in poplar stems. Can. J. Plant Sci. 93: 895–901. Protein extraction is a crucial step in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis of proteins, since it can have significant impact on both the quantity and the quality of protein detection. The present study is a comparison between six previously published protocols of protein extraction (A, B, C, D, E, and F) aiming to determine a suitable method to extract total proteins from poplar stems, a recalcitrant plant tissue. The obtained results revealed that method F (optimized method B), combining detergents (CHAPS, Triton X-100, and low sodium dodecyl sulfate amounts) and chaotropes (thiourea and urea), gave the best solution for the problem of protein solubilization. Method F enabled the detection of more than 300 spots reproducible on the 2-DE gel with pH 4–7 immobilized pH gradient strips and 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using silver staining. Our results suggest that Method F is expected to have excellent applications in proteomic studies of poplar stems.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetergents 3agels 3aoctoxynol 3apH 3aplant tissues 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3arecalcitrant species 3asilver staining 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asolubilization 3astems 3athiourea 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3aurea 0aChaotropes 0adetergents 0atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 0aproteomic 0apoplar1 aEnnajah, Amel1 aJing, Mai0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2013 Sept., v. 93, no. 5 p.895-901dAgricultural Institute of Canadax1918-18337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjps2013-1133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245006800179300001300247520122500260592002801485650001601513650001401529650001401543650002001557650003101577650001001608650001801618650002401636650002401660650002201684650002701706653000901733653000901742653000801751653000901759653000801768653000801776653000801784653000901792653001101801653000801812653002201820653003401842653003201876653001101908653001601919653002501935700001601960700002201976773010201998856008702100852000902187655001202196IND60541217520221119214413.0190318e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054121752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2013.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Arnim, Albrecht G.10aRegulation of plant translation by upstream open reading frames  ap. 1-12.  aWe review the evidence that upstream open reading frames (uORFs) function as RNA sequence elements for post-transcriptional control of gene expression, specifically translation. uORFs are highly abundant in the genomes of angiosperms. Their negative effect on translation is often attenuated by ribosomal translation reinitiation, a process whose molecular biochemistry is still being investigated. Certain uORFs render translation responsive to small molecules, thus offering a path for metabolic control of gene expression in evolution and synthetic biology. In some cases, uORFs form modular logic gates in signal transduction. uORFs thus provide eukaryotes with a functionality analogous to, or comparable to, riboswitches and attenuators in prokaryotes. uORFs exist in many genes regulating development and point toward translational control of development. While many uORFs appear to be poorly conserved, and the number of genes with conserved-peptide uORFs is modest, many mRNAs have a conserved pattern of uORFs. Evolutionarily, the gain and loss of uORFs may be a widespread mechanism that diversifies gene expression patterns. Last but not least, this review includes a dedicated uORF database for Arabidopsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3adatabases 3aevolution 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3aopen reading frames 3asignal transduction 3asynthetic biology 3atranslation (genetics) 0aAGI# 0aCaMV 0aeIF 0amORF 0aNMD 0aRPL 0aRPS 0auORF 0aCPuORF 0aUTR 0aProtein synthesis 0aTranslation initiation factor 0aUpstream open reading frame 0aSensor 0aDevelopment 0aArabidopsis thaliana1 aJia, Qidong1 aVaughn, Justin N.0 tPlant science.g2014 Jan., v. 214 p.1-12dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2013.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245012000163300001600283500001400299520120900313592002801522650001801550650001801568650001201586650002501598650002401623650002001647650002601667653002401693653001101717653001901728700002101747700002301768700002301791700001901814773018201833856007402015852000902089655001202098IND60692056420221120101504.0200502e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069205642DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.68.7052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMITSUHASHI, Wataru10aSequential Development of Cysteine Proteinase Activities and Gene Expression during Somatic Embryogenesis in Carrot  ap. 705-713.  aNAL-light  aThree bands of proteinase activity (Rf values of 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7) were detected on activity-stained gels after native gel electrophoresis of carrot (Daucus carota L. cv US-Harumakigosun) suspension cells. After the induction of somatic embryogenesis, one activity band (0.7 band) rapidly disappeared; the 0.6 band was absent at the heart-shaped embryo stage. However, the intensity of the 0.5 band increased during embryogenesis. An additional band (0.25 band) appeared after the torpedo-shaped stage. Three bands (0.25, 0.5, and 0.6) were also detected in zygotic seeds. Two activity bands (0.5 and 0.6) were classified as cysteine proteinases based on sensitivities to N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) or L-3-trans-Carboxyoxirane-2-Carbonyl-L-Leucyl-Agmatine (E-64). To find candidate genes for the cysteine proteinases, we cloned seven cDNAs encoding putative cysteine proteinases from suspension cells and developing somatic embryos. The expression patterns of the seven genes were categorized into three types (Type A, mRNAs increase concomitantly with somatic embryogenesis; Type B, mRNAs decrease quickly in organized cells; Type C, no significant change in transcript level during somatic embryogenesis).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaucus carota 3abiotechnology 3acarrots 3acysteine proteinases 3agel electrophoresis 3agene expression 3asomatic embryogenesis 0acysteine proteinase 0acarrot 0asomatic embryo1 aYAMASHITA, Taroh1 aTOYOMASU, Tomonobu1 aKASHIWAGI, Yoshiko1 aKONNAI, Tomoko0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2004 Jan. 1, v. 68, no. 3 p.705-713dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.68.7053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01412naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007500158300001600233500001400249520018900263592002800452650001700480650001800497650001600515650002200531653001700553653002100570653003800591653003000629653002500659700001900684700002000703700002000723700001800743773018200761856007400943852000901017655001201026IND60692056520221120122602.0200502e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069205652DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.68.7142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLEE, Jin Hwan10aSynthesis of All Four Stereoisomers of 3-Amino-2-hydroxybutanoic Acids  ap. 714-720.  aNAL-light  aAll four stereoisomers of 3-amino-2-hydroxybutanoic acids were been obtained as single enantiomers via stereospecific reactions from D-gulonic acid γ-lactone and D-glucono-δ-lactone.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemistry 3abiotechnology 3aenantiomers 3astereospecificity 0aisothreonine 0aalloisothreonine 0asimultaneous dealkoxyhalogenation 0aD-gulonic acid γ-lactone 0aD-glucono-δ-lactone1 aYang, Min-suk,1 aKANG, Kuy Young1 aMOON, Yea Hwang1 aPark, Ki Hun,0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2004 Jan. 1, v. 68, no. 3 p.714-720dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.68.7143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245015500160300001800315520196800333592002802301650003002329650002202359650001102381650001702392650002102409650001502430650002202445650003702467650001302504700001102517700001602528700001602544700001802560700001702578700001802595700005702613700005802670700005302728773014702781856007602928852000903004655001203013IND60603309220221121003325.0180713e20180228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060330922DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b130692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Jinqiao10aConfinement of Aggregation-Induced Emission Molecular Rotors in Ultrathin Two-Dimensional Porous Organic Nanosheets for Enhanced Molecular Recognition  ap. 4035-4046.  aDespite the rapid development of molecular rotors over the past decade, it still remains a huge challenge to understand their confined behavior in ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials for molecular recognition. Here, we report an all-carbon, 2D π-conjugated aromatic polymer, named NUS-25, containing flexible tetraphenylethylene (TPE) units as aggregation-induced emission (AIE) molecular rotors. NUS-25 bulk powder can be easily exfoliated into micrometer-sized lamellar freestanding nanosheets with a thickness of 2–5 nm. The dynamic behavior of the TPE rotors is partially restricted through noncovalent interactions in the ultrathin 2D nanosheets, which is proved by comparative experimental studies including AIE characteristics, size-selective molecular recognition, and theoretical calculations of rotary energy barrier. Because of the partially restricted TPE rotors, NUS-25 nanosheets are highly fluorescent. This property allows NUS-25 nanosheets to be used as a chemical sensor for the specific detection of acenaphthylene among a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) via fluorescent quenching mechanism. Further investigations show that NUS-25 nanosheets have much higher sensitivity and selectivity than their stacked bulk powder and other similar polymers containing dynamic TPE rotors. The highly efficient molecular recognition can be attributed to the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from NUS-25 nanosheets to acenaphthylene, which is investigated by time-resolved photoluminescence measurements (TRPL), excitation and emission spectra, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our findings demonstrate that confinement of AIE molecular rotors in 2D nanomaterials can enhance the molecular recognition. We anticipate that the material design strategy demonstrated in this study will inspire the development of other ultrathin 2D nanomaterials equipped with smart molecular machines for various applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3amolecular rotors 3ananosheets 3aphotoluminescence 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apolymers1 aLi, Xu1 aZhang, Kang1 aDi Yuan, Yi1 aWang, Yuxiang1 aZhai, Linzhi1 aLiu, Guoliang1 aYuan, Daqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4627-072X1 aJiang, Jianwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1310-90241 aZhao, Dan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4427-21500 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Feb. 28, v. 140, no. 11 p.4035-4046dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b130693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02166naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245008500157300001800242520111700260592002801377650001801405650001901423650001601442700005401458700001901512700001601531700005701547700001601604773014701620856007601767852000901843655001201852IND60603309320221120233208.0180713e20180308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060330932DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b132292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chong10aAll-Inorganic CsPbI2Br Perovskite Solar Cells with High Efficiency Exceeding 13%  ap. 3825-3828.  aAll-inorganic perovskite solar cells provide a promising solution to tackle the thermal instability problem of organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed an all-inorganic perovskite solar cell with novel structure (FTO/NiOₓ/CsPbI₂Br/ZnO@C₆₀/Ag), in which ZnO@C₆₀ bilayer was utilized as the electron-transporting layers that demonstrated high carrier extraction efficiency and low leakage loss. Consequently, the as-fabricated all-inorganic CsPbI₂Br perovskite solar cell yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 13.3% with a Vₒc of 1.14 V, Jₛc of 15.2 mA·cm–², and FF of 0.77. The corresponding stabilized power output (SPO) of the device was demonstrated to be ∼12% and remarkably stable within 1000 s. Importantly, the obtained all-inorganic PSCs without encapsulation exhibited only 20% PCE loss with thermal treatment at 85 °C for 360 h, which largely outperformed the organic-species-containing PSCs. The present study demonstrates potential in overcoming the intractable issue concerning the thermal instability of perovskite solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aencapsulation 3aheat treatment 3asolar cells1 aLi, Wenzhe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7231-76861 aZhang, Cuiling1 aMa, Yunping1 aFan, Jiandong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8728-63331 aMai, Yaohua0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Mar. 08, v. 140, no. 11 p.3825-3828dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b132293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03709naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245012100157300001800278500002000296520181400316592002802130596009302158596010302251596006702354596006902421650002402490650002102514650001802535650001002553650001202563650001902575650001302594650001102607650002402618650001602642650001002658650002002668650001702688650002902705700001702734700001902751700001402770700005702784700002002841700005202861700005902913773012702972856007103099852000903170655001203179IND60747117320221121091524.0210811e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074711732DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.64192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Rui‐Lin10aRNA interference of Argonaute‐1 delays ovarian development in the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel)  ap. 3921-3933.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: With the development of rapid resistance, new modes of action for pesticides are needed for insect control, such as RNAi‐based biopesticides targeting essential genes. To explore the function of Argonaute‐1 (Ago‐1) and potential miRNAs in ovarian development of Bactrocera dorsalis, an important agricultural pest, and to develop a novel control strategy for the pest, BdAgo‐1 was first identified in B. dorsalis. RESULTS: Spatiotemporal expression analysis indicated that BdAgo‐1 had a relatively high transcriptional level in the ovarian tissues of adult female B. dorsalis during the sexual maturation period. RNA interference (RNAi) experiment showed that BdAgo‐1 knockdown significantly decreased the expression levels of ovarian development‐related genes and delayed ovarian development. Although RNAi‐mediated silencing of Ago‐1 led to a reduced ovary surface area, a subsequent oviposition assay revealed that the influence was minimal over a longer time period. Small RNA libraries were constructed and sequenced from different ovarian developmental stages of B. dorsalis adults. Among 161 identified miRNAs, 84 miRNAs were differentially expressed during the three developmental stages of the B. dorsalis ovary. BdAgo‐1 silencing caused significant down‐regulation of seven differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) showing relatively high expression levels (>1000 TPM (Transcripts per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads)). The expression patterns of these seven core DEMs and their putative target genes were analyzed in the ovaries of B. dorsalis. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that Ago‐1 and Ago‐1‐dependent miRNAs are indispensable for normal ovarian development in B. dorsalis and help identify miRNA targets useful for control of this pest.  aPublisher supplied data  acstc2018jcyjAX0285cChongqing Research Program of Basic Research and Frontier Technology  aCARS‐26cearmarked fund for the Modern Agroindustry (Citrus) Technology Research System of China  aB18044cHigher Education Discipline Innovation Project Project  a32072422; 31872031cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aBactrocera dorsalis 3aRNA interference 3abiopesticides 3aexons 3afemales 3ainsect control 3amicroRNA 3amodels 3aovarian development 3aoviposition 3apests 3asexual maturity 3asurface area 3atranscription (genetics)1 aZhang, Qiang1 aFan, Jia‐Yao1 aYue, Yong1 aChen, Er‐Hu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7817-64821 aYuan, Guo‐Rui1 aDou, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9678-54251 aWang, Jin‐Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8777-52680 tPest management science.g2021 Sept., v. 77, no. 9 p.3921-3933dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.64193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001800162245014100180300001800321520104400339592002801383650003601411650002301447650001401470650001501484650001601499650001401515650002401529650001701553650001101570650003001581650001101611650001401622650001601636650001601652650001801668650001901686650002201705650002901727650003101756650002501787650004801812650002501860650002501885650004001910650004101950650005601991650001802047650002302065650003902088650004402127650003502171650002802206650004202234700001502276700001502291700002002306700001402326700001802340700001402358773009902372856004402471852000902515655001202524IND50089455020221121040726.0140520e199912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008945502DNAL7 a106644002pmid7 a10.1007/s0070500506602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshikawa, N.10aApple chlorotic leaf spot virus 50 kDa protein is targeted to plasmodesmata and accumulates in sieve elements in transgenic plant leaves  ap. 2475-2483.  aWe investigated the in situ localization of the 50 kDa protein encoded by ORF2 of Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV) genome which is thought to be a movement protein. In immunogold electron microscopy of ACLSV-infected Chenopodium quinoa leaves, the 50 kDa protein was localized on plasmodesmata and nearby cytoplasm. Observation of transgenic Nicotiana occidentalis leaves expressing the 50 kDa protein fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) by fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopes revealed that green fluorescence was observed as spots on the cell wall or strands passing through the cell wall of several cell types, i.e., epidermal, palisade and spongy mesophyll and collenchyma cells. In transverse and longitudinal sections of leaf veins of transgenic plants showed that the 50K-EGFP fusion accumulated in sieve elements and formed an extensive interconnecting network of threadlike structure. These results indicated that ACLSV 50 kDa protein can target plasmodesmata and traffic into sieve elements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApple chlorotic leaf spot virus 3aChenopodium quinoa 3aNicotiana 3acell walls 3acollenchyma 3acytoplasm 3aelectron microscopy 3afluorescence 3agenome 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aleaves 3amesophyll 3amicroscopes 3aplant veins 3aplasmodesmata 3asieve elements 3atransgenic plants 2aChenopodiaceaexvirology 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteins 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aLuminescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxvirology. 2aPlant Virusesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxmetabolismxvirology. 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aRNA Virusesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aViral Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aOogake, S.1 aTerada, M.1 aMiyabayashi, S.1 aIkeda, Y.1 aTakahashi, T.1 aOgawa, K.0 tArchives of virology.g1999 Dec., v. 144, no. 12 p.2475-2483dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s007050050660  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245004700164300001800211520100300229592002801232650001601260650002101276650002001297650002501317650002001342650001201362650001401374650002001388650001501408650001601423650001101439650001201450650001501462650000901477650001101486650001201497650001001509650001701519651001301536653001901549653001401568653002301582700002001605700002201625773012701647856007601774852000901850655001201859IND60517143820221122044635.0160328e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051714382DNAL7 a10.4141/cjps2013-0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavalieri, Andrea10aResidual weeds in winter wheat in Manitoba  ap. 1195-1200.  aCavalieri, A., Lewis, D.

Winter wheat production has increased from a few thousand to several hundred thousand acres in Manitoba over the past decade. In the summer of 2009, a mid-season weed survey was conducted to establish a benchmark of the residual weed community in winter wheat in three ecoregions in Manitoba. Field histories and herbicide management practices were also recorded for all 84 fields surveyed. Traditionally important weeds in other field crops such as green foxtail [Setaria viridis (L.) Beauv.], wild oats (Avena fatua L.) and wild buckwheat (Polygonum convolvulus L.) were also the most abundant weeds in winter wheat. A species never observed in production fields, waterpod [Ellisia nyctelea (L.) L.] was documented. Neither Japanese brome grass (Bromus japonicum L.) nor downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.), winter annuals often prevalent in winter wheat, were found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena fatua 3aBromus japonicus 3aBromus tectorum 3aFallopia convolvulus 3aSetaria viridis 3aannuals 3abuckwheat 3acrop production 3aecoregions 3afield crops 3afields 3agrasses 3aherbicides 3aoats 3asummer 3asurveys 3aweeds 3awinter wheat 3aManitoba 0aWeed community 0aecoregion 0arelative abundance1 aLewis, Derek W.1 aGulden, Robert H.0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2013 Nov., v. 93, no. 6 p.1195-1200dAgricultural Institute of Canadax1918-18337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjps2013-0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245014700161300001600308500002000324520123300344592002801577596007201605650003001677650001301707650001701720650001201737650002201749650001401771650002301785650001101808650001401819650000701833700002001840700001801860700001901878700005701897773011601954856007802070852000902148655001202157IND60693222120221122032507.0200505e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069322212DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2019004432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanf, Lenard10aMn2+ or Mn3+? Investigating transition metal dissolution of manganese species in lithium ion battery electrolytes by capillary electrophoresis  ap. 697-704.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA new CE method with ultraviolet–visible detection was developed in this study to investigate manganese dissolution in lithium ion battery electrolytes. The aqueous running buffer based on diphosphate showed excellent stabilization of labile Mn³⁺, even under electrophoretic conditions. The method was optimized regarding the concentration of diphosphate and modifier to obtain suitable signals for quantification. Additionally, the finally obtained method was applied on carbonate‐based electrolytes samples. Dissolution experiments of the cathode material LiNi₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄ (lithium nickel manganese oxide [LNMO]) in aqueous diphosphate buffer at defined pH were performed to investigate the effect of a transition metal‐ion‐scavenger on the oxidation state of dissolved manganese. Quantification of both Mn species revealed the formation of mainly Mn³⁺, which can be attributed to a comproportionation reaction of dissolved and complexed Mn²⁺ with Mn⁴⁺ at the surface of the LNMO structure. It was also shown that the formation of Mn³⁺ increased with lower pH. In contrast, dissolution experiments of LNMO in carbonate‐based electrolytes containing LIPF₆ showed only dissolution of Mn²⁺.  aPublisher supplied data  a03XP0034HcGerman Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acathodes 3aelectrolytes 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amanganese 3amanganese monoxide 3anickel 3aoxidation 3apH1 aHenschel, Jonas1 aDiehl, Marcel1 aWinter, Martin1 aNowak, Sascha1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1508-60730 tElectrophoresis.g2020 May, v. 41, no. 9 p.697-704dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2019004433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03566naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245009600170300001600266520231100282592002802593650002302621650001402644650002002658650001602678650001502694650002302709650001102732650002402743650002002767650001902787650001602806651000902822653001702831653001902848653001602867653002502883653001102908700001802919773010302937856008303040852000903123655001203132IND60606544720221119233909.0180726e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060654472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2015.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZolfaghari, M.R.10aDevelopment of optimization-based probabilistic earthquake scenarios for the city of Tehran  ap. 129-145.  aThis paper presents the methodology and practical example for the application of optimization process to select earthquake scenarios which best represent probabilistic earthquake hazard in a given region. The method is based on simulation of a large dataset of potential earthquakes, representing the long-term seismotectonic characteristics in a given region. The simulation process uses Monte-Carlo simulation and regional seismogenic source parameters to generate a synthetic earthquake catalogue consisting of a large number of earthquakes, each characterized with magnitude, location, focal depth and fault characteristics. Such catalogue provides full distributions of events in time, space and size; however, demands large computation power when is used for risk assessment, particularly when other sources of uncertainties are involved in the process. To reduce the number of selected earthquake scenarios, a mixed-integer linear program formulation is developed in this study. This approach results in reduced set of optimization-based probabilistic earthquake scenario, while maintaining shape of hazard curves and full probabilistic picture by minimizing the error between hazard curves driven by full and reduced sets of synthetic earthquake scenarios. To test the model, the regional seismotectonic and seismogenic characteristics of northern Iran are used to simulate a set of 10,000-year worth of events consisting of some 84,000 earthquakes. The optimization model is then performed multiple times with various input data, taking into account probabilistic seismic hazard for Tehran city as the main constrains. The sensitivity of the selected scenarios to the user-specified site/return period error-weight is also assessed. The methodology could enhance run time process for full probabilistic earthquake studies like seismic hazard and risk assessment. The reduced set is the representative of the contributions of all possible earthquakes; however, it requires far less computation power. The authors have used this approach for risk assessment towards identification of effectiveness-profitability of risk mitigation measures, using optimization model for resource allocation. Based on the error-computation trade-off, 62-earthquake scenarios are chosen to be used for this purpose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3acomputers 3adata collection 3aearthquakes 3ageophysics 3alinear programming 3amodels 3aresource allocation 3arisk assessment 3arisk reduction 3auncertainty 3aIran 0aOptimization 0aSeismic hazard 0aMonte-Carlo 0aEarthquake scenarios 0aTehran1 aPeyghaleh, E.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2016 Jan., v. 86 p.129-145dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2015.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013400171300001300305520132100318592002801639650002601667650001301693650001701706650001601723650002301739650001801762650001801780650001901798650001401817650002001831650001301851650001501864653001001879653000801889653000801897653000801905653000801913653001501921653001001936653000901946653000801955653001001963653000801973653001601981653001001997653001202007653001902019653002502038653002802063653003502091700001802126700001802144700001502162700001802177773007002195856008502265852000902350655001202359IND60562533120221121192651.0170719e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056253312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plasmid.2016.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamensek, Urska10aTailor-made fibroblast-specific and antibiotic-free interleukin 12 plasmid for gene electrotransfer-mediated cancer immunotherapy  ap. 9-15.  aElectrotransfer mediated delivery of interleukin-12 (IL-12) gene, encoded on a plasmid vector, has already been demonstrated to have a potent antitumor efficacy and great potential for clinical application. In the present study, our aim was to construct an optimized IL-12-encoding plasmid that is safe from the regulatory point of view. In light of previous studies demonstrating that IL-12 should be released in a tumor localized manner for optimal efficacy, the strong ubiquitous promoter was replaced with a weak endogenous promoter of the collagen 2 gene, which is specific for fibroblasts. Next, to comply with increasing regulatory demands for clinically used plasmids, the expression cassette was cloned in a plasmid lacking the antibiotic resistance gene. The constructed fibroblast-specific and antibiotic-free IL-12 plasmid was demonstrated to support low IL-12 expression after gene electrotransfer in selected cell lines. Furthermore, the removal of antibiotic resistance did not affect the plasmid expression profile and lowered its cytotoxicity. With optimal IL-12 expression and minimal transgene non-specific effects, i.e., low cytotoxicity, the constructed plasmid could be especially valuable for different modern immunological approaches to achieve localized boosting of the host's immune system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3acollagen 3acytotoxicity 3afibroblasts 3agenetic resistance 3aimmune system 3aimmunotherapy 3ainterleukin-12 3aneoplasms 3aplasmid vectors 3aplasmids 3atransgenes 0aIL-12 0aGET 0aCMV 0aEMA 0aORT 0aSVEC4–10 0aHUVEC 0aL929 0aLPB 0aWI-38 0aGFP 0aEF-1α/HTLV 0aELISA 0aqRT-PCR 0aInterleukin 12 0aGene electrotransfer 0aAntibiotic-free plasmid 0aFibroblast-specific expression1 aTesic, Natasa1 aSersa, Gregor1 aKos, Spela1 aCemazar, Maja0 tPlasmid.g2017 Jan., v. 89 p.9-15dElsevier Inc.x0147-619X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plasmid.2016.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02287naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245009900165520109200264592002801356650002501384650001701409650001401426650002601440653003101466653001101497653003201508653002701540700001401567700001601581700001501597700001501612700001201627700001901639700001501658700001301673773010801686856008601794852000901880655001201889IND60730481120221119094958.0220606e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073048112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1179252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNing, Xin10aPectic polysaccharides from Radix Sophorae Tonkinensis exhibit significant antioxidant effects  aTwo pectic polysaccharides (WRSP-A2b and WRSP-A3a) have been obtained from Radix Sophorae Tonkinensis and comparatively investigated in terms of their physical properties and antioxidant activities. Monosaccharide composition, FT-IR, NMR and enzymatic analyses indicate that both WRSP-A2b (13.6 kDa) and WRSP-A3a (44.6 kDa) consist of homogalacturonan (HG), rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) and rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) domains, with mass ratios of 0.9:1.8:1 and 2.3:2.9:1, respectively. The RG-I domains were further purified and characterized. Results show that WRSP-A2b contains a highly branched RG-I domain, primarily substituted with α-(1→5)-linked arabinans, whereas WRSP-A3a contains a small branched RG-I domain mainly composed of β-(1→4)-linked galactan side chains. WRSP-A3a exhibits stronger antioxidant activity in scavenging different radicals than WRSP-A2b, a finding that may be due to its higher content of GalA residues and HG domains. Our results provide useful information for screening natural polysaccharide-based antioxidants from Radix Sophorae Tonkinensis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aarabinans 3apolygalacturonic acid 0aRadix Sophorae Tonkinensis 0aPectin 0aStructural characterization 0aAntioxidant activities1 aLiu, Ying1 aJia, Mengdi1 aWang, Qidi1 aSun, Ziyan1 aLi, Ji,1 aMayo, Kevin H.1 aZhou, Yifa1 aSun, Lin0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 June 15, v. 262 p.117925-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1179253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005400144245009800198300001600296500002000312520095900332592002801291650001501319650002301334650002101357650002501378650001801403650002501421650002801446650002101474650001301495650002501508650001201533700002101545700001601566700005701582773011601639856007801755852000901833655001201842IND60693222220221122041628.0200505e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069322222DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2019004062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3023-664X12aA novel approach enables imaged capillary isoelectric focusing analysis of PEGylated proteins  ap. 735-742.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPEGylation has been used as a strategy to enhance pharmacokinetic properties of therapeutic proteins by pharmaceutical industry. Imaged CIEF (iCIEF) is the current industry standard technology for pI determination and charge variant quantification of proteins and antibodies. However, the charge variants of PEGylated proteins merge into one broad peak during iCIEF, most likely due to masking of proteins by the surrounding PEG chain as well as the increased hydrodynamic volume due to PEGylation. Here, we report our novel matrix formula with a combination of glycine and taurine that significantly improved the separation of charge variants in PEGylated proteins. As a result, it is no longer necessary to conduct IEF of proteins prior to PEGylation, which does not reflect the changes caused by PEGylation and purification processes. The novel matrix (glycine and taurine) enables iCIEF analysis of PEGylated proteins in their real conjugated states.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abiopharmaceuticals 3achemical bonding 3aglycine (amino acid) 3ahydrodynamics 3aisoelectric focusing 3apharmaceutical industry 3apharmacokinetics 3aproteins 3apurification methods 3ataurine1 aChemmalil, Letha1 aDing, Julia1 aLi, Zhengjian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1941-41450 tElectrophoresis.g2020 May, v. 41, no. 9 p.735-742dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2019004063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01817naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245004800164300001400212520082600226592002801052650002501080650001101105650001501116650002201131650001001153653002201163653001701185653001701202653001401219700001601233700001701249773010701266856008501373852000901458655001201467IND50064516120221120103420.0190415e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006451612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2013.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArora, R.10aMitochondrial DNA diversity in Indian sheep  ap. 50-55.  aThe present study investigates the mitochondrial DNA diversity in 154 Indian sheep from 19 breeds/populations from 3 different agroecological regions.

Increasingly, issues of cross-country and regional comparability in food-consumption data are now coming into the decision mix. Comparability of data across countries requires comparability of several fundamental systems. Specific countries and cultural contexts must tackle problems of how to estimate individual intakes when one-dish serving is the norm; how to keep up with rapidly changing food supplies; how to capture ingredients added at the table that may be concentrated sources of nutrients or other components of interest; and how to document out-of-home eating. Assumptions about error, bias, and intra-individual variation in food intake need to be thoroughly tested in developing-country contexts. There is an urgent need for improvement in the availability of appropriate food-composition databases and software interfaces for developing-country use.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aconsumer surveys 3adatabases 3adeveloping countries 3aeating out 3afood availability 3afood composition 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3aingredients 3anutrients 3aprotocols 3atemporal variation 0afood-consumption surveys 0adeveloping countries0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 25, no. 4 p.415-419dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826504025004103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245011600206300001000322500001900332520209900351592002802450650002602478650002002504650001102524650001902535650001502554650001402569650003502583650001102618650001302629650000902642650002002651650002302671650001502694650001002709651001102719700002002730700002602750700002202776773015002798856008302948852000903031655001203040IND60730898220221120084029.0210323e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073089822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-021-09944-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl Qudah, Ayat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3461-458310aClimate change vulnerability assessment for selected agricultural responses at Yarmouk River Basin Area, Jordan  ap. 3.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlthough climate change impacts on the agricultural sector were investigated intensively, however, vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning at the community level are still limited. This study aimed at providing a comprehensive climate change vulnerability assessment of four agriculture responses of barley production, wheat production, olive trees production, and goats’ mortality at the Yarmouk River Basin in northern Jordan using a qualitative-quantitative scoring method based on actual estimations of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity with an emphasis on community engagement. Thirty-year temporal variability (1982–2012) analysis using Kendall test and Pearson correlation test for three climatic variables (maximum and minimum air temperature, and annual rainfall) indicates high significant exposure level of increasing air temperature trends by rates of 0.07 °C/year and 0.06 °C/year for maximum and minimum temperature, respectively, and insignificant annual rainfall reductions ranging spatially from 2.1 mm/year at Irbid governorate to 2.9 mm/year at Mafraq Governorate. Agriculture responses sensitivity assessment indicates goats’ mortality followed by olive production are moderately correlated with climate variables (r ranges from 0.32 to 0.57). The adaptive capacity assessment highlights the presence of low to moderate financial, institutional, political enforcement, technology implementation, and awareness of the farmers to climate change impacts and potential adaptation measures that subjected the study area to be ranked as moderately to highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Multi-criteria decision analysis suggests that irrigation water-related adaptation measures are listed within top priorities. This paper addresses the qualitative-quantitative vulnerability assessment approach at the local rural level and through participatory engagements to be effective for improving the vulnerable adaptive capacities and suggesting further recommendations to be mainstreamed urgently with governmental strategies and action plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aair temperature 3abarley 3aclimate change 3airrigation 3amortality 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aolives 3apolitics 3arain 3arisk assessment 3atemporal variation 3awatersheds 3awheat 3aJordan1 aRusan, Munir J.1 aAl-Qinna, Mohammed I.1 aAbdulla, Fayez A.0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2021 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.3-3dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870070x1381-23867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-021-09944-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006600168300001500234520104300249592002801292650003001320650001301350650002301363650001701386650001401403650001301417650002001430650001801450650001501468650003601483653001801519653001801537653001701555653002001572653002201592653002201614653002101636653001701657700002401674773011601698856008201814852000901896655001201905IND60621454720221121005457.0181117s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062145472DNAL7 a10.1177/15648265040251S1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarza, Cutberto10aRationale for Developing a New International Growth Reference  ap. S5-S13.  aThe rationale for developing a new international growth reference derived principally from a Working Group on infant growth established by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1990. It recommended an approach that described how children should grow rather than describing how children grow; that an international sampling frame be used to highlight the similarity in early childhood growth among diverse ethnic groups; that modern analytical methods be exploited; and that links among anthropometric assessments and functional outcomes be included to the fullest possible extent. Upgrading international growth references to resemble standards more closely will assist in monitoring and attaining a wide variety of international goals related to health and other aspects of social equity. In addition to providing scientifically robust tools, a new reference based on a global sample of children whose health needs are met will provide a useful advocacy tool to health-care providers and others with interests in promoting child health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadvocacy 3aanalytical methods 3achild health 3achildhood 3achildren 3ahealth services 3ainfant growth 3amonitoring 3anationalities and ethnic groups 0aAnthropometry 0abreastfeeding 0achild health 0achild nutrition 0agrowth monitoring 0agrowth references 0agrowth standards 0ahuman rights1 aOnís, Mercedes de,0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 25, no. 1_suppl_1 p.S5-S13dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/15648265040251S1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006300142245007000205300001800275520178200293592002802075650002202103650001102125650001902136650001402155650003002169650001702199650001302216650001802229650001102247650002402258650001102282700006502293700005902358700002002417700002502437700002102462700002702483700006002510700005702570700006202627773014702689856007602836852000902912655001202921IND60603309920221122134657.0180713e20180305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060330992DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b135422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeifitokaldani, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7169-153710aHydronium-Induced Switching between CO2 Electroreduction Pathways  ap. 3833-3837.  aOver a broad range of operating conditions, many CO₂ electroreduction catalysts can maintain selectivity toward certain reduction products, leading to materials and surfaces being categorized according to their products; here we ask, is product selectivity truly a property of the catalyst? Silver is among the best electrocatalysts for CO in aqueous electrolytes, where it reaches near-unity selectivity. We consider the hydrogenations of the oxygen and carbon atoms via the two proton-coupled-electron-transfer processes as chief determinants of product selectivity; and find using density functional theory (DFT) that the hydronium (H₃O⁺) intermediate plays a key role in the first oxygen hydrogenation step and lowers the activation energy barrier for CO formation. When this hydronium influence is removed, the activation energy barrier for oxygen hydrogenation increases significantly, and the barrier for carbon hydrogenation is reduced. These effects make the formate reaction pathway more favorable than CO. Experimentally, we then carry out CO₂ reduction in highly concentrated potassium hydroxide (KOH), limiting the hydronium concentration in the aqueous electrolyte. The product selectivity of a silver catalyst switches from entirely CO under neutral conditions to over 50% formate in the alkaline environment. The simulated and experimentally observed selectivity shift provides new insights into the role of hydronium on CO₂ electroreduction processes and the ability for electrolyte manipulation to directly influence transition state (TS) kinetics, altering favored CO₂ reaction pathways. We argue that selectivity should be considered less of an intrinsic catalyst property, and rather a combined product of the catalyst and reaction environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrolytes 3aformates 3ahydrogenation 3aoxygen 3apotassium hydroxide 3asilver1 aGabardo, Christine M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9456-68941 aBurdyny, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8057-95581 aDinh, Cao-Thang1 aEdwards, Jonathan P.1 aKibria, Md Golam1 aBushuyev, Oleksandr S.1 aKelley, Shana O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3360-53591 aSinton, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2714-64081 aSargent, Edward H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0396-64950 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Mar. 05, v. 140, no. 11 p.3833-3837dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b135423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245014300164300001800307520144500325592002801770650002201798650000901820650003001829650001901859650001401878650001101892650002001903650001301923650001001936650001301946650002301959650001601982650001701998650001802015650001102033650001002044650001202054650001602066653002202082653001502104653001702119653001902136653002102155700002502176700002202201700003002223700002602253773012702279856007602406852000902482655001202491IND60517144220221121005858.0160328e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051714422DNAL7 a10.4141/cjps2013-0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaşkın, Hatıra10aEffects of different genotypes and gamma ray doses on haploidization with irradiated pollen technique in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus L.)  ap. 1165-1168.  aTaşkın, H., Yücel, N.

Can. J. Plant Sci. 93: 1165–1168. Two watermelon genotypes, one commercial watermelon variety (Ustun F1) and five different doses of gamma rays coming from Co⁶⁰ were tested to develop useful haploidization procedures in watermelon. For this purpose, male flowers collected a day before anthesis were irradiated with 50, 150, 200, 275 and 300 Gy doses of gamma rays, and female flowers were pollinated with irradiated pollen the next day. Seeds extracted from fruits harvested 25 d later were opened individually in a laminar flow hood. Embryos obtained via embryo rescue technique were placed in glass tubes containing CP medium with 30 g L⁻¹ sucrose, 8 g L⁻¹ agar, 0.08 mg L⁻¹ B12, and 0.02 mg L⁻¹ IAA. Sixty haploid embryos were obtained from 43 watermelon fruits in this study. Genotype 1 was found to be the most successful genotype with 3.57 haploid embryos per 100 seeds. Among tested irradiation doses, 275 Gy was better than other doses, with 5.26 haploid embryos per 100 seeds. Considered together with irradiation dose and genotypes, the maximum number of haploid embryos was obtained from Genotype 1 pollinated with 275 Gy irradiation dose, with 6.25 haploid embryos per 100 seeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrullus lanatus 3aagar 3abiological safety cabinet 3afemale flowers 3aflowering 3afruits 3agamma radiation 3agenotype 3aglass 3ahaploidy 3aindole acetic acid 3airradiation 3amale flowers 3aovule culture 3apollen 3aseeds 3asucrose 3awatermelons 0aCitrullus lanatus 0awatermelon 0ahomozygosity 0ahaploid embryo 0airradiation dose1 aKemal Yücel, Namık1 aBaktemur, Gökhan1 aÇömlekçioğlu, Songül1 aBüyükalaca, Saadet,0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2013 Nov., v. 93, no. 6 p.1165-1168dAgricultural Institute of Canadax1918-18337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjps2013-0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245008600173300001600259520138500275592002801660650003501688650001201723650001701735650001201752650000901764650001601773650001801789650002401807650002001831650001301851650003301864650001601897653001401913653001201927653001801939653002001957653001301977653002301990700002102013700002802034700002902062700001402091700001802105700002702123700002902150773015102179856008202330852000902412655001202421IND60557384220221120154504.0190409e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055738422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2016.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez-Cortez, E.14aThe mass transport phenomenon through pericarp during the nixtamalization process  ap. 477-486.  aThe aim of this study was to correlate the apparent diffusion coefficients with the morphological changes that take place in pericarp through the evaluation of cooking stage of corn grains, in order to set the process conditions, where the diffusion rate is faster to reduce time in nixtamalization process.In order to set the process conditions where the diffusion rate is greater to reduce the nixtamalización process time. The diffusion of calcium was studied at three temperatures (70, 80 and 90°C). The cooking of the corn was conducted in a differential photoacoustic cell (DPC). Additionally, diffusion process was simulated in a modulated temperature differential scanning calorimeter (MDSC). After cooking, the residual calcium content in the pericarp was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). These data were used to solve the mathematical modeling. The diffusion model employed was developed using Fick’s law in order to explain the transport of mass into the corn. The diffusion phenomenon was related to the morphological changes experienced by pericarp using the low-vacuum scanning electron microscopy technique (LV-SEM). The final apparent diffusion coefficients were 0.9265, 1.2101 and 1.4533m2/s×10−8 at 70, 80 and 90°C respectively; then, the best process conditions recommended for cooking stage of QPM corn grains are 90°C during 50min.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acalcium 3acalorimeters 3acooking 3acorn 3adiffusivity 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3anixtamalization 3apericarp 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 0aDiffusion 0aCalcium 0aMass transfer 0aNixtamalization 0aPericarp 0aPhotoacoustic cell1 aRojas-Molina, I.1 aZambrano-Zaragoza, M.L.1 aEspinosa-Arbeláez, D.G.1 aRojas, A.1 aGarcía, J.C.1 aCornejo-Villegas, M.A.1 aRodríguez-García, M.E.0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2016 Oct., v. 100 p.477-486dElsevier B.V.aInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:jnl47636x0960-30857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2016.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01318naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245016100163300001600324520017500340592002800515650001600543650002300559650002300582650002300605653001700628653001300645653002300658700002400681700002000705700001900725773015000744856007700894852000900971655001200980IND60522126820221121183314.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052212682DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1999-03222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKühn, Norbert,10a2.2..5.5,-Tetra-tert-butyl-3,3’-bis(trimethylsilyl)-1,1’-diazacobaltocen / 2.2..5.5,-Tetra-tert-butyl-3,3’-bis(trimethylsilyl)-1,1’-diazacobaltocene  ap. 424-426.  aThe 1,1′diazacobaltocene pyr₂Co (3) is obtained from the reaction of 2,5-di-tert-butyl-3-trimethylsilylpyrrole (pyrH, 2) and CoCl₂.

Fernald has become a dominant weed that has evolved resistance to major herbicides used in the wheat fields of rice‐wheat double cropping areas of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China. Seed dispersal occurs over long distances via irrigation water. As mechanical harvesting services popularize, there is concern that combine harvesters could play an increasing role in B. syzigachne seed dispersal. RESULTS: Random sampling of 30 combine harvesters at wheat harvest determined that an average of 8000 B. syzigachne seeds remain in the combine after wheat harvesting, predominantly on the metal plate. These seeds could potentially be transported into adjacent fields. A double exponential model predicted that seeds remaining on the metal plate could be dispersed over 7885 m² into the next field. Within a field, the number of fallen seeds and their dispersal distance were positively correlated to panicle density. Combines spread seeds away from the source potentially creating new weed patches. During irrigation and rotary tillage ploughing, 70% of B. syzigachne seeds scattered in the field floated on the water surface and were moved away by the wind. CONCLUSION: Both wheat combine harvesters and water flow effectively spread B. syzigachne seeds. Areas with high B. syzigachne population density should be carefully harvested separately, and the metal plate should be carefully cleaned to prevent spreading the weed across fields and region. Floating B. syzigachne seeds displaced to field edges by water can be physically removed with nets to prevent further distribution by water.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0200805cNational Key Research and Development Programme of China 3aBeckmannia syzigachne 3acombine harvesters 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3amodels 3apanicles 3apopulation density 3arotary tillage 3aseed dispersal 3awater flow 3aweeds 3awheat 3awind 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aZhang, Zheng1 aGao, Pinglei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6333-48741 aChen, Wansong1 aQiang, Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1183-94530 tPest management science.g2021 Sept., v. 77, no. 9 p.4109-4116dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.64363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245014400193300001600337520144800353592002801801650001501829650001501844650001201859650001601871650001101887650002401898650002401922650001501946650002001961650002301981650001002004650001602014650002102030650003302051650001702084650001802101650001402119650002002133650001002153650001202163650002502175650001702200650003002217650003802247650002702285650001402312650003802326650001402364650002402378650001402402650002402416650002102440651001802461651001102479700002102490700002302511700002102534700002002555773010002575856005502675852000902730655001202739IND4468719120221123021053.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446871912DNAL7 a218832312pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03844.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Matthew E.10aEctomycorrhizal fungal diversity and community structure on three co‐occurring leguminous canopy tree species in a Neotropical rainforest  ap. 699-712.  a• The ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis was historically considered restricted to the temperate zones, but recent studies have shown the importance of this symbiosis across the tropics. We examined ECM fungal diversity, host plant phylogeny and ECM host preferences in a rainforest dominated by the leguminous host plants Dicymbe corymbosa, Dicymbe altsonii and Aldina insignis. • Ectomycorrhizal fungi were identified by internal transcribed spacer rDNA sequencing and host species were verified with chloroplast trnL sequencing. To test whether Dicymbe and Aldina represent independent gains of the ECM symbiosis, we constructed a Fabaceae phylogeny using MatK and trnL. We identified four independent ECM lineages within the Fabaceae. • We detected a diverse community of 118 ECM species dominated by the /clavulina, /russula‐lactarius, /boletus, and /tomentella‐thelephora lineages. Ectomycorrhizal species in Agaricales, Atheliales and Polyporales may represent previously unrecognized tropical‐endemic ECM lineages. Previous studies suggested that ECM fungi did not diversify in the tropics, but the /clavulina lineage appears to have a center of diversity in tropical South America. • Dicymbe and Aldina represent independent gains of the ECM symbiosis in Fabaceae but their fungal symbionts showed no host preferences.

We have now cloned, sequenced, and analyzed in silico the gene locus of NRRL B-30761 containing the putative coding sequences of rhamnosyltransferase chain A (rhlA Pcₕ , 894 bps), rhamnosyltransferase chain B (rhlB Pcₕ , 1272 bps), and N-acyl-homoserine lactone-dependent transcriptional regulatory protein (rhlR Pcₕ , 726 bps). The putative gene products RhlAPcₕ(297 amino acid residues or a.a.), RhlBPcₕ(423 a.a.), and RhlRPcₕ(241 a.a.) only have between 60 and 65 % a.a. identities to their respective closest matched homologs in P. aeruginosa. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay did not detect the presence of rhamnosyltransferase C gene (rhlC) in P. chlororaphis, suggesting a genetic basis for the lack of dirhamnose-lipid (R₂L) synthesis in this organism. We thus genetically constructed an R₂L-synthesizing P. chlororaphis by expressing a rhamnosyltransferase C (rhlC) gene of P. aeruginosa using an expression vector (pBS29-P2-gfp) containing a Pseudomonas syringae promoter. The R₂L/R₁L ratio is 2.4 in the rhamnolipid (RL) sample isolated from the genetically engineered (GE) P. chlororaphis [pBS29-P2-rhlC], in contrast to undetectable R₂L in the GE P. chlororaphis [pBS29-P2-gfp] control cells based on LC-MS analysis. The critical micelle concentrations of the R₂L and R₁L samples from GE P. chlororaphis [pBS29-P2-rhlC] and the control [pBS29-P2-gfp] cells were ca. 0.1 mM, and their minimum surface tensions were ca. 26 mN/m with no significant difference.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aPseudomonas chlororaphis 3aPseudomonas syringae 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3abiotechnology 3agenes 3agenetically engineered microorganisms 3aglycolipids 3aliquid chromatography 3aloci 3amass spectrometry 3amicelles 3amolecular cloning 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arhamnose 3asequence analysis 3asurface tension 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransferases1 aAshby, Richard D.1 aGunther, Nereus W., IVcIV1 aZerkowski, Jonathan A.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2015 May, v. 99, no. 10 p.4333-4342dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/603303Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-6433-43Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/271444%20SOLAIMAN.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245008800174300001600262520137500278592002801653650003001681650001501711650001301726650001301739650001701752650001201769650001501781650002201796650002001818650001201838651001001850651001001860651001101870651000901881651001801890653001001908653002201918653001101940653002301951653002201974653001701996700002402013700002502037700001702062700002902079700001902108700001702127700002402144773011702168856008202285852000902367655001202376IND60621455020221121005730.0181117s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062145502DNAL7 a10.1177/15648265040251S1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWijnhoven, Trudy M.A.10aAssessment of Gross Motor Development in the who Multicentre Growth Reference Study  ap. S37-S45.  aThe objective of the Motor Development Study was to describe the acquisition of selected gross motor milestones among affluent children growing up in different cultural settings. This study was conducted in Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and the United States as part of the longitudinal component of the World Health Organization (WHO) Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS). Infants were followed from the age of four months until they could walk independently. Six milestones that are fundamental to acquiring self-sufficient erect locomotion and are simple to evaluate were assessed: sitting without support, hands-and-knees crawling, standing with assistance, walking with assistance, standing alone, and walking alone. The information was collected by both the children's caregivers and trained MGRS fieldworkers. The caregivers assessed and recorded the dates when the milestones were achieved for the first time according to established criteria. Using standardized procedures, the fieldworkers independently assessed the motor performance of the children and checked parental recording at home visits. To ensure standardized data collection, the sites conducted regular standardization sessions. Data collection and data quality control took place simultaneously. Data verification and cleaning were performed until all queries had been satisfactorily resolved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3acaregivers 3achildren 3acleaning 3adata quality 3ainfants 3alocomotion 3amotor development 3aquality control 3awalking 3aGhana 3aIndia 3aNorway 3aOman 3aUnited States 0aChild 0achild development 0ainfant 0alongitudinal study 0amotor development 0amotor skills1 aOnís, Mercedes de,1 aOnyango, Adelheid W.1 aWang, Tracey1 aBjoerneboe, Gunn-Elin A.1 aBhandari, Nita1 aLartey, Anna1 aRashidi, Badriya Al0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 25, no. 1_suppl_1 p.S37-S45dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/15648265040251S1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245030600162300001600468520092400484592002801408650001201436650002101448650002201469650001301491650001401504653002201518653002601540653001501566653001401581653003401595700001801629773015001647856007701797852000901874655001201883IND60522127120221123032852.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052212712DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1999-04032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlepp, Kurt O.10aKomplexe Chalkogenide der IVa Metalle mit niedrigdimensionalen anionischen Partialstrukturen.

The compounds are monoclinic, mP24, space group P2₁/c, Z = 4 with a = 9.089(3), b = 14.148(4), c = 6.986(3) Å, β = 105.90(1)° and a = 9.735(4), b = 14.300(7), c = 6.952(8) Å, β = 108.61(2)°, respectively. The crystal structure was determined from diffractometer data and refined to R = 0.030 for 1452 Fo's for K₂ZrTe₃ and R = 0.038 for 1131 Fo's for Rb₂ZrTe₃. The crystal structure is of a new type, characterized by infinite anionic chains, ¹∞-[ZrTe₃]²⁻ built up by octahedra sharing opposite faces which run along [001]. The mean Zr-Te bond lengths are 2.921 and 2.920 Å, respectively. The alkali cations separating the chains are characterized by two different - distorted octahedral and pentagonal bipyramidal - chalcogen environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3achemical bonding 3acrystal structure 3ageometry 3azirconium 0aCrystal Structure 0aComplex Chalcogenides 0aTellurides 0aZirconium 0aPseudo-one-dimensional solids1 aKolb, Andreas0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 54, no. 4 p.441-446dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1999-04033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011600164300001800280500001500298520167300313592002801986650001402014650001602028650001102044650001802055650001602073650001702089650001902106650000902125650000902134650001802143650002002161650001502181650000902196650001302205650001502218650001902233650001602252650001502268650001302283650001002296653001702306700001802323700001402341773011602355856008102471852000902552655001202561IND60114280220221117062122.0141120e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011428022DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-014-5905-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xiao-kui10aHeavy metal ions affecting the removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by fungi with heavy-metal resistance  ap. 9817-9827.  a2019-12-04  aThe co-occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals (HMs) is very common in contaminated environments. It is of paramount importance and great challenge to exploit a bioremediation to remove PAHs in these environments with combined pollution. We approached this question by probing the influence of HMs coexisting with PAHs on the removal of PAHs by Acremonium sp. P0997 possessing metal resistance. A removal capability for naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and fluoranthenepresentalone (98.6, 99.3, 89.9, 60.4, and 70 %, respectively) and in a mixture (96.9, 71.8, 67.0, 85.0, and 87.9 %, respectively) was achieved in mineral culture inoculated with Acremonium sp. P0997, and this strain also displayed high resistance to the individual HMs (Mn²⁺, Fe²⁺, Zn²⁺, Cu²⁺, Al³⁺, and Pb²⁺). The removal of individual PAHs existing in a mixture was differently affected by the separately tested HMs. Cu²⁺enhanced the partition process of anthracene to dead or alive mycelia and the contribution of the biosorption by this strain but imposed a little negative influence on the contribution of biodegradation to the total removal of anthracene individually in a culture. However, Mn²⁺ had an inhibitory effect on the partition process of anthracene to dead or alive mycelia and decreased the contributions of both biosorption and biodegradation to the total anthracene removal. This work showcased the value of fungi in bioremediation for the environments with combined pollution, and the findings have major implications for the bioremediation of organic pollutants in metal-organic mixed contaminated sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3anaphthalene 3acopper 3aphenanthrenes 3aanthracenes 3aheavy metals 3abioremediation 3airon 3alead 3abiotechnology 3ametal tolerance 3apollutants 3azinc 3aaluminum 3aAcremonium 3abiodegradation 3abiosorption 3ametal ions 3amycelium 3afungi 0aphenanthrene1 aling Wu, Ling1 aFam, Hala0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 Dec., v. 98, no. 23 p.9817-9827dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-014-5905-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245008600211300001400297520115300311592002801464650002201492650001601514650001101530650001401541650000901555650001801564650002401582650001301606650001601619653001601635653002301651653002701674653002501701653002201726653002601748700002201774773014901796856008201945852000902027655001202036IND60557384620221120164630.0190409e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055738462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2016.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgrawal, Shailesh G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4955-685710aMathematical model for heat and mass transfer during convective drying of pumpkin  ap. 68-73.  aConvective drying is a popular technique for drying of food materials. A plethora of empirical models have been used to fit the convective drying kinetics of food materials in general and pumpkin in particular. In literature, there exists a gap in the study of convective drying of pumpkin using first principle based model. In this article, a first principle based model for heat and mass transfer with appropriate convective boundary condition have been formulated. The model resulted in the set of partial differential equations, which have been solved using method of lines (MOL). The simulated model demonstrates good qualitative agreement with the reported literatures and experimental data. The Arrhenius parameters (activation energy and the pre exponential factor) for effective diffusivity have been estimated by fitting experimental data. Using the estimated values, the drying kinetics under various drying conditions have been simulated and found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. The different drying regimes exhibited by the pumpkin were explained using the temperature and moisture profiles predicted by the model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3adiffusivity 3adrying 3aequations 3aheat 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3apumpkins 3atemperature 0aFood drying 0aMathematical model 0aHeat and mass transfer 0aParameter estimation 0aDrying mechanisms 0aEffective diffusivity1 aMethekar, Ravi N.0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2017 Jan., v. 101 p.68-73dElsevier B.V.aInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:jnl47636x0960-30857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2016.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245014500188300001800333520163400351592002801985650002202013650001602035650002002051650001502071650001902086650002302105650001302128650001102141650001802152650001202170650001202182650002002194650000902214650003002223650002502253650001302278650001202291650002902303650002302332650003502355650005302390650005402443650005902497650001302556651000902569651000902578700002402587700001902611700002202630700002702652773012102679856008102800852000902881655001202890IND4466803520221119105837.0160218e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446680352DNAL7 a217134722pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-011-2184-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakizadeh, Mohammad10aDetermination of polychlorinated biphenyls and total mercury in two fish species (Esox lucius and Carassius auratus) in Anzali Wetland, Iran  ap. 3231-3237.  aThe Anzali Wetland is one of the most important ecosystems in the north of Iran, and parts of it were registered as a Ramsar site in 1975. However, even though, due to many problems, including eutrophication produced by inflow of excess nutrients and organic materials, the wetland was also listed on the Montreux Record indicating the need to take urgent remedial action. This study was conducted to study the levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and total mercury (THg) in two fish species (Esox lucius and Carassius auratus) as bio-indicators of the ecosystem condition in eastern part of Anzali Wetland. The sampling was carried out in six different periods between years 2009 and 2010. The results showed that the amounts of PCBs in the muscle of northern pike were below the detection limit of gas chromatography, whereas the average concentration in goldfish was 0.449 mg/kg wet weight. Some possible reasons for the higher levels of PCBs in goldfish in comparison with pike have been discussed. No significant (p < 0.05) correlation was observed between PCBs and biological factors (weight, length, lipid content) for both species. On the other hand, the mean concentration of THg in the muscle of pike and goldfish were 182.22 and 75.27 ng/g dry weight, respectively. Although these concentrations were below US-EPA criterion for human consumption (0.3 mg/kg), it pointed up a significant deterioration of the ecosystem condition during the past years. Finally, statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between THg with weight and an insignificant correlation with length for pike specimens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarassius auratus 3aEsox lucius 3adetection limit 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3agas chromatography 3agoldfish 3ahumans 3alipid content 3amercury 3amuscles 3anutrient excess 3apike 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3astatistical analysis 3awetlands 2aAnimals 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFishesxmetabolism 2aMercuryxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data 2aWetlands 3aIran 0aIran1 aEsmaeili Sari, Abas1 aAbdoli, Asghar1 aBahramifar, Nader1 aHashemi, Seyed Hossein0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2012 May, v. 184, no. 5 p.3231-3237dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-2184-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113040001800139100002100157245015900178300001800337520166400355592002802019650002802047650003002075650002002105650001102125650002602136650001102162650001302173650001502186650002402201650001402225650001302239650002502252650001202277650004502289650004402334650002102378650002502399650002302424650002402447650002002471650002502491650002602516650004102542700002102583700002002604773012402624856003902748852000902787655001202796IND50064641020221119105933.0130405e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006464102DNAL7 a229969942pmid7 a10.1002/etc.20102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Beat B.10aMultiple stressor effects of predation by rotifers and herbicide pollution on different Chlamydomonas strains and potential impacts on population dynamics  ap. 2832-2840.  aEnvironmental factors can interact with the effects of chemical pollutants on natural systems by inducing multiple stressor effects in individual organisms as well as by altering selection pressure on tolerant strains in heterogeneous populations. Predation is a stressful environmental factor relevant for many species. Therefore, the impact of predation by the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus on tolerance of eight genetically different strains of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to simultaneous exposure to each of the three herbicides (diuron, paraquat, and S‐metolachlor) was tested. Interactions of combined stressors were analyzed based on the independent action model; additive, synergistic, and antagonistic effects of the combined exposure could be detected depending on the herbicide and strain tested. If cultures were acclimated (pre‐exposed) to one stressor, tolerance to the second stressor could be increased. This indicates that physiological changes can induce cotolerance of predation‐exposed algae to herbicides and of herbicide‐treated algae to predation depending on the combination of stressors. The strain‐specific differences in multiple stressor effects also changed the correlation of strains' tolerances to individual stressors determined during combined and single‐stressor exposure. Changes in cotolerance to stressors affect selection pressure and population dynamics during long‐term exposure. This shows that predation stress can have adverse effects on the toxicity of chemical pollutants to microalgae on the organism and population levels. Environ. Toxicol.

Wheat plays an important role in feeding the world, but climate change threatens its future harvest and nutritional quality. In this study, grain iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) concentrations of 54 wheat varieties, including CIMMYT derived historic and modern wheat varieties grown in six different environmental conditions, were analyzed. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of water and heat stress on the nutritional value of wheat grains with a main emphasis on grain protein content, Zn and Fe concentrations. Significant effects of environment on protein content and grain micronutrients concentration were observed. The protein and Zn concentrations increased in the water and heat stressed environments, whereas Zn and Fe yield per unit area was higher in non-stress conditions. The results suggest that genetic gains in the yield potential of CIMMYT derived wheat varieties have tended to reduce grain Zn, in some instances; however, environmental variability might influence the extent to which this effect manifests itself.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aenvironmental factors 3agenetic improvement 3agrain protein 3aheat 3aheat stress 3airon 3amalnutrition 3anutritive value 3aprotein content 3aspring wheat 3atemperature 3azinc 0aWheat 0aAbiotic stress 0aZinc and Iron 0aBiofortification1 aGuzmán, Carlos,1 aMondal, Suchismita1 aAutrique, Jorge E.1 aHuerta, Julio1 aSingh, R.

The highest concentrations of both ¹²⁷I and ¹²⁹I occurred in sea water, on average 11.1±4.3μg/l and 3.9±4.1×10⁻⁹ at/l. In rain and lake waters the concentration of ¹²⁹I was more or less identical and almost one order of magnitude lower than in sea water. Based on these observations, and data from the literature, it is assumed that the source of ¹²⁹I in lakes is precipitation and the major source in the Baltic Sea is the inflow of sea water from the North Sea through the Danish Straits. The concentration of ¹²⁹I in the Baltic Sea has increased by a factor of six during ten years from 1999. In all studied water types the main chemical form of both iodine isotopes was iodide; in sea and lake waters by 92–96% and in rain water by 75–88%. Compared to ¹²⁷I the fraction of iodide was slightly higher in case of ¹²⁹I in all waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aiodides 3aiodine 3aisotopes 3alakes 3arain 3aseawater 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aIodatesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aIodidesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aIodinexanalysisxchemistry. 2aIodine Radioisotopesxanalysis 2aLakesxchemistry 2aMass Spectrometry 2aRainxchemistry 2aSeawaterxchemistry 2aSpectrometry, Gamma 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 3aBaltic Sea 3aFinland 3aNorth Sea 0aFinland1 aRäty, Tero1 aHou, Xiaolin1 aPaatero, Jussi1 aAldahan, Ala1 aPossnert, Göran,1 aFlinkman, Juha1 aKankaanpää, Harri0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 419 p.60-67dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.12.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245006400165500001900229520133000248592002801578650001801606650001801624650001401642650001501656650001701671650003201688650001901720650001101739650001501750653002801765653002201793653002801815653002001843700002001863700002501883700003101908700001801939700006601957773011002023856008502133852000902218655001202227IND60730705420221122025740.0210428e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073070542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1168842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Beibei10aDispersal and transport of microplastics in river sediments  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRivers are viewed as major pathways of microplastic transport from terrestrial areas to marine ecosystems. However, there is paucity of knowledge on the dispersal pattern and transport of microplastics in river sediments. In this study, a three dimensional hydrodynamic and particle transport modelling framework was created to investigate the dispersal and transport processes of microplastic particles commonly present in the environment, namely, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyamide (PA), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in river sediments. The study outcomes confirmed that sedimental microplastics with lower density would have higher mobility. PE and PP are likely to be transported for a relatively longer distance, while PA and PET would likely accumulate close to source points. High water flow would transport more microplastics from source points, and high flow velocity in bottom water layer are suggested to facilitate the transport of sedimental microplastics. Considering the limited dispersal and transport, the study outcomes indicated that river sediments would act as a sink for microplastic pollutants instead of being a transport pathway. The patchiness associated with the hotspots of different plastic types is expected to provide valuable information for microplastic source tracking.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrodynamics 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3apolyamides 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3apolypropylenes 3arivers 3awater flow 0aMicroplastics transport 0aDispersal pattern 0aMicroplastics modelling 0aRiver sediments1 aSmith, Mitchell1 aEgodawatta, Prasanna1 aAyoko, G.

The mean sodium concentration in ‘gazpacho’ was much higher than those mean values observed in the fresh vegetables. The mean values of the minerals studied in the ‘gazpacho’, except sodium and calcium, tend to be lower than the mean values in the vegetables used. Garlic presented significantly higher mean contents of the trace elements than the rest of the vegetables and the ‘gazpacho’. Many highly significant correlations between all the minerals analyzed, except calcium, were observed.

This indication would suggest that the trace element analysis of leaves in these plants could provide information about the composition, nature and origin of the atmospheric dust dispersed in the environment. In order to corroborate this hypothesis, the distribution of trace elements and Rare Earths were studied in leaves of some endemic plants, in the atmospheric fallout and in soils of rural, urban and industrial ecosystems in Sicily. These elements have been chosen to discriminate the source and nature of different source on atmospheric dust and the larger capability of the composition of the latter materials to influence the metal ion distribution in leaves of studied plants rather than the soil composition. These evidences are related to the recognition both of positive La anomaly and trace element enrichments in studied leaves and to their particular V/Th and Co/Ni signature. On the other hand, some particular normalised REE features recognised in leaves suggest that a limited contribution to the REE budget in studied leaves is provided by the REE migration from roots.  aPublisher supplied data 3acobalt 3adust 3aindigenous species 3aindustrial symbiosis 3aleaves 3anickel 3aplants (botany) 3arare earth elements 3aroots 3asoil 3asoil composition 3aSicily 0aREE 0aLa anomaly 0aLeaves 0aAnthropogenic signature 0aTrace elements1 aCibella, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1674-22631 aFalcone, E.E.1 aCuttitta, G.1 aSaiano, F.1 aInguaggiato, C.1 aLatteo, V.0 tChemosphere.g2017 Feb., v. 169 p.342-350dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.11.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245007600177520182100253592002802074650001902102650001802121650001702139650001002156650001802166650001102184650002102195650000902216650001602225650001802241650001702259650002302276650001102299650001702310650002402327650000902351650000902360650001402369650002002383650001202403650001202415651001002427653001602437653001402453653001802467653001702485653001402502700002102516700002102537773011402558856008602672852000902758655001202767IND60692628320221123000255.0201025e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069262832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1218772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Thani, Nayla Ahmad10aMaximising nutritional benefits within the energy, water and food nexus  aMany countries are exposed to malnutrition within their population, either in the form of undernutrition or obesity leading to dire affects for human health. As a consequence, a ‘Decade of Action’ was certified by the UN in 2016 to promote the need to end all types of malnutrition. Within food security objectives, this study evaluates the possibility to maximise the nutritional value of agricultural output through the optimal allocation of water and energy resources. Using a hypothetical case study in Qatar, two complementary multi-objective mathematical models are developed to solve various scenarios. Firstly, the goal programming minimises the expected value of negative deviation from the desired target in food groups and nutrients. Secondly, the linear programming model increases the expected value of self-sufficiency percentage in food groups and nutrients. The results indicate the specific dependency of increasing the self-sufficiency of different nutrients on the increased production of dates group and fish group, implying that dates and fish can be considered strategic crops in terms of their contribution towards food security, owing to the fact that they require the least quantity of water and energy resources for production. As poultry and meat groups require the largest quantities of water and energy resources, optimal results do not favour their production. The optimal production mix that increases the satisfaction of nutrients at 40% of the food groups self-sufficiency satisfaction with the same amount of energy and water are as follows: 52378, 47085, 111303 tonnes of dates, milk and dairy products and fish groups respectively. This production mix will achieve 29.18%, 100%, 90.8%, and 2.5% satisfaction percentage of carbohydrates, protein, fats, and fibres respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations 3acarbohydrates 3acase studies 3acrops 3adates (fruit) 3aenergy 3aenergy resources 3afish 3afood groups 3afood security 3ahuman health 3alinear programming 3alipids 3amalnutrition 3amathematical models 3ameat 3amilk 3anutrients 3anutritive value 3aobesity 3apoultry 3aQatar 0aAgriculture 0aNutrition 0aFood security 0aOptimisation 0aEWF Nexus1 aGovindan, Rajesh1 aAl-Ansari, Tareq0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 266 p.121877-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1218773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245015500207520166000362592002802022650001202050650000902062650001202071650002002083650002802103650002702131650001702158650001102175650002302186650001702209653001602226653002202242653001302264653003502277653002202312653001402334700002102348700001802369700006402387700005302451700001902504773011202523856008702635852000902722655001202731IND60753763820221117194609.0211213e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075376382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1179972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, Haibo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8585-955910aDry cooling retrofits at existing fossil fuel-fired power plants in a water-stressed region: Tradeoffs in water savings, cost, and capacity shortfalls  aThis study investigates the performance, cost, and generating capacity impacts of switching from wet cooling towers to dry cooling systems to reduce the consumptive water use at existing fossil fuel-fired power plants in a water-stressed region. Retrofit analysis of dry cooling is conducted on a unit-by-unit basis for both coal-fired and gas-fired power plants. Unit-level results are then aggregated to the regional level. Based on regional averages, retrofitting dry cooling systems in lieu of wet cooling towers decreases total annual plant water consumption at existing coal- and gas-fired power plants by 93% and 100%, respectively, while increasing the levelized cost of electricity generation by approximately 12% and 18%, respectively. Based on a nominal regional water price, this cost increase corresponds to an average cost of consumptive water savings of $2.5 and $5.9 per cubic meter of water saved at coal and gas plants, respectively, if retrofit difficulty is minimal. Over the course of a year, the change in monthly net regional generating capacity from dry cooling retrofits exhibits a seasonal pattern, with the largest shortfalls occurring in July. The average monthly reduction in net capacity is estimated at 0.7% and 1.2% of the regional nameplate capacity for coal- and gas-based plants, respectively. Dry cooling retrofits thus lead to tradeoffs in water savings, cost, and capacity shortfalls, which vary with power plant characteristics. The tradeoffs identified here can fill existing knowledge gaps to better inform electric power industry water management policies, planning, and decision-making in water-stressed regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannuals 3acoal 3acooling 3adecision making 3aelectric power industry 3aelectricity generation 3apower plants 3aprices 3aseasonal variation 3awater stress 0aDry cooling 0aWet cooling tower 0aRetrofit 0aFossil fuel-fired power plants 0aWater consumption 0aTradeoffs1 aRubin, Edward S.1 aGrol, Eric J.1 aO'Connell, Andrew C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5750-56111 aWu, Zitao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7697-50371 aLewis, Eric G.0 tApplied energy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 306 p.117997-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1179973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03576naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245017900165300001800344520182700362592002802189650001602217650002702233650001202260650001902272650001402291650001602305650001002321650001502331650004402346650001302390650001402403650001502417650001302432650001702445650000902462650001402471650001302485650002702498650001702525650001602542653001402558653002502572653003302597653002102630700002302651700002002674700001902694700002302713700002502736700001902761773013402780856007502914852000902989655001202998IND60568265520221119040929.0170503e20120907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056826552DNAL7 a10.1021/pr300430u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunningham, Katharine10aPharmacometabonomic Characterization of Xenobiotic and Endogenous Metabolic Phenotypes That Account for Inter-individual Variation in Isoniazid-Induced Toxicological Response  ap. 4630-4642.  aAn NMR-based pharmacometabonomic approach was applied to investigate inter-animal variation in response to isoniazid (INH; 200 and 400 mg/kg) in male Sprague–Dawley rats, alongside complementary clinical chemistry and histopathological analysis. Marked inter-animal variability in central nervous system (CNS) toxicity was identified following administration of a high dose of INH, which enabled characterization of CNS responders and CNS non-responders. High-resolution post-dose urinary ¹H NMR spectra were modeled both by their xenobiotic and endogenous metabolic information sets, enabling simultaneous identification of the differential metabolic fate of INH and its associated endogenous metabolic consequences in CNS responders and CNS non-responders. A characteristic xenobiotic metabolic profile was observed for CNS responders, which revealed higher urinary levels of pyruvate isonicotinylhydrazone and β-glucosyl isonicotinylhydrazide and lower levels of acetylisoniazid compared to CNS non-responders. This suggested that the capacity for acetylation of INH was lower in CNS responders, leading to increased metabolism via conjugation with pyruvate and glucose. In addition, the endogenous metabolic profile of CNS responders revealed higher urinary levels of lactate and glucose, in comparison to CNS non-responders. Pharmacometabonomic analysis of the pre-dose ¹H NMR urinary spectra identified a metabolic signature that correlated with the development of INH-induced adverse CNS effects and may represent a means of predicting adverse events and acetylation capacity when challenged with high dose INH. Given the widespread use of INH for the treatment of tuberculosis, this pharmacometabonomic screening approach may have translational potential for patient stratification to minimize adverse events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylation 3acentral nervous system 3aglucose 3ahistopathology 3aisoniazid 3alactic acid 3amales 3ametabolism 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3aproteome 3apyruvic acid 3arats 3ascreening 3atoxicity 3atranslation (genetics) 3atuberculosis 3axenobiotics 0aisoniazid 0apharmacometabonomics 0ainter-individual variability 0aNMR spectroscopy1 aClaus, Sandrine

This paper uses the spatial Durbin model (SDM) to explore the impact mechanism of economic development on haze pollution using panel data of 249 cities from 1998 to 2016. Urbanization is used as an intermediary variable to test whether it plays a mediating effect. The results show that 1) from the national and regional level, there are N-shaped relationships between economic development and haze pollution and a U-shaped relationship between urbanization and haze pollution; 2) urbanization plays a mediating role in the impact of the economy on haze pollution; that is, through the effect of urbanization, economic development causes more serious haze pollution; 3) convenient transportation, technological progress, and increased education levels can alleviate haze pollution while an increased opening-up level aggravates pollution; moreover, technological progress and an increased opening-up level alleviate haze pollution in the eastern region; and 4) an increase in the annual average humidity can alleviate haze pollution while an increase of the annual average wind speed will lead to the aggravation of haze pollution in adjacent areas.

As the current effective treatments and preventive measures are inconsistent and unpredictable, the use of biomaterials as carriers of bioactive ion coatings is a promising approach. However, the translation from lab to large-scale production and clinical applications is difficult due to a technology barrier. Determining the effective dosage of each ion to achieve an in vivo application of the in vitro screening is challenging. Here, we selected zinc and strontium ions to provide multiple effects on antibacterial activity and osteogenesis. The optimal coating with effective release concentrations of the two ions was obtained after the two-step screening from in vitro testing. The results showed that this type of in vivo bioactive ion usage leads to an enhanced osseointegration during the immediate implantation in a periodontitis-affected environment and prevents soft tissue inflammation and bone resorption in an inflammatory environment. The new biologically active ion screening method could verify the effectiveness of this clinical translation and its potential for large-scale production and could determine the effective dosage of each ion for a specific application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3abiocompatible materials 3abone formation 3abone resorption 3ainflammation 3astrontium 3azinc 0aperi-implantitis 0aclinical translation 0aions 0aconcentration screening 0aimplant design1 aSun, Ningjia1 aJiang, Fei1 aLu, Yuezhi1 aYang, Guangzheng1 aWu, Xiaolin1 aLin, Sihan1 aZhang, Wenjie1 aJiang, Xinquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6568-19220 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Jan. 19, v. 13, no. 4 p.5782-5794dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c196983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03631naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245016000173300001800333520160200351592002801953650002501981650002102006650001302027650001502040650001602055650001302071650002002084650001002104650001802114650002202132650002302154650001002177650001602187650001802203650000902221650001402230650002002244653001002264653000802274653001002282653000902292653000702301653001002308653001002318653001002328653001002338653000802348653000902356653000902365653001002374653001002384653000902394653001402403653001902417653001002436653001902446653001002465700002202475700002302497700002102520700002602541700001902567700002402586700001902610700001702629700001802646773010302664856008502767852000902852655001202861IND60553314420221119083713.0161021e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055331442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSellmann, Cathrin10aDiets rich in fructose, fat or fructose and fat alter intestinal barrier function and lead to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease over time  ap. 1183-1192.  aGeneral overnutrition but also a diet rich in certain macronutrients, age, insulin resistance and an impaired intestinal barrier function may be critical factors in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here the effect of chronic intake of diets rich in different macronutrients, i.e. fructose and/or fat on liver status in mice, was studied over time. C57BL/6J mice were fed plain water, 30% fructose solution, a high-fat diet or a combination of both for 8 and 16 weeks. Indices of liver damage, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) signaling cascade, macrophage polarization and insulin resistance in the liver and intestinal barrier function were analyzed. Chronic exposure to a diet rich in fructose and/or fat was associated with the development of hepatic steatosis that progressed with time to steatohepatitis in mice fed a combination of macronutrients. The development of NAFLD was also associated with a marked reduction of the mRNA expression of insulin receptor, whereas hepatic expressions of TLR-4, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 and markers of M1 polarization of macrophages were induced in comparison to controls. Bacterial endotoxin levels in portal plasma were found to be increased while levels of the tight junction protein occludin and zonula occludens 1 were found to be significantly lower in the duodenum of all treated groups after 8 and 16 weeks. Our data suggest that chronic intake of fructose and/or fat may lead to the development of NAFLD over time and that this is associated with an increased translocation of bacterial endotoxin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 4 3achronic exposure 3aduodenum 3aendotoxins 3afatty liver 3afructose 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahigh fat diet 3ainsulin receptors 3ainsulin resistance 3aliver 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aoccludins 3atight junctions 0a4-HNE 0aALT 0aArg-1 0aiNOS 0aIR 0aIRS-1 0aMCP-1 0aMyD88 0aNAFLD 0aNAS 0aNASH 0aSOPF 0aTLR-4 0aTNFα 0aZO-1 0aEndotoxin 0aMacronutrients 0aNAFLD 0aTight junction 0aAging1 aPriebs, Josephine1 aLandmann, Marianne1 aDegen, Christian1 aEngstler, Anna Janina1 aJin, Cheng Jun1 aGärttner, Stefanie1 aSpruss, Astrid1 aHuber, Otmar1 aBergheim, Ina0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2015 Nov., v. 26 p.1183-1192dElsevier Inc.x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03495naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245009100162300001800253500001900271520173400290592002802024650001302052650002102065650002202086650001602108650001502124650001102139650001302150650001802163650001302181650001102194650002202205650001502227650001102242653002402253653003002277653003202307653002502339653002202364700001402386700001602400700005202416700001902468700001702487700001602504700001402520700005502534700005702589700005702646773013902703856007802842852000902920655001202929IND60726266220221119090225.0210203e20210121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072626622DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c197902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Xuejuan10aEnhanced Hemocompatibility of a Direct Chemical Vapor Deposition-Derived Graphene Film  ap. 4835-4843.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA wide range of biomedical devices are being used to treat cardiovascular diseases, and thus they routinely come into contact with blood. Insufficient hemocompatibility has been found to impair the functionality and safety of these devices through the activation of blood coagulation and the immune system. Numerous attempts have been made to develop surface modification approaches of the cardiovascular devices to improve their hemocompatibility. However, there are still no ideal “blood-friendly” coating materials, which possess the desired hemocompatibility, tissue compatibility, and mechanical properties. As a novel multifunctional material, graphene has been proposed for a wide range of biomedical applications. The chemical inertness, atomic smoothness, and high durability make graphene an ideal candidate as a surface coating material for implantable devices. Here, we evaluated the hemocompatibility of a graphene film prepared on quartz glasses (Gra-glasses) from a direct chemical vapor deposition process. We found that the graphene coating, which is free of transfer-mediating polymer contamination, significantly suppressed platelet adhesion and activation, prolonged coagulation time, and reduced ex vivo thrombosis formation. We attribute the excellent antithrombogenic properties of the Gra-glasses to the low surface roughness, low surface energy (especially the low polar component of the surface energy), and the negative surface charge of the graphene film. Given these excellent hemocompatible properties, along with its chemical inertness, high durability, and molecular impermeability, a graphene film holds great promise as an antithrombogenic coating for next-generation cardiovascular devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abiocompatibility 3ablood coagulation 3acoagulation 3adurability 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aimmune system 3apolymers 3aquartz 3asurface roughness 3athrombosis 3avapors 0aimplantable devices 0atwo-dimensional materials 0aantithrombogenic properties 0abiomedical materials 0abio-nanointerface1 aCheng, Yi1 aWang, Puxin1 aChen, Ke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2384-84371 aChen, Zhaolong1 aLiu, Xiaojun1 aFu, Xuefeng1 aWang, Kun1 aLiu, Kaihui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8781-24951 aLiu, Zhongfan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0065-79881 aDuan, Xiaojie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7799-38970 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Jan. 21, v. 13, no. 4 p.4835-4843dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c197903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245009200174300001600266520172200282592002802004650001602032650002502048650001102073650001602084650001902100650002402119650002202143650000902165650001102174650001102185650001402196650001202210650002802222650002002250650001602270650001102286653001402297653001602311653002402327653001902351653001702370653002102387700006202408700001602470700001402486700001602500700001702516700001902533700002302552700002002575700002202595773010502617856008902722852000902811655001202820IND60609803920221118053922.0180824e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060980392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.11.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jiangfei10aDevelopmental bisphenol A exposure impairs sperm function and reproduction in zebrafish  ap. 262-270.  aThe developmental and reproductive toxicity of bisphenol A (BPA) has been demonstrated in a variety of model systems. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were waterborne-exposed to BPA during three different developmental stages: embryonic period:6 h post fertilization (hpf) to 5 months post fertilization (mpf); larval period: 6 days post fertilization (dpf) to 5 mpf; and sexually mature period: 3 mpf to 5 mpf. Evaluations included F0 adult growth, reproduction parameters, and F1 offspring development. BPA exposure did not affect zebrafish growth in any of exposure groups. Testis weight was decreased only following the 6 hpf to 5 mpf 0.001 μM BPA exposure. The lowest effect level indicated by a reduction in sperm volume, density, motility, and velocity across a range of exposure durations was 0.001 μM, with all but sperm density significant for the longest exposure duration, which was also the only significant endpoint for the lowest exposure concentration in the 3–5 mpf exposure group. Nonmonotonic concentration-response curves were noted for all F0 reproductive endpoints for at least one of the two longest exposure durations. For the F1 offspring of fish exposed from 6 hpf to 5 mpf, malformations and mortality were increased following 0.001 μM BPA exposure, while egg production and fertilization were reduced in higher concentration treatment groups. Overall, BPA exposure during three different developmental periods impaired zebrafish reproductive development, with most significance changes found in the lowest concentration treatment groups. Genetic impacts on gamete development may underlie the secondary effects of reduced fertilization rate, embryonic mortality, and malformations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aabnormal development 3aadults 3abisphenol A 3aegg production 3aembryonic mortality 3aexposure duration 3afish 3alarvae 3amodels 3amortality 3aprogeny 3areproductive toxicology 3asexual maturity 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 0aZebrafish 0aBisphenol A 0aProcreation ability 0aSperm motility 0aReproduction 0aChronic exposure1 aSaili, Katerine S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5759-10061 aLiu, Yueqin1 aLi, Lelin1 aZhao, Yuxin1 aJia, Yinhang1 aBai, Chenglian1 aTanguay, Robert L.1 aDong, Qiaoxiang1 aHuang, Changjiang0 tChemosphere.g2017 Feb., v. 169 p.262-270dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.11.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245015200177300001400329520131700343592002801660650002201688650001201710650001201722650001001734650001101744650002301755650001401778650003001792650001301822650001501835650001401850650002401864650001001888650001001898650001501908651001901923653002001942653001701962653002301979653002802002653003002030700003402060773007902094856008202173852000902255655001202264IND60520287420221119170119.0160519e20121018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052028742DNAL7 a10.1515/mammalia-2012-00462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, Luis Mariano,10aMediterranean monk seal Monachus monachus distribution and fisheries interactions in the Atlantic Sahara during the second half of the 20th century  ap. 41-49.  aThe most important surviving colony of the critically endangered Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) inhabits the Atlantic Saharan coast. The population has not recovered despite the cessation of commercial sealing in the second half of the 20th century. We report the distribution of the monk seals within the region from 1940 to 1989 and their interactions with fisheries, from data gathered through interviews of fishermen. Our study shows a notable decrease in the seals’ range during the study period. Observations of seals on open beaches and exposed rocks decreased, while observations in caves increased. Important negative interactions between monk seals and fisheries were detected, with the most frequent interactions being bycatch in gillnets and bottom trawl nets. Reports obtained from fishermen clearly indicate that the seals were still being deliberately killed on land during the 20th century, which likely caused the extirpation of seal populations hauling out on beaches. We recommend that mortality due to fishery bycatch be added as a contributing factor to the decline of the monk seal populations in the region from 1940 to 1989. We also recommend conservation measures such as the establishment of a permanent marine reserve along the Atlantic Coast of the Cap Blanc Peninsula.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonachus monachus 3abeaches 3abycatch 3acaves 3acoasts 3aendangered species 3afishermen 3ageographical distribution 3agillnets 3ainterviews 3amortality 3apopulation dynamics 3arocks 3aseals 3atrawl nets 3aAtlantic Ocean 0aAtlantic Sahara 0adistribution 0aendangered species 0aMediterranean monk seal 0aseal-fishery interactions1 ade Larrinoa, Pablo Fernández0 tMammalia.g2012 Oct. 18, v. 77, no. 1 p.41-49dDe Gruyterx1864-15477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mammalia-2012-00463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001100152245009800163520136400261592002801625650001501653650001101668650002901679650001601708650002701724650001301751650001101764650001201775650002101787650001701808650000901825653002001834653000801854653002301862653003401885653003201919700001101951700005401962773009802016856008702114852000902201655001202210IND60753764220221117194524.0211213e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075376422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1180132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bo12aA system and game strategy for the isolated island electric-gas deeply coupled energy network  aFor the isolated island micro grid, a safe and reliable energy supply system is indispensable. Generally speaking, the power generation modules of an small and medium-sized isolated island energy system with off-grid power supply mode mainly include diesel generator(DIG) and distributed power supply. In order to smooth the power output fluctuation of wind and solar, coordinate the output of multiple energy generation technologies, and increase the penetration rate of distributed energy, it is necessary to develop a flexible and reliable energy system, and an efficient and smart scheduling strategy. In this paper, the power-to-gas (P2G) technology is introduced to construct a multi-energy complementary integrated energy system with deep coupling of power-gas network. Four possible game planning models are proposed by using game theory analysis method, and the energy scheduling strategies under each game mode are obtained by particle swarm optimization(PSO). By comparing the scheduling strategies under the four game modes, it can be found that the synergistic response of hydrogen and methane in the alliance cooperative game mode has absolute advantages in reducing the curtailment rate of wind and solar energy, balancing the income of each participant, improving the total income of the system, and saving energy and environmental protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3aenvironmental protection 3agame theory 3agenerators (equipment) 3ahydrogen 3aincome 3amethane 3apower generation 3asolar energy 3awind 0aIsolated island 0aP2G 0aDistributed energy 0aCoordination and optimization 0aParticle swarm optimization1 aLi, Xu1 aSu, Qingyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1355-67480 tApplied energy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 306 p.118013-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1180133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011700163300001600280500002000296520110000316592002801416650001801444650001301462650001401475650001301489650001201502650002701514650001901541650001201560650001601572650001201588650001901600651001001619700002801629700001401657700002501671773011501696856007301811852000901884655001201893IND60592403520221117224958.0180403e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059240352DNAL7 a10.1111/pbr.125712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaxena, Kul Bhushan10aMaternal inheritance of male sterility in the progeny of a natural hybrid between Cajanus lineatus and C. cajan  ap. 229-233.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAdoption of pigeonpea hybrids in central and southern India is showing high impact with on‐farm yield advantages of >30%. The hybrid pigeonpea technology, the first in any legume crop, is based on a cytoplasmic‐nuclear male‐sterility (CMS) system. For a long‐term sustainability of hybrid programme, it is imperative that both nuclear diversity and cytoplasmic diversity are maintained among hybrid parents. In this context, a continuous search for new CMS‐inducing cytoplasms is necessary. This paper reports detection of maternal inheritance of male sterility in the progeny derived from a natural hybrid between a wild relative [Cajanus lineatus (W. & A.) Maesen comb. nov.] of pigeonpea and an unknown pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] genotype. In the present study, the male sterility was maintained up to BC₇F₁ generation by an advanced breeding pigeonpea line ICPL 99044. This male sterility inducing cytoplasm of C. lineatus was tagged as A₆. In future, this CMS genetic stock can be used to develop a range of new pigeonpea hybrids with high yield and adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCajanus cajan 3abreeding 3acytoplasm 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3ainheritance (genetics) 3amale fertility 3aparents 3apigeon peas 3aprogeny 3awild relatives 3aIndia1 aKumar, Ravikotti Vijaya1 aRao, Rama1 aSaxena, Rachit Kumar0 tPlant breeding.g2018 Apr., v. 137, no. 2 p.229-233dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl40712x0179-95417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbr.125713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245010400205500001900309520171500328592002802043650001802071650001902089650001202108650001802120650002202138650002802160650001102188650001802199650003102217650001702248650001402265650001802279653003102297653001602328700002202344700002102366700002102387773011002408856008502518852000902603655001202612IND60730705820221122040558.0210527e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073070582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1168882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotiei, Asa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0436-128X10aEcotoxicological assessment of suspended solids: The importance of biofilm and particle aggregation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAssessment of microplastic impacts in biota is challenging due to the complex behavior of the test particles and their interactions with other particulates, including microorganisms, in the environment. To disentangle responses to microplastic exposure from those to other suspended solids, both microplastic and natural particles must be present in the test system. We evaluated how microplastic, non-plastic particles, and biofilms interacted in their effects on survivorship using acute toxicity assay with Daphnia magna. The animals were exposed to microplastic and kaolin at different concentrations of suspended solids (SS; 10, 100, and 1000 mg/L) with a varying microplastic contribution (%MP; 0–80%) and biofilm (presence/absence) associated with the solids. Also, we examined how these exposure parameters (SS, %MP, and Biofilm) affected aggregate formation that was analyzed using particle size distribution data. Under the exposure conditions, Daphnia mortality was primarily driven by SS concentration but ameliorated by both microplastic and biofilm. The ameliorating effects were related to increased particle aggregation in the presence of biofilm and high %MP. In addition, a weak yet significant positive effect of the biofilm on the survivorship was observed, presumably, due to microbial food supply to the daphniids in the exposure system; the bacteria were utilized at the absence of other food. Therefore, the effects of both natural and anthropogenic particulates depend on the particle behavior and aggregation in the water governed by microbial communities and physicochemical properties of the particles, which must be taken into account in the hazard assessment of plastic litter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aacute toxicity 3abiofilm 3aecotoxicology 3afood availability 3ahazard characterization 3akaolin 3amicroplastics 3aparticle size distribution 3aparticulates 3apollution 3asurvival rate 0aParticle hazardous effects 0aAggregation1 aOgonowski, Martin1 aReichelt, Sophia1 aGorokhova, Elena0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 July 01, v. 280 p.116888-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1168883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245019700162300002000359520181500379592002802194650001202222650001202234650001402246650001302260650001502273650002402288650001102312650001502323650001602338700002302354700001902377700002302396700002802419700006002447700002402507700001302531700005902544700007402603700006402677700002902741700005602770773014902826856007602975852000903051655001203060IND60622010420221121140139.0181123e20181023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062201042DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b079982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshida, Suguru10aHybrid Improper Ferroelectricity in (Sr,Ca)₃Sn₂O₇ and Beyond: Universal Relationship between Ferroelectric Transition Temperature and Tolerance Factor in n = 2 Ruddlesden–Popper Phases  ap. 15690-15700.  aHybrid improper ferroelectricity, which utilizes nonpolar but ubiquitous rotational/tilting distortions to create polarization, offers an attractive route to the discovery of new ferroelectric and multiferroic materials because its activity derives from geometric rather than electronic origins. Design approaches blending group theory and first principles can be utilized to explore the crystal symmetries of ferroelectric ground states, but in general, they do not make accurate predictions for some important parameters of ferroelectrics, such as Curie temperature (TC). Here, we establish a predictive and quantitative relationship between TC and the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, t, by employing n = 2 Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) A₃B₂O₇ as a prototypical example of hybrid improper ferroelectrics. The focus is placed on an RP system, (Sr₁–ₓCaₓ)₃Sn₂O₇ (x = 0, 0.1, and 0.2), which allows for the investigation of the purely geometric (ionic size) effect on ferroelectric transitions, due to the absence of the second-order Jahn–Teller active (d⁰ and 6s²) cations that often lead to ferroelectric distortions through electronic mechanisms. We observe a ferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition with TC = 410 K for Sr₃Sn₂O₇. We also find that the TC increases linearly up to 800 K upon increasing the Ca²⁺ content, i.e., upon decreasing the value of t. Remarkably, this linear relationship is applicable to the suite of all known A₃B₂O₇ hybrid improper ferroelectrics, indicating that the TC correlates with the simple crystal chemistry descriptor, t, based on the ionic size mismatch. This study provides a predictive guideline for estimating the TC of a given material, which would complement the convergent group-theoretical and first-principles design approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acations 3achemistry 3ageometry 3aguidelines 3amathematical theory 3amixing 3aprediction 3atemperature1 aAkamatsu, Hirofumi1 aTsuji, Ryosuke1 aHernandez, Olivier1 aPadmanabhan, Haricharan1 aSen Gupta, Arnab1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0801-65551 aGibbs, Alexandra S.1 aMibu, Ko1 aMurai, Shunsuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4597-973X1 aRondinelli, J.

Especially, the interaction between adipose tissue and liver is critical for the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. This study investigated the involvement of resveratrol (RSV) in the crosstalk between adipokine adiponectin and hepatokine fetuin-A. Adipocytes-hepatocytes co-culture system and a high-fat (HF) diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse model were utilized. Protein levels of adiponectin and fetuin-A were analyzed in adipocytes and hepatocytes with the knockdown of adiponectin and fetuin-A, respectively. After six weeks of the HF diet treatment, RSV was delivered via an osmotic pump for four weeks. The experimental groups were lean control fed with a standard diet, HF diet-induced obese control and HF_RSV (8 mg/kg/day). After 4 weeks of each treatment, blood and tissues were collected, and the levels of adiponectin and fetuin-A were analyzed. RNA interference during co-culture of adipocytes and hepatocytes demonstrated the existence of crosstalk between adiponectin and fetuin-A. The four-week RSV treatment resulted in increased serum adiponectin and decreased serum fetuin-A in diet-induced obesity mice. The serum levels of adiponectin and fetuin-A were inversely related. In epididymal fat depots, RSV increased adiponectin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha, PPAR gamma, sirtuin1 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). RSV lowered fetuin-A and NF-κB, and increased liver AMPK. These results demonstrate the crosstalk between adiponectin and fetuin-A, and suggest that RSV may be involved in adipose tissue and liver crosstalk through the interaction between adiponectin and fetuin-A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aRNA interference 3aadipocytes 3aadiponectin 3aadipose tissue 3aanimal models 3ablood serum 3acoculture 3adiet 3aepididymis 3aglucose 3ahepatocytes 3ahomeostasis 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3amice 3aobesity 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3aresveratrol 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aAdiponectin 0aCo-culture 0aCrosstalk 0aFetuin-A 0aResveratrol1 aLim, Yunsook1 aYang, Soo Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7892-76480 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2015 Nov., v. 26 p.1254-1260dElsevier Inc.x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2015.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010800156300001800264520163500282592002801917650003001945650001901975650002801994650001202022650002202034650001302056650001302069650002602082650001802108653002302126653001502149653002202164653000902186700002502195700001702220700002302237700002102260700002002281700001802301773011902319856007502438852000902513655001202522IND60568266020180516000000.0170503e20120907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056826602DNAL7 a10.1021/pr300521p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLooso, Mario10aSpiked-in Pulsed in Vivo Labeling Identifies a New Member of the CCN Family in Regenerating Newt Hearts  ap. 4693-4704.  aThe newt Notophthalmus viridescens, which belongs to the family of salamanders (Urodela), owns remarkable regenerative capacities allowing efficient scar-free repair of various organs including the heart. Salamanders can regrow large parts of the myocardium unlike mammals, which cannot replace lost cardiomyocytes efficiently. Unfortunately, very little is known about the molecules and the regulatory circuits facilitating efficient heart regeneration in newts or salamanders. To identify proteins that are involved in heart regeneration, we have developed a pulsed SILAC-based mass spectrometry method based on the detection of paired peptide peaks after ¹³C₆-lysine incorporation into proteins in vivo. Proteins were identified by matching mass spectrometry derived peptide sequences to a recently established normalized newt EST library. Our approach enabled us to identify more than 2200 nonredundant proteins in the regenerating newt heart. Because of the pulsed in vivo labeling approach, accurate quantification was achieved for 1353 proteins, of which 72 were up- and 31 down-regulated with a (|log 2 ratio| > 1) during heart regeneration. One deregulated member was identified as a new member of the CCN protein family, showing a wound specific activation. We reason that the detection of such deregulated newt-specific proteins in regenerating hearts supports the idea of a local evolution of tissue regeneration in salamanders. Our results significantly improve understanding of dynamic changes in the complex protein network that underlies heart regeneration and provides a basis for further mechanistic studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNotophthalmus viridescens 3acardiomyocytes 3aexpressed sequence tags 3amammals 3amass spectrometry 3aproteins 3aproteome 3asalamanders and newts 3atissue repair 0aheart regeneration 0aproteomics 0amass spectrometry 0anewt1 aMichel, Christian

This study investigated scores on an in‐training evaluation in use at one veterinary school to determine the dimensions being assessed and the influence of the dimensions on the overall score awarded. Common factor analysis and ordinal logistic regression were conducted on a retrospective sample of 3466 evaluations of 197 final year veterinary students. The findings suggested a higher‐order dimensional structure, with one overarching factor and two to four subfactors, consistent with the complex construct of competency that thSAS Institute e assessment was intended to assess. In the four ‐factor model, all dimensions were significantly related to overall grade, with the effects of the professional attitude factor and the knowledge factor dependent on the placement. The professional attitude factor had the strongest effect on overall grade (β=2.71, P=0.0004). There was a significant effect of placement on overall grade (P=0.021). Neither academic status of the supervisor nor grade point average had significant effects on the overall grade (P>0.49), and a student's overall grade did not significantly differ over time (P=1). The results suggest that the complexity of supervisor judgement is effectively represented in evaluation scores.  aPublisher supplied data  cMassey University 3afactor analysis 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aveterinary schools0 tVeterinary record.g2019 May, v. 184, no. 18 p.557-557dBMJ Publishing Group LimitedwJournal:jnl45502x0042-49007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vr.1050333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01596naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008000161300001800241500002000259520054800279592002800827650002800855650002300883650000900906650002000915700002200935700002200957700002300979700002001002700002001022773013301042856007401175852000901249655001201258IND60592403920221117225053.0180403e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059240392DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.289922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurakami, Takuya10aSynthesis of PEO‐based physical gels with tunable viscoelastic properties  ap. 1033-1038.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA major challenge in physical gel systems is tailoring of rheological properties, with future applications being enabled by the development of a robust strategy for tuning viscoelasticity in a wide range.

Our specific objectives were to (1) construct a continuous spatial model of brook trout distribution and habitat quality at the stream reach scale; (2) characterize brook trout vulnerability to climate change under a range of future climate scenarios; and (3) identify multi‐scale restoration and protection priorities for brook trout across the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Boosted regression tree analysis predicted brook trout occurrence at the stream reach scale with a high degree of accuracy (CV AUC = 0.92) as a function of both natural (e.g., water temperature and precipitation) and anthropogenic (e.g., agriculture and urban development) landscape and climatic attributes. Current land use activities result in a predicted loss of occurrence in over 11,000 stream segments (40% of suitable habitat) and account for over 15,000 km (45% of current value) of lost functional brook trout fishery value (i.e., length‐weighted occurrence probability) in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Climate change (increased ambient temperatures and altered precipitation) is projected to result in a loss of occurrence in at least 3000 additional segments (19% of current value) and at least 3000 km of functional fishery value (9% of current value) by 2062. Model outcomes were used to identify low‐ and high‐quality stream segments within relatively intact and degraded sub‐watersheds as restoration and protection priorities, respectively, and conservation priorities were targeted in watersheds with high projected resilience to climate change. Our results suggest that traditional restoration activities, such as habitat enhancement, riparian management, and barrier removal, may be able to recover a substantial amount of brook trout habitat lost to historic landscape change. However, restoration efforts must be designed within the context of expected impacts from climate change or those efforts may not produce long‐term benefits to brook trout in this region.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cVirginia Agricultural Experiment Station Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100013141  aOIA‐1458952cNational Science Foundation  a0233616cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture  cWest Virginia Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalvelinus fontinalis 3aambient temperature 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afisheries 3ahabitats 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aplanning 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3astreams 3asubwatersheds 3aurban development 3awater temperature 3aChesapeake Bay1 aPetty, J.

Most of these techniques are ensemble methods that can provide association constants and in some cases stoichiometry. Here we use charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS), a single particle technique, to probe the interactions of antigen binding fragments (Fabs) from a series of antibodies with the canine parvovirus (CPV) capsid. In addition to providing the average number of bound Fabs as a function of Fab concentration (i.e., the binding curve), CDMS measurements provide information about the distribution of bound Fabs. We show that the distribution of bound ligands is much better at distinguishing between different binding models than the binding curve. The binding of Fab E to CPV is a textbook example. A maximum of 60 Fabs bind and the results are consistent with a model where all sites have the same binding affinity. However, for Fabs B, F, and 14, the distributions can only be fit by a model where there are distinct virus subpopulations with different binding affinities. This behavior can be distinguished from a situation where all CPV particles are identical, and each particle has the same distribution of sites with different binding affinities. The different responses to viral heterogeneity can be traced to the Fab binding sites. A comparison of Fab binding to new and aged CPV capsids reveals that a post-translational modification at the binding site for Fab E (M569) probably reduces the binding affinity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarnivore protoparvovirus 1 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abinding capacity 3abinding sites 3acapsid 3aligands 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apost-translational modification 3aproteins 3astoichiometry 3aviruses1 aCallaway, Heather M.1 aParrish, Colin R.1 aJarrold, Martin F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7084-176X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Nov. 06, v. 140, no. 46 p.15701-15711dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b080503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009400156300001800250520147400268592002801742650001801770650001601788650001901804650001001823650001601833650001601849650001501865650003001880650001001910650001701920650000901937650001101946650001301957650000901970650001301979650002001992650002902012650001002041653001402051653001702065653000802082653002402090653000802114653002002122700001502142700002102157700002502178700001502203700001602218700001602234773013402250856007502384852000902459655001202468IND60568266220221119040927.0170503e20120907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056826622DNAL7 a10.1021/pr300533a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xiu-Ju10aSystems Responses of Rats to Mequindox Revealed by Metabolic and Transcriptomic Profiling  ap. 4712-4721.  aMequindox is used as an antibiotic drug in livestock; however, its toxicity remains largely unclear. Previously, we investigated metabolic responses of mice to mequindox exposure. In order to evaluate dependences of animal species in response to mequindox insult, we present the metabolic consequences of mequindox exposure in a rat model, by employing the combination of metabonomics and transcriptomics. Metabolic profiling of urine revealed that metabolic recovery is achieved for rats exposed to a low or moderate dose of mequindox, whereas high levels of mequindox exposure trigger liver dysfunction, causing no such recovery. We found that mequindox exposure causes suppression of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and stimulation of glycolysis, which is in contrast to a mouse model previously investigated. In addition, mequindox dosage induces promotion of β-oxidation of fatty acids, which was confirmed by elevated expressions of acox1, hsd17b2, and cpt1a in liver. Furthermore, altered levels of N-methylnicotinate, 1-methylnicotinamide, and glutathione disulfide highlighted the promotion of vitamin B3 antioxidative cycle in rats exposed to mequindox. Moreover, mequindox exposure altered levels of gut microbiotal related co-metabolites, suggesting a perturbation of the gut microflora of the host. Our work provides a comprehensive view of the toxicological effects of mequindox, which is important in the usage of mequindox in animal and human food safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantibiotics 3abeta oxidation 3adrugs 3afatty acids 3aglutathione 3aglycolysis 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aliver 3ametabolomics 3amice 3aniacin 3aproteome 3arats 3atoxicity 3atranscriptomics 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3aurine 0amequindox 0ametabonomics 0aNMR 0apattern recognition 0arat 0atranscriptomics1 aHao, Fuhua1 aHuang, Chongyang1 aRantalainen, Mattias1 aLei, Hehua1 aTang, Huiru1 aWang, Yulan0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2012 Sept. 07, v. 11, no. 9 p.4712-4721dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fpr300533a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245013100182520156800313592002801881650001101909650001901920650001601939650003201955650002001987650001602007650001102023650001802034650001402052650001202066653002702078653001702105653002102122653002002143653002002163653002302183700002502206700001602231700001602247773011302263856008602376852000902462655001202471IND60692629520221123015713.0201025e20200820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069262952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1219092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaena-Moreno, Francisco M.10aBio-methane and bio-methanol co-production from biogas: A profitability analysis to explore new sustainable chemical processes  aHerein a potential synergy between biogas upgrading and CO₂ conversion to bio-methanol is investigated. This novel idea arises as an alternative path to the traditional biogas – to – bio-methane route which involves CO₂ separation. In this work a techno-economic analysis of the process was performed to study the profitability for potential investors. A total of 15 scenarios were analysed. Different biogas plant sizes were examined as baseline scenarios: 100, 250, 500, and 1000 m³/h. Furthermore the potential effect of governmental incentives through bio-methane subsidies (feed-in tariffs and investment percentage) was studied. Finally a sensitivity analysis was developed to study the effect of key parameters. The results of the baseline scenarios demonstrated that not profitable results can be obtained without subsidies. Bio-methane subsidies as feed-in tariffs proved to be effective for the 500 and 1000 m³/h plant sizes. For a feed-in tariff subsidy of 40 €/MW, 500 m³/h biogas production plants are remarkably profitable (net present value equal to 3106 k€). Concerning 1000 m³/h biogas production plants, 20 €/MW of subsidies as feed-in tariffs gives similar net present value result. Our results point out that only big biogas production can produce bio-methanol at profitable margins under 90–100% of investment subsidied. The sensitivity analysis showed that electricity, natural gas and bio-methanol price can affect considerably to the overall profitability, converting predicted positive cases in negative scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectricity 3agas production (biological) 3agreen chemistry 3anatural gas 3aprices 3aprofitability 3asubsidies 3atariffs 0aBio-methane production 0aBio-methanol 0aBiogas upgrading 0aCO2 utilisation 0aGreen-chemicals 0aWaste valorization1 aPastor-Pérez, Laura1 aWang, Qiang1 aReina, T.R.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Aug. 20, v. 265 p.121909-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1219093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04298naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245011900201500002000320520268800340592002803028596007703056596005203133596003003185596005603215650001703271650002403288650001103312650001703323650002003340650001903360650001103379650002503390650001703415650001103432650001903443650001903462650001203481650001603493650001503509651001803524700002303542700006303565773010603628856007303734852000903807655001203816IND60632457320221121033354.0190314e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063245732DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.25962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcManamay, Ryan A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5551-314010aCommonalities in stream connectivity restoration alternatives: an attempt to simplify barrier removal optimization  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMovement within stream corridors is a basic life history requirement of many aquatic organisms. Barrier removal in streams has become a common practice in the United States aimed to restore organism dispersal and meet conservation objectives; however, there are social and economic costs to the removal of barriers. Accordingly, tools to prioritize barrier removal, particularly optimization techniques, can be used to evaluate cost‐benefit trade‐offs. Many of these techniques, however, require programming experience and are not available to natural resource managers. Furthermore, conservation objectives vary considerably depending on the life histories of organisms under consideration, and these opposing objectives, in conjunction with variant socioeconomic costs, will influence optimization solutions, specifically which barriers to remove. To promote the use of optimization tools, straightforward and open‐access platforms are needed to support use by managers, while also providing general approaches for holistic basin‐scale connectivity restoration. Herein, we use two case studies, White Oak Creek (small watershed) and the Roanoke River Basin (large basin), to explore the divergent outcomes stemming from different conservation objectives and socioeconomic costs used to prioritize barrier removal. We conducted optimization modeling using a widely accessible platform along with an open‐access solver plug‐in to support a wide variety of conservation objectives. We used simple approaches to find commonalities in barriers identified for removal among divergent conservation objectives and provide alternative (i.e., hybrid removal‐passage) strategies for approaching habitat restoration for diverse aquatic communities while increasing social benefits (i.e., hydropower energy). As expected, different conservation objectives aimed to support varied species life histories (e.g., diadromy, large‐river vs. small‐river potamodromy) have very different effects on optimization solutions. In both case studies, however, commonalities in solutions were identified through clustering groups of barriers into general connectivity restoration strategies. Furthermore, strategy types for a given barrier could be predicted with ≥72% accuracy using only four metrics. This suggests that optimization results can be simplified into general standards to support adoption of sustainable basin connectivity criteria strategies. Our framework provides a flexible and open‐access approach to conduct relatively complex optimization modeling for stream barrier prioritization, while examining potential for agreement among divergence conservation objectives.  aPublisher supplied data  cORNL Environmental Protection Services Division's Water Quality Programs  cY12 Biological Monitoring and Abatement Program  cU.S. Department of Energy  aDEAC05‐00OR22725cWater Power Technologies Office 3aQuercus alba 3aaquatic communities 3abasins 3acase studies 3adiadromous fish 3aeconomic costs 3aenergy 3ahabitat conservation 3alife history 3amodels 3aprioritization 3asocial benefit 3astreams 3awater power 3awatersheds 3aUnited States1 aPerkin, Joshuah S.1 aJager, Henriette I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4253-533X0 tEcosphere.g2019 Feb., v. 10, no. 2 p.e02596-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.25963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009200170300001600262520119700278592002801475650003101503650001101534650002001545650002301565650001201588650001501600650001301615650001201628650001801640650002201658650001101680650001101691650001101702651001001713653002201723653002501745653001301770653001701783653001801800700003001818700002101848700002401869773008001893856008201973852000902055655001202064IND60520288220221119170153.0160519e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052028822DNAL7 a10.1515/mammalia-2011-01342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía, Karla P.10aAssessing rodent community responses in disturbed environments of the Chilean Patagonia  ap. 195-204.  aThe effects of a perturbation gradient on a Patagonian rodent community were assessed over the course of a year by comparing the community parameters in natural and different disturbed environments in the central Chilean Patagonia. The studied habitat types were mature forest, second-growth forest, forest plantations, and agricultural grassland. We recorded eight species of sigmodontine rodents (Abrothrix longipilis, Abrothrix olivaceus, Chelemys macronyx, Geoxus valdivianus, Irenomys tarsalis, Loxodontomys micropus, Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, and Reithrodon auritus). Most species experience an increment in abundance from summer to autumn, with a notable decrease in winter and spring. The grassland showed lower species abundance than the mature forest. However, we did not detect significant differences in diversity, evenness, or species richness among the forest habitats. Our results suggest that rodents basically distinguish between forested and open areas, but not the specific plant composition of each habitat. Thus, the change in land use in the central Chilean Patagonia has not significantly affected the community parameters of diversity, evenness, or species richness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOligoryzomys longicaudatus 3aautumn 3aforest habitats 3aforest plantations 3aforests 3agrasslands 3aland use 3arodents 3asecond growth 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3aChile 0aChilean Patagonia 0acommunity parameters 0aland use 0aperturbation 0aSigmodontinae1 aZapata, Juan Carlos Ortiz1 aAguayo, Mauricio1 aD’Elia, Guillermo0 tMammalia.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 77, no. 2 p.195-204dDe Gruyterx1864-15477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mammalia-2011-01343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245009700169300001800266500002000284520124900304592002801553650004401581650001301625650001101638650001501649650002301664650003801687650001901725650001101744650001801755650002301773650002201796650002101818650004401839650001901883650001801902650002001920650002101940650001201961700002301973700004001996700004802036773013302084856007402217852000902291655001202300IND60592404020221117224850.0180403e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059240402DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.289782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerraz, Fernando Augusto10aBio‐based comb‐like copolymers derived from alkyl 10‐undecenoates and maleic anhydride  ap. 1039-1045.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this article, 10‐undecenoic acid, based on castor oil, was used a raw material for the synthesis of alternating copolymers. ω‐Unsaturated fatty esters as alkyl 10‐undecenoates were prepared by the esterification reaction of 10‐undecenoic acid with alkyl alcohol. A series of comb‐like copolymers were synthesized by free radical polymerization from maleic anhydride and alkyl 10‐undecenoates copolymers with different length of alkyl side chains in a toluene solution. These copolymers were investigated by ¹H and ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The copolymers were obtained in a low molecular weight in a range 3370–12,240 g mol⁻¹ and their structural characterization indicated the formation of alternating copolymers. DSC characterization revealed that these comb‐like copolymers showed amorphous to semicrystalline behavior by increasing the length of side chains. The bio‐based comb‐like copolymers allow for the development of new polymeric materials for several applications. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

In this study, silicon kerf waste is collected by a two-step sintering method (TSS) to obtain a ceramic product for the first time and its effect on the leaching behavior of silicon kerf was assessed. The results show that the relative density and grain size of silicon kerf ceramic could reach 91.72% and 0.75 μm under TSS3-10 h condition (1400 °C in the first stage and 1350 °C for 10 h in the second stage). The TSS process is confirmed to be beneficial for decomposing silicon oxide layer and promoting densification. Acid leaching experiment was conducted and the relationship between the relative density and impurity extraction was evaluated. It was found that the removal rate of impurities (except oxygen) from silicon kerf by direct acid leaching was higher than that through TSS3-10 h and acid leaching. However, the combined process can reduce 52.4% oxygen content and the yield of silicon was reached 96.03%. The present study aims to shed light on the feasible application of TSS on the hydrometallurgical recycling of silicon kerf.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceramics 3aleaching 3aoxygen 3arecycling 3asawing 3asilica 3asilicon 3awastes 0aSilicon kerf 0aRecovery 0aPurification 0aTwo-step sintering 0aAcid leaching1 aSheng, Wang1 aHuang, Liuqing1 aZhang, Chentong1 aTang, Xueyuan1 aLuo, Xuetao0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Aug. 20, v. 265 p.121911-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1219113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04443naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011600158500002000274520259300294592002802887596006202915596008002977596002303057596001003080596001903090596004503109596005503154650002703209650001503236650001803251650002003269650002203289650002203311650002503333650001503358650001703373650002303390650001103413650002203424650001503446651002303461700001803484700002303502700002303525700002003548700002003568700002103588700002303609700002303632700002203655773010603677856007303783852000903856655001203865IND60632457420221121033307.0190314e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063245742DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.25892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMims, Meryl C.10aSimulating demography, genetics, and spatially explicit processes to inform reintroduction of a threatened char  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe success of species reintroductions can depend on a combination of environmental, demographic, and genetic factors. Although the importance of these factors in the success of reintroductions is well‐accepted, they are typically evaluated independently, which can miss important interactions. For species that persist in metapopulations, movement through and interaction with the landscape is predicted to be a vital component of persistence. Simulation‐based approaches are a promising technique for evaluating the independent and combined effects of these factors on the outcome of various reintroduction and associated management actions. We report results from a simulation study of bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) reintroduction to three watersheds of the Pend Oreille River system in northeastern Washington State, USA. We used an individual‐based, spatially explicit simulation model to evaluate how reintroduction strategies, life history variation, and riverscape structure (e.g., network topology) interact to influence the demographic and genetic characteristics of reintroduced bull trout populations in three watersheds. Simulation scenarios included a range of initial genetic stocks (informed by empirical bull trout genetic data), variation in migratory tendency and life history, and two landscape connectivity alternatives representing a connected network (isolation‐by‐distance) and a fragmented network (isolation‐by‐barrier, using the known existing barriers). A novel feature of these simulations was the ability to consider the interaction of both demographic and genetic (i.e., demogenetic) factors in riverscapes with implicit asymmetric movement probabilities across the barriers. We found that connectivity (presence or absence of barriers) had the largest effect on demographic and genetic outcomes over 200 yr, with a greater effect than both initial genetic diversity and life history variation. We also identified regions of the study system in which bull trout populations persisted across a wide range of demographic, life history, and environmental connectivity parameters. Finally, we found no evidence that initial neutral genetic diversity influenced genetic diversity and structure after 200 yr; instead, genetic drift due to stray rate and population isolation dominated and erased any initial differences in genetic diversity. Our results highlight the utility of spatially explicit demogenetic approaches in exploring and understanding population dynamics—and their implications for management strategies—in fresh waters.  aPublisher supplied data  aNNX14AC91GcNational Aeronautics and Space Administration  cMendenhall Research Fellowship Program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)  cSeattle City Light  cUSFWS  cKalispel Tribe  cClimate and Land Use Change Mission Area  cUSGS Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center 3aSalvelinus confluentus 3ademography 3agenetic drift 3agenetic factors 3agenetic resources 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat connectivity 3alandscapes 3alife history 3amigratory behavior 3arivers 3asimulation models 3awatersheds 3aWashington (state)1 aDay, Casey C.1 aBurkhart, Jacob J.1 aFuller, Matthew R.1 aHinkle, Jameson1 aBearlin, Andrew1 aDunham, Jason B.1 aDeHaan, Patrick W.1 aHolden, Zachary A.1 aLandguth, Erin E.0 tEcosphere.g2019 Feb., v. 10, no. 2 p.e02589-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.25893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003600147245011800183300001800301520137300319592002801692650002701720650004701747650001501794650002601809650001901835650001501854650002101869651001801890700001401908700001801922773012601940856008202066852000902148655001202157IND60595203020221116205844.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059520302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-018-1989-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuental, Miguel Pacheco Arruda,10aEvaluation of Multiple Satellite-Based Soil Moisture Products over Continental U.S. Based on In Situ Measurements  ap. 3233-3246.  aMeasurements of soil water content are of great importance for climatic researches and hydrological applications. Satellite remote sensing techniques have provided convenient access to global soil moisture data at high temporal resolution. The evaluation of remotely sensed soil moisture products from multiple sensors are fundamental for understanding the quality and usefulness of the products and are helpful for the improvements of the retrieval algorithms. In this study, we evaluated four satellite-based soil moisture products against two in situ networks over continental U.S. These products are the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth observing system (AMSR-E), the Fengyun-3B/Microwave Radiation Imager (FY-3B/MWRI), and the Essential Climate Variable (ECV) soil moisture products. The evaluation results show that the temporal characteristics of ECV and SMOS soil moisture products are consistent with those of in situ measurements. Larger errors and bias exist in AMSR-E and FY-3B/MWRI over the study region. In general, the ECV product performs the best comparing with other products. Therefore, the ECV product is recommended in regional hydrological applications and water resource management over the continental U.S. for its good performance in absolute values and soil moisture anomalies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth Observing System 3aSoil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite 3aalgorithms 3amicrowave radiometers 3aremote sensing 3asoil water 3awater management 3aUnited States1 aSong, Jia1 aZhao, Xiaodan0 tWater resources management.g2018 July, v. 32, no. 9 p.3233-3246dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-018-1989-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04310naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100007000186245017100256300001600427506007600443520208800519592002802607596005702635506003702692650001102729650001102740650001102751650002102762650002402783650001602807650001602823650001902839650001502858650001102873650001402884650001702898650001902915650001102934650002602945650001502971651001802986653002703004653001603031653001603047653001403063653002603077700005803103700002003161700001903181700002103200700002003221700002003241700001803261700001703279700002603296700002003322700002503342700002503367773014303392856008003535852000903615655001203624IND60621549420221207103829.0181203e20170701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062154942DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.116.1439252doi7 aPMC54861932pmcid7 a285663112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPearson-Stuttard, Jonathan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2175-997510aComparing effectiveness of mass media campaigns with price reductions targeting fruit and vegetable intake on US cardiovascular disease mortality and race disparities  ap. 199-206.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: A low intake of fruits and vegetables (F&Vs) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the United States. Both mass media campaigns (MMCs) and economic incentives may increase F&V consumption. Few data exist on their comparative effectiveness. Objective: We estimated CVD mortality reductions potentially achievable by price reductions and MMC interventions targeting F&V intake in the US population. Design: We developed a US IMPACT Food Policy Model to compare 3 policies targeting F&V intake across US adults from 2015 to 2030: national MMCs and national F&V price reductions of 10% and 30%. We accounted for differences in baseline diets, CVD rates, MMC coverage, MMC duration, and declining effects over time. Outcomes included cumulative CVD (coronary heart disease and stroke) deaths prevented or postponed and life-years gained (LYGs) over the study period, stratified by age, sex, and race. Results: A 1-y MMC in 2015 would increase the average national F&V consumption by 7% for 1 y and prevent ∼18,600 CVD deaths (95% CI: 17,600, 19,500), gaining ∼280,100 LYGs by 2030. With a 15-y MMC, increased F&V consumption would be sustained, yielding a 3-fold larger reduction (56,100; 95% CI: 52,400, 57,700) in CVD deaths. In comparison, a 10% decrease in F&V prices would increase F&V consumption by ∼14%. This would prevent ∼153,300 deaths (95% CI: 146,400, 159,200), gaining ∼2.51 million LYGs. For a 30% price decrease, resulting in a 42% increase in F&V consumption, corresponding values would be 451,900 CVD deaths prevented or postponed (95% CI: 433,100, 467,500) and 7.3 million LYGs gained. Effects were similar by sex, with a smaller proportional effect and larger absolute effects at older ages. A 1-y MMC would be 35% less effective in preventing CVD deaths in non-Hispanic blacks than in whites. In comparison, price-reduction policies would have equitable proportional effects. Conclusion: Both national MMCs and price-reduction policies could reduce US CVD mortality, with price reduction being more powerful and sustainable.  aPublisher supplied data  aR01HL115189cNIHdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000020 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBlacks 3aWhites 3aadults 3acoronary disease 3aeconomic incentives 3afood policy 3afood prices 3afruit products 3amass media 3amodels 3amortality 3arisk factors 3arisk reduction 3astroke 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables 3aUnited States 0acardiovascular disease 0adisparities 0afood policy 0anutrition 0afruits and vegetables1 aBandosz, Piotr1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6395-62161 aRehm, Colin D.,1 aAfshin, Ashkan1 aPeñalvo, Jose L1 aWhitsel, Laurie1 aDanaei, Goodarz1 aMicha, Renata1 aGaziano, Tom1 aLloyd-Williams, Ffion1 aCapewell, Simon1 aMozaffarian, Dariush1 aO’Flaherty, Martin0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2017 July 01, v. 106, no. 1 p.199-206dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45206x1938-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.1439253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03561naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009300169300001800262500001500280520202900295592002802324650001702352650001402369650001102383650001802394650000902412650001302421650001602434650001602450650000702466650001702473650001302490650002002503650001102523650002502534650001402559650000902573650001402582653001102596653003102607653002702638653002102665653002202686653001002708653001202718700002102730700001902751700002702770773011502797856008602912852000902998655001203007IND60565001420221120110415.0180831e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056500142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.08.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumari, Anjan10aClean process for recovery of metals and recycling of acid from the leach liquor of PCBs  ap. 4826-4834.  a2019-12-06  aThe present work reports the application oriented systematic basic studies for the recovery of copper, nickel and iron from scrap printed circuit boards (PCBs) of computer. Initially, the PCBs were depopulated and crushed with the help of scutter-crusher and then subjected to pyrolysis under vacuum at 300 °C for 4 min. Thereafter, this pyrolysed PCBs (poly-cracked PCBs) were further beneficiated to separate high and low metal concentrate (small fraction). The small fraction (−10 mesh size) of poly-cracked PCBs was leached in 2.4 M H2SO4 at 150 °C maintaining 20 bar pressure and pulp density 100 g/L. Systematic scientific studies were also carried out to recover base metals (Cu, Fe and Ni) from leach liquor of small fraction of poly-cracked PCBs. To recover acid from the leach liquor, the experiments were carried out using 70% TEHA diluted in kerosene, which resulted in the extraction of 99.99% H2SO4 in three stages at O/A ratio 2/1 in 5 min. The recovered acid could be recycled for leaching of materials in continuous close loop of operation. Subsequently, air sparging was performed to separate and recover Fe as precipitate. After the recovery of acid and iron from the leach liquor, the solution was further processed to recover Cu using 10% LIX 84IC diluted in kerosene. 99.99% copper was found to be extracted in two stages at pH 2.5, O/A ratio 1/1 in 5 min, leaving Ni in the raffinate. Further, nickel was separated completely from the solution in two stages using 1% LIX 84IC at pH 4.58, O/A ratio 2/1 in 15 min. From the pure metallic solutions, the pure metal and its salt could be produced using electrolysis, evaporation, crystallization etc. The novel pyro-hydro hybrid metallurgical process consists of pyrolysis–beneficiation–leaching–solvent extraction for the recovery of metals from scrap PCBs is reported. The developed process is cleaner and environmental with zero waste generation concept and has potential to be commercialized after validation on pilot scale trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair sparging 3acomputers 3acopper 3asulfuric acid 3airon 3aleaching 3azero wastes 3aevaporation 3apH 3aelectrolysis 3akerosene 3acrystallization 3anickel 3aelectronic equipment 3apyrolysis 3apulp 3arecycling 0aCopper 0aSolvent extraction process 0aPhysical beneficiation 0aVacuum pyrolysis 0aPoly-cracked PCBs 0aH2SO4 0areports1 aJha, Manis Kumar1 aLee, Jae-Chun,1 aSingh, Rajendra Prasad0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 112 p.4826-4834dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245009900164300001600263520172500279592002802004650001702032650002002049650001502069650001602084650001902100650001902119651001002138653002002148653001002168653001102178653002802189653001702217653001902234700002302253700002202276773014002298856007802438852000902516655001202525IND60788636320221118173515.0220909e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078863632DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2022.00112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeier, Josephine10aWest Nile Virus Seroprevalence and Cross-Neutralization in Sera from Eastern and Central Sudan  ap. 472-477.  aObjectives: In regions with co-existing flaviviruses, the diagnosis of previous West Nile virus (WNV) infections is challenging due to cross-reacting antibodies. The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of previous WNV infections in sera from three Sudanese states by excluding potentially dengue virus (DENV) and ZIKV cross-reacting sera and to determine the percentage of WNV cross-neutralizing sera from individuals with previous DENV infection. Methods: Serum samples from Kassala, North Kordofan, and Red Sea state were screened for antibodies against DENV by ELISA. Sera without DENV antibodies (N = 106) and a matched set of sera with DENV antibodies (N = 108) was selected. In all blood samples the frequency of WNV-neutralizing antibodies and the antibody titers were measured with microplate neutralization assays. DENV and Zika virus (ZIKV) microplate neutralization assays were performed with all WNV neutralizing sera of the DENV negative group. Results: A fraction of 30.2% of the DENV antibody negative sera neutralized WNV. The seroprevalence increased with age from 9.5% to 41.7%. Men and women were equally affected. The percentage of DENV positive sera that neutralized WNV was 83.3%. DENV positive sera had higher WNV neutralization titers than DENV negative sera. Conclusions: A significant fraction of the DENV antibody negative sera from three regions in Sudan showed serologic evidence of previous WNV infection. In comparison, the large majority of DENV antibody positive sera had WNV neutralizing antibodies. Studies are needed to identify clinical cases of WNV infection and to determine whether individuals with cross-neutralizing antibodies are protected from WNV disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDengue virus 3aWest Nile virus 3aZika virus 3ablood serum 3aneutralization 3aseroprevalence 3aSudan 0aWest Nile virus 0aSudan 0aAfrica 0aseroepidemiologic study 0adengue virus 0across-reaction1 aAdam, Awadalkareem1 aJassoy, Christian0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 22, no. 9 p.472-477dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2022.00113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245011600215300001800331520110700349592002801456650001801484650001001502650001301512650002601525650001401551650002001565650002101585650001701606650001601623650001101639650001701650650002801667700003101695700001801726700002401744773013001768856008301898852000901981655001201990IND60739438620221120075204.0210731e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073943862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-021-02394-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMógor, Atila Francisco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4199-907910aBiostimulant action of Lithothamnium sp. promoting growth, yield, and biochemical and chemical changes on onion  ap. 1905-1913.  aThe development of new natural biostimulant sources for a sustainable agriculture is a strategic issue aiming to improve the healthy food production. In this sense, the goal was to identify the biostimulant action of the calcareous alga Lithothamnium sp. (Rhodophyta) on onion in two experiments, (i) in pots and (ii) at field under organic system, both in factorial scheme with two onion cultivars and foliar sprays with micronized Lithothamnium sp. at concentration of 1.5 and 3.0 g L⁻¹. The plant growth promotion and commercial yield improvement of two onion cultivars were achieved and related to changes on amino acid metabolism and source-to-sink flow stimuli. Better nutrient acquisition also was achieved related to the stimuli to thin roots growth, with N, Mg, Mn, Zn, and Cu content in bulbs improved at 3.0 g L⁻¹, while 1.5 g L⁻¹ allowed highest Ca, Mg, Mn, and Zn content in bulbs. Thus, the results presents Lithothamnium sp. as novel biostimulant source to grow onion, which effects related to the presence of bioactive humic acid that calcareous algae release by micronization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithothamnium 3aalgae 3aalgology 3aamino acid metabolism 3acultivars 3afood production 3agrowth promotion 3ahealthy diet 3ahumic acids 3aonions 3aplant growth 3asustainable agriculture1 aAmatussi, Juliana Oliveira1 aMógor, Gilda1 aGemin, Luiz Gabriel0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2021 June, v. 33, no. 3 p.1905-1913dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-021-02394-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001900192245005800211300001800269506007600287520092800363592002801291506003701319650002701356650001201383650001201395650001101407650001201418650001901430650002101449650002001470653002001490653001201510653002101522653001901543653002101562653002201583653002201605700001501627773015601642856008601798852000901884655001201893IND60539322620221207142626.0190215e20150622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053932262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2015.05.0052doi7 aPMC44585072pmcid7 a259791762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Kyung Won10aNeuronal responses to stress and injury in C. elegans  ap. 1644-1652.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe nervous system plays critical roles in the stress response. Animals can survive and function under harsh conditions, and resist and recover from injuries because neurons perceive and respond to various stressors through specific regulatory mechanisms. Caenorhabditis elegans has served as an excellent model to discover fundamental mechanisms underlying the neuronal response to stress. The basic physiological processes that C. elegans exhibits under stress conditions are similar to those observed in higher organisms. Many molecular pathways activated by environmental and cellular stresses are also conserved. In this review, we summarize major findings in examining neuronal responses to hypoxia, oxidative stress, osmotic stress, and traumatic injury. These studies from C. elegans have provided novel insights into our understanding of neuronal responses to stress at the molecular, cellular, and circuit levels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aanimals 3ahypoxia 3amodels 3aneurons 3aosmotic stress 3aoxidative stress 3astress response 0aStress response 0aHypoxia 0aOxidative stress 0aOsmotic stress 0aTraumatic injury 0aAxon regeneration 0aNeurodegeneration1 aJin, Yishi0 tFEBS letters.g2015 June 22, v. 589, no. 14 p.1644-1652dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2015.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015800169300001800327520164700345592002801992650002002020650002802040650002002068650001102088650002402099650001602123650002502139651000902164700002602173773012602199856008202325852000902407655001202416IND60595203420221116205648.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059520342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-018-1970-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehdizadeh, Saeid12aA Comparative Study of Autoregressive, Autoregressive Moving Average, Gene Expression Programming and Bayesian Networks for Estimating Monthly Streamflow  ap. 3001-3022.  aIn the recent years, artificial intelligence techniques have attracted much attention in hydrological studies, while time series models are rarely used in this field. The present study evaluates the performance of artificial intelligence techniques including gene expression programming (GEP), Bayesian networks (BN), as well as time series models, namely autoregressive (AR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) for estimation of monthly streamflow. In addition, simple multiple linear regression (MLR) was also used. To fulfill this objective, the monthly streamflow data of Ponel and Toolelat stations located on Shafarood and Polrood Rivers, respectively in Northern Iran were used for the period of October 1964 to September 2014. In order to investigate the models’ accuracy, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R²) were employed as the error statistics. The obtained results demonstrated that the single AR and ARMA time series models had better performance in comparison with the single GEP, BN and MLR methods. Furthermore, in this study, six hybrid models known as GEP-AR, GEP-ARMA, BN-AR, BN-ARMA, MLR-AR and MLR-ARMA were developed to enhance the estimation accuracy of the monthly streamflow. It was concluded that the developed hybrid models were more accurate than the corresponding single artificial intelligence and time series models. The obtained results confirmed that the integration of time series models and artificial intelligence techniques could be of use to improve the accuracy of single models in modeling purposes related to the hydrological studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aartificial intelligence 3agene expression 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3astream flow 3atime series analysis 3aIran1 aKozekalani Sales, Ali0 tWater resources management.g2018 July, v. 32, no. 9 p.3001-3022dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-018-1970-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245010400202520133300306592002801639650001701667650001501684650001301699650001101712650001201723650001701735650001801752650001501770650000901785650001101794650001501805650001801820700005701838700006101895700005801956700005702014700005902071700001702130700003002147700002202177773009502199856007702294852000902371655001202380IND60759794520221118143736.0211213e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075979452DNAL7 a10.1155/2021/39255722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuaabou, Rachida1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0550-848X10aHygroscopic Properties of Sweet Cherry Powder: Thermodynamic Properties and Microstructural Changes  aUnderstanding sorption isotherms is crucial in food science for optimizing the drying processes, enhancing the shelf-life of food, and maintaining food quality during storage. This study investigated the isotherms of sweet cherry powder (SCP) using the static gravimetric method. The experimental water sorption curves of lyophilized sweet cherry powder were determined at 30°C, 40°C, and 50°C. The curves were then fitted to six isotherm models: Modified GAB, Halsey, Smith, Oswin, Caurie, and Kühn models. To define the energy associated with the sorption process, the isosteric sorption heat, differential entropy, and spreading pressure were derived from the isotherms. Among the six models, the Smith model is the most reliable in predicting the sorption of the cherry powder with a determination coefficient (R²) of 0.9978 and a mean relative error (MRE) ≤1.61. The values of the net isosteric heat and differential entropy for the cherry increased exponentially as the moisture content decreased. The net isosteric heat values varied from 10.63 to 90.97 kJ mol⁻¹, while the differential entropy values varied from 27.94 to 273.39 J. mol⁻¹K⁻¹. Overall, the enthalpy-entropy compensation theory showed that enthalpy-controlled mechanisms could be used to regulate water adsorption in cherry powders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus avium 3aadsorption 3acherries 3aenergy 3aentropy 3afood quality 3afreeze drying 3agravimetry 3aheat 3amodels 3ashelf life 3awater content1 aEnnahli, Said1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5017-05131 aDi Lorenzo, Chira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2798-87201 aHanine, Hafida1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9309-56721 aBajoub, Aadil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3665-52231 aLahlali, Rachid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1299-57331 aIdlimam, Ali1 aAit-Oubahou, A.q(Ahmed),1 aMesnaoui, Mohamed0 tJournal of food quality.g2021 Dec. 1, v. 2021dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x1745-45577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/39255723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010900168520100400277592002801281650001201309650001401321650001701335650001401352650002401366650001501390650001401405650001601419653003301435653002801468653002201496653002301518653001401541700005301555700001201608700001301620700005301633700002501686700001301711700001801724700001701742700001401759773012401773856008301897852000901980655001201989IND60755245520221116154938.0211213e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075524552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1053602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chengkun10aHydrothermal co-liquefaction of rice straw and waste cooking-oil model compound for bio-crude production  aThis study aims to investigate the hydrothermal co-liquefaction of rice straw (RS) and waste cooking-oil model compound (WCOM) under sub-critical conditions for the optimum bio-crude yield and conversion. Effects of temperature, catalyst (K₂CO₃), residence time and mass ratios of RS to WCOM on products’ distribution were examined and the reaction mechanism for co-liquefaction of RS and WCOM was also explored. The highest bio-crude yield (88.77%) was obtained when mass ratio of RS to WCOM was 1:3 at 300 ℃, 10 min and in absence of K₂CO₃. When the mass ratio was 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3, the synergistic effect approached 14.38%, 11.38% and 12.84%, respectively. WCOM could improve the overall conversion rate of RS during co-liquefaction. GC-MS analysis suggested that the bio-crude contained large amounts of fatty acids and smaller amounts of phenols and ketone aldehydes. Co-liquefaction was found effective to improve the qualitative and quantitate features of products from biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3aliquefaction 3apyrolysis 3areaction mechanisms 3arice straw 3asynergism 3atemperature 0aHydrothermal co-liquefaction 0aLignocellulosic biomass 0aWaste cooking-oil 0aSynergistic effect 0aBio-crude1 aHan, Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2382-60781 aYan, Mi1 aXia, Jia1 aRong, Nai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6685-36851 aBaloch, Humair Ahmed1 aGuo, Hui1 aWu, Pingjiang1 aXu, Guoqiang1 aMa, Kaili0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2021 Nov., v. 160 p.105360-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2021.1053603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012700170300001600297520101700313592002801330650001301358650002001371650001801391650001101409650005801420650001101478650001101489650001901500650001601519700001601535700001501551773008401566856008501650852000901735655001201744IND60113682920221120221318.0141112e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011368292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2011.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuggisberg, D.10aDetermination of Vitamin B₁₂ in meat products by RP-HPLC after enrichment and purification on an immunoaffinity column  ap. 279-283.  aA quantitative method for the determination of Vitamin B12 in meat products by RP-HPLC and UV detection was developed and compared to the reference method (microbiological assay, MBA). Vitamin B12 was extracted with 50mM sodium acetate buffer in the presence of sodium cyanide. For the quantification of total Vitamin B12, it was necessary to release protein-bound Vitamin B12 by pepsin treatment. Cyanocobalamin was detected as total Vitamin B12 after purification and enrichment on an immunoaffinity column. The calibration with five concentrations of Vitamin B12 was linear with a regression coefficient r2>0.99. The method was validated at three different concentration levels (5–15ng/g) with salami showing good recovery rates between 80 and 108% and low relative standard deviations between 1.50 and 7.26% (n=6). The detection limit was found to be 2ng/g. The Vitamin B12 levels of 50 meat products measured by the developed procedure were similar or significantly lower than those determined by the MBA.  aPublisher supplied data 3acyanides 3adetection limit 3alinear models 3apepsin 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asalami 3asodium 3asodium acetate 3avitamin B121 aRisse, M.C.1 aHadorn, R.0 tMeat science.g2012 Feb., v. 90, no. 2 p.279-283dElsevier Ltdx0309-17407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2011.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007200170300001800242520092900260592002801189650003201217650001001249650001501259650001701274650001201291650002601303650002201329653003201351653001501383653002701398653002601425653001401451653001501465653001201480653001801492653002201510700002201532773015601554856008601710852000901796655001201805IND60539322820221117224546.0190215e20150622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053932282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2015.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yunhong10aRegulation of neuronal communication by G protein-coupled receptors  ap. 1607-1619.  aNeuronal communication plays an essential role in the propagation of information in the brain and requires a precisely orchestrated connectivity between neurons. Synaptic transmission is the mechanism through which neurons communicate with each other. It is a strictly regulated process which involves membrane depolarization, the cellular exocytosis machinery, neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft, and the interaction between ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and downstream effector molecules. The focus of this review is to explore the role of GPCRs and G protein-signaling in neurotransmission, to highlight the function of GPCRs, which are localized in both presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane terminals, in regulation of intrasynaptic and intersynaptic communication, and to discuss the involvement of astrocytic GPCRs in the regulation of neuronal communication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3abrain 3aexocytosis 3aion channels 3aneurons 3asynaptic transmission 3asynaptic vesicles 0aG protein-coupled receptors 0aG-proteins 0aNeuronal communication 0aSynaptic transmission 0aSignaling 0aAstrocytes 0aNeurons 0aAutoreceptors 0aNeurotransmitters1 aThathiah, Amantha0 tFEBS letters.g2015 June 22, v. 589, no. 14 p.1607-1619dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2015.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245012400173300001800297520166300315592002801978650001502006650002302021650001002044650001102054650001302065650000902078650001702087650001602104650002102120651000902141700002302150700002402173700001902197773012602216856008202342852000902424655001202433IND60595203520221116205922.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059520352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-018-1969-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNafarzadegan, AliReza10aSocially-Optimal and Nash Pareto-Based Alternatives for Water Allocation under Uncertainty: an Approach and Application  ap. 2985-3000.  aThis study has proposed a methodology by enhancing an interactive algorithm to multi-objective optimization problems with interval parameters, in an attempt to reach the tradeoff between quality and reliability of the resultant optimum solutions. The earlier algorithm could turn into a prolonged procedure that deals with several players with different aspirations at different reliability, or risk, levels under non-deterministic conditions. Hence, it is not a pertinent approach to solve problems of water allocation between competing parties. The enhanced methodology aims to alleviate the burdens of the procedure and generate a unique set of solutions (i.e., near-Pareto-optimal alternatives), instead of a myriad of compromise solution sets. We have investigated a real-world hydro-environmental problem, the allocation of water between Dorudzan-Korbal irrigation networks and Bakhtegan Lake in Fars Province, Iran to assess feasibility of this methodology. In order to reach a consensus concerning the stakeholders’ individual preferences, we identified the compromise alternatives from the obtained sets of non-dominated solutions by taking advantage of various social choice rules and the Nash bargaining model. The results demonstrated that the developed methodology could incorporate the risk of system constraints violations (i.e., planning reliability under uncertainty) into the process of approximating the optimal tradeoff set of solutions. It also gave policymakers a chance to acquire perception into the potentially best compromise for land and water allocation schemes regarding the preference profiles of the involved interest groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3airrigation systems 3alakes 3amodels 3aplanning 3arisk 3astakeholders 3auncertainty 3awater allocation 3aIran1 aVagharfard, Hassan1 aNikoo, MohammadReza1 aNohegar, Ahmad0 tWater resources management.g2018 July, v. 32, no. 9 p.2985-3000dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-018-1969-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245017200177500002200349500001500371520201300386592002802399650002602427650001502453650000902468650001402477650002302491650002002514650001202534650001102546650001002557653001302567653000902580653001802589653001002607653002502617653001502642653001702657700002202674700002602696700002502722700002202747773006702769856008302836852000902919655001202928IND60528744420221119125325.0160716s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052874442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.05.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchrankel, Catherine S.12aA conserved alternative form of the purple sea urchin HEB/E2-2/E2A transcription factor mediates a switch in E-protein regulatory state in differentiating immune cells  aPre-press version  a2019-12-06  aE-proteins are basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors with essential roles in animal development. In mammals, these are encoded by three loci: E2-2 (ITF-2/ME2/SEF2/TCF4), E2A (TCF3), and HEB (ME1/REB/TCF12). The HEB and E2-2 paralogs are expressed as alternative (Alt) isoforms with distinct N-terminal sequences encoded by unique exons under separate regulatory control. Expression of these alternative transcripts is restricted relative to the longer (Can) forms, suggesting distinct regulatory roles, although the functions of the Alt proteins remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize the single sea urchin E-protein ortholog (SpE-protein). The organization of the SpE-protein gene closely resembles that of the extended HEB/E2-2 vertebrate loci, including a transcript that initiates at a homologous alternative transcription start site (SpE-Alt). The existence of an Alt form in the sea urchin indicates that this feature predates the emergence of the vertebrates. We present additional evidence indicating that this transcript was present in the common bilaterian ancestor. In contrast to the widely expressed canonical form (SpE-Can), SpE-Alt expression is tightly restricted. SpE-Alt is expressed in two phases: first in aboral non-skeletogenic mesenchyme (NSM) cells and then in oral NSM cells preceding their differentiation and ingression into the blastocoel. Derivatives of these cells mediate immune response in the larval stage. Inhibition of SpE-Alt activity interferes with these events. Notably, although the two isoforms are initially co-expressed, as these cells differentiate, SpE-Can is excluded from the SpE-Alt+ cell population. This mutually exclusive expression is dependent on SpE-Alt function, which reveals a previously undescribed negative regulatory linkage between the two E-protein forms. Collectively, these findings reorient our understanding of the evolution of this transcription factor family and highlight fundamental properties of E-protein biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3aEchinoidea 3aloci 3aevolution 3aanimal development 3aimmune response 3amammals 3alarvae 3aexons 0aImmunity 0abHLH 0aHematopoiesis 0agenes 0aAlternative splicing 0aEchinoderm 0aDeuterostome1 aSolek, Cynthia M.1 aBuckley, Katherine M.1 aAnderson, Michele K.1 aRast, Jonathan P.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2016, dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.05.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03561naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012500167300001800292520243700310592002802747650001302775650001602788650001402804650002202818650001502840650002502855650002202880650002502902650001602927700002702943700002402970773012602994856008203120852000903202655001203211IND60595203620221116210017.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059520362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-018-1973-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Renato10aProbabilistic Model for the Representation of the Reservoir Water Level of Concrete Dams During Normal Operation Periods  ap. 3041-3052.  aThe dam’s reservoir water level varies over the year according to the water inflow and outflow, as a function of environmental events but also of dam exploitation management policy and human decisions. In the Portuguese dam safety regulation (RSB 2007), the normal water level (NWL) is considered as the optimum exploitation level. However, as proved by the continuous monitoring over the lifetime of a set of dams, the NWL is occasionally exceeded for non-negligible time periods. The reservoir water level, to which the water pressure on the upstream face is related, is a fundamental parameter for the safety and reliability analysis of concrete dams. When water-induced actions are considering the leading loads, only the maximum reservoir water level, usually associated with a high-return-period flood, is relevant. However, for other combinations, in particular, earthquake scenarios, the consideration of the variability of the water level over time is crucial. In reliability analysis of concrete dams, the reservoir water level has been considered either as a deterministic variable, once the loading scenario analyzed assume water-induced actions as leading loads (Westberg 2010), or as a random variable defined using hydrological site information of a specific study case (Altarejos et al. Structural Safety 36-37:1–13 2012). This work proposes a probabilistic model of the reservoir water level of any new dam based only on its geometrical properties, which provides a low-cost alternative to in-depth hydrological analysis. The proposed model can be useful in two stages of the lifecycle of dams: (i) initial design and feasibility stages, and (ii) routine safety assessment of existing structures, as in both stages the costs of a complete hydrological analysis is too high for the level of detail required. For that, the recorded reservoir water level of 27 Portuguese large concrete dams is used. A normalized sinusoidal model, with annual period, is adjusted to the reservoir water level annual history of those dams by beta regression. Generally, a good agreement between observations and the proposed model, for most of the annual adjustments, was achieved. The distribution parameters of the random variables were estimated through the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method.

Then, 1-naphthol as new reactant was oxidized by Pt/CeO2/GO composites with outstanding catalytic performance, resulting in detection signal amplification. In addition, as compared to label electroactive substance to antibodies, a simplified preparative step of immunosensor could be achieved because the signal probe get rid of introducation other electroactive substances. The proposed immunosensor achieved a linear range of 1.0×10−3–1.0ngmL−1 and 5.0 to 1.0×102ngmL−1 with a detection limit of 0.43pgmL−1 (defined as S/N=3).  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-naphthol 3aantibodies 3acatalytic activity 3aceric oxide 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrolysis 3aimmunosensors 3ainfluenza 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aphosphates 0aIn situ produce 0aAmplification 0aGraphene oxide and Pt nanoparticles functionalized CeO2 nanocomposites 0aElectrochemical immunosensor 0aInfluenza1 aZhuo, Ying1 aYuan, Ruo1 aChai, Ya-Qin0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 July 15, v. 69 p.321-327dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.01.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03506naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245021100167300001400378520186200392592002802254650000802282650001902290650002002309650001702329650003302346650004302379650001902422650001702441650000902458650003302467650001802500650000702518650003402525650001302559650001302572650002302585653003802608653001702646653005002663653004302713700001702756700001902773700001402792773011202806856008502918852000903003655001203012IND60628859320221120024642.0190509e20190329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062885932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2018.12.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Kaige12aA hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent based vortex-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction for the determination of formaldehyde from biological and indoor air samples by high performance liquid chromatography  ap. 39-46.  aHydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are a new class of green solvents, and their research and application are a brand new area. So far, only a few hydrophobic DESs have been reported as extraction solvents. In this paper, five kinds of hydrophobic DESs composed of trioctylmethylammonium chloride and hydroquinone, 4-phenylphenol or 4-cyanophenol are designed and prepared for the first time. Melting point / glass transition temperature and density are also determined for these DESs. Coupled with HPLC, these hydrophobic DESs have been used as extractants in vortex-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction for the selective enrichment and indirect determination of formaldehyde. The optimization of reaction and extraction conditions, such as pH value, reaction time and temperature, concentration of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, type and dosage of the extraction solvent, speed and time of vortex, salt addition and centrifugation time are investigated in detail. It is found that under the optimized experimental conditions, the calibration curve of this method is linear in the range of 1.0–200.0 μg L−1 with the linear correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.9994. The limit of detection (S/N = 3) and limit of quantification (S/N = 10) are 0.2 μg L−1 and 1.0 μg L−1, and the intra-day and inter-day precision (RSD, n = 5) are 1.1% and 3.5%, respectively. The interference of some common coexisting ions and neutral molecules have been also tested. The proposed method has been successfully used for the determination of formaldehyde from biological and indoor air samples. The recovery of formaldehyde is in the range from 83.1% to 104.4%, and the relative standard deviation is lower than 5.9%. Furthermore, the analytical parameters of the proposed method have been compared with other extraction and microextraction methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acentrifugation 3adetection limit 3aformaldehyde 3aglass transition temperature 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3ahydroquinone 3aions 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amelting point 3apH 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3aquinones 3asolvents 3astandard deviation 0aHydrophobic deep eutectic solvent 0aFormaldehyde 0aVortex-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction 0aHigh performance liquid chromatography1 aLiu, Zhuang,1 aLi, Shuangying1 aFan, Jing0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Mar. 29, v. 1589 p.39-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2018.12.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245010800159300001600267520075300283592002801036650001501064650004401079650002901123650001701152650001601169650001601185650001101201650001201212650001801224650001701242650004101259650001001300650002301310650002301333650002001356650001501376650001001391700001701401700002101418700001901439773011801458856004401576852000901620655001201629IND50073498120221117064119.0140301e200110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007349812DNAL7 a10.1007/s0021601010332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhro, Mikko10aProcess control of apple winemaking by low-resolution gas-phase Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy  ap. 541-549.  aFour apple wine fermentation processes have been observed by means of direct-inlet gas-phase FTIR spectroscopy.

The development of the concentrations of 1-propanol, 4-methylpyridine, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, and ethyl acetate was monitored. Two different sampling methods were used – static headspace and direct injection of the must. The performance of the FTIR method is limited by the high ethanol concentration. It can be mathematically proven that the amount of sample can be selected so that any distortion due to ethanol is minimized. Headspace GC–MS was used for preliminary compound identification.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetic acid 3aapple juice 3aapples 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3afermentation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agases 3aheadspace analysis 3ajuice concentrates 3aprocess control 3awinemaking 3awines1 aHakala, Mari1 aKauppinen, Jyrki1 aKallio, Heikki0 tFresenius' journal of analytical chemistry.g2001 Oct., v. 371, no. 4 p.541-549dSpringer-Verlagx0937-06337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002160101033  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002700190245013800217500002200355520130600377592002801683653001001711653001401721653001201735653001001747653002001757653003301777700003301810700002701843700001701870700002101887773008101908856008301989852000902072655001202081IND60531700220221117190525.0160724s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053170022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrep.2016.07.0052doi7 aPMC56135082pmcid7 a289559322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMufhandu, Hazel Tumelo10aUCLA1 aptamer inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype C primary isolates in macrophages and selection of resistance  aPre-press version  aWe have previously shown that the aptamer, UCLA1, is able to inhibit HIV-1 replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by binding to residues in gp120. In this study we examined whether UCLA1 was effective against HIV-1 subtype C isolates in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Of 4 macrophage-tropic isolates tested, 3 were inhibited by UCLA1 in the low nanomolar range (IC80<29nM). One isolate that showed reduced susceptibility (<50nM) to UCLA1 contained mutations in the α5 helix next to the CD4 and co-receptor (CoR) binding complex. To further evaluate aptamer resistance, two primary viruses were subjected to increasing concentrations of UCLA1 over a period of 84 days in PBMCs. One isolate showed a 7-fold increase in IC80 (351nM) associated with genetic changes, some of which were previously implicated in resistance. This included F223Y in the C2 region and P369L within the CD4 and CoR binding complex. A second isolate showed a 3-fold increase in IC80 (118nM) but failed to show any genetic changes. Collectively, these data show that UCLA1 can efficiently block HIV-1 infection in MDMs and PBMCs with escape mutations arising in some isolates after prolonged exposure to the aptamer. This supports the further development of the UCLA1 aptamer as a HIV-1 entry inhibitor.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHIV-1 0aSubtype C 0aAptamer 0aUCLA1 0agp120 Mutations 0aMonocyte-derived macrophages1 aAlexandre, Kabamba Bankoledi1 aGray, Elin Solomonovna1 aMorris, Lynn1 aKhati, Makobetsa0 tBiochemistry and Biophysics Reports.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x2405-58087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrep.2016.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245008600213300001600299506007600315520166800391592002802059506003702087650002702124650002102151650001502172650003802187650001202225650000902237650001102246650003102257650001402288650001502302653001002317653002202327653001602349653001302365653000802378653000902386700006102395773014502456856008302601852000902684655001202693IND60635757920221207050809.0190425e20190521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063575792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.03.1772doi7 aPMC64756052pmcid7 a309524302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArkhipov, Sergey N.10aATP release into ADPKD cysts via pannexin-1/P2X7 channels decreases ENaC activity  ap. 166-171.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenetic predisposition is necessary for polycystic kidney disease (PKD) initiation, although there are other, incompletely identified downstream processes that are required for cyst growth. Their characterization may provide a unique opportunity for clinical interventions. One of the poorly studied phenomena in PKD is high ATP content in cysts. Unfortunately, neither origins of uncontrolled ATP release, nor consequences of abnormal purinergic signaling in relation to epithelial transport are well explored in the polycystic kidney. We tested the distribution of pannexin-1 (Panx1) and P2X7, two proteins potentially involved in ATP release, in the kidneys of the Pkd1RC/RC mice, a model of autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD). Abundances of both proteins were abnormally increased in the cyst lining cells compared to non-dilated collecting ducts. To establish if pannexin-1 contributes to ATP release in the collecting ducts (CD), we measured luminal accumulation of ATP in M1 cell renal CD monolayers, and found that treatment with probenecid, a Panx1 blocker, prevents ATP release. Single channel patch clamp analysis of polarized M1 cells revealed that apical stimulation of P2X receptors with αβ-MeATP acutely reduces ENaC activity. We conclude that in ADPKD progression, an abnormal hyperexpression of both PANX1 and P2RX7 occurs in the cyst lining epithelial cells. High abundance of both proteins is not typical for non-dilated CDs but, when it happens in cysts, pannexin1/P2X7 cooperation elevates ATP release into the luminal space. High ATP level is a pathogenic factor facilitating cystogenesis by reducing ENaC-mediated reabsorption from the lumen.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3agenetic predisposition to disease 3akidneys 3amice 3amodels 3apolycystic kidney diseases 3areceptors 3aresorption 0aADPKD 0aPolycystic kidney 0aATP release 0aPannexin 0aP2X 0aENaC1 aPavlov, Tengis S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6481-03900 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 May 21, v. 513, no. 1 p.166-171dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.03.1773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245007600161300001600237520094200253592002801195650001801223650002201241650002001263650001301283650001501296650001901311650001801330650002401348650001201372650002201384650002601406650001101432650000701443650001501450650002301465650001601488650002701504650001201531653001401543653001901557653001501576700002301591700002301614700002101637773015201658856007801810852000901888655001201897IND60523149520221120205613.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052314952DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2012-7-8112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmedi, Afaf10aEnzymatic Degradation of Congo Red by Turnip (Brassica rapa) Peroxidase  ap. 429-436.  aThe enzyme peroxidase is known for its capacity to remove phenolic compounds and aromatic amines from aqueous solutions and also to decolourize textile effluents.

S(+)-carprofen possessed preferential activity for COX-2 inhibition but, because the slopes of inhibition curves differed, the COX-1:COX-2 inhibition ratio decreased from 9.04:1 for inhibitory concentration (IC)₁₀ to 1.84:1 for IC₉₅. R(−) carprofen inhibited COX-2 preferentially only for low inhibition of the COX isoforms (IC₁₀ COX-1:COX-2=6.63:1), whereas inhibition was preferential for COX-1 for a high level of inhibition (IC₉₅ COX-1:COX-2=0.20:1). S(+) carprofen was the more potent inhibitor of COX isoforms; potency ratios S(+):R(−) carprofen were 11.6:1 for IC₁₀ and 218:1 for IC₉₀. Based on serum concentrations of carprofen enantiomers obtained after administration of a therapeutic dose of 1.4mg/kg to calves subcutaneously, S(+)-carprofen concentrations exceeded the in vitro IC₈₀ COX-2 value for 32h and the IC₂₀ for COX-1 for 33h. The findings are discussed in relation to efficacy and safety of carprofen in calves.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acalves 3aenantiomers 3ain vitro studies 3aprostaglandin synthase 2aAnimals 2aCarbazolesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCattlexblood 2aCyclooxygenase 1xbloodxmetabolism. 2aCyclooxygenase 2xbloodxmetabolism. 2aCyclooxygenase Inhibitorsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aThromboxane B21 aCheng, Zhangrui1 aMcKellar, Quintin A.1 aLees, Peter0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2012 Dec., v. 93, no. 3 p.1387-1392dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.x0034-52887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2012.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100006300188245014800251300001100399506007600410520182100486592002802307506003702335650002102372650001402393650002802407650001502435650001302450650001102463650001902474650001102493650002302504650001302527650002502540650002102565650001702586650001602603700002802619700002102647700002202668700001702690773011702707856008202824852000902906655001202915IND60548658720221207124724.0200912e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054865872DNAL7 a268165282pmid7 aPMC47272702pmcid7 a10.1186/s13068-016-0431-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPihlajaniemi, Ville1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8220-665610aRate-constraining changes in surface properties, porosity and hydrolysis kinetics of lignocellulose in the course of enzymatic saccharification  ap. 18.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Explaining the reduction of hydrolysis rate during lignocellulose hydrolysis is a challenge for the understanding and modelling of the process. This article reports the changes of cellulose and lignin surface areas, porosity and the residual cellulase activity during the hydrolysis of autohydrolysed wheat straw and delignified wheat straw. The potential rate-constraining mechanisms are assessed with a simplified kinetic model and compared to the observed effects, residual cellulase activity and product inhibition. RESULTS: The reaction rate depended exclusively on the degree of hydrolysis, while enzyme denaturation or time-dependent changes in substrate hydrolysability were absent. Cellulose surface area decreased linearly with hydrolysis, in correlation with total cellulose content. Lignin surface area was initially decreased by the dissolution of phenolics and then remained unchanged. The dissolved phenolics did not contribute to product inhibition. The porosity of delignified straw was decreased during hydrolysis, but no difference in porosity was detected during the hydrolysis of autohydrolysed straw. CONCLUSIONS: Although a hydrolysis-dependent increase of non-productive binding capacity of lignin was not apparent, the dependence of hydrolysis maxima on the enzyme dosage was best explained by partial irreversible product inhibition. Cellulose surface area correlated with the total cellulose content, which is thus an appropriate approximation of the substrate concentration for kinetic modelling. Kinetic models of cellulose hydrolysis should be simplified enough to include reversible and irreversible product inhibition and reduction of hydrolysability, as well as their possible non-linear relations to hydrolysis degree, without overparameterization of particular factors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding capacity 3acellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3ahydrolysis 3akinetics 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amodels 3aphenolic compounds 3aporosity 3aprotein denaturation 3asaccharification 3asurface area 3awheat straw1 aSipponen, Mika Henrikki1 aKallioinen, Anne1 aNyyssölä, Antti1 aLaakso, Simo0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.18-18dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-016-0431-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03524naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245011400176300001200290520178900302592002802091596015102119650001502270650000902285650001102294650002402305650001602329650000902345650000902354650001102363650001902374650001402393650001602407650002002423650001502443650001602458650001902474650001302493650002602506650002402532700002502556700002402581700003102605700002702636700002902663700003002692700006302722773011702785856008302902852000902985655001202994IND60712575720221117210118.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071257572DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-020-02485-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanthavichit, Kanokporn10aEvaluation of vacuum phenomenon in dogs with coxofemoral degenerative joint disease using computed tomography  ap. 274.  aBACKGROUND: Degenerative joint disease (DJD) is a common orthopedic lesion in the coxofemoral joint of canine patients. Concurrent with the sign of degeneration, the vacuum phenomenon (VP), or intra-articular gas, has been observed in several locations in both human and canine patients. A cadaveric study described VP in small breed dogs without DJD but with hip laxity. However, none of the canine VP reports mentioned coxofemoral DJD. Therefore, the aim of this retrospective study was to describe the distribution of coxofemoral VP revealed on computed tomography (CT) imaging in canine patients with DJD. RESULTS: A total of 282 dogs (564 coxofemoral joints), comprising 142 small, 85 large, and 55 medium breeds, were included in the present study. DJD was found in 31.02% of all dogs. The incidence of DJD was highest in large breed dogs (50%), followed by medium (31.81%) and small (19.36%) breed dogs. In addition, VP was detected with CT using the pulmonary window in 31 joints of 25 dogs that received a diagnosis of hip degenerative disease. VP was found most frequently at the laterodorsal area of the acetabulum. The incidences of VP in large, small, and medium breed dogs were 35.94%, 17.14% and 8.33%, respectively. The presence of coxofemoral VP was significantly and positively correlated with DJD (odds ratio = 17.58, 95% CI 2.32–133.42). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of coxofemoral joint DJD and VP was more likely to be detected in large breed dogs, especially in those with established DJD. CT is an advanced diagnostic imaging modality that can be used to reveal VP lesions, most of which are reported at the laterodorsal acetabulum. Further studies, including comparisons of different patient positions, may reveal more information regarding coxofemoral VP.  aPublisher supplied data  aChulalongkorn University Graduate Scholarship to Commemorate the 72nd Anniversary of His Majesty King Bhumibol AdulyadejcChulalongkorn University 3aacetabulum 3aarea 3abreeds 3acomputed tomography 3acorrelation 3adogs 3ahips 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aincidence 3ainformation 3ajoints (animal) 3aodds ratio 3aorthopedics 3aosteoarthritis 3apatients 3aretrospective studies 3aveterinary medicine1 aKlaengkaew, Auraiwan1 aSrisowanna, Naparee1 aChaivoravitsakul, Nardtiwa1 aHoroongruang, Kongthit1 aThanaboonnipat, Chutimon1 aSoontornvipart, Kumpanart1 aChoisunirachon, Nan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7169-66990 tBMC veterinary research.g2020 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.274-274dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02485-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007700170300001600247520104800263592002801311650000801339650001101347650001801358650001401376650002901390650001801419650002001437650001201457653002001469653002301489653002401512653002401536653001201560653001801572653001301590700002301603700001901626700002001645700002001665773010801685856008201793852000901875655001201884IND60633135520221119182600.0190613e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063313552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2019.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoldogkői, Zsolt,10aLong-Read Sequencing – A Powerful Tool in Viral Transcriptome Research  ap. 578-592.  aLong-read sequencing (LRS) has become increasingly popular due to its strengths in de novo assembly and in resolving complex DNA regions as well as in determining full-length RNA molecules. Two important LRS technologies have been developed during the past few years, including single-molecule, real-time sequencing by Pacific Biosciences, and nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Although current LRS methods produce lower coverage, and are more error prone than short-read sequencing, these methods continue to be superior in identifying transcript isoforms including multispliced RNAs and transcript-length variants as well as overlapping transcripts and alternative polycistronic RNA molecules. Viruses have small, compact genomes and therefore these organisms are ideal subjects for transcriptome analysis with the relatively low-throughput LRS techniques. Recent LRS studies have multiplied the number of previously known transcripts and have revealed complex networks of transcriptional overlaps in the examined viruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3agenome 3amessenger RNA 3ananopores 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aviruses 0aDNA replication 0areplication origin 0ananopore sequencing 0aPacific Biosciences 0aRNA-Seq 0anoncoding RNA 0asplicing1 aMoldován, Norbert1 aBalázs, Zsolt1 aSnyder, Michael1 aTombácz, Dóra0 tTrends in microbiology.g2019 July, v. 27, no. 7 p.578-592dElsevier LtdwJournal:6327x0966-842X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2019.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245009600157300001600253520107600269592002801345650001901373650002101392650001101413650002501424650001101449650001601460650001101476650001001487650001001497650001901507650001401526650001001540650003101550651001001581653002101591653001901612653003101631700002001662700001401682700001901696700001701715773015201732856007801884852000901962655001201971IND60523149620221120205637.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052314962DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2012-7-8122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jing10aAttraction of the Gypsy Moth to Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) of Damaged Dahurian Larch  ap. 437-444.  aOlfactory responses of the gypsy moth Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), a major defoliator of deciduous trees, were examined in Inner Mongolia, China. We studied whether the gypsy moth adults are attracted by the major volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of damaged Larix gmelinii (Dahurian larch) foliage and compared the attractiveness of the plant volatiles with that of the synthetic sex pheromone. Our results indicated that the VOCs of the Dahurian larch were effective in attracting gypsy moth males especially during the peak flight period. The VOCs also attracted moths significantly better than the sex pheromone of the moth. Our study is the first trial to show the responses of adult gypsy moths to volatile compounds emitted from a host plant. Electroantennogram responses of L. gmelinii volatiles on gypsy moths supported our field observations. A synergistic effect between host plant volatiles and sex pheromone was also obvious, and bothcan be jointly applied as a new attractant method or population management strategy of the gypsy moth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarix gmelinii 3aLymantria dispar 3aadults 3aelectroantennography 3aflight 3ahost plants 3aleaves 3amales 3amoths 3asex pheromones 3asynergism 3atrees 3avolatile organic compounds 3aChina 0aLymantria dispar 0aLarix gmelinii 0aVolatile Organic Compounds1 aValimaki, Sanna1 aShi, Juan1 aZong, Shixiang1 aLuo, Youqing0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 67, no. 7-8 p.437-444dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:21135x0939-50757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-2012-7-8123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03400naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245015600161500001400317520200200331592002802333650001302361650001102374650000902385650000902394650002802403650001502431650001602446650001802462650001402480650001802494650002302512650002202535700002802557700002602585700002902611700003402640700001702674700003202691700002602723773012202749856007402871852000902945655001202954IND60729373620221118041911.0210228e20210130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072937362DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130204702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeller, Amélie 14aThe Effect of a Combined Gluten- and Casein-Free Diet on Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  aNAL-light  aThere has been a growing interest in the gastrointestinal system and its significance for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including the significance of adopting a gluten-free and casein-free (GFCF) diet. The objective was to investigate beneficial and safety of a GFCF diet among children with a diagnosis of ASD. We performed a systematic literature search in Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and the Cochrane Library up to January 2020 for existing systematic reviews and individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies were included if they investigated a GFCF diet compared to a regular diet in children aged 3 to 17 years diagnosed with ASD, with or without comorbidities. The quality of the identified existing reviews was assessed using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR). The risk of bias in RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and overall quality of evidence was evaluated using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). We identified six relevant RCTs, which included 143 participants. The results from a random effect model showed no effect of a GFCF diet on clinician-reported autism core symptoms (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.31 (95% Cl. -0.89, 0.27)), parent-reported functional level (mean difference (MD) 0.61 (95% Cl -5.92, 7.14)) or behavioral difficulties (MD 0.80 (95% Cl -6.56, 10.16)). On the contrary, a GFCF diet might trigger gastrointestinal adverse effects (relative risk (RR) 2.33 (95% Cl 0.69, 7.90)). The quality of evidence ranged from low to very low due to serious risk of bias, serious risk of inconsistency, and serious risk of imprecision. Clinical implications of the present findings may be careful consideration of introducing a GFCF diet to children with ASD. However, the limitations of the current literature hinder the possibility of drawing any solid conclusion, and more high-quality RCTs are needed.

In addition to endosymbionts, organisms harbour a collection of host-associated microbes, the microbiome that can impact important host traits. In this opinion article we argue that the mutual influences of the microbiome and endosymbionts, as well as their combined influence on the host, are still understudied. Focusing on the endosymbiont Wolbachia, we present growing evidence indicating that host phenotypic effects are exerted in interaction with the remainder microbiome and the host. We thus advocate that only through an integrated approach that considers multiple interacting partners and environmental influences will we be able to gain a better understanding of host–microbe associations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWolbachia 3aendosymbionts 3amicrobiome 3amicroorganisms 3aphenotype 3asymbiosis 0ainsects 0aphenotype 0aWolbachia 0amosquitoes 0ametacommunity 0aDrosophila1 aFontaine, Michael C.1 aBeukeboom, Leo W.1 aFalcao Salles, Joana0 tTrends in microbiology.g2019 June, v. 27, no. 6 p.480-488dElsevier LtdwJournal:6327x0966-842X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2019.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01636naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245005700180300001600237500000900253520054900262592002800811650001500839650001300854650001900867650001800886650001500904650002100919650001400940650000900954650002300963700001700986700001901003773014701022856009601169852000901265655001201274IND60669657020221119020511.0191125e198105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066965702DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1981.03615995004500030048x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertsch, P.

Several studies have discussed the importance of punctual mutations, recombination, and natural selection in the generation of allelic diversity in the S-locus. However, there has been no wide-ranging study correlating the molecular evolution and structural aspects of the corresponding proteins in Solanum. Therefore, we evaluated the molecular evolution of one gene in this locus and generated a statistically well-supported phylogenetic tree, as well as evidence of positive selection, helping us to understand the diversification of S alleles in Solanum. The three-dimensional structures of some of the proteins corresponding to the major clusters of the phylogenetic tree were constructed and subsequently submitted to molecular dynamics to stabilize the folding and obtain the native structure. The positively selected amino acid residues were predominantly located in the hyper variable regions and on the surface of the protein, which appears to be fundamental for allele specificity. One of the positively selected residues was identified adjacent to a conserved strand that is crucial for enzymatic catalysis. Additionally, we have shown significant differences in the electrostatic potential among the predicted molecular surfaces in S-RNases. The structural results indicate that local changes in the three-dimensional structure are present in some regions of the molecule, although the general structure seems to be conserved. No previous study has described such structural variations in S-RNases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum 3aalleles 3aamino acids 3acatalytic activity 3agametophytes 3ainbreeding depression 3aloci 3amolecular dynamics 3amutation 3anatural selection 3aphylogeny 3aribonucleases 3aselfing1 aThompson, Claudia Elizabeth1 aFernandes, Cláudia Lemelle1 ade Freitas, Loreta Brandão0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2015 June, v. 290, no. 3 p.987-1002dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-014-0969-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011900159500001400278520140500292592002801697650001301725650000901738650002501747650002801772650002001800650001501820650001201835650001201847650001201859650001801871650001901889650001901908650001201927650001501939650000901954650000901963650001601972650002401988650001002012650001602022700002402038700002602062700002602088700002202114700002202136700002302158700002602181700002402207700002102231700002302252773012202275856007402397852000902471655001202480IND60729373820221118041856.0210228e20210130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072937382DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130204602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBondi, Danilo 10aFeeding Your Himalayan Expedition: Nutritional Signatures and Body Composition Adaptations of Trekkers and Porters  aNAL-light  aHigh-altitude exposure leads to many physiological challenges, such as weight loss and dehydration. However, little attention has been posed to the role of nutrition and ethnic differences. Aiming to fulfill this gap, five Italian trekkers and seven Nepalese porters, all males, recorded their diet in diaries during a Himalayan expedition (19 days), and the average daily intake of micro and macro-nutrients were calculated. Bioimpedance analysis was performed five times during the trek; muscle ultrasound was performed before and after the expedition, only for the Italians. The Nepalese group consumed a lot of rice and only Italians consumed cheese. Water intake was slightly over 3000 g/d for both groups. Nepalese diet had a higher density of dietary fibre and lower density of riboflavin, vitamins A, K, and B12. Intake of calcium was lower than recommended levels. Body mass index, waist circumference, fat-free mass, and total body water decreased in both groups, whereas resistance (Rz) increased. Italians reactance (Xc) increased at day 9, whereas that of Nepalese occurred at days 5, 9, and 16. The cross-sectional area of the Vastus lateralis was reduced after the expedition. Specific nutritional and food-related risk factors guidance is needed for diverse expedition groups. Loss of muscle mass and balance of fluids both deserve a particular focus as concerns altitude expeditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aarea 3aaverage daily intake 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody mass index 3abody water 3acalcium 3acheeses 3adensity 3adietary fiber 3alean body mass 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3ariboflavin 3arice 3arisk 3aultrasonics 3awaist circumference 3awater 3aweight loss1 aAloisi, Anna  Maria1 aPietrangelo, Tiziana 1 aPiccinelli, Raffaela 1 aLe Donne, Cinzia 1 aJandová, Tereza,1 aPieretti, Stefano 1 aTaraborrelli, Mattia 1 aSantangelo, Carmen 1 aLattanzi, Bruna 1 aVerratti, Vittore 0 tNutrients.g2021 Jan. 30, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130204603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245016400159300001600323520169700339592002802036650002202064650001102086650001102097650001202108650002502120650002202145650000902167650001802176650001502194650001702209700001302226700001802239773010702257856008102364852000902445655001202454IND60133397420221123005808.0150520e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013339742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-014-0970-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTu, Lin10aCommon genetic variants (rs4779584 and rs10318) at 15q13.3 contributes to colorectal adenoma and colorectal cancer susceptibility: evidence based on 22 studies  ap. 901-912.  aSeveral genome-wide association studies on colorectal cancer (CRC) have reported similar findings of a new susceptibility locus, 15q13.3. After that, a number of studies have reported that the rs4779584 and rs10318 polymorphisms at chromosome 15q13.3 have been implicated in CRC and colorectal adenoma (CRA) risk; however, these studies have yielded inconsistent results. To investigate this inconsistency, we performed a meta-analysis of 22 studies involving a total of 48,468 CRC cases, 4,189 CRA cases, and 85,105 controls for the two polymorphisms to evaluate its effect on genetic susceptibility for CRC/CRA. Potential sources of heterogeneity and publication bias were also systematically explored. Overall, the summary odds ratio (OR) of rs4779584-T variant for CRC was 1.13 (95 % CI 1.09–1.16, P < 10⁻⁵) and 1.15 (95 % CI 1.04–1.28, P = 0.006) for CRA. After stratified by ethnicity, significantly increased CRC risks were found for rs4779584 polymorphism among East Asians and Caucasians, while no significant associations were detected among African American and other ethnic populations. A meta-analysis of studies on the rs10318 polymorphism also showed significant overall association with CRC, yielding a per-allele OR of 1.13 (95 % CI 1.02–1.24, P = 0.02). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased CRC risks were found in Caucasians; whereas no significant associations were found among East Asians and African Americans. This meta-analysis demonstrated that the rs4779584 and rs10318 polymorphism at 15q13.3 is a risk factor associated with increased CRC/CRA susceptibility, but these associations vary in different ethnic populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aAsians 3aWhites 3aadenoma 3acolorectal neoplasms 3agenetic variation 3aloci 3ameta-analysis 3aodds ratio 3arisk factors1 aYan, Bin1 aPeng, Zhiyong0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2015 June, v. 290, no. 3 p.901-912dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-014-0970-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245019400168300001600362520109300378592002801471650001201499650002301511650001701534650000901551650001601560650001801576650002001594650000901614650000701623650001701630653003101647653008501678653001801763653003501781653001801816653002901834700001401863700001601877700001601893700001801909773010001927856008702027852000902114655001202123IND60552321920221118085544.0190402e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055232192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.07.1382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Jiajia10aDevelopment and optimization of a naphthoic acid-based ionic liquid as a “non-organic solvent microextraction” for the determination of tetracycline antibiotics in milk and chicken eggs  ap. 138-148.  aIn traditional ionic liquids (ILs)-based microextraction, ILs are often used as extraction and dispersive solvents; however, their functional effects are not fully utilized. Herein, we developed a novel ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium naphthoic acid salt ([C4MIM][NPA]) with strong acidity. It was used as a mixed dispersive solvent with conventional [C2MIM][BF4] in “functionalized ionic liquid-based non-organic solvent microextraction (FIL-NOSM)” for determination of tetracycline antibiotics (TCs) in milk and eggs. Utilization of [C4MIM][NPA] in FIL-NOSM method increased extraction recoveries (ERs) of TCs by more than 20% and eliminated the pH adjustment step because of its strong acidity. Under optimized conditions based on central composite design, the ERs of four TCs were 94.1–102.1%, and the limitsofdetection were 0.08–1.12μgkg−1 in milk and egg samples. This proposed method provides high extraction efficiency, less pretreatment time and requires non-organic solvents for determination of trace TC concentrations in complex animal-based food matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aanimal-based foods 3achicken eggs 3aeggs 3afood matrix 3aionic liquids 3amicroextraction 3amilk 3apH 3atetracycline 0aIonic liquid [C4MIM][NPA]) 0aFunctionalized ionic liquid-based non-organic solvent microextraction (FIL-NOSM) 0aIonic liquids 0aTetracycline antibiotics (TCs) 0aFood products 0aCentral composite design1 aWang, Hui1 aQu, Jingang1 aWang, Huili1 aWang, Xuedong0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 215 p.138-148dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.07.1383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007900171300001600250520113700266592002801403650001401431650001801445650001301463650001901476650002701495650003501522650001901557650001101576650001101587651001801598653001401616653001701630653002301647653002201670653001901692700002401711700002101735700002301756700002601779773010801805856008501913852000901998655001202007IND60531700820221117190325.0190215e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053170082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2016.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorge, Kelly A.10aChanges in attitudes toward animals in the United States from 1978 to 2014  ap. 237-242.  aMore than three decades ago, Stephen Kellert surveyed >3000 Americans to gain a better understanding of their attitudes toward wildlife. We used a web-based questionnaire to survey a nationally representative sample of 1287U.S. residents, replicating 26 single-item measures of attitudes toward animals from Kellert's study. Attitudes toward all animals were remarkably similar in 1978 and 2014. The average change in rank was 2.1 (of 26), and species mean scores from 1978 and 2014 correlated at r=0.95. Americans' attitudes toward eight species exhibited substantive differences (Cohen's d>0.4). The greatest differences were for historically stigmatized species (e.g. bats, sharks, vultures, wolves and coyotes)—attitudes in 2014 were significantly more positive for these species. The majority of respondents reported positive attitudes toward wolves and coyotes, and the proportion of people reporting positive attitudes toward these species increased by 42 and 47%, respectively. The differences in attitudes witnessed in this study may be indicative of growing concern for the welfare of animals – both wild and domestic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmericans 3aCanis latrans 3aInternet 3aanimal welfare 3aattitudes and opinions 3anatural resources conservation 3aquestionnaires 3asharks 3awolves 3aUnited States 0aAttitudes 0aAnthropocene 0aValue orientations 0aAnimal preference 0aAnimal welfare1 aSlagle, Kristina M.1 aWilson, Robyn S.1 aMoeller, Steven J.1 aBruskotter, Jeremy T.0 tBiological conservation.g2016 Sept., v. 201 p.237-242dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2016.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001700167245011300184300001800297520118000315592002801495650001101523650001901534650001001553650003001563650002801593650001501621650001101636650002201647650001201669650004601681650002301727650004401750650002901794650002301823650003701846650003201883700001901915700001701934700001701951700001901968773011501987856008202102852000902184655001202193IND60114073620221118022014.0141112e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011407362DNAL7 a226833902pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2012.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSundra, T.M.14aThe influence of spasmolytic agents on heart rate variability and gastrointestinal motility in normal horses  ap. 1426-1433.  aThe effects of hyoscine-N-butylbromide (hyoscine) and propantheline-bromide (propantheline) on heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV) and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) contractions in the normal horse were determined. Five adult horses had ECG recordings for 180min after treatment with propantheline (100mg), hyoscine (120mg) or saline. Both propantheline and hyoscine reduced GIT sounds, with propantheline having a longer duration of effect (⩾120min). Both drugs elevated HR relative to the control baseline period (P<0.05), with the effects of propantheline again being of longer duration. HRV analysis indicated that propantheline suppressed Total Power (P<0.05), and both the high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) components of the power spectral analysis for up to 60–90min post treatment. Hyoscine had no effect on HRV Total Power but reduced the HF component for 30min after drug injection. Time domain variables correlated with Total Power and HF data (P<0.01). The marked effect of these compounds on parasympathetic control of cardiac and GIT function in normal horses should be taken into consideration when evaluating a clinical response to these agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3adrug injection 3adrugs 3agastrointestinal motility 3agastrointestinal system 3aheart rate 3ahorses 3aspectral analysis 2aAnimals 2aButylscopolammonium Bromidexpharmacology 2aCross-Over Studies 2aGastrointestinal Motilityxdrug effects 2aHeart Ratexdrug effects 2aHorsesxphysiology 2aParasympatholyticsxpharmacology 2aPropanthelinexpharmacology1 aHarrison, J.L.1 aLester, G.D.1 aRaidal, S.L.1 aPhillips, J.K.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2012 Dec., v. 93, no. 3 p.1426-1433dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.x0034-52887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2012.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007800173300001400251520119100265592002801456650002201484650001301506650001101519650001301530650001901543650001901562650001901581650003301600650001101633650001001644650001601654653002501670653001901695653003701714653002101751700002701772700002301799700002001822700002001842700002201862773008401884856008501968852000902053655001202062IND60633136120221119182539.0190325e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063313612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2019.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHofinger, Matthias10aMicrostructural evolution of a dual hardening steel during heat treatment  ap. 48-56.  aDual hardening steels combine precipitation of both secondary hardening carbides and intermetallic phases in a martensitic matrix. Due to this combination, the carbon content necessary to achieve high hardness levels can be reduced, resulting in a decreased amount of large and embrittling carbides.In this study, the influence of different heat treatments on microstructure evolution and secondary hardness is investigated. Different metallographic preparation methods were tested in order to visualize the microstructure. Carbides were characterized using spot-pattern electron backscatter diffraction.For light optical investigations, preparation with V2A-pickle lead to the best results. Preparation with colloidal silica suspension achieved the best results for investigations by scanning electron microscopy and for carbide characterization using electron backscatter diffraction. It was found that a homogenization treatment prior to austenitization was unable to increase the amount of dissolved carbides, and thus had no effect on secondary hardness. By increasing the austenitization temperature, the amount of carbides and secondary hardness could be increased significantly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbides 3acarbon 3ahardness 3aheat treatment 3ahomogenization 3amicrostructure 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asteel 3atemperature 0aDual hardening steel 0aHeat treatment 0aElectron backscatter diffraction 0aPrimary carbides1 aStaudacher, Maximilian1 aOgnianov, Miloslav1 aTurk, Christoph1 aLeitner, Harald1 aSchnitzer, Ronald0 tMicron.g2019 May, v. 120 p.48-56dElsevier LtdwJournal:12416x0968-43287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2019.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245018400166500001400350520156200364592002801926650001101954650002001965650002201985650001602007650002302023650001402046650001502060650002902075650003002104650001502134650001602149650001502165650001202180650001002192650001602202700003102218700003102249700004302280700002602323700003702349773012202386856007402508852000902582655001202591IND60729374120221118041749.0210228e20210130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072937412DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130204732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishioka, Alessandra 10aStratification of Volunteers According to Flavanone Metabolite Excretion and Phase II Metabolism Profile after Single Doses of ‘Pera’ Orange and ‘Moro’ Blood Orange Juices  aNAL-light  aLarge interindividual variations in the biological response to citrus flavanones have been observed, and this could be associated with high variations in their bioavailability. The aim of this study was to identify the main determinants underlying interindividual differences in citrus flavanone metabolism and excretion. In a randomized cross-over study, non-obese and obese volunteers, aged 19–40 years, ingested single doses of Pera and Moro orange juices, and urine was collected for 24 h. A large difference in the recovery of the urinary flavanone phase II metabolites was observed, with hesperetin-sulfate and hesperetin-sulfo-O-glucuronide being the major metabolites. Subjects were stratified according to their total excretion of flavanone metabolites as high, medium, and low excretors, but the expected correlation with the microbiome was not observed at the genus level. A second stratification was proposed according to phase II flavanone metabolism, whereby participants were divided into two excretion groups: Profiles A and B. Profile B individuals showed greater biotransformation of hesperetin-sulfate to hesperetin-sulfo-O-glucuronide, as well as transformation of flavanone-monoglucuronide to the respective diglucuronides, suggestive of an influence of polymorphisms on UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. In conclusion, this study proposes a new stratification of volunteers based on their metabolic profiles. Gut microbiota composition and polymorphisms of phase II enzymes may be related to the interindividual variability of metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3abioavailability 3abiotransformation 3acorrelation 3across-over studies 3aexcretion 3aflavanones 3aglucuronosyltransferases 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amicrobiome 3aoranges 3aurine 3avariability1 aTobaruela, Eric  de Castro1 aFraga, Layanne  Nascimento1 aTomas-Barberan, F.

The oesophageal pH in anaesthetised dogs undergoing endoscopic evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract (END group; n = 12) or orthopaedic surgery (ORT group; n = 12) was measured using an oesophageal probe. The dogs were sedated with acepromazine or with methadone or butorphanol, and anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane. Of the 24 dogs in this study, 21 (87.5%) had an episode of GER during anaesthesia. The incidence of GER, as well as the first, the minimum, and the maximum pH values, did not differ significantly between the groups. The mean maximum difference versus the first pH value was higher for dogs in the END group (-2.6 ± 3.5) as compared with those in the ORT group (-0.7 ± 2.5), although they were not statistically significant (p = 0.25). The administration of methadone or butorphanol had no significant effect on the development of acidic reflux or biliary reflux. In the acepromazine-sedated dogs, the incidence of GER did not differ significantly between patients undergoing an endoscopic procedure and those undergoing orthopaedic surgery; however, during endoscopy, fluctuations in the oesophageal pH can be expected, even without any clinical signs of GER.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacepromazine 3aanesthesia 3abutorphanol 3adigestive tract 3aendoscopy 3agastroesophageal reflux 3aisoflurane 3amethadone 3aorthopedics 3apH 3aveterinary medicine1 aPietra, Marco 1 aGaliazzo, Giorgia 1 aTorresan, Francesco 1 aPinna, Stefania 1 aPisoni, Luciano 1 aRomagnoli, Noemi 0 tVeterinary sciences.g2020 Sept. 25, v. 7, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27139x2306-73817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vetsci70401443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002900180245010100209506007600310520136100386592002801747506003701775650002501812650001101837650001801848650001501866650001201881650001101893650002301904650002001927650002301947650002201970650001001992650001602002650001802018650001502036651001002051700004102061700003002102773012202132856007302254852000902327655001202336IND60650066720221207101232.0190709e20161008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065006672DNAL7 a10.3390/nu81006182doi7 aPMC50840062pmcid7 a277405992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerrano Iglesias, María10aComposition and Nutrient Information of Non-Alcoholic Beverages in the Spanish Market: An Update  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study was to draw an updated map of the nutrition facts in the different categories of non-alcoholic beverages in the Spanish market based on the information declared on the labels of these products; we expect this first step to justify the need for the coordination and harmonization of food composition tables in Spain so that there will be an updated database available to produce realistic scientific nutrient intake estimates in accordance with the actual market scenario. Materials and Methods: The nutrition facts declared on the labels of non-alcoholic beverages by manufacturers in Spain were compiled and studied. Results: The database included 211 beverages classified in 7 groups with energy/carbohydrate content per 100 mL ranging from 0–55 kcal/0–13 g for soft drinks; 2–60 kcal/0–14.5 g for energy drinks; 24–31 kcal/5.8–7.5 g for sports drinks; 1–32 kcal/0–7.3 g for drinks containing mineral salts in their composition; 14–69 kcal/2.6–17 g for fruit juice, nectar, and grape musts; 43–78 kcal/6.1–14.4 g for vegetable drinks; and 33–88 kcal/3.6–14 g for dairy drinks.

In the present study, ptfA gene encoding for type IV fimbrial subunit of P. multocida serogroup B:2 (strain p52), an Indian HS vaccine strain, has been cloned and over-expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli. The recombinant type IV fimbrial subunit protein (∼31kDa) including N-terminus histidine tag was purified under denaturing condition and confirmed by western blotting. A homology model of HS causing P. multocida serogroup B:2 fimbrial subunit has also been discussed. The study indicated the potential possibilities to use the recombinant fimbrial protein in developing HS subunit vaccine along with suitable adjuvant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPasteurella multocida 3aWestern blotting 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3afimbriae 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahistidine 3amodels 3aserotypes 3atropics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFimbriae Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterialxphysiology 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Annotation 2aPasteurella multocidaxmetabolism 2aProtein Conformation 2aProtein Subunitsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 3aAsia1 aYogisharadhya, Revanaiah1 aAhuja, Anuj1 aBhanuprakash, Veerakyathappa0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2012 Dec., v. 93, no. 3 p.1128-1131dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.x0034-52887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2012.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04664naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011300162300001600275520329900291592002803590650002103618650001603639650002103655650002003676650001003696650001903706650001203725650001803737650002603755650001403781650003303795650001403828650002403842650001403866650001603880700001703896700001903913700001703932700001403949700001803963700001603981773010703997856008104104852000904185655001204194IND60133398020221123023127.0150520e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013339802DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-014-0958-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Gang10aGenome-wide analysis of the WW domain-containing protein genes in silkworm and their expansion in eukaryotes  ap. 807-824.  aWW domains are protein modules that mediate protein–protein interactions through recognition of proline-rich peptide motifs and phosphorylated serine/threonine–proline sites. WW domains are found in many different structural and signaling proteins that are involved in a variety of cellular processes. WW domain-containing proteins (WWCPs) and complexes have been implicated in major human diseases including cancer as well as in major signaling cascades such as the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, making them targets for new diagnostics and therapeutics. There are a number of reports about the WWCPs in different species, but systematic analysis of the WWCP genes and its ligands is still lacking in silkworm and the other organisms. In this study, WWCP genes and PY motif-containing proteins have been identified and analyzed in 56 species including silkworm. Whole-genome screening of B. mori identified thirty-three proteins with thirty-nine WW domains located on thirteen chromosomes. In the 39 silkworm WW domains, 15 domains belong to the Group I WW domain; 14 domains were in Group II/III, 9 domains derived from 8 silkworm WWCPs could not be classified into any group, and Group IV contains only one WW domain. Based on gene annotation, silkworm WWCP genes have functions in multi-biology processes. A detailed list of WWCPs from the other 55 species was sorted in this work. In 14,623 silkworm predicted proteins, nearly 18 % contained PY motif, nearly 30 % contained various motifs totally that could be recognized by WW domains. Gene Ontology and KEGG analysis revealed that dozens of WW domain-binding proteins are involved in Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, mTOR, EGF and Jak-STAT signaling pathway. Tissue expression patterns of WWCP genes and potential WWCP-binding protein genes on the third day of the fifth instar (L5D3) were examined by microarray analysis. Tissue expression profile analysis found that several WWCP genes and poly-proline or PY motif-containing protein genes took tissue- or gender-dependent expression manner in silkworms. We further analyzed WWCPs and PY motif-containing proteins in representative organisms of invertebrates and vertebrates. The results showed that there are no less than 16 and up to 29 WWCPs in insects, the average is 22. The number of WW domains in insects is no less than 19, and up to 47, the average is 36. In vertebrates, excluding the Hydrobiontes, the number of WWCPs is no less than 34 and up to 49, the average is 43. The number of WW domains in vertebrates is no less than 56 and up to 85, the average is 73. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most homologous genes of the WWCP subfamily in vertebrates were duplicated during evolution and functions diverged. Nearly 1,000 PY motif-containing protein genes were found in insect genomes and nearly 2,000 genes in vertebrates. The different distributions of WWCP genes and PY motif-containing protein genes in different species revealed a possible positive correlation with organism complexity. In conclusion, this comprehensive bio-information analysis of WWCPs and its binding ligands would provide rich fundamental knowledge and useful information for further exploration of the function of the WW domain-containing proteins not only in silkworm, but also in other species.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3achromosomes 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3ainstars 3ainvertebrates 3amicroarray technology 3aphylogeny 3aprotein-protein interactions 3ascreening 3asignal transduction 3asilkworms 3avertebrates1 aDai, Fangyin1 aTong, Xiaoling1 aLi, Niannian1 aDing, Xin1 aSong, Jiangbo1 aLü, Cheng,0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2015 June, v. 290, no. 3 p.807-824dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-014-0958-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245013200167500001400299520127500313592002801588650002001616650002601636650001501662650001301677650001501690650003801705650000901743650002101752650001601773650001501789651001301804700002101817700002801838773013201866856007701998852000902075655001202084IND60721798720221121174035.0201224e20201028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072179872DNAL7 a10.3390/vetsci70401632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinghla, Tawatchai 10aValidation of a Novel ELISA for the Diagnosis of Hemorrhagic Septicemia in Dairy Cattle from Thailand Using a Bayesian Approach  aNAL-light  aThe objective of this study was to estimate sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test (using a coating antigen from Pasteurella multocida M-1404 via heat extraction) and an indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test for detection of Hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) in dairy cows, under Thai conditions, using a Bayesian approach. Dairy cow sera with a total of 1236 samples from 44 farms were tested with the two tests to detect immune responses against the HS. Percentages of positive samples for the ELISA and IHA tests were 73% (901/1236) and 70% (860/1236), respectively. Estimated sensitivity and estimated specificity of the ELISA test were 90.5% (95% posterior probability interval (PPI) = 83.2–95.4%) and 70.8% (95% PPI = 60.8–79.8%), respectively. Additionally, estimates for the Se and Sp values of the IHA test were 77.0% (95% PPI = 70.8–84.1%) and 51.1% (PPI = 36.8–66.3%), respectively. The estimated prevalence of the disease was 71.7% (95% PPI = 62.7–82.6%). These results demonstrate that the ELISA test can be a useful tool for the detection of the presence of an antibody against the HS in dairy cows. Notably, the cows in this area indicated a high percentage of exposure to Pasteurella multocida.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aPasteurella multocida 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3adairy cows 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aheat 3ahemagglutination 3aprobability 3asepticemia 3aThailand1 aTankaew, Pallop 1 aSthitmatee, Nattawooti 0 tVeterinary sciences.g2020 Oct. 28, v. 7, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27139x2306-73817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vetsci70401633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04504naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002100188245016600209300001100375506007600386520237600462592002802838596005602866506003702922650002202959650003102981650002903012650001203041650001403053650002603067650001303093650001303106650001203119650001603131650001203147650001803159650001003177650002603187650001303213650001603226650002603242650001603268650001203284650001303296650002003309650002303329650003003352650002203382650001303404650001103417650001103428700002903439700001503468700002103483700002503504700002803529700002903557700002403586773011703610856008203727852000903809655001203818IND60548659520221207124825.0200912e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054865952DNAL7 a268395862pmid7 aPMC47362522pmcid7 a10.1186/s13068-016-0432-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCroux, Christian10aConstruction of a restriction-less, marker-less mutant useful for functional genomic and metabolic engineering of the biofuel producer Clostridium acetobutylicum  ap. 23.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Clostridium acetobutylicum is a gram-positive, spore-forming, anaerobic bacterium capable of converting various sugars and polysaccharides into solvents (acetone, butanol, and ethanol). The sequencing of its genome has prompted new approaches to genetic analysis, functional genomics, and metabolic engineering to develop industrial strains for the production of biofuels and bulk chemicals. RESULTS: The method used in this paper to knock-out or knock-in genes in C. acetobutylicum combines the use of an antibiotic-resistance gene for the deletion or replacement of the target gene, the subsequent elimination of the antibiotic-resistance gene with the flippase recombinase system from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and a C. acetobutylicum strain that lacks upp, which encodes uracil phosphoribosyl-transferase, for subsequent use as a counter-selectable marker. A replicative vector containing (1) a pIMP13 origin of replication from Bacillus subtilis that is functional in Clostridia, (2) a replacement cassette consisting of an antibiotic resistance gene (MLS ᴿ) flanked by two FRT sequences, and (3) two sequences homologous to selected regions around target DNA sequence was first constructed. This vector was successfully used to consecutively delete the Cac824I restriction endonuclease encoding gene (CA_C1502) and the upp gene (CA_C2879) in the C. acetobutylicum ATCC824 chromosome. The resulting C. acetobutylicum Δcac1502Δupp strain is marker-less, readily transformable without any previous plasmid methylation and can serve as the host for the “marker-less” genetic exchange system. The third gene, CA_C3535, shown in this study to encode for a type II restriction enzyme (Cac824II) that recognizes the CTGAAG sequence, was deleted using an upp/5-FU counter-selection strategy to improve the efficiency of the method. The restriction-less marker-less strain and the method was successfully used to delete two genes (ctfAB) on the pSOL1 megaplasmid and one gene (ldhA) on the chromosome to get strains no longer producing acetone or L-lactate. CONCLUSIONS: The restriction-less, marker-less strain described in this study, as well as the maker-less genetic exchange coupled with positive selection, will be useful for functional genomic studies and for the development of industrial strains for the production of biofuels and bulk chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data  aPEOPLE-ITN-2008-237942cSeventh Framework Programme0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3aClostridium acetobutylicum 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetone 3aanaerobes 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abiofuels 3abutanol 3achromosomes 3aethanol 3agene deletion 3agenes 3agenetic recombination 3agenomics 3alactic acid 3ametabolic engineering 3amethylation 3amutants 3aplasmids 3apolysaccharides 3areplication origin 3arestriction endonucleases 3asequence homology 3asolvents 3asugars 3auracil1 aNguyen, Ngoc-Phuong-Thao1 aLee, Jieun1 aRaynaud, Céline1 aSaint-Prix, Florence1 aGonzalez-Pajuelo, Maria1 aMeynial-Salles, Isabelle1 aSoucaille, Philippe0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.23-23dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-016-0432-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03676naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245019600175300001200371520163300383592002802016596006802044650002302112650002702135650002302162650002902185650002602214650001302240650001502253650001302268650001402281650001302295650001202308650001902320650001402339650001002353650001602363650001002379650000902389650002002398650001102418650001302429650001402442650005202456650001302508650001602521650002402537651001002561700003002571700002602601700002102627700002602648700004002674700001802714700001902732700002902751700003702780773011702817856008302934852000903017655001203026IND60712577320221117205704.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071257732DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-020-02511-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVargas-Castro, Ignacio10aAlpha- and gammaherpesviruses in stranded striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) from Spain: first molecular detection of gammaherpesvirus infection in central nervous system of odontocetes  ap. 288.  aBACKGROUND: Herpesvirus infections in cetaceans have always been attributed to the Alphaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae subfamilies. To date, gammaherpesviruses have not been reported in the central nervous system of odontocetes. CASE PRESENTATION: A mass stranding of 14 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) occurred in Cantabria (Spain) on 18th May 2019. Tissue samples were collected and tested for herpesvirus using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and for cetacean morbillivirus using reverse transcription-PCR. Cetacean morbillivirus was not detected in any of the animals, while gammaherpesvirus was detected in nine male and one female dolphins. Three of these males were coinfected by alphaherpesviruses. Alphaherpesvirus sequences were detected in the cerebrum, spinal cord and tracheobronchial lymph node, while gammaherpesvirus sequences were detected in the cerebrum, cerebellum, spinal cord, pharyngeal tonsils, mesenteric lymph node, tracheobronchial lymph node, lung, skin and penile mucosa. Macroscopic and histopathological post-mortem examinations did not unveil the potential cause of the mass stranding event or any evidence of severe infectious disease in the dolphins. The only observed lesions that may be associated with herpesvirus were three cases of balanitis and one penile papilloma. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of gammaherpesvirus infection in the central nervous system of odontocete cetaceans. This raises new questions for future studies about how gammaherpesviruses reach the central nervous system and how infection manifests clinically.  aPublisher supplied data  aFPU18/01499cMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades 3aAlphaherpesvirinae 3aCetacean morbillivirus 3aGammaherpesvirinae 3aHerpesviridae infections 3aStenella coeruleoalba 3aadenoids 3acerebellum 3acerebrum 3adetection 3adolphins 3afemales 3ahistopathology 3aknowledge 3alungs 3alymph nodes 3amales 3amass 3amixed infection 3amucosa 3anecropsy 3apapilloma 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asampling 3aspinal cord 3aveterinary medicine 3aSpain1 aCrespo-Picazo, José Luis1 aRivera-Arroyo, Belén1 aSánchez, Rocío1 aMarco-Cabedo, Vicente1 aJiménez-Martínez, María Ángeles1 aFayos, Manena1 aSerdio, Ángel1 aGarcía-Párraga, Daniel1 aSánchez-Vizcaíno, José Manuel0 tBMC veterinary research.g2020 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.288-288dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02511-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03778naa a2200937 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001100150245009200161300001600253520149700269592002801766650001601794650002001810650001801830650001401848650001101862650002301873650001501896650001301911650001401924650001201938650002001950650001001970650002301980650001102003650001702014650001702031650004302048650001002091650001202101650002202113650001102135653003002146653001202176653002302188653002302211653001602234653000902250653000802259653000802267653000802275653000802283653001002291653000802301653001402309653000702323653000802330653000902338653000802347653000802355653001502363653000702378653000802385653000702393653000802400653000702408653000702415653000802422653000802430653000702438653000802445653000802453653000802461653000802469653000702477653001202484653000802496653000802504700001702512700001202529700001402541700005502555773012402610856008502734852000902819655001202828IND60591958520221117041257.0190516e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059195852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Ke10aCharacterization of a SUPERMAN-like Gene, MdSUP11, in apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.)  ap. 136-142.  aArabidopsis SUPERMAN and its family members of its family play important roles in plant growth and floral organ development; yet much less is known about their functions expanding in apple tree development. Previous work has identified 12 SUP-like genes in the apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) genome, and the MdSUP11 which is expressed in both vegetative and reproductive organs of apple. However, the function of MdSUP11 remains obscure. In this study, the β-glucuronidase expression driven by the MdSUP11 native promoter was detected in roots, young leaves, and floral organs of transgenic Arabidopsis. In transgenic tobacco, overexpression of MdSUP11 lead to dwarfism, aberrant leaf shapes, and morphological changes of floral organs. Endogenous concentrations of auxin (indole-3-acetic acid), abscisic acid, isopentenyl adenosine and zeatin riboside were significantly higher in young MdSUP11-transformed tobacco plants than in non-transformed plants. Gene expression analysis using real-time quantitative PCR showed up-regulation of NtDFR2 and NtANS1 expression in unopened transgenic flowers, whereas NtCHS expression was not changed significantly. Together, these results suggest that MdSUP11 is associated with apple's vegetative and reproductive development. Its overexpression in tobacco affects leaf and flower organ development and plant height; potentially by changing NtDFR2 and NtANS1 expression and endogenous levels of indole-3-acetic acid, cytokinins and abscisic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aMalus domestica 3aabscisic acid 3aadenosine 3aapples 3abeta-glucuronidase 3acytokinins 3adwarfing 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agene expression 3agenes 3aindole acetic acid 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants 3azeatin 0aMalus × domestica Borkh. 0aMdSUP11 0aEctopic expression 0aEndogenous hormone 0aAnthocyanin 0aZFPs 0aSUP 0asup 0aJAG 0aKNU 0aCsSUP 0aGUS 0aPlantCARE 0aMS 0aHyg 0a6-BA 0aNAA 0aCef 0aMdSUP11-ox 0aCK 0aCTK 0aGA 0aIAA 0aBR 0aJA 0aABA 0aiPA 0aZR 0aGA3 0aCHS 0aDFR 0aANS 0aTS 0aqRT-PCR 0aLIF 0aSAZ1 aWang, Limin,1 aLiu, Na1 aXie, Xuan1 aZhu, YuanDi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5156-69500 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2018 Apr., v. 125 p.136-142dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245011400183300001800297520146200315592002801777650002101805650002001826650001301846650001601859650001901875650001301894650001501907650002501922650004801947650003501995650002702030650005302057700001702110700002802127700001502155700001502170773013502185856008102320852000902401655001202410IND50088753520221120152028.0141211e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008875352DNAL7 a244352052pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-014-2502-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xingzu10aFate and transformation of naphthylaminesulfonic azo dye Reactive Black 5 during wastewater treatment process  ap. 5713-5723.  aCertain aromatic amines generated by the decolorization of some azo dyes are not removed substantially by conventional anaerobic–aerobic biotreatment. These aromatic amines are potentially toxic and often released in the wastewater of industrial plants. In this study, the fate and transformation of the naphthylaminesulfonic azo dye Reactive Black 5 (RB5) during different phases of a sequencing batch reactor were investigated. The major products of RB5 decolorization during the anaerobic phase include 2-[(4-aminophenyl)sulfonyl]ethyl hydrogen sulfate (APSEHS) and 1-2-7-triamino-8-hydroxy-3-6-naphthalinedisulfate (TAHNDS). During the aerobic phase, APSEHS was hydrolyzed and produced 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid, which was further degraded via dearomatization. TAHNDS was transformed rapidly via auto-oxidation into TAHNDSDP₋₁and TAHNDSDP₋₂, which were not further removed by the activated sludge during the entire 30-day aerobic phase. In contrast, different behaviors of TAHNDS were observed during the anoxic phase. The transformation of TAHNDS was initiated either by deamination or desulfonation reaction. TAHNDS was then converted into 3,5-diamino-4-hydroxynaphthalene-2-sulfonic acid, which was subsequently removed via ring cleavage reaction under aerobic condition. In conclusion, complete degradation of TAHNDS by activated sludge occurs only during anoxic/aerobic processes instead of the conventional anaerobic/aerobic processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aaromatic amines 3aazo dyes 3adeamination 3adecolorization 3ahydrogen 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 2aNaphthalenesulfonatesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWastewaterxchemistry. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry.1 aCheng, Xiang1 aSun, Chuanfeng,d-1890,1 aRen, Yiwei1 aXu, Guihua0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Apr., v. 21, no. 8 p.5713-5723dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-2502-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002200161245005000183300001600233500000900249520166600258592002801924650001201952650001201964650001401976650000901990650001001999650001302009650002802022650002702050650001802077650001602095650001302111650001502124650001102139650001702150650001402167650002302181650000902204650001802213650001302231650001602244651001902260773014902279856009602428852000902524655001202533IND60669657820221119020727.0191125e196309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066965782DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1963.03615995002700050032x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliamson, R. E.14aThe Management of Soil Salinity in Lysimeters  ap. 580-583.  aepub  aSoil salinity quickly became a problem in sheltered lysimeters used for studies of the drainage requirements of crops in North Carolina. Water tables were maintained by subsurface watering at depths of 6 to 40 inches below the soil surface in 3-foot-square lysimeters, with some sheltered from rainfall and others exposed to rainfall. All were exposed alike to other atmospheric conditions. Very high levels of P, K, and Ca were established in the soil by mixing 0-20-0, muriate of potash, and lime with the soil placed into each tank. Soybean plants exhibited chlorosis and stunted growth in the lysimeters with subsurface watering only. These symptoms were serious approximately 1 month after the establishment of water tables only 6 inches beneath the surface, but were less pronounced with the deeper water tables. They were not observed where rain fell on the soil. At any water table depth, the plant growth and yield were best on the lysimeters that were leached with rainfall. Plant growth increased with depth to water table to a depth of 24 inches, both with and without rain on the soil. After soybean harvest in 1959, the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract from the soil in the top 6 inches of all lysimeters was 4 to 5 millimhos where subsurface watering only was used, and 0.4 millimho where rain fell on the soil. Lower fertilizer applications and leaching with small amounts of water kept the soil salinity in the upper 6-inches at a low level in subsequent years. Crops of soybeans, cabbage, corn, grain sorghum, and string beans were produced successfully both in the lysimeters sheltered from rain and in those exposed to rain.  aPublisher supplied data 3acabbage 3acalcium 3achlorosis 3acorn 3acrops 3adrainage 3aelectrical conductivity 3afertilizer application 3agrain sorghum 3agreen beans 3aleaching 3alysimeters 3amixing 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3arain 3asoil salinity 3asoybeans 3awater table 3aNorth Carolina0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1963 Sept., v. 27, no. 5 p.580-583dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1963.03615995002700050032x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002500169245016500194300001800359520147900377592002801856650001201884650001901896650001601915650002101931650001701952650001501969650000901984650002301993650001702016650001002033650002202043650002902065650003802094650002602132650001202158650004102170650002702211651001502238651001502253653001202268653001602280653002302296653001102319653001502330700002202345700002602367700002002393700001802413700001902431700002102450700002702471700002202498700001802520700002202538700002102560700002302581700002402604700001802628773013102646856005102777852000902828655001202837IND50076402920221120050554.0140410e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007640292DNAL7 a218798502pmid7 a10.1080/10934529.2011.5987682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhattacharya, Prosun10aTemporal and seasonal variability of arsenic in drinking water wells in Matlab, southeastern Bangladesh: A preliminary evaluation on the basis of a 4 year study  ap. 1177-1184.  aTemporal and seasonal variability of As concentrations in groundwater were evaluated in As-affected areas of Matlab, southeastern Bangladesh. Groundwater samples from 61 randomly selected tubewells were analyzed for As concentrations over a period of three years and four months (from July 2002 to November 2005) and monitored seasonally (three times a year). The mean As concentrations in the sampled tubewells decreased from 153 to 123 μg/L during July 2002 to November 2005. Such changes were pronounced in tubewells with As concentration >50 μg/L than those with As concentrations <50 μg/L. Similarly, individual wells revealed temporal variability, for example some wells indicated a decreasing trend, while some other wells indicated stable As concentration during the monitoring period. The mean As concentrations were significantly higher in Matlab North compared with Matlab South. The spatial variations in the mean As concentrations may be due to the differences in local geological conditions and groundwater flow patterns. The variations in mean As concentrations were also observed in shallow (<40 m) and deep (>40 m) wells. However, to adequately evaluate temporal and seasonal variability of As concentration, it is imperative to monitor As concentrations in tubewells over a longer period of time. Such long-term monitoring will provide important information for the assessment of human health risk and the sustainability of safe drinking water supplies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahuman health 3amonitoring 3arisk 3aseasonal variation 3awater supply 3awells 2aArsenicxanalysis 2aDrinking Waterxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGroundwaterxanalysis 2aSeasons 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Wellsxanalysis. 3aBangladesh 0aBangladesh 0aArsenic 0agroundwater 0atemporal variation 0aMatlab 0aBangladesh1 aHossain, Mohammed1 aRahman, Shamsun Naima1 aRobinson, Clare1 aNath, Bibhash1 aRahman, Marina1 aIslam, M.

The objective of this study is to utilize data from two population-based prospective cohort studies to examine the calcium supplementation status and to identify whether breastfeeding is associated with increased calcium supplementation among Chinese mothers after child birth. Information from 1540 mothers on breastfeeding and calcium supplementation measured at discharge, 1, 3, and 6 months postpartum were extracted to evaluate the association between breastfeeding and calcium supplementation postpartum. A generalized linear mixed model was applied to each study initially to account for the inherent correlation among repeated measurements, adjusting for socio-demographic, obstetric factors and calcium supplementation during pregnancy. In addition, breastfeeding status measured at different follow-up time points was treated as a time dependent variable in the longitudinal analysis. Furthermore, the effect sizes of the two cohort studies were pooled using fixed effect model. Based on the two cohort studies, the pooled likelihood of taking calcium supplementation postpartum among breastfeeding mothers was 4.02 times (95% confidence interval (2.30, 7.03)) higher than that of their non-breastfeeding counterparts. Dietary supplementation intervention programs targeting different subgroups should be promoted in Chinese women, given currently a wide shortage of dietary calcium intake and calcium supplementation postpartum.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChinese people 3abreast feeding 3acalcium 3achildbirth 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3adietary supplements 3alactating women 3alongitudinal studies 3amothers 3apostpartum period 3apregnancy 3astatistical models1 aZhao, Yun1 aBinns, C.

To evaluate how Pb induces oxidative stress, and modulates the antioxidant enzymes and the phytohormones pool, four-week old Pisum sativum plants were exposed during 28 days to 10, 100 and 500 mg kg−1 Pb in soil. In comparison to leaves, roots showed higher Pb accumulation, oxidative damages and changes in phytohormone pools. Contrarily to leaves, where glutathione reductase (GR) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities were more stimulated than catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), roots showed a stimulation of SOD, GR and APX in all doses, and of CAT in the highest dose. While protein oxidation occurred in roots even at lower Pb-doses, lipid peroxidation and membrane permeability also occurred but at 500 mg kg−1 and in both organs, accompanied by increases of H2O2. Jasmonic acid (JA) responded in both organs even at lowest Pb-doses, while salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA, only in leaves), increased particularly at the concentration of 500 mg Pb kg−1. In conclusion, and compared with leaves, roots showed oxidative damage even at 10 mg Pb Kg−1, being proteins a first oxidative-target, although there is a stimulation of the antioxidant enzymes. Also, JA is mobilized prior to oxidative stress changes are detected, and may play a protective role (activating antioxidant enzymes), while the mobilization of SA is particularly relevant in cells expressing oxidative damage. Other hormones, like indolacetic acid and ABA may have a low protective role against Pb toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPisum sativum 3aabscisic acid 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahormones 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ajasmonic acid 3alead 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amembrane permeability 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3aproteins 3aroots 3asalicylic acid 3asoil 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aLipid peroxidation 0aPisum sativum 0aPhytohormonal response 0aProtein oxidation 0aReactive oxygen species 0aAbscisic acid 0aascorbate peroxidase 0acatalase 0acell membrane permeability 0aglutathione reductase 0ahydrogen peroxide 0aindolacetic acid 0ajasmonic acid 0amalondialdehyde 0asalicylic acid 0asuperoxide dismutase1 aMariz-Ponte, Nuno1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1695-27621 aSantos, Conceição,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4129-63810 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2019 Apr., v. 137 p.121-129dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006400164300001800228520125600246592002801502650001601530650000801546650001201554650002101566650001601587650002001603650002401623650001401647650001601661650001201677650001101689650001101700650001101711650001101722650001501733650002401748650002101772650004301793650005201836650001901888650001801907650001401925650002301939650000901962650001101971700001901982700001502001700001702016700001902033700001802052700001802070700001702088700001502105700001502120700001702135773010902152856008102261852000902342655001202351IND60133398420221123005742.0150520e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013339842DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-014-0980-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Liang10aOverexpression of host plant urease in transgenic silkworms  ap. 1117-1123.  aBombyx mori and mulberry constitute a model of insect–host plant interactions. Urease hydrolyzes urea to ammonia and is important for the nitrogen metabolism of silkworms because ammonia is assimilated into silk protein. Silkworms do not synthesize urease and acquire it from mulberry leaves. We synthesized the artificial DNA sequence ure-as using the codon bias of B. mori to encode the signal peptide and mulberry urease protein. A transgenic vector that overexpresses ure-as under control of the silkworm midgut-specific P2 promoter was constructed. Transgenic silkworms were created via embryo microinjection. RT-PCR results showed that urease was expressed during the larval stage and qPCR revealed the expression only in the midgut of transgenic lines. Urea concentration in the midgut and hemolymph of transgenic silkworms was significantly lower than in a nontransgenic line when silkworms were fed an artificial diet. Analysis of the daily body weight and food conversion efficiency of the fourth and fifth instar larvae and economic characteristics indicated no differences between transgenic silkworms and the nontransgenic line. These results suggested that overexpression of host plant urease promoted nitrogen metabolism in silkworms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aDNA 3aammonia 3aartificial diets 3abody weight 3afood conversion 3agene overexpression 3ahemolymph 3ahost plants 3ainstars 3alarvae 3aleaves 3amidgut 3amodels 3amulberries 3anitrogen metabolism 3apromoter regions 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal peptide 3asilk proteins 3asilkworms 3atransgenic insects 3aurea 3aurease1 aHuang, Chunlin1 aSun, Qiang1 aGuo, Huizhen1 aPeng, Zhengwen1 aDang, Yinghui1 aLiu, Weiqiang1 aXing, Dongxu1 aXu, Guowen1 aZhao, Ping1 aXia, Qingyou0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2015 June, v. 290, no. 3 p.1117-1123dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-014-0980-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04094naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245021500165300001400380520218400394592002802578650002502606650001402631650001402645650002002659650000902679650002402688650004302712650000902755650001302764650000902777650001402786650001902800650002702819650002902846650004402875653004902919653005802968653002703026653002603053653003403079653002003113653001403133700001303147700001803160700002103178700001703199700001503216700001903231700001603250700001803266700001403284773011203298856008503410852000903495655001203504IND60628860420221119131132.0190321e20190412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062886042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2019.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Meng10aComprehensive screening of 63 coloring agents in cosmetics using matrix solid-phase dispersion and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry  ap. 27-38.  aAn analytical methodology for comprehensive screening of 63 coloring agents of great concern for regulatory control in cosmetics has been established using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with quadrupole-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (Q-Orbitrap HRMS). An effective, rapid, and simple sample pretreatment protocol with low sample and reagent consumption was developed based on matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD). The selection of the most suitable extraction conditions was made using statistical tools of factorial multifactor experimental design and analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the final conditions, 0.1 g of cosmetic sample was blended with 0.3 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate and 0.4 g of sand, and the MSPD column was eluted with 2 mL of methanol. The extract was analyzed by UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS under synchronous full-scan MS and data-dependent MS/MS (full-scan MS1/dd-MS2) acquisition mode. The mass resolution was set to 70,000 FWHM (full width at half maximum) for full-scan MS1 and 17,500 FWHM for dd-MS2 stage with the experimentally measured mass deviations of less than 3 ppm (parts per million) for quasi-molecular ions and 5 ppm for characteristic fragment ions for each individual analyte. An accurate-mass database and a mass spectral library were built in house for searching the 63 target compounds. Broad screening was conducted by comparing the experimentally measured exact mass of precursor and fragment ions, retention time, isotopic pattern, and ionic ratio with the accurate-mass database and by matching the acquired MS/MS spectra against the mass spectral library. Method performance was evaluated in terms of limits of detection (LODs), limits of quantitation (LOQs), linearity, precision, recovery, and matrix effect. The UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS approach was applied for the simultaneous analysis of 63 target coloring agents in 69 genuine cosmetic samples. Eleven legally prohibited coloring agents were detected in 26 cosmetic samples in total. The proposed method exhibited great potential for high-throughput, sensitive, and reliable screening of multi-class coloring agent substances in cosmetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3acosmetics 3adatabases 3adetection limit 3adyes 3aexperimental design 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aions 3amethanol 3asand 3ascreening 3asodium sulfate 3asolid phase extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aUltra-high-performance liquid chromatography 0aQuadrupole-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry 0aAccurate-mass database 0aMass spectral library 0aMatrix solid-phase dispersion 0aColoring agents 0aCosmetics1 aBai, Hua1 aZhai, Junfeng1 aMeng, Xianshuang1 aGuo, Xiangyu1 aWang, Chun1 aWang, Penglong1 aLei, Haimin1 aNiu, Zengyuan1 aMa, Qiang0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Apr. 12, v. 1590 p.27-38dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2019.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010200159500001400261520155200275592002801827650001901855650001401874650001101888650000901899650003401908650002001942650001701962650001501979650001101994650000902005650001202014650001202026650002202038650002502060700002202085700002402107700002102131700002202152700002202174773012202196856007402318852000902392655001202401IND60729374920221118041709.0210228e20210131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072937492DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130204792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Shilpi 10aInedible Food Waste Linked to Diet Quality and Food Spending in the Seattle Obesity Study SOS III  aNAL-light  aAmericans waste about a pound of food per day. Some of this is represented by inedible food waste at the household level. Our objective was to estimate inedible food waste in relation to diet quality and participant socio-economic status (SES). Seattle Obesity Study III participants (n = 747) completed the Fred Hutch Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and socio-demographic and food expenditure surveys. Education and geo-coded tax-parcel residential property values were measures of SES. Inedible food waste was calculated from diet records. Retail prices of FFQ component foods (n = 378) were used to estimate individual-level diet costs. The NOVA classification was used to identify ultra-processed foods. Multivariable linear regressions tested associations between inedible food waste, SES, food spending, Nutrient Rich Food (NRF₉.₃) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015) scores. Inedible food waste was estimated at 78.7 g/d, mostly from unprocessed vegetables (32.8 g), fruit (30.5 g) and meat, poultry, and fish (15.4 g). Greater inedible food waste was associated with higher HEI-2015 and NRF₉.₃ scores, higher food expenditures and lower percent energy from ultra-processed foods. In multivariable models, more inedible food waste was associated with higher food expenditures, education and residential property values. Higher consumption of unprocessed foods were associated with more inedible food waste and higher diet costs. Geo-located estimates of inedible food waste can provide a proxy index of neighborhood diet quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclassification 3aeducation 3aenergy 3afish 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood purchasing 3afood quality 3afood waste 3afruits 3ameat 3aobesity 3apoultry 3aresidential areas 3asocioeconomic status1 aRose, Chelsea  M.1 aBuszkiewicz, James 1 aOtten, Jennifer 1 aSpiker, Marie  L.1 aDrewnowski, Adam 0 tNutrients.g2021 Jan. 31, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130204793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245009100204300002000295520158100315592002801896650004401924650002701968650002601995650003102021650001502052650002902067650001302096650002302109650002202132650002802154650001402182650001802196650003802214650002002252650001902272650001102291650003302302650002202335650001402357650001302371650001802384650002502402650002302427650002102450650001802471700006202489700005902551700006402610700005702674773012402731856008202855852000902937655001202946IND60595200320221116210008.0200528e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059520032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-018-2445-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaut, PiyushW.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8292-684810aPolyurethane–polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine blends as potential urological biomaterials  ap. 11176-11193.  aBiomaterial-centred infections are major complications of implanted and indwelling medical devices like urological and venous catheters with significant economic consequences and increased patient morbidity. In the present study, polyurethane (PU) blends comprising the polymeric complex of polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine (PVPI) were developed. The developed PU/PVPI blends were extensively characterized for both surface and thermal properties using contact angle, ATR-FTIR, SEM-EDAX, TGA and DSC analyses. The suitability of the developed blends as urinary tract biomaterial was evaluated using bacterial adhesion (both qualitative and quantitative), protein adsorption and salt encrustation studies. The PU blends with PVPI exhibited reduced protein adsorption and excellent antimicrobial efficacy against the three clinically relevant bacteria, viz. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A progressive increase in the antiadhesive and antimicrobial efficacy was observed with the increase in PVPI concentration from 0.5 to 1.5% w/w in the PU/PVPI blends. The developed blends showed a strong resistance towards salt encrustation process as the deposition of the salts, namely struvite and hydroxyapatite, which usually forms the major components of urinary tract encrustation, was significantly reduced on PU/PVPI blends. Due to the combined antiadhesive, antimicrobial and encrustation-resistant properties, along with good stability these PU/PVPI blends can offer a promising strategy to reduce medical device-associated infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aadsorption 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3abacterial adhesion 3abiobased products 3abiocompatible materials 3acatheters 3acontact angle 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aeconomic impact 3ahydroxyapatite 3aiodine 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3amedical equipment 3amorbidity 3apatients 3apolyurethanes 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3aurinary tract1 aKhandwekar, AnandP.1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2377-44311 aRaut, Piyush W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8292-68481 aKhandwekar, Anand P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2377-44311 aSharma, Neeti1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4457-57170 tJournal of materials science.g2018 Aug., v. 53, no. 16 p.11176-11193dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-018-2445-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024003100122040001800153100002300171245018500194300001800379506007600397506003100473506002800504506005700532520102800589592002801617596000801645596000901653506003701662650001601699650000901715650001801724650001401742650001801756650001401774650001301788650001101801650001101812650002301823650003701846700002501883700001701908700002001925700002101945773012101966856007402087852000902161655001202170IND60759788720221215143053.0220901e20180421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075978872DNAL7 a10.1039/c8nj01223g2doi7 a10.1039/c8nj01223g2chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Md Tariqul,10aGreen synthesis of gold, silver, platinum, and palladium nanoparticles reduced and stabilized by sodium rhodizonate and their catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol and methyl orange  ap. 6472-6478.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aResource is Open Access  aRoyal Society of Chemistry (RSC) License Information  aSodium rhodizonate was used as a bifunctional reducing as well as stabilizing agent for the single step synthesis of gold (Au), silver (Ag), platinum (Pt), and palladium (Pd) nanoparticles (NPs) in water. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that Pt, Au, Ag, and PdNPs have average core diameters of about 2, 8, 26, and 39 nm, respectively. The ability of these nanoparticles towards the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and the dual-catalytic oxidation of formic acid followed by the reduction of methyl orange (MO) was studied. The apparent rate constants (kapp) of the catalytic reduction of 4-NP in the presence of Ag, Au, Pt, and PdNPs were calculated to be 2.1482, 1.1167, 1.088 × 10−1, and 1.65 × 10−2 min−1, respectively. However, for the dual-catalytic oxidation of formic acid followed by the reduction of MO, the kapp values were calculated to be 4.145, 1.25 × 10−2, 6.7 × 10−3, and 9.0 × 10−5 for the Pt, Pd, Au, and AgNPs, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSF  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aformic acid 3agold 3amethyl orange 3aoxidation 3ap-nitrophenol 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3asilver 3asodium 3asodium borohydride 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aSaenz-Arana, Ricardo1 aWang, Huiyao1 aBernal, Ricardo1 aNoveron, Juan C.0 tNew Journal of Chemistry.g2018 Apr. 21, v. 42, no. 8 p.6472-6478dRoyal Society of Chemistry (RSC)x1369-92617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8nj01223g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100002000170245007900190300001600269520122300285592002801508650001501536650002601551650002301577650001701600650000901617650003301626650001601659650001601675650001201691650003701703650004101740650001001781700001901791700001601810700001601826773008401842856008501926852000902011655001202020IND60113680620221120205107.0141112e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011368062DNAL7 a218213672pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2011.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbin, Douglas10aNear-infrared hyperspectral imaging for grading and classification of pork  ap. 259-268.  aIn this study, a hyperspectral imaging technique was developed to achieve fast, accurate, and objective determination of pork quality grades. Hyperspectral images were acquired in the near-infrared (NIR) range from 900 to 1700nm for 75 pork cuts of longissimus dorsi muscle from three quality grades (PSE, RFN and DFD). Spectral information was extracted from each sample and six significant wavelengths that explain most of the variation among pork classes were identified from 2nd derivative spectra. There were obvious reflectance differences among the three quality grades mainly at wavelengths 960, 1074, 1124, 1147, 1207 and 1341nm. Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out using these particular wavelengths and the results indicated that pork classes could be precisely discriminated with overall accuracy of 96%. Algorithm was developed to produce classification maps of the tested samples based on score images resulting from PCA and the results were compared with the ordinary classification method. Investigation of the misclassified samples was performed and showed that hyperspectral based classification can aid in class determination by showing spatial location of classes within the samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ahyperspectral imagery 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat quality 3apork 3aprincipal component analysis 3areflectance 3awavelengths 2aAnimals 2aMeatxclassificationxstandards. 2aSpectrophotometry, Infraredxmethods 2aSwine1 aElmasry, Gamal1 aSun, Da-Wen1 aAllen, Paul0 tMeat science.g2012 Jan., v. 90, no. 1 p.259-268dElsevier Ltdx0309-17407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2011.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009800167300002000265520164600285592002801931596010701959596003702066650001302103650001902116650001702135650001702152650001702169650001502186650001202201650002002213650001302233650001802246650000902264650001102273650001002284650001402294650001702308650001302325650001102338650001702349653001802366653003102384653001402415653001902429653002302448700002302471700002002494700002502514700006302539773014702602856008602749852000902835655001202844IND60788633720221118173326.0220815e20220802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078863372DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c034662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdibi, Azin10aHigh Barrier Sustainable Paper Coating Based on Engineered Polysaccharides and Natural Rubber  ap. 10718-10732.  aThe demand for paper-based packaging solutions as an alternative to incumbent single-use petroleum-based polymers for food packaging applications is ever-increasing. Paper-based packaging enables direct options for recycling and, in the case of inadvertent leakage, avoids the formation of microplastics through natural biodegradation. However, typical paper-based formats do not offer sufficient barrier performance which meets these sustainability objectives. Replacement of the plastic film with paper formats will reduce product shelf-stability and increase food wastage from farm to table. This work employed enzymatically polymerized microcrystalline glucan (MCG) as a functional additive in natural rubber (NR)-based coating formulations. Typically, NR coating formulations containing 0–50 wt % MCG were fabricated at a constant coating thickness with a constant solid content. The influence of the MCG on the wet and dry strength, rheology, adhesion strength, and barrier properties such as moisture, oxygen, and grease barrier of the formulated coatings was investigated. Also, further study on the effect of solid content and light crosslinking on the barrier properties was conducted. The optimized NR/MCG coating displayed promising mechanical properties as well as oxygen and oil barrier properties. Furthermore, light crosslinking of the NR/MCG coating enhances the barrier properties of the paper coating. Overall, the formulated NR/MCG paper coatings exhibited excellent wet strength in conjuncture with outstanding barrier properties, indicating their potential as a sustainable alternative in the food packaging industry.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canadadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038  aNAcIFF Inc.dhttps://doi.org/NA 3aadhesion 3abiodegradation 3acrosslinking 3adry strength 3afarm to fork 3afood waste 3aglucans 3agreen chemistry 3aindustry 3amicroplastics 3aoils 3aoxygen 3apaper 3apetroleum 3aplastic film 3arheology 3arubber 3awet strength 0apaper coating 0aengineered polysaccharides 0apackaging 0anatural rubber 0abarrier properties1 aValdesueiro, David1 aSimon, Leonardo1 aLenges, Christian P.1 aMekonnen, Tizazu H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9649-329X0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2022 Aug. 02, v. 10, no. 32 p.10718-10732dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c034663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01893naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013900166300001800305520075600323592002801079596010101107650001601208650001001224650001301234650002201247650001301269651001201282700002801294700002301322773013001345856008301475852000901558655001201567IND60739435820221120054233.0210731e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073943582DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-021-02415-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHung, Le Dinh10aKappa carrageenan from the red alga Kappaphycus striatus cultivated at Vanphong Bay, Vietnam: physicochemical properties and structure  ap. 1819-1824.  aThe red alga Kappaphycus striatus “sacol” brown strain is an economically important species and extensively cultivated at Vanphong Bay, Vietnam. To elucidate the carrageenan quality, the chemical profile of the alkali-modified carrageenan from this alga was investigated by FT-IR, ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectroscopies, and methods of analysis. The structural components of the polysaccharide mainly consisted of 3,6-anhydro-α-D-galactose and β-D-galactose-4-sulfate. FT-IR and ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra indicated that the polysaccharide was composed predominantly of kappa carrageenan with a small amount of iota carrageenan and 6-O-methylated carrageenan. The red alga K. striatus is good source of carrageenan for application in food or medicine.  aPublisher supplied data  a106-YS.06-2015.16cVietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) 3aKappaphycus 3aalgae 3aalgology 3akappa carrageenan 3amedicine 3aVietnam1 aNguyen, Hoang Thi Trang1 aTrang, Vo Thi Dieu0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2021 June, v. 33, no. 3 p.1819-1824dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-021-02415-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001400170245010400184300001600288520121400304592002801518650001901546650001501565650001001580650001201590650002101602650001401623650001901637650002001656650002001676650001001696650001901706650001201725650002901737650001001766650003001776651001201806700001801818773008401836856008501920852000902005655001202014IND60113680720221120205147.0141112e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011368072DNAL7 a217336352pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2011.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwaby, H.12aA note on the frequency of gastric ulcers detected during post-mortem examination at a pig abattoir  ap. 269-271.  aThere is growing interest in using findings from post-mortem meat inspection as indicators of on-farm and preslaughter animal welfare. This study considered whether oesophago-gastric ulcers might be a useful feature in pigs. The stomachs of 9827 finishing pigs from 60 farms were examined to provide an estimate of the frequency of oesophago-gastric ulcers in England. Stomachs were graded using a four-point scale ranging from normal, hyperkeratotic, eroded or ulcerated with or without stenosis. Over 79% of stomachs had either an oesophago-gastric ulcer or visible pre-ulcerative changes, including hyperkeratosis of the epithelium lining the pars oesophagea. The frequency of severe ulceration (Grade 3) was 6%, and mild ulcers (Grades 1 and 2) 73%. There was a significantly higher frequency of oesophago-gastric lesions in the groups of pigs that were held at the abattoir overnight, compared with those slaughtered on the day of arrival. This could have been due to the combined effect of overnight fasting plus stress in an unfamiliar environment. However, the exact fasting times of the animals were unknown and so it was not possible to provide a precise assessment of the effect of feed withdrawal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aepithelium 3afarms 3afasting 3afeed deprivation 3afinishing 3ahyperkeratosis 3ameat inspection 3aslaughterhouses 3aswine 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aStomach Ulcerxpathology 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxpathology 3aEngland1 aGregory, N.G.0 tMeat science.g2012 Jan., v. 90, no. 1 p.269-271dElsevier Ltdx0309-17407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2011.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024003100122040001800153100002100171245011100192300001800303506007600321506003100397520074400428592002801172596002501200596004701225596007801272506003701350650002401387650001501411650002301426650003401449650002201483650001801505650001401523650001201537650002501549650001601574650002101590700001401611700001401625700002501639700001801664700002001682700002401702700002401726773011301750856007401863852000901937655001201946IND60759789020221215143046.0220901e20180621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075978902DNAL7 a10.1039/c8sc01638k2doi7 a10.1039/c8sc01638k2chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHickey, David P.10aPyrene hydrogel for promoting direct bioelectrochemistry: ATP-independent electroenzymatic reduction of N2  ap. 5172-5177.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aEnzymatic bioelectrocatalysis often requires an artificial redox mediator to observe significant electron transfer rates. The use of such mediators can add a substantial overpotential and obfuscate the protein's native kinetics, which limits the voltage of a biofuel cell and alters the analytical performance of biosensors. Herein, we describe a material for facilitating direct electrochemical communication with redox proteins based on a novel pyrene-modified linear poly(ethyleneimine). This method was applied for promoting direct bioelectrocatalytic reduction of O2 by laccase and, by immobilizing the catalytic subunit of nitrogenase (MoFe protein), to demonstrate the ATP-independent direct electroenzymatic reduction of N2 to NH3.  aPublisher supplied data  cArmy Research Office  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  cSmall Business Innovative Research and Small Business Technology Transfer0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioelectrochemistry 3abiosensors 3acatalytic activity 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectron transfer 3aethyleneimine 3ahydrogels 3alaccase 3amicrobial fuel cells 3anitrogenase 3aprotein subunits1 aLim, Koun1 aCai, Rong1 aPatterson, Ashlea R.1 aYuan, Mengwei1 aSahin, Selmihan1 aAbdellaoui, Sofiene1 aMinteer, Shelley D.0 tChemical Science.g2018 June 21, v. 9, no. 23 p.5172-5177dRoyal Society of Chemistry (RSC)x2041-65207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8sc01638k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002100129024001900150040001800169100002000187245008800207300001200295506007600307520089400383592002801277506003701305650002901342650001501371650002501386650002001411650001001431650002601441650001101467700001801478773010401496856008101600852000901681655001201690IND60119499820221207113634.0141214e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011949982DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2004-5-12-r1002doi7 aPMC5457952pmcid7 a155759662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagwene, Paul M10aEstimating genomic coexpression networks using first-order conditional independence  ap. 904.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe describe a computationally efficient statistical framework for estimating networks of coexpressed genes. This framework exploits first-order conditional independence relationships among gene-expression measurements to estimate patterns of association. We use this approach to estimate a coexpression network from microarray gene-expression measurements from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate the biological utility of this approach by showing that a large number of metabolic pathways are coherently represented in the estimated network. We describe a complementary unsupervised graph search algorithm for discovering locally distinct subgraphs of a large weighted graph. We apply this algorithm to our coexpression network model and show that subgraphs found using this approach correspond to particular biological processes or contain representatives of distinct gene families.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalgorithms 3abiochemical pathways 3agene expression 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3amodels1 aKim, Junhyong0 tGenome biology.g2004 Dec., v. 5, no. 12 p.904-904dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2004-5-12-r1003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01889naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245008600209300001800295520080100313592002801114650001101142650002501153650001301178650001401191650001101205651001201216653001501228653001701243653002401260653002501284653002001309773011501329856008601444852000901530655001201539IND60564998820221117091142.0180831e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056499882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBranson, Robin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4132-118010aRe-constructing Kalundborg: the reality of bilateral symbiosis and other insights  ap. 4344-4352.  aA collection of commercial arrangements between various organisations at Kalundborg in Denmark is the archetypical example of an eco-industrial system. Features of industrial symbiosis derived from the example include close geographic proximity among organisations in a system and a ‘short mental distance’ between managers. On the basis of a temporal re-construction and detailed analysis of these arrangements, it is concluded that neither feature is necessarily a prerequisite for successful industrial symbiosis. Bilateral symbiosis is found to be the fundamental transaction with regard to physical transfers of materials and energy. The findings also provide insights on what constitutes waste, the notion of commercial viability and the dichotomy between physical and social symbiosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aindustrial symbiosis 3amanagers 3asymbiosis 3awastes 3aDenmark 0aKalundborg 0aRe-construct 0aBilateral symbiosis 0aCommercial proximity 0aMental distance0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 112 p.4344-4352dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009900162300002000261520115900281592002801440650001201468650001501480650002201495650002601517650001801543650001801561650002601579650002101605650001901626650001201645650001201657700002001669700001801689700001901707700002201726700002201748700002301770773012501793856007401918852000901992655001202001IND60641055620221121021745.0190505e20160902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064105562DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra16034d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran, Clara T. H.10aCovalent linker-free immobilization of conjugatable oligonucleotides on polypropylene surfaces  ap. 83328-83336.  aA novel plasma treatment method was used to activate a polymer surface for oligonucleotide immobilization. Polypropylene was treated with plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) to create radicals on its surface and in its subsurface. Treated polypropylene was shown to retain single stranded oligonucleotides after stringent washing whereas they were easily removed from the untreated surface. The attachment is proposed to occur through a covalent binding by reaction between radicals created in the treated surface and the side chains of oligonucleotide bases. The density of attachment depends on the type of nucleobase; for example, adenine was found to be superior to thymine. A demonstration of using 20-thymine and 20-adenine spacers in the capture sequences significantly improved the density of attachment and provided an orientation supporting hybridization with complementary DNA molecules compared to unmodified capture sequences. PIII treatment is a practical and effective method for immobilizing single stranded oligonucleotides on polymers, offering potential for use in DNA and RNA based diagnostic devices, biosensors and microarrays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenine 3abiosensors 3acomplementary DNA 3adiagnostic techniques 3afree radicals 3ahybridization 3amicroarray technology 3aoligonucleotides 3apolypropylenes 3athymine 3awashing1 aCraggs, Michael1 aSmith, Lee M.1 aStanley, Keith1 aKondyurin, A.

To test this hypothesis, L. mexicana mutants deficient in ICP were evaluated for their ability to develop in the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis. No significant differences were found between the wild-type parasites, two independently derived ICP-deficient mutants, or mutants overexpressing ICP; all lines developed similarly in the sand fly midgut and produced heavy late-stage infections. In addition, recombinant L. mexicana ICP did not inhibit peptidase activity of the midgut extracts in vitro. We conclude that ICP has no major role in promoting survival of L. mexicana in the vectorial part of its life cycle in L. longipalpis. 3aLeishmania mexicana 3aprocyclic forms 3acysteine proteinase inhibitors 3abiological development 3ainsect vectors 3aLutzomyia longipalpis 3amidgut 3acysteine proteinases 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3amutants 3arecombinant proteins 2aAnimals 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxphysiology 2aCysteine Proteinase Inhibitorsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aInsect Proteinsxphysiology 2aLeishmania mexicanaxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aProtozoan Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPsychodidaexenzymologyxparasitology.1 aSvarovska, Anna1 aBesteiro, Sebastien1 aMottram, Jeremy C.1 aCoombs, Graham H.1 aVolf, Petr0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2009 May, v. 46, no. 3 p.605-609dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/033.046.03273Available from publisher's Web site  a20090611b20090703c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/06/11  aOther US 7aarticle03171naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245005600175300001800231520176400249592002802013650001302041650001202054650002202066650002402088650001102112650001602123650001302139650002102152650001902173650002902192650001302221650001302234653001402247653002002261653003002281653001902311653001402330653002102344700001402365700006802379700001502447700001702462773011502479856008602594852000902680655001202689IND60564998920221117105130.0180831e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056499892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRedel-Macías, M.D.10aVirtual laboratory on biomass for energy generation  ap. 3842-3851.  aVirtual laboratories (VL) and interactive simulations are excellent approaches for training students to understand technical principles. This can be useful in many fields of science and engineering teaching. For this purpose, we have developed a virtual environment that can simulate real-laboratory operations, effectively enhancing the teaching process with an intuitive and appealing interface. Such software shows the virtual-studio practice characterization of basic biofuel-properties, simulating reality step-by-step. This virtual laboratory has been used by students of the postgraduate master subject on Biomass for Power Generation, belonging to the Master of Distributed Renewable Energy. The aim of this tool is to help students to study, learn and investigate on their own. The virtual lab is made of a web-based application to complement experimental laboratory training, allowing students to prepare their experimental practices before going to the lab, and to review them at any time afterwards. The computer application exhibits key virtual-lab educational features, like an integrative layout and self-evaluating tests. It allows a personalized and active learning-process, adaptability to teacher's aims and versatility and simplicity, using different multimedia resources. A satisfaction questionnaire was carried out between master degree students to evaluate the usefulness of the VL. Such a tool was positively evaluated, achieving a mean score of 6 out of 7 points. Additionally, the VL efficiency in the learning process showed a final examination main score of 8 out of 10 points. Last but not least, most students considered that the VL promoted learning and personal effort, being an excellent preparatory tool to real experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3abiomass 3acomputer software 3acomputer techniques 3aenergy 3aengineering 3alearning 3apower generation 3aquestionnaires 3arenewable energy sources 3astudents 3ateachers 0aBiodiesel 0aRemote learning 0aNew teaching technologies 0aVirtualization 0aComputing 0aRenewable energy1 aPinzi, S.1 aMartínez-Jiménez, M.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8680-52501 aDorado, G.1 aDorado, M.P.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 112 p.3842-3851dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001900170245015300189300001400342520097500356592002801331650001201359650001001371650002901381650000901410650001801419650001701437650001101454650001201465650001601477650002201493650002301515650000901538650002101547650001001568650002301578650002101601650001601622650001301638650001801651650002701669650002601696650004701722650001201769650001101781650002101792650004001813650004001853650000901893650003101902650002201933650004001955700002001995700001702015700001702032700001502049700002202064700001802086773008202104856008502186852000902271655001202280IND60113680920221120205137.0141112e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011368092DNAL7 a216801032pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2011.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, E.A.10aQuality traits and lipid composition of meat from Nellore young bulls fed with different oils either protected or unprotected from rumen degradation  ap. 28-35.  aThe qualitative characteristics, lipids and chemical composition of the meat of 35 Nellore young bulls were analyzed.

Significant differences were found only in the meat's water holding capacity (WHC), which was higher for animals fed with fresh linseed oil. More conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) was found in the meat of animals fed with unprotected soybean oil, while better omega-6/omega-3 ratios were noted for those fed unprotected linseed oil. The addition of different vegetable oils to the bulls' diet (soybean or linseed, either protected or not protected from rumen digestion) did not interfere with the qualitative characteristics of their meat while improving the lipid composition of the longissimus muscle. Of the oils examined, unprotected linseed oil most improved the omega-6/omega-3 ratio, thus producing the healthiest meat for human consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNellore 3abulls 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adiet 3afat thickness 3afood animals 3ahumans 3alinseed 3alinseed oil 3alipid composition 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat 3ameat composition 3arumen 3arumen fermentation 3aslaughter weight 3asoybean oil 3asoybeans 3avegetable oil 3awater holding capacity 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturatedxanalysis 2aLinseed Oilxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMeatxanalysisxstandards. 2aRumenxphysiology 2aSoybean Oilxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aSampaio, A.A.M.1 aHenrique, W.1 aPivaro, T.M.1 aRosa, B.L.1 aFernandes, A.R.M.1 aAndrade, A.T.0 tMeat science.g2012 Jan., v. 90, no. 1 p.28-35dElsevier Ltdx0309-17407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2011.05.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009600172300001800268520083200286592002801118650001601146650003201162650002401194650001301218650002701231653001101258653000901269653000901278653000901287653001001296653000901306653000901315653000901324653000801333653001001341653000801351653000801359653001001367653000701377653000801384653002901392653003401421653003201455653002301487700001801510700002701528700002201555700001901577773011001596856008601706852000901792655001201801IND60539320120221117224606.0190215e20150708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053932012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2015.04.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuast, Robert B.10aCotranslational incorporation of non-standard amino acids using cell-free protein synthesis  ap. 1703-1712.  aOver the last years protein engineering using non-standard amino acids has gained increasing attention.

This study identified critical stress periods influencing the productivity of no-till winter wheat produced on the Canadian prairies. Grain yield, grain protein, aerial dry matter, harvest index, and individual yield components were related to weather and soil water factors at 11 field locations between 1984 and 1986. Soil types included Typic Haploborolls, Udic Haploborolls, and Vertic Haploborolls. Pan evaporation, precipitation, and growing degree-days were totalized for six 15-d periods corresponding with Zadok growth scale stages 21 to 32, 32 to 46, 46 to 65, 65 to 74, 74 to 83, and 83 to 91, respectively. Extractable soil water to 1.3 m was measured at the stem elongation (stage 31), anthesis (stage 65), and soft dough (stage 85) development stages. Environmental stress between stages 21 and 65 most influenced grain yield, aerial dry matter production, harvest index, grain protein yield, spikes per square meter, kernels per spike, and kernels per square meter. Kernel weight was most dependent on prevailing conditions after anthesis. Grain protein concentration was influenced by environmental stresses both before and after anthesis. Evaporation, followed by root zone extractable soil water and precipitation, had the largest influence on crop performance of all the environmental-water parameters considered.

These microcrystals were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. XRD patterns proved that these crystals are monophasic and present a wolframite-type monoclinic structure. FE-SEM images revealed that the surfactants modified the crystal shapes, suggesting the occurrence of distinct crystal growth processes. The CTAB cationic surfactant promotes the hindrance of small nuclei that leads to the formation of rectangle-like crystals, SDS anionic surfactant induces a growth of irregular hexagons with several porous due to considerable size effect of counter-ions on the crystal facets, PVP-K40 non-ionic surfactant allows a reduction in size and thickness of plate-like crystals, while without surfactants have the formation of irregular plate-like crystals. Finally, the PL properties of β-ZnMoO₄ microcrystals were explained by means of different shape/size, surface defects and order-disorder into lattice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanionic surfactants 3acationic surfactants 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3acolloids 3acrystals 3amolybdates 3anonionic surfactants 3aphotoluminescence 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3azinc1 aSczancoski, J.C.1 aSiu Li, M.1 aLongo, E.1 aVarela, J.A.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2012 Feb. 20, v. 396 p.346-351dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2011.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02329naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015000163300002000313520131900333592002801652596004101680650001101721650001101732650001601743700001401759700001701773700002201790773012401812856008201936852000902018655001202027IND60595201120221116205657.0200528e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059520112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-018-2381-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalloom, R.10aFirst principles calculations on the effect of interstitial oxygen on phase stability and β–α″ martensitic transformation in Ti–Nb alloys  ap. 11473-11487.  aThe effect of oxygen on phase stability and β–α″ martensitic transformation in Ti–Nb alloys has been studied using first principles calculations. Three stable atomic configurations of Ti–Nb (Ti-12.5, 16.6, and 25 at.% Nb) systems, which can transform from β-phase to α″-phase without changing the local atomic position of Nb atoms, were first identified using the cluster expansion method. Phonon calculations indicated that these structures were stable. Next, the martensitic transformation behavior of Ti–Nb–O system was studied using these structures. We observed a significant lattice distortion around oxygen atoms occupying octahedral interstitial sites that resembles a bcc type of stacking. Our results conclusively revealed that while the oxygen interstitials can oppose the atomic shuffle required for martensitic transformation, they can also cooperatively stabilize the β-phase even at 1 at.% oxygen concentrations by inducing local elastic shear strains. Interestingly, the canceling of these fields can stabilize the β-phase by suppressing the β to α″ transformation which decreases the martensitic start temperature (Mₛ). Our study revealed that the reduction in Mₛ is higher at lower Nb concentration. The stabilization of β-phase increases with oxygen concentration.  aPublisher supplied data  a1435611cNational Science Foundation 3aalloys 3aoxygen 3atemperature1 aReith, D.1 aBanerjee, R.1 aSrinivasan, S.

We compared effects of the relatively new herbicides fluazifop [(±)-butyl-2-(4-{[5-(trifuoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]oxy}phenoxy)propanoate], haloxyfop [methyl-2-(4-{[3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]oxy}phenoxy)propanoate], and sethoxydim {2-[l-(ethoxyimino)butyl]-5-2[2-(ethylthio)propyl]-3-hydroxy-2-cyclohexen-l-one} applied at various rates to oat (Avena sativa L.) at the 5- to 6-cm stage on transpiration, soil water use, and plant development. In controlled environments, transpiration rates in oat declined about 6 d after herbicide treatment. Time for and the degree of transpiration reduction were herbicide and herbicide-rate dependent, as were the reductions in plant weight and leaf number. First reductions in soil moisture under laboratory conditions were found 10 d after treatment of oat with fluazifop and haloxyfop and 12 d after treatment with sethoxydim. Similarly, in the field fluazifop treatment required 9 d and haloxyfop and sethoxydim 11 d before significant differences in soil moisture occurred. The correlation coefficient of soil matric potential and dry weight of oat in the field was −0.89 and −0.90, respectively, for 2 yr, 1984 and 1985. Reduction of oat dry matter and soil water use in the field was also herbicide rate dependent. Cooperative research between the Cornell Univ. Agric. Exp. Stn. and the USDA-ARS.

However, much of the complexity of host-microbiota interaction remains to be elucidated both at cellular and molecular levels. Siderophores are chemically diverse, ferric-specific chelators synthesized and secreted by microbes to secure their iron acquisition. The host defense peptide LL-37 is ubiquitously produced at epithelial surfaces modulating microbial communities and suppressing pathogenic strains. The present work demonstrates that LL-37 binds tightly siderocalin-resistant stealth siderophores which are important contributors to the virulence of several pathogens. As indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopic experiments, addition of aerobactin and rhizoferrin increases the membrane active α-helical conformation of the partially folded peptide. The cationic nature of LL-37 (+6 net charge at pH 7.4) and the multiple carboxylate groups present in siderophores refer to the dominant contribution of electrostatic interactions in the stabilization of peptide-chelator adducts. It is proposed that aside siderocalin proteins, LL-37 may be a complementary, less specific component of the siderophore scavenging repertoire of the innate immune system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aepithelium 3ahumans 3ainnate immunity 3amicroorganisms 3apH 3apeptides 3aresearch 3asiderophores 3avirulence 0aAerobactin 0aCircular dichroism 0aLL-37 0aRhizoferrin 0aSiderophore 0aCD1 aBeke-Somfai, Tamás0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 June 04, v. 526, no. 3 p.780-785dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.1623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010500155300002000260520149400280592002801774650002401802650001101826650001401837650002301851650002201874650001901896650001201915650001101927650001801938650001801956650001401974700001801988700001602006700001602022700001602038700001602054773012402070856007402194852000902268655001202277IND60641056120221121010103.0190505e20160819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064105612DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra16045j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Feng10aTuning the performance of Pt–Ni alloy/reduced graphene oxide catalysts for 4-nitrophenol reduction  ap. 79028-79036.  aAn environmentally benign and economic reaction system with an effective catalyst for 4-nitrophenol reduction is highly desirable. Here, we synthesized reduced graphene oxide (RGO) supported Pt–Ni alloy catalysts with different atomic ratios of Pt and Ni, investigated their morphology, size, dispersity, structure and elemental valence, and studied their catalytic activity in order to tune their performance for 4-nitrophenol reduction. It is worth pointing out that the RGO support can efficiently avoid the aggregation of Pt–Ni alloy nanoparticles, and the most dispersed and smallest Pt–Ni particles on RGO can be obtained when the atomic ratio of Pt to Ni is 1 : 9. The Pt–Ni/RGO (1 : 9) nanocatalyst also shows a higher catalytic activity toward the conversion of 4-NP to 4-AP with a catalytic rate constant of 0.3700 min⁻¹ than Pt–Ni/RGO (1 : 3) and Pt–Ni/RGO (1 : 25), and much higher than that of Pt/RGO, Ni/RGO and bare Pt–Ni owing to the well-defined composition, small particle size (10 nm), good dispersion, synergistic effect between Pt and Ni, and electron transfer between RGO and Pt–Ni alloy nanoparticles. In addition, the catalyst possesses good stability and recyclability for the catalytic reduction reaction. The Pt–Ni/RGO nanocatalyst, with well-defined composition, small particle size, uniform dispersity, high catalytic rate, and recyclability, should be an ideal catalyst for specific applications in liquid phase reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloy nanoparticles 3aalloys 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene oxide 3aliquids 3anickel 3ap-nitrophenol 3aparticle size 3asynergism1 aKong, Weixiao1 aHu, Zonggao1 aLiu, Jindun1 aZhao, Yafei1 aZhang, Bing0 tRSC advances.g2016 Aug. 19, v. 6, no. 82 p.79028-79036dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra16045j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013100159300002000290520124600310592002801556650002501584650001401609650001501623650002201638650003301660650001701693650003701710700001601747700002001763700002001783700002001803700001801823773012501841856007401966852000902040655001202049IND60641056220221121010236.0190505e20160907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064105622DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra16047f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHung, Wei-Song10aNon-destructive means of probing a composite polyamide membrane for characteristic free volume, void, and chemical composition  ap. 85019-85025.  aPositron annihilation spectroscopy measures free volume in membranes at the sub-nanometer scale (0.1–1 nm). In this study, we used positron annihilation age–momentum correlation (AMOC) spectroscopy coupled to a variable mono-energy slow positron beam; our objectives were to measure not only free volume but also voids that are bigger than 1 nm and to estimate the chemical composition of a composite polyamide membrane. To crosscheck these data, we also used conventional techniques: scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and quantum chemical calculations (QCC). AMOC showed that the free volume diameters and intensities in a polyamide layer were in the range of 0.42–0.68 nm and 9–3%, respectively, and that the void diameters and intensities were 7.2–14.1 nm and 12–18%, respectively, with the size distribution of the voids ranging from 5 to 20 nm. These results were consistent with those from TEM, indicating that the polyamide layer structure consisted of discrete voids distributed throughout a continuously dense phase. QCC validated the S parameter data taken from AMOC, which showed that a highly electronegative environment in the polyamide layer could inhibit the formation of positronium.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3aelectrons 3apolyamides 3aquantum mechanics 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectroscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aAn, Quan-Fu1 aHu, Chien-Chieh1 aLee, Kueir-Rarn1 aJean, Yan-Ching1 aLai, Juin-Yih0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 07, v. 6, no. 88 p.85019-85025dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra16047f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012100168300001800289520122100307592002801528650001201556650001501568650002201583650002201605650001601627650001201643650001901655650002901674650001401703650001301717650000701730650001501737650001401752650001801766650001701784650001701801650001601818653002501834653001801859653001701877653001201894653003101906653002701937653000801964653000701972653001301979653000801992653000802000653000802008653003802016653002702054653000902081653001102090700001802101773011502119856008602234852000902320655001202329IND60564999520221117091901.0180831e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056499952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jishi10aSustainable mechanisms of biochar derived from brewers' spent grain and sewage sludge for ammonia–nitrogen capture  ap. 3927-3934.  aThe limitations of the existing means of treating brewers' spent grain and sewage sludge highlight the need to find sustainable routes to manage them. Biochars derived from their mixtures enriching with magnesium and phosphorus, through pyrolysis at 400–700 °C, were characterized, and their potential use as a capture agent for ammonia-nitrogen removal in aqueous solutions was also analyzed. The yield increased with rising brewers' spent grain ratio, but decreased with increasing temperature. Higher pyrolysis temperature caused higher ash content, pH, surface basicity, specific surface area, and mineral element concentrations, whereas lower surface acidity, cation exchange capacity and nitrogen contents. Biochars derived from the mixtures of brewers' spent grain and sewage sludge (80:20, wt%) gained the highest removal efficiencies of ammonia-nitrogen, owing to their high surface area, magnesium and phosphorus availability, suitable surface chemistry and morphology. Compared with other biochars for ammonia-nitrogen adsorption, the biocahrs had high removal efficiencies (above 60%), which also had the potential to sustainably contribute to carbon dioxide emission reduction and nitrogen recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aadsorption 3aammonium nitrogen 3aaqueous solutions 3aash content 3abiochar 3acarbon dioxide 3acation exchange capacity 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apyrolysis 3asewage sludge 3aspent grains 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aBrewers' spent grain 0aSewage sludge 0aCo-pyrolysis 0aBiochar 0aAmmonia–nitrogen capture 0aSustainable mechanisms 0aBSG 0aSS 0aNH4+–N 0aMAP 0aSSA 0aCEC 0aBSC400, BSC500, BSC600 and BSC700 0aTC500, TC600 and TC700 0aCSAC 0aHSC3001 aWang, Qinqing0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 112 p.3927-3934dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006700168300001800235520099800253592002801251650001901279650001101298650001901309650001901328650001501347650001401362650002601376650002201402653003001424653001301454653002701467653001801494653001901512653001101531700001901542773011501561856008601676852000901762655001201771IND60564999620221117091818.0180831e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056499962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCadez, Simon10aClimate change mitigation strategies in carbon-intensive firms  ap. 4132-4143.  aThis study explores corporate strategies to mitigate climate change of large CO2 polluters. Unlike most prior studies in the area, which have attempted to identify configurations of firms pursuing similar strategies, this study appraises the relationships between nineteen carbon reduction practices and their underlying strategies. The findings are based on a sample of 158 carbon-intensive firms from three EU countries. Five main strategies in carbon-intensive firms are identified. The only relatively widely deployed strategy is emissions trading. The remaining strategies, including process emissions reduction, combustion emissions reduction, external measures, and lowering product output are not deployed extensively. Complementarity between the identified strategies is low – firms focus on a single climate change mitigation strategy rather than deploying several simultaneously.Climate policy stringency appears to have a positive effect on corporate efforts to reduce emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acombustion 3aemissions 3aenvironmental markets 3aissues and policy 0aClimate change mitigation 0aStrategy 0aCarbon-intensive firms 0aCO2 emissions 0aSustainability 0aEU ETS1 aCzerny, Albert0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 112 p.4132-4143dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002400192245012100216300001800337500001500355506007600370520121900446592002801665506003701693650002201730650003001752650001801782650001301800650002701813650001501840650000901855650002701864650001701891650002001908650001901928650003101947650002101978650002701999650001302026650001002039653001502049653001902064653000702083653002002090653001702110653000802127653002302135653000802158700002202166700002102188700001602209700001802225700002002243700001902263773009902282856008602381852000902467655001202476IND60535054220221207140330.0190319e20150408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053505422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.02.0412doi7 aPMC43770972pmcid7 a257483362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArnold, Isabelle C.10aHelicobacter hepaticus infection in BALB/c mice abolishes subunit-vaccine-induced protection against M. tuberculosis  ap. 1808-1814.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBCG, the only licensed vaccine against tuberculosis (TB), provides geographically variable protection, an effect ascribed to exposure to environmental mycobacteria (EM). Here we show that altering the intestinal microbiota of mice by early-life infection with the commensal bacterium Helicobacter hepaticus (Hh) increases their susceptibility to challenge with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Furthermore Hh-infected mice immunised parenterally with the recombinant subunit vaccine, human adenovirus type 5 expressing the immunodominant antigen 85A of Mtb (Ad85A), display a reduced lung immune response and protection against Mtb challenge is also reduced. Expression of interleukin 10 (IL10) messenger RNA is increased in the colon of Hh infected mice. Treatment of Hh-infected Ad85A-immunised mice with anti-IL10 receptor antibody, following challenge with Mtb, restores the protective effect of the vaccine. These data show for the first time that alteration of the intestinal microbiota by addition of a single commensal organism can profoundly influence protection induced by a TB subunit vaccine via an IL10-dependent mechanism, a result with implications for the deployment of such vaccines in the field.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aprotective effect 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amessenger RNA 3aantigens 3aHelicobacter hepaticus 3aantibodies 3amice 3aHuman mastadenovirus C 3atuberculosis 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-10 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3asubunit vaccines 3aenvironmental exposure 3abacteria 3acolon 0aMicrobiota 0aInterleukin 10 0aHh 0aSubunit vaccine 0aTuberculosis 0aCFU 0aHuman adenovirus C 0aMtb1 aHutchings, Claire1 aKondova, Ivanela1 aHey, Ariann1 aPowrie, Fiona1 aBeverley, Peter1 aTchilian, Elma0 tVaccine.g2015 Apr. 08, v. 33, no. 15 p.1808-1814dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.02.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03390naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024003100122040001800153100001900171245009200190300001600282506007600298506003100374506002800405506005700433520129100490592002801781596003201809596004501841596004701886596004901933596005601982596000902038596007802047506003702125650002602162650002002188650001302208650001302221650002402234650002002258650001202278650001502290650001502305650001702320650001302337650001102350700002002361700001602381700001302397700001202410700001302422700001502435700002002450700001502470700001502485700001802500700001802518773012102536856007402657852000902731655001202740IND60759789920221215143100.0220901e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075978992DNAL7 a10.1039/c9en00716d2doi7 a10.1039/c9en00716d2chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xuejiao10aResponse of soil enzyme activity and bacterial community to black phosphorus nanosheets  ap. 404-413.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aResource is Open Access  aRoyal Society of Chemistry (RSC) License Information  aCurrently, black phosphorus (BP) is widely applied in a variety of fields. Concerning the potential toxicity of BP nanosheets towards mammalian cells and bacteria, there is a great need to evaluate their ecological effects. This study was focused on the effect of BP nanosheets on enzyme activity, bacterial community structure, and bacterial function of black soil and burozem. We found BP nanosheets had no significant impact on enzyme activities in black soil during the 60 day exposure. In contrast, the activities of urease and catalase in burozem were significantly inhibited at day 10 and day 30, respectively, which were gradually recovered at day 60. The introduction of BP nanosheets significantly decreased the community richness in burozem at day 10, but had no effect either on the diversity or the richness in black soil. The discrepancies were attributed to the stronger interaction of BP nanosheets with organic matter-rich black soil, leading to a lowered bioavailability of BP nanosheets. Nevertheless, BP nanosheets were predicted to have negligible effect on bacterial function in both soils. It is worthwhile to further investigate the in-depth mechanisms and dose-dependent effect in order to lay the foundation for safe application and discharge of BP nanosheets.  aPublisher supplied data  cChinese Academy of Sciences  cNational Basic Research Program of China  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cNatural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province  cUSDA  cYouth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacterial communities 3abioavailability 3aburozems 3acatalase 3acommunity structure 3aenzyme activity 3amammals 3ananosheets 3aphosphorus 3asoil enzymes 3atoxicity 3aurease1 aXiong, Zhiqiang1 aZhang, Siyu1 aGe, Yuan1 aMa, Wei1 aYan, Lei1 aLi, Dengyu1 aWang, Dongsheng1 aDeng, Shuo1 aZhao, Qing1 aWang, Weidong1 aXing, Baoshan0 tEnvironmental Science: Nano.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 7, no. 2 p.404-413dRoyal Society of Chemistry (RSC)x2051-81537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9en00716d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03988naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006700147245008500214300001400299520241300313592002802726650001802754650001302772650001002785650001502795650001902810650000902829650002802838650001002866650001202876650001202888650001302900650001302913650001702926650001602943650001902959650001002978650001502988650001403003650001703017650002203034650001103056650001403067650002203081650002703103650001503130650001403145651001203159700001903171700001803190773012303208856008203331852000903413655001203422IND60595201620221116205738.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059520162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10933-018-0023-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendieta, KalindhiLarios1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4308-618810aFlorida wildfires during the Holocene Climatic Optimum (9000–5000 cal yr BP)  ap. 51-66.  aFire is a key ecological driver in terrestrial ecosystems of the southeastern United States. The combination of plant species composition and fire poses the possibility of positive feedback loops in a landscape. How fire regimes will change in the future with global warming is uncertain. To better understand the main factors that control fire, Holocene fire history was studied using macroscopic charcoal (as a fire proxy) in sediment cores from two shallow lakes in north Florida, USA. Following the onset of lacustrine sedimentation in the early Holocene, there was a 95% decline in average charcoal concentration, from 28.3 to 1.4 charcoal particles cm⁻³, at ~ 7500 cal yr BP in a 3.9-m core from Newnans Lake (basal age: 8870 cal yr BP). At ~ 7000 cal yr BP in a 5.4-m core from nearby Lochloosa Lake (basal age: 9280 cal yr BP), particle density declined by 99%, from 113.8 to 1.4 charcoal particles cm⁻³. These declines in charcoal concentration are not artifacts of changes in bulk sedimentation, i.e. dilution, but instead reflect lower charcoal production. Newnans Lake and Lochloosa Lake averaged ~ 8.93 and ~ 40.42 charcoal particles cm⁻³, respectively over their entire records. Pollen records from the two study lakes do not display the Quercus to Pinus shift during the Holocene Climatic Optimum (9000–5000 cal yr BP) observed previously in cores from many studied lakes in the region. Instead, pine pollen, as a percentage of total oak and pine pollen, was high (> 50%) through the entire Holocene. Pine and oak pollen counts and the variety of arboreal pollen, however, were lower in early Holocene deposits. No relation was found between pine and oak percentages and macroscopic charcoal quantity, i.e. before, during, or after charcoal peaks. There were, however, qualitative differences between pollen assemblages within charcoal-rich and charcoal-poor depth intervals. Early to middle Holocene sediments contained pollen of Quercus spp., Pinus spp., Ambrosia sp., Amaranthaceae, Cyperaceae and Poaceae. Late Holocene sediments contained hydric and mesic pollen types including Taxodium spp., Carya sp., Ilex sp., and Liquidambar styraciflua. The flat, poorly drained topography around both lakes played a role in shaping Holocene plant communities and probably explains why a Quercus-to-Pinus shift seen elsewhere in Florida did not occur in the study region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthaceae 3aAmbrosia 3aCarya 3aCyperaceae 3aHolocene epoch 3aIlex 3aLiquidambar styraciflua 3aPinus 3aPoaceae 3aQuercus 3aTaxodium 3acharcoal 3afire history 3afire regime 3aglobal warming 3alakes 3alandscapes 3alimnology 3apaleontology 3aplant communities 3apollen 3asediments 3aspecies diversity 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atopography 3awildfires 3aFlorida1 aGerber, Stefan1 aBrenner, Mark0 tJournal of paleolimnology.g2018 June, v. 60, no. 1 p.51-66dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000474x0921-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-018-0023-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002100160245007400181300001600255500000900271520132300280592002801603650002201631650001401653650002801667650001201695650001001707650001101717700002001728700002001748773012201768852000901890856009701899655001201996IND9002969220221120230104.0191122e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900296922DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1990.00021962008200020003x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez, J.

Therefore, a project was initiated to measure dry matter accumulation and N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu uptakes in whole plants, stalks, leaves and heads of proso millet during the growing season. The two cultivars, Cope and Dawn, were field grown on an Aridic Argiustoll that had optimum nutrient and water availability. Plant samples were collected at weekly intervals starting 30 d after planting, and continuing throughout the growing season. Nutrient concentrations, dry matter accumulation, and mineral uptakes were very similar for both varieties. Whole plant concentrations of most nutrients decreased from emergence to maturity, except for Ca, Mg, and Mn which increase with time. From anthesis to maturity, dry matter accumulated rapidly at a rate of 0.5 Mg/ha/d, tripling during this period. Heads at maturity accounted for 55% of the total plant dry matter, which is higher than for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). Proso millet accumulated N and P during heading like grain sorghum, which is more efficient than corn (Zea mays L.). Dry matter accumulation and nutrient uptake patterns are illustrated during the life cycle of this plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum miliaceum 3acultivars 3adry matter accumulation 3aheading 3astems 3aleaves1 aWestfall, D.

To overcome the limitation of metallic electrodes depletion, the application of non-sacrificial electrode was investigated for the electrochemical harvesting (ECH) of microalgae. The effect of applied current, addition of electrolyte and initial pH were parameters investigated. The highest recovery efficiency of 83% was obtained for Scenedesmus obliquus at 1.5A, initial pH 9 and 6gL−1 NaCl with power consumption of 3.84kWhkg−1. Recovery efficiency of ECH process was comparable to literature reported centrifugation, filtration and chemical flocculation techniques but with a much lower power consumption. The ECH process with addition of electrolyte enhanced the lipid extraction by 22% without any adverse effects. The ECH process with non sacrificial carbon electrodes could be a possible harvesting step at commercial scale microalgal biomass production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScenedesmus obliquus 3aadverse effects 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3acentrifugation 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy use and consumption 3afiltration 3aflocculation 3afuel production 3aharvesting 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3apH 3asodium chloride 0aMicroalgae 0aNon-sacrificial carbon electrode 0aBiodiesel 0aElectrochemical harvesting 0aLipid1 aGuldhe, Abhishek1 aSingh, Poonam1 aRawat, Ismail1 aStenström, Thor Axel1 aBux, F.q(Faizel),0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Jan., v. 176 p.1-7dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245012500203500002000328520108700348592002801435650001201463650002501475650002101500650001101521650001801532650001101550650002401561650001301585650000901598650001201607650001001619650002301629700006401652773013101716856007701847852000901924655001201933IND60779019020221117211008.0220603e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077901902DNAL7 a10.1029/2021WR0313572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoudi, Sébastien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8013-785310aInformation, Experience, and Willingness to Mitigate Mental Health Consequences From Flooding Through Collective Defence  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDemand for reducing mental health impacts from flooding through collective flood defence is elicited using a contingent valuation method with a sequential hypothetical scenario, which accounts for human resilience and experience. A two‐step model fits the survey data: it combines a binary sample selection rule to distinguish protesters and participants with a Tobit model to accommodate true zero responses among participants. Results show that non‐symptoms‐specific information on mental health risk may bias the willingness to pay downward. Risk‐averse individuals who have taken self‐insurance protection measures are willing to pay for additional protection through collective defence. Feelings, such as worries and anxiety related to flooding, drive the demand, which supports the risk‐as‐feelings hypothesis for mental health protection from flooding. Inexperience rather than experience of flooding is found to increase demand, which indicates that individual mental resilience to flooding may increase after an event as posited by the inoculation hypothesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3acontingent valuation 3ahealth promotion 3ahumans 3amental health 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3arisk 3asurveys 3awater 3awillingness to pay1 aOsés‐Eraso, Nuria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2669-46910 tWater resources research.g2022 Apr., v. 58, no. 4 p.e2021WR031357-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021WR0313573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001800182245010300200300001200303506007600315520169500391592002802086506003702114650001602151650000802167650001402175650002002189650002202209650005202231650001502283650001402298700002202312700001902334700002002353773008702373856004402460852000902504655001202513IND4463080220221207100931.0120907e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446308022DNAL7 a213961252pmid7 aPMC30699522pmcid7 a10.1186/1746-4811-7-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBox, Mathew S10aProtocol: A simple phenol-based method for 96-well extraction of high quality RNA from Arabidopsis  ap. 130.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Many experiments in modern plant molecular biology require the processing of large numbers of samples for a variety of applications from mutant screens to the analysis of natural variants. A severe bottleneck to many such analyses is the acquisition of good yields of high quality RNA suitable for use in sensitive downstream applications such as real time quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real time qRT-PCR). Although several commercial kits are available for high-throughput RNA extraction in 96-well format, only one non-kit method has been described in the literature using the commercial reagent TRIZOL. RESULTS: We describe an unusual phenomenon when using TRIZOL reagent with young Arabidopsis seedlings. This prompted us to develop a high-throughput RNA extraction protocol (HTP96) adapted from a well established phenol:chloroform-LiCl method (P:C-L) that is cheap, reliable and requires no specialist equipment. With this protocol 192 high quality RNA samples can be prepared in 96-well format in three hours (less than 1 minute per sample) with less than 1% loss of samples. We demonstrate that the RNA derived from this protocol is of high quality and suitable for use in real time qRT-PCR assays. CONCLUSION: The development of the HTP96 protocol has vastly increased our sample throughput, allowing us to fully exploit the large sample capacity of modern real time qRT-PCR thermocyclers, now commonplace in many labs, and develop an effective high-throughput gene expression platform. We propose that the HTP96 protocol will significantly benefit any plant scientist with the task of obtaining hundreds of high quality RNA extractions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aRNA 3aequipment 3agene expression 3amolecular biology 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ascientists 3aseedlings1 aCoustham, Vincent1 aDean, Caroline1 aMylne, Joshua S0 tPlant methods.g2011 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.130-130dSpringer-Verlagx1746-48117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-4811-7-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001700160245007600177300001600253500000900269500001500278520187700293592002802170650002002198650001102218650002302229650001402252650001102266650002302277650001602300650001202316650001302328653002602341700002902367700001802396773012202414852000902536856009702545655001202642IND9002969320221120230019.0191122e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900296932DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1990.00021962008200020004x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, V.

Such luxuriant growth causes several production problems. A plant growth regulator, mepiquat chloride¹ (1,1-dimethylpiperidinium chloride; BASF Wyandotte Corp., Parsippany, NJ) has been found to reduce vegetative growth, but the crop responses to it appears to be temperature sensitive. An experiment was conducted to determine the crop responses to temperature in naturally lighted, temerature- and CO₂-controlled plant growth chambers. The experiment was conducted at five temperatures and measurements were made of several plant parameters. A preliminary experiment showed that mepiquat chloride (MC) caused a dramatic reduction in plant height and number of main-stem nodes. A more detailed study showed that the impact of MC on main-stem elongation was temperature dependent, with the greatest effect occurring at 35/25 °C day/night temperatures. The application of MC also caused a reduction in mainstem, vegetative-branch and fruiting-branch node formation. Leaf area was reduced on plants treated with MC at each of the temperatures. Specific leaf area (m² kg⁻¹) was also reduced on leaves from various positions on the plants. It appears that MC affects more than one physiological process. The primary effects were reduction in stem elongation, node formation, and leaf expansion. The reduced stem growth and leaf area development also caused greater leaf densities—probably a secondary or tertiary effect. Contribution from Dep. Agric.

This is especially so among obstetrician/gynecologists (Ob/Gyns) – the specialty many women use as their primary care provider. We sought to understand the acceptability of using standing orders for HPV vaccination among a sample of women attending outpatient Ob/Gyn clinics.From February to April 2014, an on-line survey was administered to a convenience sample of 400 women aged 15–26 recruited from 9 Ob/Gyn practices in Colorado. The survey identified attitudes about standing orders for HPV vaccination, demographics and prior experience with HPV vaccines.The response rate was 44%. Receipt of prior HPV vaccine doses was reported by 67% of respondents. Approximately half (53%) were comfortable with the idea of standing orders for HPV vaccination at Ob/Gyn clinics among women generally, but only 40% of the 154 women not initially opposed to HPV vaccination indicated they would personally feel comfortable receiving HPV vaccines offered under a standing order policy. General and personal acceptance of standing orders for HPV vaccination was significantly higher among women who reported receiving HPV vaccine doses previously, but not by any demographic or experiential variables. Acceptability of standing orders for HPV vaccines was higher for series completion than initiation (88% vs. 70%, p<0.001) and was more commonly supported for adult patients (79%) than for adolescents (43%). Acceptability of standing orders increased if the patient was first told that the provider ‘strongly recommended the vaccine’, even for a majority (52%) of those who generally were not comfortable receiving the vaccine using standing orders.Because standing orders for HPV vaccine are generally acceptable to women attending Ob/Gyn clinics, to increase vaccination uptake among adults Ob/Gyn providers may want to consider adoption of standing orders for HPV vaccine, at least for series completion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aadults 3aattitudes and opinions 3ademographic statistics 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3apatients 3asurveys 3avaccination 3avaccines 3awomen 3aColorado 0aHPV 0aUSPSTF 0aOb/Gyn 0aREDCap 0aHuman papillomavirus 0aVaccine 0aStanding orders1 aPyrzanowski, Jennifer1 aBrewer, Sarah1 aBarnard, Juliana1 aSevick, Carter1 aO’Leary, Sean T.0 tVaccine.g2015 Apr. 08, v. 33, no. 15 p.1773-1779dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.02.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009300168300001400261500001900275520091800294592002801212650002301240650001001263650001801273650001201291650002101303650001301324650001201337653001301349653001901362653002701381653002401408653002301432700002001455700002201475700001901497700005801516773014401574856008301718852000901801655001201810IND60688288120221119210614.0200614e20200712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068828812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBongini, Pietro12aA possible strategy to fight COVID-19: Interfering with spike glycoprotein trimerization  ap. 35-38.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe recent release of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein allows detailed analysis of the structural features that are required for stabilizing the infective form of its quaternary assembly. Trying to disassemble the trimeric structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein, we analyzed single protomer surfaces searching for concave moieties that are located at the three protomer-protomer interfaces. The presence of some druggable pockets at these interfaces suggested that some of the available drugs in Drug Bank could destabilize the quaternary spike glycoprotein formation by binding to these pockets, therefore interfering with COVID-19 life cycle. The approach we propose here can be an additional strategy to fight against the deadly virus. Ligands of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein that we have predicted in the present computational investigation, might be the basis for new experimental studies in vitro and in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3adrugs 3aglycoproteins 3aligands 3aprotein subunits 3aresearch 3aviruses 0aCOVID-19 0aS glycoprotein 0aQuaternary disassembly 0aInterfering ligands 0aDocking simulation1 aTrezza, Alfonso1 aBianchini, Monica1 aSpiga, Ottavia1 aNiccolai, Neri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6919-69080 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 July 12, v. 528, no. 1 p.35-38dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03635naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024003100122040001800153100001600171245010800187300001500295506007600310506003100386506002800417506005700445520156700502592002802069596004502097596004702142596004902189596000902238506003702247650001502284650001202299650001802311650001702329650002002346650002802366650001702394650001802411650002602429650001502455650001302470650001802483650002302501650001602524650001702540650001402557650001902571650001402590650001502604650000902619650001302628650001302641700001902654700001902673700001602692700002002708700001702728700001302745773012002758856007402878852000902952655001202961IND60759790120230102090100.0220901e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075979012DNAL7 a10.1039/c9en00933g2doi7 a10.1039/c9en00933g2chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Liyan10aCdS nanoparticles in soil induce metabolic reprogramming in broad bean (Vicia faba L.) roots and leaves  ap. 93-104.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aResource is Open Access  aRoyal Society of Chemistry (RSC) License Information  aThe rapid development of nanotechnology has raised concern regarding the environmental toxicity of nanoparticles (NPs). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying NP toxicity in plants. Broad bean (Vicia faba L.) plants were cultivated in soil amended with 0, 10, and 100 mg cadmium sulfide (CdS)-NPs per kg soil for 4 weeks, and then the phenotypic, biochemical, and metabolic responses of the plants to CdS-NP stress were evaluated. Metabolomics analysis revealed the significant up-regulation (1.2- to 39.2-fold) of several antioxidative metabolites, including N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, putrescine, and flavone, upon CdS-NP exposure, but no negative phenotypic effects were visible (plant biomass, photosynthetic pigment contents, and lipid peroxidation). This observation was in accordance with the observed regulation of antioxidative-defense-related metabolic pathways (tyrosine pathway and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis) that were identified by biological pathway analysis. Importantly, twice as many metabolites were modulated in leaves than in roots, including three nitrogen-related (purine metabolism; alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; β-alanine metabolism) and two carbon-related (pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis and carbon fixation) metabolic pathways. These results indicate that to alleviate the toxicity of CdS-NP exposure in soil, plants significantly reprogram the metabolic profiles of leaves rather than of roots, which might subsequently impact both harvest and crop quality.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Basic Research Program of China  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVicia faba 3aalanine 3aaspartic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acadmium sulfide 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acrop quality 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental science 3afaba beans 3aflavones 3aglutamic acid 3alipid peroxidation 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aphenotype 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytomass 3aputrescine 3asoil 3atoxicity 3atyrosine1 aZhang, Huiling1 aZhao, Xiaopeng1 aGu, Xueyuan1 aWhite, Jason C.1 aZhao, Lijuan1 aJi, Rong0 tEnvironmental Science: Nano.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 7, no. 1 p.93-104dRoyal Society of Chemistry (RSC)x2051-81537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9en00933g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012300167300001400290520167100304592002801975650004402003650002302047650001302070650001802083650001402101650003302115650001902148650004402167650001902211650001402230650003302244650001202277650002302289650003702312700001602349700001202365700002102377773008902398856008602487852000902573655001202582IND60095478820221120035815.0141104e20120220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009547882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2011.12.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Lifen10aSynthesis, film morphology and hydrophobicity of novel fluorinated polyacrylate emulsion and solution on silicon wafer  ap. 83-89.  aNovel fluorinated polyacrylate emulsion (CFBDH) and solution (SFBDH) were synthesized by polymerization of dodecafluoroheptyl methacrylate (DFMA) with butyl acrylate (BA), dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DM) and 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate (HpA) via seeded emulsion polymerization and solution polymerization, respectively. Chemical structure, particle morphology, glass transition temperature and thermal property of resultant CFBDH and SFBDH were characterized by FT-IR, ¹H NMR, TEM, DSC and TGA, respectively. The as-prepared products were utilized to treat the clean silicon wafers and form films on it, and then morphology and hydrophobicity of films were investigated by SEM, AFM, contact angle meter, etc. Results showed that the CFBDH particles had uniform spherical core–shell structure with an average diameter of 126nm. Core–shell CFBDH film thus had two Tg and SFBDH film only had one Tg. Their thermal properties were improved. The SFBDH film seemed less level and continuous than the CFBDH film by SEM at an amplification of 1000 and the observation rule of 20μm. However, as the observation rule decreased to 3nm, both the CFBDH and SFBDH films were inhomogeneous and existed in a phase-separated state with many low or high peaks in AFM images. The higher bright peaks in CFBDH film were much more and distributed uniformer than those in SFBDH film, but the roughness of CFBDH film was less than that of SFBDH film, the average roughness (Rq) of the CFBDH and SFBDH films reached to 0.205nm and 0.336nm in 1μm² scanning field, respectively. In addition, contact angles on CFBDH/Sil and SFBDH/Sil surfaces separately attained 104.3° and 98.5°.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3achemical structure 3acolloids 3acontact angle 3aemulsions 3aglass transition temperature 3ahydrophobicity 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3aroughness 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3athermal properties 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aAn, Qiufeng1 aXu, Wei1 aHuang, Liangxian0 tColloids and surfaces.g2012 Feb. 20, v. 396 p.83-89dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2011.12.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001800160245013300178300001600311500000900327500001500336520157100351592002801922650001401950650002101964650002101985650001202006650001402018650001102032650001802043650002402061650002202085650001702107650001402124650001502138651001702153653001602170653001902186700001702205773012202222852000902344856009702353655001202450IND9002969420221120225950.0191122e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900296942DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1990.00021962008200020005x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauer, Armand10aStubble Height Effect on Winter Wheat in the Northern Great Plains: I.

In contrast, estimates of the effect that duration of the low temperature has on winter survival have not been published for winterhardy cultivars. Objectives were to relate temperature at the 4-cm soil depth to winter survival and develop capability to estimate survival based on accumulated cold degree-hours. Field trials were conducted during a 4- yr period on Williams loam (fine-loamy, mixed Typic Argiborolls) at Mandan, ND. Soil temperature at the 4-cm depth was measured at 2-hr intervals under three cultivars (Roughrider, Mironovskaya and Centurk) grown on four stubble heights (0, 5, 20, and 36 cm) and with two preplant water levels (0 and 50 mm supplemental water applied 1–2 wk before planting). Based on postwinter pretillering plant populations, complete winterkill was effected at about −20 °C soil temperature for Roughrider and Mironovskaya; Centurk did not survive at −18 °C. Population reductions began to occur when 4- cm depth soil temperatures were about 7 °C warmer than the lethal soil temperature. Duration of the lethal temperature effecting complete winterkill appears to be a matter of hours, based on cold degree- hours lower than a threshold temperature. This information, coupled with that of soil temperatures estimated from models, has utility in predicting degree of potential winterkill and reduction in plant populations.

Here, we present two approaches based on tailored single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) architectures to develop immunosensors for the bacteriophage MS2, a virus often detected in sewage-impacted water supplies. In the first approach, SWCNTs were used in the bottom-up design of sensors as antibody immobilization support. Carboxy-functionalised SWCNTs were covalently tethered onto gold electrodes via carbodiimide coupling to cysteamine-modified gold electrodes. These SWCNTs were hydrazide functionalized by electrochemical grafting of diazonium salts. Site-oriented immobilization of antibodies was then carried out through hydrazone bond formation. Results showed microarray electrode behavior, greatly improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Excellent sensitivity and limit of detection (9.3pfu/mL and 9.8pfu/mL in buffer and in river water, respectively) were achieved, due to the combination of the SWCNTs′ ability to promote electron transfer reactions with electroactive species at low overpotentials and their high surface-to-volume ratio providing a favorable environment to immobilize biomolecules. In the second approach, SWCNTs were decorated with iron oxide nanoparticles. Diazonium salts were electrochemically grafted on iron-oxide-nanoparticle-decorated SWCNTs to functionalize them with hydrazide groups that facilitate site-directed immobilization of antibodies via hydrazone coupling. These magnetic immunocarriers facilitated MS2 separation and concentration on an electrode surface. This approach minimized non-specific adsorptions and matrix effects and allowed low limits of detection (12pfu/mL and 39pfu/mL in buffer and in river water, respectively) that could be further decreased by incubating the magnetic immunocarriers with larger volumes of sample. Significantly, both approaches permitted the detection of MS2 to levels regularly encountered in sewage-impacted environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantibodies 3abacteriophages 3abiochemical compounds 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3agold 3aimmunosensors 3airon oxides 3amicroarray technology 3amicrobial contamination 3amicrobial detection 3ananoparticles 3ariparian buffers 3ariver water 3asalts 3asurface area 3awater supply 0aElectrochemical immunoassay 0aCarbon nanotubes 0aIron oxide nanoparticles 0aAntibody immobilization 0aVirus detection1 aBandaru, N.M.1 aSaint, C.1 aVoelcker, N.H.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 May 15, v. 67 p.642-648dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2014.09.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245008500183300001800268520085800286592002801144650002601172650001901198650002001217650001101237650000701248650003901255650002801294650001201322650002701334650004001361650002101401650006201422650006001484650003101544650001301575650002101588650002701609650005901636650001601695700001601711700001701727700001601744700002101760773009801781856008101879852000901960655001201969IND50067035520221121050854.0150207e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006703552DNAL7 a235158962pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-013-1187-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Qingqing10aUFEIII, a fibrinolytic protease from the marine invertebrate, Urechis unicinctus  ap. 1115-1120.  aA new serine protease with fibrinolytic activity from a marine invertebrate, Urechis unicinctus, was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using column chromatography.

Although specific signaling pathways have been previously targeted for cancer therapy, the Wnt pathway has been rarely explored in this pursuit. Also an important facet of cancer theranostics is cellular bio-imaging. Taking into consideration these two critical aspects, we herein report the synthesis, bio-imaging and anti-cell proliferative effect of the recombinant secreted frizzled-related protein-4 (sFRP4) bound with silver nanocluster-embedded chitosan–alginate composite nanoparticles. While bacterially expressed and purified recombinant sFRP4 specifically blocked the aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cancer cells, the remarkable luminescence of the silver nanoclusters enabled imaging, binding, and uptake studies. Both the protein as well as the nanoparticle component of this multifaceted system were responsible for triggering facile cell death; sFRP4 by inhibiting the Wnt signaling, and silver nanoclusters by the activation of reactive oxygen species. Hereby, a co-therapy module was generated that successfully brought about apoptotic cell death. Therefore, the current module has achieved significant benefits for in vitro cancer theranostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aimage analysis 3aluminescence 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aprecision medicine 3asignal transduction 3asilver1 aGoswami, Upashi1 aRaza, Asif1 aChattopadhyay, Arun1 aGhosh, Siddhartha Sankar0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 08, v. 6, no. 89 p.85763-85772dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra16066b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013100168300001800299520123100317592002801548650001901576650002501595650001701620650000901637650002001646650001101666650001701677650001101694650001601705651001001721653000801731653002301739653001601762653002401778700005101802773011501853856008601968852000902054655001202063IND60565000020221120140047.0180831e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056500002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang Xiping,10aStudy on carbon capture and storage (CCS) investment decision-making based on real options for China's coal-fired power plants  ap. 4123-4131.  aIn this paper, a quadrinomial model based on the theory of real options is developed to evaluate the investment in carbon capture and storage (CCS) retrofitting for existing coal-fired power plants in China. Uncertainties in carbon price, fossil fuel price, investment cost and government subsidy are considered. An existing typical 600 MW supercritical pulverized coal-fired (SCPC) plant is taken as a case study to illustrate the proposed model, and the effects of government subsidy under different scenarios on the critical carbon price to invest in CCS are analyzed. The results indicate that the real options approach has an advantage over the application of traditional net present value (NPV) method when handling uncertainty. And government subsidy has significant effects on reducing critical carbon price for investment in CCS. The critical carbon prices are 103.56 RMB/ton with 100% subsidy and 217.95 RMB/ton without subsidy, while the current average carbon price is 85.2 RMB/ton. This means that the current trading environment is not positive enough to attract investment in CCS retrofitting. These conclusions provide theoretical foundation for decision-making of CCS investment and related policy-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon markets 3acarbon sequestration 3acase studies 3acoal 3adecision making 3amodels 3apower plants 3aprices 3auncertainty 3aChina 0aCCS 0aQuadrinomial model 0aPower plant 0aReal options theory1 aDu, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9195-93880 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 112 p.4123-4131dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.07.1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01782naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245006300180300001600243500000900259520070200268592002800970650001600998650001901014650001901033650001901052650001801071650002001089651001901109700001601128700001801144700001601162773014901178856009601327852000901423655001201432IND60669655020221119020659.0191125e197709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066965502DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1977.03615995004100050029x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandon, C.

Brittleness was associated with mineral material that was slightly finer in mean particle size, less well sorted, and slightly more fine skewed than spodic horizons that were not brittle. No chemical, mineralogical, or organic matter composition was related to brittleness. Brittle spodic layers are very different from nonbrittle layers in micromorphology, having their macropacking voids filled with organic matter and silt-sized mineral material.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrittleness 3acoastal plains 3amicrostructure 3aorganic matter 3aparticle size 3aspodic horizons 3aNorth Carolina1 aBuol, S.

Searching for synergies, in the current study, we simultaneously overexpressed the five glycolytic genes in a stepwise fashion to evaluate the effect of the cumulative overexpression of glycolytic genes on D-lactate production. Interestingly, the final D-lactate concentration markedly differed depending on whether or not the PFK encoding gene was overexpressed when combined with overexpressing other glycolytic genes. The simultaneous overexpression of the GLK, GAPDH, TPI, and FBA encoding genes led to the highest initial D-lactate concentration at 10 h. However, this particular recombinant strain dramatically slowed producing D-lactate when a concentration of 1300 mM was reached, typically after 32 h. In contrast, the strain overexpressing the PFK encoding gene together with the GLK, GAPDH, TPI, and FBA encoding genes showed 12.7 % lower initial D-lactate concentration at 10 h than that observed with the strain overexpressing the genes coding for GLK, GAPDH, TPI, and FBA. However, this recombinant strain continued to produce D-lactate after 32 h, reaching 2169 mM after a mineral salts medium bioprocess incubation period of 80 h. These results suggest that overexpression of the PFK encoding gene is essential for achieving high production of D-lactate. Our findings provide interesting options to explore for using C. glutamicum for cost-efficient production of D-lactate at the industrial scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3abioprocessing 3acost effectiveness 3afructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aglucokinase 3aglyceraldehyde 3aglycolysis 3aoxygen 3aphosphofructokinases 3asalts 3atriose-phosphate isomerase1 aYamamoto, Shogo1 aKato, Naoto1 aSuda, Masako1 aVertès, Alain A.,1 aYukawa, Hideaki1 aInui, Masayuki0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2015 June, v. 99, no. 11 p.4679-4689dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-6546-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245016700174300001400341520175700355592002802112650002802140650002502168650001302193650001502206650002802221650002102249650001602270650000902286650001602295650002402311650002102335650001402356650003302370650003002403650001902433650001002452650001602462650001302478650003702491653001702528653002202545653001402567653001402581653001402595700002002609700002602629700002302655773008402678856008502762852000902847655001202856IND60591955520221117040508.0200614e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059195552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2018.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaranowski, Łukasz12aA cryotechnique-based method for low abundance protein immunolocalization in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) roots infected with a nematode, Globodera rostochiensis  ap. 24-30.  aPlant-parasitic cyst forming nematodes induce in host roots a specific feeding site called a syncytium. Modifications induced by the pathogen in cells incorporated into syncytium include their hypertrophy and changes in apoplast caused by over-expression of plant proteins, e.g. cellulases. As a result cell wall openings between syncytial elements are formed. The major aim of our investigation was to immunolocalize cellulases involved in these cell-wall modifications. Experiments were conducted on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. “Money Maker”) infected with Globodera rostochiensis. Root segments containing syncytia were processed using two techniques: conventional method of embedding in LR-White resin and cryotechnique of progressive lowering of temperature (PLT). It is believed that the latter is superior to other techniques in keeping in place cell components and preserving antigenicity of macromolecules. It is especially useful when low abundance proteins have to be immunodetected at their place of action. The main principle of the PLT technique is a stepwise lowering of temperature throughout probe dehydration, infiltration and embedding in an appropriate resin. Two-step immunolocalization and visualization using fluorochrome (FITC) at light microscopy level or colloidal gold particles at transmission electron microscopy level was performed in this study. The labeling of cellulase 7 protein at both microscopy levels was more intensive and specific on PLT-treated sections as compared to sections obtained from the classical method. Our results confirm the usefulness of the PLT cryotechnique for plant immunocytochemistry and indicate that in nematode-infected roots cellulase 7 is predominantly present in the syncytia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlobodera rostochiensis 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aapoplast 3acell walls 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afluorescent dyes 3agiant cells 3agold 3ahypertrophy 3aimmunocytochemistry 3alight microscopy 3apathogens 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aplant proteins 3aroots 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aAntigenicity 0aPLT cryotechnique 0aCell wall 0aSyncytium 0aCellulase1 aKurek, Wojciech1 aLichocka, Małgorzata1 aSobczak, Mirosław0 tMicron.g2018 May, v. 108 p.24-30dElsevier LtdwJournal:12416x0968-43287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2018.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002800142245011500170500001900285520160500304592002801909650002001937650001801957650001901975650000901994650001302003650001902016650001202035650001302047650001202060650001902072650000902091650001902100650002202119650001702141650001602158651001002174700002102184700002802205700001602233773011802249856007602367852000902443655001202452IND60732130920221121223415.0210326e20210319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073213092DNAL7 a10.3390/land100303182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSonneveld, B.

Development of a Site Selection Tool for Three Cities in Benin  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the context of rapid urbanization, poorer residents in cities across low- and middle-income countries increasingly experience food and nutrition deficiencies. The United Nations has highlighted urban agriculture (UA) as a viable solution to food insecurity, by empowering the urban poor to produce their own fresh foods and make some profit from surplus production. Despite its potential role in reducing poverty and food insecurity, there appears to be little political will to support urban agriculture. This is seen in unclear political mandates that are sustained by information gaps on selection criteria for UA sites. The research reported here addresses this issue in the form of a decision-making support tool that assesses the suitability of cadastral units and informal plots for allotment gardens in urban and peri-urban areas. The tool was developed and tested for three rapidly expanding cities in Benin, a low-income country in West Africa, based on an ordered logit model that relates a set of 300 expert assessments on site suitability to georeferenced information on biophysical and socio-economic characteristics. Soil, land use, groundwater depth, vicinity to market and women’s safety were significant factors in the assessment. Scaled up across all cadastral units and informal sites, the tool generated detailed baseline maps on site suitability and availability of areas.

Astringent food ingredients comprising polyphenols, cationic macromolecules, and multivalent metal salts are known to interact with the pellicle. However, astringent-induced changes in the physicochemical properties of the tooth-saliva interphase are not yet completely understood. Here we provide comprehensive insights into interfacial charging, ultrastructure, thickness, and surface roughness of the pellicles formed on the model substrates silicon oxide (SiO₂), Teflon® AF, and hydroxyapatite, as well as on bovine enamel before and after incubation with the astringents epigallocatechin gallate, tannic acid, iron(III) salt, lysozyme, and chitosan. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring demonstrated viscous behavior of untreated pellicles formed in vitro on the different materials. Electrokinetic (streaming current) measurements revealed that cationic astringents reverse the charge of native pellicles, whereas polyphenols did not change the charge under physiological pH condition. In addition, transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy showed a concentration-dependent increase in average film thickness and pellicle surface roughness as induced by astringents. These multifaceted alterations of the salivary pellicle may come along with an increase in roughness perceived on the teeth, which is part of the complex sensations of oral astringency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aastringency 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiofilm 3acattle 3achitosan 3acolloids 3aenamel 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3ahydroxyapatite 3aingredients 3ainterphase 3airon 3alysozyme 3amodels 3apH 3apolyphenols 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3aroughness 3asaliva 3asilica 3asurface roughness 3atannins 3ateeth 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 0aSaliva 0aPellicle 0aOral astringents 0aElectrokinetics 0aQCM-D 0aAFM1 aDelius, Judith1 aFriedrichs, Jens1 aStehl, Susanne1 aHofmann, Thomas1 aHannig, Christian1 aRehage, Melanie1 aWerner, C.q(Carsten),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0189-34481 aHannig, Matthias0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 174 p.451-458dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245011700174300001600291520199600307592002802303650002702331650001402358650002002372650001202392650001302404650001502417650001602432650002002448650000902468700002202477700002202499773011702521856005502638852000902693655001202702IND4510075320221118030625.0150730e20020201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451007532DNAL7 a10.1046/j.0014-2956.2001.02687.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, John W.10aImplications of the simultaneous occurrence of hepatic glycolysis from glucose and gluconeogenesis from glycerol  ap. 792-797.  aGlycolysis from [6â3H]glucose and gluconeogenesis from [Uâ14C]glycerol were examined in isolated hepatocytes from fasted rats. A 5 mm bolus of glycerol inhibited phosphorylation of 40âmm glucose by 50% and glycolysis by more than 60%, and caused cellular ATP depletion and glycerol 3âphosphate accumulation. Gluconeogenesis from 5âmm glycerol was unaffected by the presence of 40âmm glucose. When nonsaturating concentrations of glycerol (<â200âÂµm) were maintained in the medium by infusion of glycerol, cellular ATP concentrations remained normal. The rate of uptake of infused glycerol was unaffected by 40âmm glucose, but carbohydrate synthesis from glycerol was inhibited 25%, a corresponding amount of glycerol being diverted to glycolytic products, whereas 10âmm glucose had no inhibitory effect on conversion of infused glycerol into carbohydrate. Glycerol infusion depressed glycolysis from 10âmm and 40âmm glucose by 15 and 25%, respectively; however, the overall rates of glycolysis were unchanged because of a concomitant increase in glycolysis from the infused glycerol. These studies show that exposure of hepatocytes to glucose and low quasiâsteadyâstate concentrations of glycerol result in the simultaneous occurrence, at substantial rates, of glycolysis from glucose and gluconeogenesis from the added glycerol. We interpret our results as demonstrating that, in hepatocytes from normal rats, segments of the pathways of glycolysis from glucose and gluconeogenesis from glycerol are compartmentalized and that this segregation prevents substantial crossâover of phosphorylated intermediates from one pathway to the other. The competition between glucose and glycerol implies that glycolysis and phosphorylation of glycerol take place in the same cells, and that the occurrence of simultaneous glycolysis and gluconeogenesis may indicate channelling within the cytoplasm of individual hepatocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acytoplasm 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3aglycolysis 3ahepatocytes 3aphosphorylation 3arats1 aJones, Michael E.1 aBerry, Michael N.0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2002 Feb. 1, v. 269, no. 3 p.792-797dBlackwell Science, Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0014-2956.2001.02687.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245008900192300001400281520136500295592002801660650001901688650001301707650001001720650002001730650001701750650003001767650001201797650002201809650003201831653001601863653001401879700002101893700002701914700001501941773012501956856008102081852000902162655001202171IND60655603220221117205214.0190803e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065560322DNAL7 a224640102pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800120008942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Scholten, Bernt J10aAetiological factors behind adipose tissue inflammation: an unexplored research area  ap. 27-35.  aDespite extensive research into the biological mechanisms behind obesity-related inflammation, knowledge of environmental and genetic factors triggering such mechanisms is limited. In the present narrative review we present potential determinants of adipose tissue inflammation and suggest ways ahead for future research in the field. We searched the literature for potential determinants of obesity with inflammation through MEDLINE by applying the MeSH headings ‘obesity’ and ‘inflammation’ in combination with specific terms for a series of environmental and genetic factors. Numerous articles reported on the association between environmental or genetic factors and respectively obesity and inflammation, whereas only a few studies assessed obesity and inflammation as a combined outcome. Among suggested determinants for obesity with inflammation were Adenovirus-36, the gut microbiota, trans-fatty acids, and the four genes FTO, MC4R, TNF-α and LEPR. We present a limited number of factors potentially contributing to the development of obesity with inflammation, while concluding that overall the area is indeed sparsely investigated. We present ideas for future studies that can identify relevant aetiological factors. This identification is essential for targeted prevention of obesity with inflammation and the clinical consequences thereof.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aetiology 3agenes 3agenetic factors 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aobesity 3atrans fatty acids 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aEnvironment 0aAetiology1 aAndresen, Erik N1 aSørensen, Thorkild IA1 aJess, Tine0 tPublic health nutrition.g2013 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.27-35dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800120008943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02037naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245009400174300001400268520076800282592002801050650002301078650001301101650001001114650001001124650002101134650001501155650002201170650002401192650002601216653002401242653002201266653003001288653002301318700002501341700002201366700003401388773010901422856008701531852000901618655001201627IND60541531420221118170035.0190318e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054153142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2015.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanco, Carlos A.10aBeer discrimination using a portable electronic tongue based on screen-printed electrodes  ap. 57-62.  aThere is a wide variety of Lager beer styles that differ, among others characteristics, in their alcohol content and color.

However, there are many issues that make accurate determination of fruit and vegetable consumption quite difficult. There are many methods used to measure fruit and vegetable intake, but all have limitations. Also, what foods individuals consider to be or to not be fruits or vegetables appear to be quite variable, with such variability often associated with the individual's racial/ethnic background. Researchers and governmental agencies vary with respect to what foods they include and do not include when calculating fruit and vegetable intake. These differences make it difficult to conduct, evaluate and compare studies in this area. The current paper reviews some of the major issues with measuring and determining fruit and vegetable intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3afoods 3afruits 3ahuman health 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables 0aFruit and vegetables 0aDietary assessment 0aNutrition research1 aNiederhauser, Victoria P.,0 tPublic health nutrition.g2013 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.2-7dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800120009853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245005700178300001600235520139200251592002801643650001401671650001301685650001601698650001301714650001001727650002101737650002101758650002301779650002101802650001801823650001801841650001601859650000901875650001101884650001401895650000901909650001801918650001801936650001601954650003201970650001602002653002002018653001802038653002202056653002202078700002402100700003302124700003102157700002102188700002302209700002402232773010602256856008702362852000902449655001202458IND60622975920221119020054.0210108e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062297592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.11.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaimi, Ayelen Tatiana10aNovel imiquimod nanovesicles for topical vaccination  ap. 536-543.  aDevelopment of needle and pain free noninvasive immunization procedures is a top priority for public health agencies. In this work the topical adjuvant activity of the immunomodulator imiquimod (IMQ) carried by ultradeformable archaeosomes (UDA₂) (nanovesicles containing sn-2,3 ether linked phytanyl saturated archaeolipids) was surveyed and compared with that of ultradeformable liposomes lacking archaeolipids (UDL₂) and free IMQ, using the model antigen ovalbumin and a seasonal influenza vaccine in Balb/c mice. UDA₂ (250 ± 94 nm, -26 ± 4 mV Z potential) induced higher IMQ accumulation in human skin and higher production of TNF-α and IL-6 by macrophages and keratinocytes than free IMQ and UDL₂. Mixed with ovalbumin, UDA₂ was more efficient at generating cellular response, as measured by an increase in serum IgG2a and INF-γ production by splenocytes, compared with free IMQ and UDL₂. Moreover, mixed with a seasonal influenza vaccine UDA₂ produced same IgG titers and IgG2a/IgG1 isotypes ratio (≈1) than the subcutaneously administered influenza vaccine. Topical UDA₂ however, induced highest stimulation index and INF-γ levels by splenocytes. UDA₂ might be a promising adjuvant for topical immunization, since it produced cell-biased systemic response with ≈ 13-fold lower IMQ dose than the delivered as the commercial IMQ cream, Aldara.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3acolloids 3acream 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunomodulators 3ainfluenza vaccines 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-6 3akeratinocytes 3amacrophages 3amice 3amodels 3aovalbumin 3apain 3apublic health 3askin (animal) 3asplenocytes 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avaccination 0aImmunomodulator 0aArchaeolipids 0aCellular response 0aInfluenza vaccine1 aAltube, Maria Julia1 ade Farias, Marcelo Alexandre1 aPortugal, Rodrigo Villares1 aPerez, Ana Paula1 aRomero, Eder Lilia1 aMorilla, Maria Jose0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 174 p.536-543dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009200161300001800253500001900271520121400290592002801504650002001532650003001552650001201582653003401594653002401628653002801652653003201680700001901712700001901731700001701750700001601767700001601783700001801799700001701817700001501834700001701849700001801866700005601884700001601940700005601956773013902012856007802151852000902229655001202238IND60729851220221122200812.0210303e20210220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072985122DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c183112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Wenyan10aCdS Induced Passivation toward High Efficiency and Stable Planar Perovskite Solar Cells  ap. 9771-9780.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn perovskite solar cells, the halide vacancy defects on the perovskite film surface/interface will instigate charge recombination, leading to a decrease in cell performance. In this study, cadmium sulfide (CdS) has been introduced into the precursor solution to reduce the halide vacancy defects and improve the cell performance. The highest efficiency of the device reaches 21.62%. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the incorporated Cd²⁺ ions can partially replace Pb²⁺ ions, thus forming a strong Cd–I bond and effectively reducing iodide vacancy defects (VI); at the same time, the loss of the charge recombination is significantly reduced because VI is filled by S²– ions. Besides, the substitution of Cd²⁺ for Pb²⁺ could increase the generation of PbI₂, which can further passivate the grain boundary. Therefore, the stability of the cells, together with the efficiency of the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), is also improved, maintaining 87.5% of its initial PCEs after being irradiated over 410 h. This work provides a very effective strategy to passivate the surface/interface defects of perovskite films for more efficient and stable optoelectronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium sulfide 3adensity functional theory 3aiodides 0aplanar perovskite solar cells 0ainduced passivation 0asuppress iodine vacancy 0apower conversion efficiency1 aShi, Jiangjian1 aTian, Chuanjin1 aWu, Jionghua1 aLi, Hongshi1 aLi, Yusheng1 aYu, Bingcheng1 aLuo, Yanhong1 aWu, Huijue1 aXie, Zhipeng1 aWang, Changan1 aDuan, Defang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6878-18301 aLi, Dongmei1 aMeng, Qingbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4531-47000 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Feb. 20, v. 13, no. 8 p.9771-9780dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c183113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015900167300001800326520168800344592002802032650001602060650002002076650002502096650001602121650001002137650001302147650003502160650000902195650002102204650001102225650001102236650003502247650003002282650001502312650002002327650001302347650002102360650001702381650001302398700002502411700002102436700001802457700002502475773011402500856008102614852000902695655001202704IND60573564120221116223351.0170724e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057356412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10695-016-0239-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVutukuru, S.

Recent studies demonstrate that endocrine disrupting chemicals like Bisphenol A (BPA), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) affect the reproductive characters shared by wide range of creatures including fish. An attempt was made to evaluate the toxicity of these chemicals on the vitellogenin protein of zebra fish (Danio rerio) using in silico approach. The protein structure of zebra fish vitellogenin was predicted using homology modelling, and the stereochemical quality of the model was validated by Ramachandran plot. The 3-D structure of vitellogenin was docked with the aforementioned chemicals that have demonstrated endocrine-disrupting activity. The pair-wise alignments between vitellogenin with phosvitin, lipovitellin-2 and YGP40 obtained by CLUSTALW alignment suggest that the vitellogenin contained lipovitellin-2- phosvitin- and YGP40-related amino acid sequences. Based on the prediction of CASTp and CLUSTALW, BPA and PCB predominantly interacted with lipovitellin-2 site of the protein, while PBDE interacts predominantly with the YGP40 site of the vitellogenin protein. The results indicate that the endocrine-disrupting chemicals (BPA, PCB and PBDE) dock with the vitellogenin cleavage sites lipovitellin-2 and YGP40 that play a crucial role in lipid–protein complex formation in the egg yolk. We hypothesize that these chemicals could potentially impair the egg yolk formation and eventually impact the zebra fish population which occupies an important niche among testing models used in drug discovery and related toxicity studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadverse effects 3aamino acid sequences 3abisphenol A 3adrugs 3aegg yolk 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3afish 3afish communities 3ahumans 3amodels 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aprediction 3astereochemistry 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3avitellogenin 3awildlife1 aGanugapati, Jayasree1 aGanesh, Vardhini1 aAtheeksha, P.1 aPotti, Ravindra Babu0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2016 Dec., v. 42, no. 6 p.1541-1555dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-016-0239-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012600169300001600295520070200311592002801013650002001041650002201061650001601083650002101099650002701120650002601147650002001173650002901193650001301222650002501235650001201260650001901272650004101291650002201332650001101354651000901365653002601374653001801400653004301418653002701461653001601488653001701504700002501521700002501546773011101571856008401682852000901766655001201775IND60122933220221119071427.0150325e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012293322DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2013.8290072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPino, Jorge A.10aChemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil of Callistemon speciosus (Sims) DC. leaves from Cuba  ap. 419-423.  aThe essential oil from the leaves of Callistemon speciosus (Sims) DC. grown in Cuba was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS).

Here we compare the results of molecular monitoring of ticks and zoonotic TBPs over a six-year period, with the monitoring of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in an endemic area. RESULTS: In the period 2011–2016, 2,578 ticks were collected in 38 sites of 20 municipalities of Belluno Province. Individual adults (264), pooled larvae (n = 330) and nymphs (n = 1984) were screened for tick-borne encephalitis virus, Borrelia burgdorferi (s.l.), Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum and “Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis” by specific SYBR green real-time PCR assays and sequencing. The spleens of 97 foxes, culled in the period 2015–2017 during sport hunting or population control programs, were also screened. Overall, nine different pathogens were found in I. ricinus nymph and adult ticks: Rickettsia helvetica (3.69%); R. monacensis (0.49%); four species of the B. burgdorferi (s.l.) complex [B. afzelii (1.51%); B. burgdorferi (s.s.) (1.25%); B. garinii (0.18%); and B. valaisiana (0.18%)]; A. phagocytophilum (3.29%); “Candidatus N. mikurensis” (1.73%); and Babesia venatorum (0.04%). Larvae were collected and screened in the first year only and two pools (0.6%) were positive for R. helvetica. Tick-borne encephalitis virus was not found in ticks although human cases do occur in the area. The rate of infection in ticks varied widely according to tick developmental stage, site and year of collection. As expected, adults were the most infected, with 27.6% harboring at least one pathogen compared to 7.3% of nymphs. Pathogens with a minimum infection rate above 1% were recorded every year. None of the pathogens found in ticks were detectable in the foxes, 52 (54%) of which were instead positive for Babesia cf. microti (also referred to as Babesia microti-like, “Theileria annae”, “Babesia annae” and “Babesia vulpes”). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that foxes cannot be used as sentinel animals to monitor tick-borne pathogens in the specific epidemiological context of northeastern Italy. The high prevalence of Babesia cf. microti in foxes and its absence in ticks strongly suggests that I. ricinus is not the vector of this pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnaplasma phagocytophilum 3aBabesia 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aIxodes ricinus 3aRickettsia helvetica 3aTick-borne encephalitis virus 3aVulpes vulpes 3aadults 3afoxes 3ahumans 3alarvae 3amonitoring 3anymphs 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asentinel animals 3aspleen 3asport hunting 3aticks 3aItaly1 aRavagnan, Silvia1 aSoppelsa, Fabio1 aPorcellato, Elena1 aSoppelsa, Mauro1 aObber, Federica1 aCitterio, Carlo Vittorio1 aCarlin, Sara1 aDanesi, Patrizia1 aMontarsi, Fabrizio1 aCapelli, Gioia0 tParasites & vectors.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.137-137dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2726-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245012600188300001300314520132400327592002801651650001101679650002201690650001301712650002301725650002401748650001701772650001101789650000901800650000901809650001201818650001901830650001101849650001101860650001601871653002101887653002801908653001601936653001101952700001801963700002201981700001402003773012402017856008102141852000902222655001202231IND60655603520221117205152.0190803e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065560352DNAL7 a227170282pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800120010852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVereecken, Carine10aTest–retest reliability and agreement between children's and parents’ reports of a computerized food preferences tool  ap. 8-14.  aTo investigate test–retest reliability of primary-school children's reports of food preferences and to investigate agreement with parental reports. Children completed an online test and retest, one to two weeks later, during school hours; parents completed a paper-and-pencil or an online questionnaire at home. The children's preferences questionnaire contained 148 food items, reduced to twelve scales; the parental questionnaire contained seventy-eight items reduced to nine scales. Children of fourteen primary schools in Belgium-Flanders. In total 572 children participated; test–retest data were available for 354 children, children's tests could be matched to 362 parental reports. Test–retest intraclass correlations were on average 0·73, ranging between 0·62 and 0·86; correlations between children's and parents’ reports were on average 0·50, ranging between 0·32 and 0·62. Retest preferences were significantly higher for more than half of the scales. Children reported higher preferences than their parents for milk & milk products, fruit and soft drinks, while parents reported higher preferences for bread & breakfast cereals, meat, snacks and sauces.

In this work, six membrane stages are employed: microfiltration (MF) (0.2μm), ultrafiltration (UF) (50, 20, 10 and 1kDa) and nanofiltration (NF).The most promising stages are 50kDa UF and NF based on SDS–PAGE analyses and total amino acid concentration. The 50kDa stage produces a protein concentrate (>17kDa). NF produces a retentate containing sugars, amino acids and smaller peptides and a NF permeate containing salt and acetic acid ready for reuse. 42% of the spent marinade is recovered to substitute fresh water and chemicals. The waste water amount is reduced 62.5%. Proteins are concentrated 30 times, while amino acids and smaller peptides are concentrated 11 times.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acids 3acell fractionation 3afish fillets 3afractionation 3aherring 3alipids 3amarinating 3amicrofiltration 3ananofiltration 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein concentrates 3asugars 3aultrafiltration 3awastewater 0aFish food waste 0aHerring brine 0aProtein characterization 0aMembrane filtration 0aFractionation1 aLizarazu, Juncal Martin1 aRazi Parjikolaei, Behnaz1 aKarring, Henrik1 aChristensen, Knud V.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2015 Aug., v. 158 p.39-47dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2015.02.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002500169245013200194300001600326520082100342592002801163650002201191650002301213650000901236650002201245650001301267650002001280650002701300650001101327650001301338650001201351650006001363650003501423650004601458650000901504650002201513650001301535650003201548651001301580651001801593651002801611653002701639653002201666653002501688653001401713653001901727700002101746700002601767700001701793773012101810856008501931852000902016655001202025IND50068128520221119114531.0190401e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006812852DNAL7 a233519752pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.12.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamírez, Juan David10aUnderstanding the role of dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) in the transmission dynamics of Trypanosoma cruzi genotypes in Colombia  ap. 216-219.  aThe dog (Canis lupus familiaris) is the most important domestic reservoir of Chagas disease, a zoonosis that affects more than 10 million people in Latin America. Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of the disease, displays remarkable genetic variability, as indicated by its six genotypes (TcI-TcVI). A pilot study was conducted to establish the prevalence of T. cruzi among the canine population by analyzing 80 dogs. We report the identification of the TcI, TcII, TcIV and TcVI genotypes as single infections. TcI/TcII and TcI/TcIV presented as mixed infections and included the presence of Trypanosoma angel. The implications of this distribution are herein discussed. Based on the molecular epidemiology findings, this study suggests a plausible role for canine synanthropism in the transmission of T. cruzi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3adisease reservoirs 3adogs 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3amixed infection 3amolecular epidemiology 3apeople 3azoonoses 2aAnimals 2aChagas Diseasexepidemiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aDisease Reservoirsxveterinary 2aDog Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aDogs 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aTrypanosoma cruzixgenetics 3aColombia 3aLatin America 0aColombiaxepidemiology. 0aCanis lupus familiaris 0aTrypanosoma cruzi 0aDiscrete typing unit 0aReservoir 0aChagas disease1 aTurriago, Brenda1 aTapia-Calle, Gabriela1 aGuhl, Felipe0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2013 Sept. 01, v. 196, no. 1-2 p.216-219dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.12.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010800169300001600277520090500293592002801198650001501226650002901241650002001270650000901290650000801299650002601307650001401333650001901347650001701366650003701383650001301420650000901433650002101442650001101463653001701474653001901491653001501510653002901525653001801554700001601572700001701588773011101605856008401716852000901800655001201809IND60122933520221119071604.0150325e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012293352DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2013.7824752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Zhenhua10aAntifungal activities against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum by Cinnamomum cassia oil and its main components  ap. 444-451.  aThe plant disease produced by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a big problem in agriculture. This paper tested the effects of cinnamon oil and its components on the growth of S. sclerotiorum . The cinnamon oil was first separated into carbonyl and noncarbonyl parts by treatment with sodium bisulfite. Then two main cinnamaldehyde derivatives, that is 2′-methoxycinnamaldehyde and coniferyl aldehyde, were further separated by column chromatography from the carbonyl parts. Cinnamon oil demonstrated a significant antifungal effect against S. sclerotiorum with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 256 μg/mL in agar and 64 μg/mL air, respectively. trans -Cinnamaldehyde exhibited the highest antifungal activity among all the three cinnamaldehydes tested. In addition, thymol and carvacrol had an additive effect with trans -cinnamaldehyde in preventing the mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum .  aPublisher supplied data 3aCinnamomum 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aadditive effect 3aagar 3aair 3aantifungal properties 3acarvacrol 3achromatography 3acinnamon oil 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amycelium 3aoils 3asodium bisulfite 3athymol 0acinnamon oil 0acinnamaldehyde 0aantifungal 0aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 0aphytopathogen1 aJiang, Hong1 aXie, Pengfei0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 25, no. 6 p.444-451dTaylor & Francisx2163-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.2013.7824753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04307naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245005100169300001400220506002800234520247600262592002802738506003702766650002602803650002102829650001902850650001202869650001302881650002002894650001902914650001302933650001202946650002402958650001702982650001102999650001503010650003503025650001203060650001403072650001703086650001203103651002103115651001003136653002103146653001703167653000903184653001903193653001103212653001803223700002703241700001903268700002603287700002303313700001503336700002403351700001803375700002103393773015303414856008103567852000903648655001203657IND60785527020221207075257.0200322e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078552702DNAL7 a10.3126/jnarc.v6i0.281112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoshi, Bal Krishna10aAgrobiodiversity and its Conservation in Nepal  ap. 14-33.  aResource is Open Access  aNepal is a part of the world’s biodiversity hotspot and ranks the 49th in the world for biodiversity. Agrobiodiversity and its conservation status were studied through literature review, field survey, key informant survey and focus group discussion. Results of field implementation of some good practices and action research were also documented. Among 24,300 total species in the country, 28% are agricultural genetic resources (AGRs), termed as agrobiodiversity. Agrobiodiversity has six components (crops, forages, livestock, aquatic, insects and microorganisms) and four sub-components (domesticated, semi-domesticated, wild relatives and wild edible) in Nepal. Agrobiodiversity on each component exists at agroecosystem, species, variety/breed/biotype/race/strain, genotype and allele levels, within an altitude range from 60 to 5,000 masl. There are 12 agroecosystems supporting 1026 species under crop component, 510 under forage, 35 under livestock, 250 under the aquatic animal, 17 under aquatic plant, 3,500 under insect and 800 under microorganism. An estimated loss of agrobiodiversity is 40%, however, farmers have reported up to 100% loss of AGRs in some areas for a particular species. Conservation of agrobiodiversity has been initiated since 1986. Four strategies namely ex-situ, on-farm, in-situ and breeding have been adopted for conservation and sustainable utilization of AGRs. Eighty good practices including process, methods and actions for managing agrobiodiversity have been in practice and these practices come under five conservation components (sensitization, method and approach, accelerator, value and enabling environment). Within the country, 18,765 accessions of AGRs have been conserved in different kinds of banks. A total of 24,683 accessions of Nepalese crops, forages and microbes have been conserved in different international and foreign genebanks. Some collections are conserved as safety duplication and safety backup in different CGIARs’ banks and World Seed Vault, Korea. Two global databases (GENESYS and EURISCO) have maintained 19,200 Nepalese accessions. Geographical Information System, Climate Analog Tool and biotechnological tools have been applied for better managing AGRs. Many stakeholders need to further concentrate on the conservation and utilization of AGRs. Global marketing of some native AGRs is necessary for sustaining agriculture and attracting young generations as well as conserving them through use.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural research 3aagrobiodiversity 3aagroecosystems 3aalleles 3aaltitude 3aaquatic animals 3aaquatic plants 3abiotypes 3aclimate 3aconservation status 3afocus groups 3aforage 3agene banks 3ageographic information systems 3ainsects 3alivestock 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3aKorean Peninsula 3aNepal 0aaquatic resource 0aconservation 0acrop 0agood practices 0ainsect 0amicroorganism1 aGorkhali, Neena Amatya1 aPradhan, Neeta1 aGhimire, Krishna Hari1 aGotame, Tek Prasad1 aPrenil, KC1 aMainali, Ram Prasad1 aKarkee, Ajaya1 aPaneru, Ram Babu0 tJournal of Nepal Agricultural Research Council.g2020 Mar., v. 6, no. 1 p.14-33dNepal Agricultural Research CouncilwJournal:27861x2392-45437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3126/jnarc.v6i0.281113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245013000183300001400313520155200327592002801879650001301907650001601920650002701936650001201963650001601975650002201991650001002013650003302023650002502056650002402081650002402105650001302129650001202142650001502154651001602169653000902185653002402194653002002218700001902238700002302257700002302280773012502303856008102428852000902509655001202518IND60655603720221117205202.0190803e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065560372DNAL7 a225754212pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800120011522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHowe, Anna S10aAttitudes to food differ between adolescent dieters and non-dieters from Otago, New Zealand, but overall food intake does not  ap. 36-45.  aThere is increasing pressure for adolescents to be thin and this may not always be acted upon in healthy ways; for example, certain foods or food groups may be restricted or meals skipped. As foods are not eaten in isolation it is useful to examine dietary patterns and associated psychosocial factors to better understand eating behaviour. The aim of the present study was to identify correlates of ‘dieting’ in adolescents from Otago, New Zealand. A web-based survey was conducted in 2009, collecting information on food consumption and factors potentially associated with food consumption. Principal components analysis was used to investigate dietary patterns. Correlates were examined in 1329 students using multiple logistic regression analysis. Nineteen secondary schools in the province of Otago, New Zealand. Students from school years 9 and 10 (mean age 14·1 (sd 0·7) years). There was no relationship between dieting and dietary patterns. Those not dieting were 17 % (95 % CI 7, 26 %) more likely to eat lunch and 22 % (95 % CI 3, 37 %) more likely to eat an evening meal on one more weekday than those who were dieting. Those who reported dieting were more likely to report healthiness (OR = 2·18, 95 % CI 1·11, 4·26) as an important factor when choosing food and that eating fruit and vegetables makes you better looking. No sex by dieting interaction was found. In this cohort, while there was no difference in actual food consumption between dieters and non-dieters, there were significant differences in attitudes to food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aadolescents 3aattitudes and opinions 3adieting 3afood groups 3afruit consumption 3alunch 3aprincipal component analysis 3apsychosocial factors 3aregression analysis 3asecondary education 3astudents 3asurveys 3avegetables 3aNew Zealand 0aFood 0aNutrition knowledge 0aFood preference1 aMandic, Sandra1 aParnell, Winsome R1 aSkidmore, Paula ML0 tPublic health nutrition.g2013 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.36-45dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800120011523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245016500168300001600333520141500349592002801764650002101792650004401813650002201857650002901879650002601908650002501934650002101959650001301980650002301993650001502016650001902031650001802050650001402068650003702082650000902119653002902128653001702157653005302174653002302227653001902250700002402269700005602293700005302349700001602402700001802418700001902436773010602455856008702561852000902648655001202657IND60622976320221119015947.0210108e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062297632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.11.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mengxue10aHigh and long-term antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli via synergy between the antibiotic penicillin G and its carrier ZnAl layered double hydroxide  ap. 435-442.  aAntibiotic-resistant bacterial infections are a global health problem. A commonly-used antibiotic Penicillin G was incorporated into ZnAl-layered double hydroxides (PNG/LDH) with a varied amount of PNG. PNG/LDH nanocomposites were well characterized in structure and composition using elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction pattern, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and TEM images, revealing that PNG were mostly adsorbed on the LDH surfaces at a lower PNG loading but some were intercalated into LDH interlayers at a higher PNG loading. The typical release profile of PNG and Zn²⁺ from PNG/LDH was a quick release, followed by a sustainable slow release. The antibacterial tests against Escherichia coli demonstrated that PNG/LDH with a suitable composition synergistically improved bacterial inhibition compared with free PNG and pristine LDHs. In specific, PNG/LDH with much higher cost-effectiveness showed a potent antimicrobial activity and maintained the activity for up to 10 days, significantly elongating the antibacterial effect compared with just 1 day for free PNG in the same conditions. Our results suggest suitable composition of nanoparticle carriers and antibiotics could significantly enhance antibacterial activity of antibiotics for a long period via the synergistic effect between carrier and antibiotics, a potential approach to overcome the bacterial resistance to antibiotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacterial infections 3abenzylpenicillin 3acolloids 3acost effectiveness 3ahydroxides 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3asynergism 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc 0aLayered double hydroxide 0aPenicillin G 0aSynergistic and long-term antibacterial activity 0aControlled release 0aDissolved Zn2+1 aSultanbawa, Yasmina1 aXu, Zhi Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6070-50351 aGu, Wenyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3360-13901 aChen, Weiyu1 aLiu, Jianyong1 aQian, Guangren0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 174 p.435-442dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.11.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245017900185300001600364520121800380592002801598650001601626650001301642650001401655650001701669650002201686650002501708650001201733650002201745650001001767650004601777650002101823650003001844650001301874650001101887650001801898650006001916650001101976650000901987650002101996650003402017651001302051651001202064651001102076651001102087651001002098651001102108700001602119700001802135700002002153700001402173700001402187700001802201700001502219700001502234700000702249773010102256856005502357852000902412655001202421IND4491790420221118030610.0150209e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449179042DNAL7 a223090702pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00963.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNethe, A.10aExisting policies, regulation, legislation and ongoing health promotion activities related to physical activity and nutrition in pre‐primary education settings: an overview  ap. 118-128.  aObesity prevention efforts for school‐aged children and adolescents are increasing in number. However, little has been done to address the problem in the preschool age. To address this age group, an evidence‐based preschool programme on physical activity (PA) and nutrition is developed within the ToyBox project. Environmental influencing factors such as policies and competitive health promotion activities could inhibit or induce a successful health promotion programme. This paper describes an overview of existing policies, legislation and/or regulations and health promotion activities in the preschool setting. Method: data were gathered on policies and activities aiming to improve healthy eating and PA of young children (age group 4–6 years) in Belgium‐Flanders, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Poland and Spain. A limited number of influencing policies, regulations and/or legislation exists; agenda setting of health promotion and policy evaluations in all relevant policy areas was lacking. Also, health promotion activities in preschool the setting did not exist in all six European countries and high‐quality preschool‐based health interventions existed in three of the six ToyBox countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3achildren 3aeducation 3ahealthy diet 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 2aChild 2aChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aChild, Preschool 2aCross-Cultural Comparison 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aHealth Policy 2aHealth Promotionxlegislation & jurisprudencexmethods. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNutrition Policy 2aObesityxprevention & control 3aBulgaria 3aGermany 3aGreece 3aPoland 3aSpain 0aEurope1 aDorgelo, A.1 aKugelberg, S.1 aAssche, J. van,1 aBuijs, G.1 aYngve, A.1 ade Henauw, S.1 aBoskou, G.1 aManios, Y.1 a, 0 tObesity reviews.g2012 Mar., v. 13 Suppl s1 p.118-128dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-78817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00963.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03969naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002500188245014500213300001100358506007600369520214100445592002802586596007702614506003702691650002002728650001902748650002102767650002202788650001102810650001202821650001302833650002502846650001202871650002102883650002602904650001102930650001102941650001002952650002702962650001102989650002003000650001603020650001803036650001903054700003203073700003503105700003103140700003003171773011103201856008203312852000903394655001203403IND60590580420221207101530.0191016e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059058042DNAL7 a293048492pmid7 aPMC57564352pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-017-2560-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDantas, Edson Santos10aShould I stay or should I go? Movement of adult Triatoma sordida within the peridomestic area of a typical Brazilian Cerrado rural household  ap. 14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is an important neglected tropical illness caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which is primarily transmitted to humans by hematophagous insects of the subfamily Triatominae. Although knowledge on triatomine movement capabilities at the micro-geographical scale is of fundamental importance concerning the development of effective vector control strategies, it remains a poorly understood subject. Furthermore, survival rates and size estimates of natural populations are important topics to consider when evaluating transmission intensity. RESULTS: The movement of adult Triatoma sordida within the peridomestic area of a rural Brazilian household was evaluated via mark-release-recapture assays. A total of 210 insects had their pronota marked with fluorescent dyes and were released at different distances from the chicken coop (two, five, ten and 20 m), and from the horse corral (27, 32, 35, 46 and 56 m). Recaptures occurred in three consecutive 15-day intervals. Specimens were successfully recaptured at all distances up to 32 m. Bayesian models were used to estimate recapture probability, survival rates (males vs females) and population size. Although recapture probability was inversely proportional to distance for both sexes, females were more affected by increased distance. On the other hand, no significant difference was detected in the survival rates between males and females in a 15-day period. Fisher-Ford and Bayesian models gave more accurate population size estimates than Lincoln method. CONCLUSIONS: Triatoma sordida adults were able to cover a distance of 32 m in 45 days. Recapture data modelling reveals that male dispersal was more effective suggesting that T. sordida males are more likely to contribute as potential colonizers of the peridomestic environment. Increasing the distance between the peridomestic structures and the sylvatic environment as much as possible appears to be a simple and feasible recommendation to reduce the contact rate between humans and infected bugs and ultimately Chagas disease transmission.  aPublisher supplied data  a40-2012cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3aChagas disease 3aTriatoma sordida 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aadults 3acerrado 3achickens 3adisease transmission 3afemales 3afluorescent dyes 3ahematophagous insects 3ahorses 3ahumans 3amales 3amark-recapture studies 3amodels 3apopulation size 3aprobability 3asurvival rate 3avector control1 aGonçalves, Rodrigo Gurgel,1 aVillela, Daniel Antunes Maciel1 aMonteiro, Fernando Araújo1 aMaciel-de-Freitas, Rafael0 tParasites & vectors.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.14-14dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-017-2560-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245012400157300001800281500001900299520117400318592002801492650000801520650001901528650001001547650001201557650001301569650002101582653001201603653002801615653002601643653002101669653001801690700001801708700001401726700001401740700001801754700005601772700005601828773013901884856007802023852000902101655001202110IND60729851620221122200758.0210303e20201228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072985162DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c188462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Fei10aProgrammable Repurposing of Existing Drugs as Pharmaceutical Elements for the Construction of Aptamer–Drug Conjugates  ap. 9457-9463.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aConverting marketed drug molecules into phosphoramidites may present a potential strategy to facilitate the development of aptamer–drug conjugates (ApDCs) by a DNA synthesizer in a programmable way; however, quite limited methods were reported. Herein, we demonstrated a general approach by repurposing camptothecin (CPT) species. Commonly used inactive ingredients in pharmaceuticals are investigated and selected as a bonding moiety, from which 2-mercaptoethoxy ethanol and thioglycerol were efficiently incorporated with CPT to give the precursors. Cell viability and molecular docking results of the precursors supported that incorporation of the bonding moiety would not interrupt the inhibitory activity. Therefore, corresponding phosphoramidites were prepared as pharmaceutical elements, and a series of ApDCs were constructed automatically by solid-phase synthesis. Biological studies revealed that CPT elements could be specifically delivered to HCT116 cells by an aptamer and released inside cells. This kind of programmable repurposing may take advantage of established safety data and efficacy of existing drugs resulting in a faster development of ApDCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acell viability 3adrugs 3aethanol 3amoieties 3aoligonucleotides 0aaptamer 0apharmaceutical elements 0asolid-phase synthesis 0atargeted therapy 0adrug delivery1 aZhou, Jinming1 aSun, Yang1 aYang, Cai1 aZhang, Shiyan1 aWang, Ruowen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9131-18611 aTan, Weihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8066-15240 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Dec. 28, v. 13, no. 8 p.9457-9463dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c188463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245009600160300001800256500001500274520086700289592002801156650001901184650002001203650002601223650001801249650002301267650000801290650001301298653001401311700001601325700001401341700001901355700001201374773010101386856008101487852000901568655001201577IND60573564620221116222921.0170724e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057356462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-016-0440-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ying10aMechanical and X-band electromagnetic properties of vitrified bonded SiC composite ceramics  ap. 1461-1468.  a2019-12-06  aVitrified bonded SiC composite ceramics were prepared using a simple powder blending, forming, and sintering process. The effect of SiC particle size on the mechanical and dielectric properties of vitrified bonded SiC composite ceramics was investigated. Vitrified bonds wet and coat SiC particles during sintering and form continuous bonding networks upon cooling. The vitrified bonds render the ceramics high flexural strength and act as impedance mismatching modification layer between SiC particles and air. With varying SiC particle size, the microstructure, and properties of the vitrified bonded SiC composite ceramics change accordingly and at 7 μm, it reaches optimal microstructure, a highest flexural strength of 67.85 MPa and highest reflection loss. However, the dielectric loss of composite ceramics decreases as the SiC particle size increases.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicrostructure 3asilicon carbide 3adielectric properties 3aparticle size 3amodulus of rupture 3aair 3aceramics 0aimpedance1 aLi, Zhihong1 aYang, Tao1 aMeng, Qingcong1 aLi, Qie0 tJournal of materials science.g2017 Feb., v. 52, no. 3 p.1461-1468dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-016-0440-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245017800164520138500342592002801727650001801755650001401773650001301787650001901800650001101819650002601830650002901856650001101885650001801896650002101914650001301935650001701948650001301965650002901978650004402007650002102051651001102072700001802083700001802101700002002119700002102139700002102160773012002181856008002301852000902381655001202390IND60703163920221118012239.0200720e20200416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070316392DNAL7 a10.3390/insects110402512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ying-An 10aUsing UPLC–MS/MS to Evaluate the Dissemination of Pyriproxyfen by Aedes Mosquitoes to Combat Cryptic Larval Habitats after Source Reduction in Kaohsiung in Southern Taiwan  aThe policy regarding mosquito control strategies in Taiwan is based on integrated vector management (IVM). The major approach is source reduction via collaboration by both residents and governments. However, small and cryptic habitats of dengue vectors are hard to find and eliminate in urban communities. Therefore, this study evaluated a complementary approach that targeted cryptic habitats by utilizing mosquitoes themselves as vehicles to transfer an insect growth regulator, pyriproxyfen (PPF), to their breeding sites; the amount of PPF in breeding water was determined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS). A bioassay conducted by introducing ten late-instar larvae into PPF solution was performed to assess emergence inhibition (EI). PPF was found at 0.56 ± 0.04 ng in 25 mL of water by dissemination via ten Aedes aegypti mosquitoes exposed to 0.01% PPF, leading to 100% EI. After the community-level source reduction, a field trial in Kaohsiung in Southern Taiwan showed that 30.8–31.5% of cryptic ovitraps reached EI ≥ 50% one month after spraying 0.01% PPF in microhabitats favored by mosquitoes. IVM in parallel with residual spraying of PPF on resting surfaces of mosquitoes could serve as a simple and complementary approach to reduce cryptic larval sources in urban communities in Southern Taiwan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3abioassays 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3adengue 3afield experimentation 3ainsect growth regulators 3alarvae 3amicrohabitats 3amosquito control 3aovitraps 3apyriproxyfen 3aspraying 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aurban population 3aTaiwan1 aLai, Yi-Ting 1 aWu, Kuo-Chih 1 aYen, Tsai-Ying 1 aChen, Chia-Yang 1 aTsai, Kun-Hsien 0 tInsects.g2020 Apr. 16, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects110402513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245011300210300001600323520116800339592002801507650002301535650001501558650001101573650002601584650002201610650001601632650001101648650001301659650001601672650002501688650001501713651001201728653001401740653002201754653001001776653001101786653001401797653001401811700001601825773008701841856008501928852000902013655001202022IND60589690620221120215029.0190403e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058969062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2016.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillamizar, M.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6545-380712aA modelling framework to simulate river flow and pesticide loss via preferential flow at the catchment scale  ap. 120-130.  aA modelling framework with field-scale models including the preferential flow model MACRO was developed to simulate transport of six contrasting herbicides in a 650km2 catchment in eastern England. The catchment scale model SPIDER was also used for comparison. The catchment system was successfully simulated as the sum of multiple field-scale processes with little impact of in-stream processes on simulations. Preferential flow was predicted to be the main driver of pesticide transport in the catchment. A satisfactory simulation of the flow was achieved (Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiencies of 0.56 and 0.34 for MACRO and SPIDER, respectively) but differences between pesticide simulations were observed due to uncertainties in pesticide properties and application details. Uncertainty analyses were carried out to assess input parameters reported as sensitive including pesticide sorption, degradation and application dates; their impact on simulations was chemical-specific. The simulation of pesticide concentrations in the river during low flow periods was very sensitive to uncertainty from rain gauge measurements and the estimation of evapotranspiration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevapotranspiration 3aherbicides 3amodels 3apesticidal properties 3apreferential flow 3arain gauges 3arivers 3asorption 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 3awatersheds 3aEngland 0aPesticide 0aPreferential flow 0aMACRO 0aSPIDER 0aIn-stream 0aCatchment1 aBrown, C.D.0 tCatena.g2017 Feb., v. 149 p.120-130dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2016.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01512naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010000163300002000263520044100283592002800724650001900752650001900771650001700790650001300807650001300820700001300833700001700846700001700863700001500880700001600895700001500911700001700926773012400943856007401067852000901141655001201150IND60640485720221120024836.0190504e20160616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064048572DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra03371g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chi-chʻien,10aShort peptide mediated self-assembly of platinum nanocrystals with selective spreading property  ap. 58099-58105.  aSpherical assemblies with core/shell configurations are prepared through C-terminal amidated short peptide mediated self-association of platinum nanocrystals.

A field experiment compared yield and nutritive value of rhizoma peanut and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) in central Georgia on a Norfolk soil (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Typic Kandiudults). Crude protein (CP), neutral-detergent fiber (NDF), aciddetergent fiber (ADF), lignin, Ca, Mg, and P of total herbage, and dry matter (DM) yield and in vitro organic matter disappearance (IVOMD) of total herbage, leaf, and stem tissues were determined for three growing seasons. Annual DM yield of peanut and alfalfa averaged 7.6 and 11.8 Mg ha⁻¹, respectively. In the first 2 yr, alfalfa outyielded rhizoma peanut, but there was no difference in yield in the third year. Leaf DM yield was higher for peanut than for alfalfa in the third year. Rhizoma peanut DM production occurred predominately during late summer and early autumn vs. spring for alfalfa. Rhizoma peanut total herbage DM was lower in CP and higher in Ca and Mg than that of alfalfa, but IVOMD was similar. Leaf IVOMD was higher for alfalfa than for rhizoma peanut, but IVOMD of peanut stems was equal to or higher than alfalfa stems. Rhizoma peanut has potential for central Georgia and other areas of the southern USA with a similar climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop quality 3aforage crops 3ain vitro digestibility 3afiber content 3acalcium 3aMedicago sativa 3adry matter accumulation 3amagnesium 3anutritive value 3acrop yield 3atemperate zones 3acrude protein 3achemical constituents of plants 3alignin 3acoastal plains 3aArachis glabrata 3aphosphorus 3aGeorgia 0aforage 0aprotein content1 aGelaye, Seyoum1 aMahotiere, Sauveur1 aAmoah, Eugene A.1 aMiller, Schauston1 aGates, Roger N.1 aWindham, William R.0 tAgronomy journal.g1996 May, v. 88, no. 3 p.485-488dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1996.00021962008800030021x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01572naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008700156300002000243520062400263592002800887650001500915650001400930650002700944650001100971650001600982700001700998700001801015700001801033773012401051856007401175852000901249655001201258IND60640485820221121195103.0190504e20160329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064048582DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra03373c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Wuseok10aEnhanced sensitivity of quartz tuning fork sensors using electrospun polymer wires  ap. 31131-31134.  aA polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) nanowire was prepared by electrospinning and attached to the two prongs of a quartz tuning fork (QTF) to form a polymer bridge.

Assessment of synapse, the basic unit for a neuronal connection, is labor-intensive and time-consuming in conventional culture systems, due to the small size and the spatially random distribution. In the present study, we propose a novel ‘synapse compartmentalization’ culture system, in which synapses are concentrated at controlled locations. We fabricated a negative dot array pattern by coating the entire surface with poly-l-lysine (PLL) and subsequent microcontact printing of 1) substrates which mask positive charge of PLL (Fc, BSA and laminin), or 2) a chemorepulsive protein (Semaphorin 3F-Fc). By combination of physical and biological features of these repulsive substrates, functional synapses were robustly concentrated in the PLL-coated dots. This synapse compartmentalization chip can be combined with the various high-throughput assay formats based on the synaptic morphology and function. Therefore, this quantifiable and controllable dot array pattern by microcontact printing will be potential useful for bio-chip platforms for the high-density assays used in synapse-related neurobiological studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3alaminin 3aneurons 3asynapse 0aMicrocontact printing 0aSynapse compartmentalization 0aBioassay chip 0aNeuronal culture1 aJang, Min Jee1 aJo, Youhwa1 aJoo, Sunghoon1 aLee, Do Hoon1 aLee, Byung Yang1 aNam, Yoonkey1 aSun, Woong0 tBiomaterials.g2016 June, v. 92 p.46-56dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010700156300001800263500002000281520152000301592002801821650002201849650001301871650002201884650001301906650001901919650002201938650002501960650001401985650001101999650001502010650002102025650002502046700002802071700002902099773013202128856007302260852000902333655001202342IND60572093320221118064321.0170712e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057209332DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.51922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsghar, Anam10aIn situ production of hydrogen peroxide in a microbial fuel cell for recalcitrant wastewater treatment  ap. 1825-1840.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) offer a sustainable and energy efficient solution for in situ hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) production with simultaneous power generation. In MFCs, H₂O₂ is produced as a result of two‐electron oxygen reduction at graphite cathode surface. However, due to poor catalytic properties of graphite cathode high yields of H₂O₂ are not attained. Therefore, this study investigates the feasibility of in situ H₂O₂ production in MFC for recalcitrant wastewater treatment. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: In this study, a dual chamber MFC was used. A heat‐treated graphite electrode was used as cathode and Nafion‐117 as membrane. Cyclic voltammetric analysis was also performed to study the potential of heat‐treated graphite cathode for H₂O₂ production. Experimentally, a maximum of 140 mg L⁻¹ of H₂O₂ was produced with simultaneous power generation of 33.52 W m⁻³. Consequently, in situ Fenton oxidation experiments were performed and compared with conventional Fenton oxidation using a recalcitrant pollutant i.e. Acid Blue 113 dye. On average, 24% difference between the performance of the Fenton and in situ Fenton oxidation was observed while 42% reduction in the cost of process was obtained in the case of the in situ Fenton oxidation process. CONCLUSION: The current study proved that MFC is a sustainable solution for in situ Fenton oxidation (followed by H₂O₂ production) with less requirement of H₂O₂. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon electrodes 3acathodes 3aenergy efficiency 3agraphene 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apollutants 3apower generation 3awastewater treatment1 aRaman, Abdul Aziz Abdul1 aDaud, Wan Mohd Ashri Wan0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2017 July, v. 92, no. 7 p.1825-1840dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.51923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02030naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006100167300001600228520100200244592002801246650001501274650001101289650001001300650001401310650001201324650001801336650001901354650001301373650001301386650001001399700002501409700001801434700001801452773009601470856008101566852000901647655001201656IND50090630320221120111405.0150216e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009063032DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-013-9341-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHočevar, Marko10aFlowering estimation in apple orchards by image analysis  ap. 466-478.  aTree-specific management practice related to individual tree physiological condition is necessary for higher quality and quantity in apple fruit production.

The image acquisition was performed with a still camera and an industrial color camera during the day and night. The FC estimation algorithm included HSL thresholding with parameter optimization. Three hypothetical, tree-specific management practices (sprayings) were assumed, using >25, >50 and >100 FC thresholds to carry out the practice. When an industrial camera was used for image acquisition during the daytime and hypothetical spraying was done by on/off criterion >100 FC per tree, 10 % incorrect executions were identified.

In developing countries, solid fuels remain the main sources of energy. The purpose of this study aims to describe the distribution of household cooking fuel types and to analyze the factors influencing household cooking energy choice in Ouagadougou. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2017 in 3 neighborhoods of Ouagadougou. A total of 1734 household were randomly selected. We performed a multivariable logistic regression and a multinomial logistic regression to measure the relationship between selected determinants and households’ primary cooking fuel. 59.53% of the households of Ouagadougou reported using solid fuels as the main cooking fuel. Wood is the most common primary cooking fuel used (43.93%), followed by LPG (40.41%) and then charcoal (15.60%). About 84% combine at least 2 types of energy for cooking. Cooking fuel choice is strongly influenced by the socioeconomic status, the family size, and also by the woman’s educational attainment, her age and the main cooking fuel used in her parents’ house. Actions aimed at reducing the impact of solid fuel use in the environment or health must consider these factors.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject IDRC 107347cInternational Development Research Centre 3acharcoal 3across-sectional studies 3aenergy 3afamily size 3aindoor air pollution 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3asocioeconomic status 3awomen 3awood1 aKafando, Benoit1 aDramaix, Michèle1 aMeda, Nicolas1 aBouland, Catherine0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 May, v. 27, no. 15 p.18902-18910dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08427-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01854naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245012900158300001800287520079900305592002801104650003401132650001501166650003401181650001001215650002901225650001301254650001501267700001801282700001401300700001501314773010001329856007801429852000901507655001201516IND60519262820221121061623.0160424e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051926282DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2015011992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Hua10aDevelopments in high‐speed countercurrent chromatography and its applications in the separation of terpenoids and saponins  ap. 1574-1591.  aHigh‐speed countercurrent chromatography is a liquid–liquid separation chromatographic technique, which has the unique feature of eliminating irreversible adsorption using liquid support medium, and is widely used in research and development of traditional Chinese medicine, biochemistry, food, environment analysis, and so on.

In fungi, TCS signaling routes, that mediate perception of stimuli, correspond to a multi-step phosphorelay between three protein families including hybrid histidine kinases (HHK), histidine phosphotransfer proteins (HPt) and response regulators (RR). The best known of these fungal transduction pathways remains the Sln1(HHK)–Ypd1(HPt)–Ssk1(RR) system that governs the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway for osmo-adaptation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although recent advances have provided a preliminary overview of the distribution of TCS proteins in the kingdom Fungi, underlying mechanisms that drive the remarkable diversity among HHKs and other TCS proteins in different fungal lineages remain unclear. More precisely, evolutionary paths that led to the appearance, transfer, duplication, and loss of the corresponding TCS genes in fungi have never been hitherto addressed. In the present study, we were particularly interested in studying the distribution of TCS modules across the so-called “budding yeasts clade” (Saccharomycotina) by interrogating the genome of 82 species. With the exception of the emergence of an additional RR (named Srr1) in the fungal CTG clade, TCS proteins Ypd1 (HPt), Ssk1 (RR), Skn7 (RR), and Rim15 (RR) are well conserved within the Saccharomycotina. Surprisingly, some species from the basal lineages, especially Lipomyces starkeyi, harbor several filamentous-type HHKs that appear as relict genes that have been likely retained from a common ancestor of Saccharomycotina. Overall, this analysis revealed a progressive diminution of the initial pool of HHK-encoding genes during Saccharomycotina yeast evolution.  aPublisher supplied data  aSEV-2016-0644cMINECO  aAGL2011-55971-RcSpanish National Research Plan 3aLipomyces starkeyi 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aevolution 3agenes 3aglycerol 3ahistidine kinase 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3ayeasts1 aLavín, José L.1 ade Bernonville, Thomas Dugé1 aVandeputte, Patrick1 aBouchara, Jean-Philippe1 aGastebois, Amandine1 aOguiza, José A.1 aPapon, Nicolas0 tCurrent genetics.g2018 Aug., v. 64, no. 4 p.841-851dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl32278x0172-80837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00294-017-0797-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245009900211300001800310506007600328520107900404592002801483506003701511650002101548650002001569650001001589650002601599650001501625650003001640700002601670700002001696700001501716700003001731700002001761700001701781700002501798700001501823700002001838700002001858773017301878856007902051852000902130655001202139IND60230313120221207131540.0150614e20140225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023031312DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13183761112doi7 aPMC39398702pmcid7 a245201772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDamrauer, Jeffrey S.10aIntrinsic subtypes of high-grade bladder cancer reflect the hallmarks of breast cancer biology  ap. 3110-3115.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe sought to define whether there are intrinsic molecular subtypes of high-grade bladder cancer. Consensus clustering performed on gene expression data from a meta-dataset of high-grade, muscle-invasive bladder tumors identified two intrinsic, molecular subsets of high-grade bladder cancer, termed “luminal” and “basal-like,” which have characteristics of different stages of urothelial differentiation, reflect the luminal and basal-like molecular subtypes of breast cancer, and have clinically meaningful differences in outcome. A gene set predictor, bladder cancer analysis of subtypes by gene expression (BASE47) was defined by prediction analysis of microarrays (PAM) and accurately classifies the subtypes. Our data demonstrate that there are at least two molecularly and clinically distinct subtypes of high-grade bladder cancer and validate the BASE47 as a subtype predictor. Future studies exploring the predictive value of the BASE47 subtypes for standard of care bladder cancer therapies, as well as novel subtype-specific therapies, will be of interest.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreast neoplasms 3agene expression 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3aprediction 3aurinary bladder neoplasms1 aHoadley, Katherine A.1 aChism, David D.1 aFan, Cheng1 aTiganelli, Christopher J.1 aWobker, Sara E.1 aYeh, Jen Jen1 aMilowsky, Matthew I.1 aIyer, Gopa1 aParker, Joel S.1 aKim, William Y.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Feb. 25, v. 111, no. 8 p.3110-3115dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13183761113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245015300164300001600317520156300333592002801896650001201924650000801936650001601944650001601960650001601976650001001992650001602002650001502018650001902033650001402052650001302066650001602079650000702095650001302102650001402115650001302129650001402142650001802156650002002174651001102194700002002205700002102225700002102246773008802267856004802355852000902403655001202412IND4520847120221119214126.0151109e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452084712DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617120501412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaralov, A.

The cells were gram-negative, nonmotile, pleomorphic ovoids, 1.0â1.5 Ã 1.5â2.5 Î¼m. The isolates were chemoorganotrophic, obligately aerobic, and catalase-positive. A range of carbohydrates and organic acids was used, as well as amino acids and peptides. The strains were halophiles and thermotolerant neutrophiles. They grew in the media with 15 to 30% NaCl (optimum at 20â22%) and 0.005â0.7 M Mg2+ (0.1â0.2 M), at pH 5.0â8.2 (optimum 7.0â7.2) and 25â55Â°C (optimum at 35â50Â°C). The major fatty acids were C16:0, C18:1, C18:0, and C16:1. The membranes contained carotenoid pigments of the bacterioruberin series and polar lipids, mostly as C20,C20 isoprenoid derivates: phosphatidylglyceromethylphosphate, phosphatidylglycerol, and three unidentified sulfated glycolipids of the S-DGD type. The DNA G+C content was 65.1â66.4 mol %. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the thermotolerant neutrophilic isolate RS94 (DNA G+C content of 66.4 mol %) was most closely related to the nonpigmented moderate acidophile Halarchaeum acidiphilum MH1-52-1T (97.3%). Based on its phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, the organism was classified as a new species of the genus Halarchaeum with the proposed name Halarchaeum solikamskense sp. nov. The type strain is RS94T (= VKPM B-11282T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aDNA 3aamino acids 3acarotenoids 3afatty acids 3agenes 3aglycolipids 3ahalophiles 3aheat tolerance 3amagnesium 3aminerals 3anew species 3apH 3apeptides 3aphylogeny 3apigments 3apotassium 3aribosomal RNA 3asodium chloride 3aRussia1 aBaslerov, R.

Despite advances in the production process, a notable drawback still exists due to high production cost. The aim of this work is to provide a production strategy for cost reduction. The suggested process may be adapted to other polymers, useable by a wide audience in biopolymer research. RESULTS: Dual production of two commercially important biopolymers, P(3HB) and γ‐PGA, in a single batch from cheap substrates was studied, as proof of concept, for feasible low cost dual biopolymer production. Dual production from a single batch yielded 1 g L⁻¹ P(3HB) and 0.4 g L⁻¹ γ‐PGA using Bacillus subtilis OK2 (B. subtilis OK2). When orange peel was substituted as a cheap carbon source for dual production, coupled pH and dissolved oxygen control proved to be essential to overcome the inhibition imposed by the non‐sugar components of the substrate. Cell lysis and release of P(3HB) granules in the dual production medium can be exploited of as a new approach for separation of this polymer. CONCLUSION: This proof of concept study provides a new approach from upstream to downstream processing for low cost production of dual biopolymers. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3abiopolymers 3acarbon 3acost effectiveness 3adissolved oxygen 3agranules 3aorange peels 3apH 3apolyglutamic acid1 aRoy, Ipsita1 aKeshavarz, Tajalli0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2017 July, v. 92, no. 7 p.1548-1557dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.52593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245018400161300001800345520098000363592002801343650003401371650001701405650002501422650001701447650002501464650002401489650001301513650002001526650001101546650001201557650001301569650001801582650002201600650002001622650001501642650002101657650002401678650001701702650002501719650001101744650001601755653001801771653002701789653001201816653002501828653002001853700001501873700001301888700001201901700001401913700001401927700005801941773014801999856008002147852000902227655001202236IND60608707220221116200618.0180808e20180716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060870722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b026472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Meilin10aResponses of Fresh-Cut Strawberries to Ethanol Vapor Pretreatment: Improved Quality Maintenance and Associated Antioxidant Metabolism in Gene Expression and Enzyme Activity Levels  ap. 8382-8390.  aStrawberries were treated with different concentrations of ethanol vapor and then cut into four wedges and stored at 4 °C for 1 week. It was found that 4 mL/kg of ethanol was the optimal concentration to reduce the decrease of firmness and weight loss. Total phenolics content, total flavonoid and anthocyanin contents, antioxidant enzyme activities, and gene expression related to the antioxidant were elevated using the ethanol treatment. Ethanol vapor also suppressed microbial growth and promoted free radical (hydroxyl and DPPH) scavenging capacities and four kinds of esters and bioactive components in strawberry wedges.

M.10aInvestigating Missing Sources of Sulfur at Fairbanks, Alaska  ap. 9332-9338.  aWe investigated disparities in elemental sulfur and inorganic sulfate concentrations in ambient fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) data from 2005 to 2012 at a monitoring station in Fairbanks, AK. In approximately 28% of the observations from 2005 to 2012, elemental sulfur by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy significantly exceeded the inorganic sulfur by ion chromatography (IC), suggesting the presence of a significant quantity of unmeasured sulfur compounds. The mean ratio of sulfur by XRF to that by IC for only these cases was 1.22 ± 0.11. The largest discrepancies between elemental sulfur and sulfate were most frequently observed in the summer, although discrepancies were observed year round. Assuming the additional sulfur (other than inorganic sulfate) as the upper limit estimate, this work shows that organosulfur species (or the additional sulfur) account for 1.29% of organic carbon (OC) and 0.75% of PM₂.₅ in Fairbanks. An analysis of all available air quality system (AQS) data suggests that these recurring phenomena are linked to seasons, total carbon, inorganic nitrate, and elemental sources during cold periods and ozone during warm periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aair quality 3acarbon 3aion exchange chromatography 3amonitoring 3anitrates 3aozone 3aparticulates 3aspectroscopy 3asulfates 3asulfur 3asummer 3aAlaska1 aPeltier, Richard E.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 Aug. 20, v. 47, no. 16 p.9332-9338dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes402020b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03898naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100001700186245015500203300001200358506007600370520200200446592002802448506003702476650002902513650002902542650001202571650001302583650001202596650001602608650001602624650001602640650002502656650001202681650002302693650001702716650001002733650002302743650001202766650001702778650001102795650002102806650001602827650001202843650001102855650001102866700001602877700002102893700002102914700002202935700003502957700002202992700002003014700002103034700001703055773010003072856007903172852000903251655001203260IND50068346420221207113501.0150208e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006834642DNAL7 a238900732pmid7 aPMC37294972pmcid7 a10.1186/1754-6834-6-1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Mingjie10aPhenotypic selection of a wild Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain for simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation of AFEX™ pretreated corn stover  ap. 332.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) process involves enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated lignocellulosic biomass and fermentation of glucose and xylose in one bioreactor. The optimal temperatures for enzymatic hydrolysis are higher than the standard fermentation temperature of ethanologenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, degradation products resulting from biomass pretreatment impair fermentation of sugars, especially xylose, and can synergize with high temperature stress. One approach to resolve both concerns is to utilize a strain background with innate tolerance to both elevated temperatures and degradation products. RESULTS: In this study, we screened a panel of 108 wild and domesticated Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains isolated from a wide range of environmental niches. One wild strain was selected based on its growth tolerance to simultaneous elevated temperature and AFEX™ (Ammonia Fiber Expansion) degradation products. After engineering the strain with two copies of the Scheffersomyces stipitis xylose reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase and xylulokinase genes, we compared the ability of this engineered strain to the benchmark 424A(LNH-ST) strain in ethanol production and xylose fermentation in standard lab medium and AFEX pretreated corn stover (ACS) hydrolysates, as well as in SSCF of ACS at different temperatures. In SSCF of 9% (w/w) glucan loading ACS at 35°C, the engineered strain showed higher cell viabilities and produced a similar amount of ethanol (51.3 g/L) compared to the benchmark 424A(LNH-ST) strain. CONCLUSION: These results validate our approach in the selection of wild Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with thermo-tolerance and degradation products tolerance properties for lignocellulosic biofuel production. The wild and domesticated yeast strains phenotyped in this work are publically available for others to use as genetic backgrounds for fermentation of their pretreated biomass at elevated temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aScheffersomyces stipitis 3aammonia 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acorn stover 3aengineering 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3agenes 3agenetic background 3aglucose 3ahydrolysates 3aniches 3asaccharification 3atemperature 3axylitol 3axylose 3ayeasts1 aSarks, Cory1 aGunawan, Christa1 aBice, Benjamin D1 aSimonett, Shane P1 aAvanasi Narasimhan, Ragothaman1 aWillis, Laura B.,1 aDale, Bruce E.,1 aBalan, Venkatesh1 aSato, Trey K0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2013 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.332-332dSpringer-Verlagx1754-68347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1754-6834-6-1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011900160300002000279520121100299592002801510596009801538596010201636596010401738650001501842650001101857650001301868650002401881650001901905653002101924653002201945653002001967653002001987700001602007700001702023700001502040700001802055700001202073700001602085700005802101700005802159773014202217856007902359852000902438655001202447IND60776316120221117110148.0220505e20220420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077631612DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c013582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Kunkun10aEngineering Phase Stability of Semimetallic MoS₂ Monolayers for Sustainable Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Production  ap. 19847-19856.  a1T′-phase MoS₂ possesses excellent electrocatalytic performance, but due to the instability of the thermodynamic metastable phase, its actual electrocatalytic effect is seriously limited. Here, we report a wet-chemical synthesis strategy for constructing rGO/1T′-MoS₂/CeO₂ heterostructures to improve the phase stability of metastable 1T′ phase MoS₂ monolayers. Importantly, the rGO/1T′-MoS₂/CeO₂ heterostructure exhibits excellent electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, which is much better than the 1T′-MoS₂ monolayers. The synergistic effects between CeO₂ nanoparticles (NPs) and 1T′-MoS₂ monolayers were systematically investigated. 1T′-MoS₂ monolayers combined with the cocatalyst of CeO₂ NPs can produce lattice strain and distortion on 1T′-MoS₂ monolayers, which can tune the energy band structure, charge transfer, and energy barriers of hydrogen atom adsorption (ΔEH), leading to promotion of the phase activity and stability of 1T′-MoS₂ monolayers for hydrogen production. Our work offers a feasible method for the preparation of efficient HER electrocatalysts based on the engineering phase stability of metastable materials.  aPublisher supplied data  a52102306cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2021JQ-095cNatural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007128  aG2020KY0535cCentral University Basic Research Fund of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018594 3aadsorption 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3athermodynamics 0a1T′ phase MoS2 0aCeO2 nanoparticle 0aheterostructure 0aphase stability1 aQu, Xiaoyan1 aGao, Dongwei1 aLi, Binjie1 aYuan, Yanling1 aLiu, Qi1 aLi, Xinghua1 aChong, Shaokun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1931-17791 aLiu, Zhengqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3153-61290 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Apr. 20, v. 14, no. 17 p.19847-19856dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c013583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245008600205300001800291506007600309520153300385592002801918506003701946650002401983650001802007650001002025650001502035650001102050650001102061650001102072650001602083650001202099651001102111651001802122651001402140653002802154653002802182653002002210700003202230700002002262700002102282700002202303700001902325700001802344773017302362856007902535852000902614655001202623IND60230313420221207131551.0150614e20140225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023031342DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13186781112doi7 aPMC39398612pmcid7 a245161222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKistler, Logan10aTransoceanic drift and the domestication of African bottle gourds in the Americas  ap. 2937-2941.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) was one of the first domesticated plants, and the only one with a global distribution during pre-Columbian times. Although native to Africa, bottle gourd was in use by humans in east Asia, possibly as early as 11,000 y ago (BP) and in the Americas by 10,000 BP. Despite its utilitarian importance to diverse human populations, it remains unresolved how the bottle gourd came to be so widely distributed, and in particular how and when it arrived in the New World. A previous study using ancient DNA concluded that Paleoindians transported already domesticated gourds to the Americas from Asia when colonizing the New World [Erickson et al. (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102(51):18315–18320]. However, this scenario requires the propagation of tropical-adapted bottle gourds across the Arctic. Here, we isolate 86,000 base pairs of plastid DNA from a geographically broad sample of archaeological and living bottle gourds. In contrast to the earlier results, we find that all pre-Columbian bottle gourds are most closely related to African gourds, not Asian gourds. Ocean-current drift modeling shows that wild African gourds could have simply floated across the Atlantic during the Late Pleistocene. Once they arrived in the New World, naturalized gourd populations likely became established in the Neotropics via dispersal by megafaunal mammals. These wild populations were domesticated in several distinct New World locales, most likely near established centers of food crop domestication.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLagenaria siceraria 3adomestication 3afauna 3afood crops 3agourds 3ahumans 3amodels 3aplastid DNA 3atropics 3aAfrica 3aArctic region 3aEast Asia 0along-distance dispersal 0aNew World domestication 0aarchaeogenomics1 aMontenegro García, Alvaro,1 aSmith, Bruce D.1 aGifford, John A.1 aGreen, Richard E.1 aNewsom, Lee A.1 aShapiro, Beth0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Feb. 25, v. 111, no. 8 p.2937-2941dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13186781113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245018700164300001800351520123500369592002801604650002201632650003401654650001001688650002101698650002301719650002201742650002401764650003001788650002101818650002201839650001601861650001701877650001501894650000901909650001401918650002901932650004401961651000902005653001602014653002602030653007302056653004302129700001502172700005202187700005702239700001502296700001802311773014802329856008002477852000902557655001202566IND60608707320221116200854.0180808e20180709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060870732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b027532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Guifang10aTargeted Screening Approach to Systematically Identify the Absorbed Effect Substances of Poria cocosin Vivo Using Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry  ap. 8319-8327.  aPoria cocos are extensively used as nutritious food, dietary supplements, and oriental medicine in Asia. However, the effect substances are still not very clear. In this study, a targeted screening approach was developed to systematically identify absorbed constituents of Poria cocos in vivo using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry combined with UNIFI software. First, incubation reactions in vitro with rat intestinal microflora and rat liver microsomes were conducted to sum up metabolic rules of main constituents. Second, the absorbed constituents in vivo were picked out and identified based on the results of metabolic study in vitro. Finally, the absorbed active constituents in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease were screened by targeted network pharmacology analysis. A total of 62 absorbed prototypes and 59 metabolites were identified and characterized in dosed plasma. Thirty potential active constituents were screened, and 86 drug-targets shared by absorbed constituents and Alzheimer’s disease were discovered by targeted network pharmacology analysis. In general, this proposed targeted strategy comprehensively provides new insight for active ingredients of Poria cocos.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aPoria 3aWolfiporia cocos 3aactive ingredients 3acomputer software 3adietary supplements 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aliver microsomes 3ametabolic studies 3ametabolites 3apharmacology 3aprototypes 3arats 3ascreening 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aAsia 0aPoria cocos 0aabsorbed constituents 0aultrahigh performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 0atargeted network pharmacology analysis1 aLi, Shizhe1 aLiu, Shu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8848-68711 aSong, Fengrui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7338-81391 aPi, Zifeng1 aLiu, Zhiqiang0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 July 09, v. 66, no. 31 p.8319-8327dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b027533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008900168300001400257520199800271592002802269650001502297650001702312650001802329650002602347650001602373650002402389700001402413700001302427700001802440700001702458700001602475700002202491700001602513700001502529773007602544856008402620852000902704655001202713IND60096405520221119072916.0141104e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009640552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2012.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZsély, I.Gy.10aDetermination of rate parameters of cyclohexane and 1-hexene decomposition reactions  ap. 85-93.  aPeukert et al. recently published (Int.

The optimization resulted in the following Arrhenius parameters: R1: A = 2.441 × 10¹⁹, E/R = 52,820; R2: A = 3.539 × 10¹⁸, E/R = 42,499; R4: A = 8.563 × 10¹⁹, n = −3.665, E/R = 13,825 (high pressure limit); R4: A = 7.676 × 10³¹n = −3.120, E/R = 40,323 (low pressure limit); R5: A = 3.600 × 10¹², E/R = 10699; R6: A = 1.248 × 10¹⁷, E/R = 28,538; R8: A = 6212 × 10¹³, E/R = −970. The rate parameters above are in cm³, mol, s, and K units. Data analysis resulted in the covariance matrix of all these parameters. The standard deviations of the rate coefficients were converted to temperature dependent uncertainty parameter f(T). These uncertainty parameters were typically f = 0.1 for reaction R1, f = 0.1–0.3 for reaction R2, below 0.5 for reaction R8 in the temperature range of 1250–1380 K, and above 1 for reactions R4–R6.  aPublisher supplied data 3acovariance 3acyclohexanes 3afree radicals 3aparameter uncertainty 3atemperature 3athermal degradation1 aVarga, T.1 aNagy, T.1 aCserháti, M.1 aTurányi, T.1 aPeukert, S.1 aBraun-Unkhoff, M.1 aNaumann, C.1 aRiedel, U.0 tEnergy.g2012 July, v. 43, no. 1 p.85-93dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2012.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012800175300001800303520075900321592002801080650002601108650001801134650003101152650001901183650001401202650001101216650001501227650001401242650001101256650001001267650001501277653001701292653001801309653002101327653003101348700002301379700001701402700002801419700002701447773010501474856008401579852000901663655001201672IND60122238620221120071000.0150325e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012223862DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2013.8310952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerrilli, Anna Maria10aNocellaralactone, a new monoterpenoid with anti-inflammatory activity, from Olea europaea L., cultivar Nocellara del Belice  ap. 2311-2319.  aNocellara del Belice, a cultivated variety (cultivar) of olive tree (Olea europæa L.), was examined with respect to the medium-polar compounds present in the wastewaters of olive oil extraction at the end of 2007.

We developed and optimized a type‐J counter‐current chromatography system with a novel tri‐rotor spiral coil column for the rapid separation of polysaccharides. The optimal composition of an aqueous PEG1000/K₂HPO₄/KH₂PO₄ system was found to be 14:16:14 w/w/w where the lower phase was the mobile phase. Optimal performance was achieved at a column rotational speed, temperature, and flow rate of 1200 rpm, 45°C, and 3.0 mL/min, respectively. The mobile phase was pumped from the inner terminal in a ‘‘head‐to‐tail’’ elution mode. Polysaccharide LCP‐1 (10.7 mg) was successfully obtained in high purity in one step from 50.0 mg of a crude polysaccharide extracted from the lychee fruit (Litchi chinensis) within 100 min. LCP‐1 possess a number‐average molecular weight and weight‐average molecular weight of 1.05 × 10⁵ and 1.59 × 10⁵ kDa, respectively. The monosaccharide composition consists of the molar ratio of glucose, galactose, and arabinose of 1.3:3.5:1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitchi chinensis 3aarabinose 3acountercurrent chromatography 3agalactose 3aglucose 3alitchis 3amolecular weight 3apolysaccharides 3atemperature1 aWu, Tao0 tJournal of separation science.g2016 Apr., v. 39, no. 8 p.1404-1410dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2015014023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01583naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014800158300001600306520034200322592002800664650002700692650002300719650001000742650000900752650001900761650001300780650001800793650001300811650001700824650001100841700001900852700001800871700001700889700001800906700001900924700001700943773013000960856007401090852000901164655001201173IND60659737120221119110246.0190823e20130102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065973712DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc37702k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Po-Jung12aA novel multifunctional nano-platform with enhanced anti-cancer and photoacoustic imaging modalities using gold-nanorod-filled silica nanobeads  ap. 892-894.  aThe novel nano-seaurchin structure is characteristic of high-density and well-dispersed gold nanorods in one mesoporous silica nanobead.

Only 15 min electrolysis was needed for total tylosin degradation using a carbon felt cathode and a platinum anode; while 6 h electrolysis was needed to achieve high oxidation and mineralization yields, 96 and 88 % respectively. Biodegradability improvement was shown since BOD₅/COD increased from 0 initially to 0.6 after 6 h electrolysis (for 100 mg L⁻¹initial TYL). With the aim of combining electro-Fenton with a biological treatment, an oxidation time in the range 2 to 4 h has been however considered. Results of AOS (average oxidation state) and COD/TOC suggested that the pretreatment could be stopped after 2 h rather than 4 h; while in the same time, the increase of biodegradability between 2 and 4 h suggested that this latter duration seemed more appropriate. In order to conclude, biological cultures have been therefore carried out for various electrolysis times. TYL solutions electrolyzed during 2 and 4 h were then treated with activated sludge during 25 days, showing 57 and 67 % total organic carbon (TOC) removal, respectively, namely 77 and 88 % overall TOC removal if both processes were considered. Activated sludge cultures appeared, therefore, in agreement with the assessment made from the analysis of physico-chemical parameters (AOS and COD/TOC), since the gain in terms of mineralization expected from increasing electrolysis duration appeared too low to balance the additional energy consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3abiodegradability 3abiological treatment 3acarbon 3achemical oxygen demand 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy 3amineralization 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aplatinum 3atylosin1 aFourcade, Florence1 aSoutrel, Isabelle1 aAït-Amar, Hamid1 aDjelal, Hayet1 aAmrane, Abdeltif0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 July, v. 21, no. 14 p.8534-8542dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-2771-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03719naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005900144245011900203300002000322520186700342592002802209596010302237596009902340650001102439650003002450650002602480650001302506650000902519650001102528653003802539653001502577653001302592653002002605653002802625700002902653700001502682700005802697700005502755700001802810700001802828700002102846700002202867700006302889700004302952773014202995856007903137852000903216655001203225IND60776316420221117110355.0220505e20220422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077631642DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c015082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDwivedi, Neeraj1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1232-438X10aUnusual High Hardness and Load-Dependent Mechanical Characteristics of Hydrogenated Carbon–Nitrogen Hybrid Films  ap. 20220-20229.  aMechanical components are exposed to a rigorous environment in a number of applications including engineering, aerospace, and automobiles. Thus, their service lifetime and reliability are always on the verge of risk. Protective coatings with high hardness are required to enhance their service lifetime and minimize the replacement cost and waste burden. Hydrogenated amorphous carbon including nitrogen-incorporated films, that are commonly deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, are widely used for commercial protective coating applications. However, their mechanical hardness still falls into the moderate hard regime. This needs to be substantially enhanced for advanced applications. Here, we report the synthesis of very hard nanostructured hydrogenated carbon–nitrogen hybrid (n-C:H:N) films. The optimized n-C:H:N film displays a hardness of about 36 GPa, elastic modulus of 360 GPa, and reasonably good elastic recovery (ER) of 62.7%. The mechanical properties of n-C:H:N films are further tailored when nitrogen pressure is tuned during the growth. The realized remarkably improved mechanical properties are correlated with the films’ structural properties and experimental growth conditions. We also conducted density functional theory calculations that show the trend for the elastic modulus of the amorphous carbon films with varying nitrogen concentrations matches well with experimentally measured values. Finally, we probed load-dependent mechanical properties of n-C:H:N films and found an anomalous behavior; some of the mechanical parameters, for instance, ER, reveal an irregular trend with indentation load, which we explain in the framework of the film–substrate composite concept. Overall, this work uncovers many unknown and exciting mechanical phenomena that could pave the way for new technological developments.  aPublisher supplied data  aMLPc, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Indiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001412  aSRG/2021/000105cScience and Engineering Research Boarddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001843 3acarbon 3adensity functional theory 3amodulus of elasticity 3anitrogen 3arisk 3avapors 0acarbon−nitrogen hybrid material 0athin films 0ahardness 0aelastic modulus 0amechanical applications1 aBalasubramanian, Karthik1 aSahu, Riya1 aManna, Sukriti1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3193-78031 aBanik, Suvo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7239-88531 aDhand, Chetna1 aKumar, Rajeev1 aHashmi, S.

In this study, a series of λ-cyhalothrin (LC)-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) were produced by flash nanoprecipitation (FNP), and the parameters that influence nanoparticle size were systematically studied. The narrowly distributed and size-controllable NPs formed stable suspensions in aqueous solution without organic solvents. The amphiphilic block polymer PEG-PDLLA played an important role as a drug carrier, and the encapsulation content was as high as 99%. The obtained NPs with high loading of LC exhibited toxicity comparable to those of two commercial formulations at low doses. This confirms that FNP technology is a promising and scalable method for agrochemical delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagrochemicals 3aaqueous solutions 3adrug carriers 3aencapsulation 3alambda-cyhalothrin 3ananoparticles 3apesticide formulations 3apolymers 3asolvents 3atoxicity 0aflash nanoprecipitation 0ananosuspension 0aλ-cyhalothrin 0ablock polymer1 aFu, Zhinan1 aWang, Mingwei1 aLv, Yin1 aWang, Chunxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3692-45581 aShen, Yue1 aWang, Yan1 aCui, Haixin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1274-19871 aGuo, Xuhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1792-85640 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 July 17, v. 66, no. 31 p.8246-8252dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b028513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002700156245008200183300001400265520131800279592002801597650002101625650001101646650002801657650002501685650001801710650002501728650001701753650001101770650001401781653001701795653002701812653002001839653002301859653002001882700002101902700001701923700001901940700001901959700001901978700002101997700002502018700001902043700002102062773009002083856009002173852000902263655001202272IND60606787620221118002847.0180730e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060678762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.03.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSciancalepore, Anna G.10aMicropatterning control of tubular commitment in human adult renal stem cells  ap. 57-69.  aThe treatment of renal injury by autologous, patient-specific adult stem cells is still an unmet need. Unsolved issues remain the spatial integration of stem cells into damaged areas of the organ, the commitment in the required cell type and the development of improved bioengineered devices. In this respect, biomaterials and architectures have to be specialized to control stem cell differentiation. Here, we perform an extensive study on micropatterned extracellular matrix proteins, which constitute a simple and non-invasive approach to drive the differentiation of adult renal progenitor/stem cells (ARPCs) from human donors. ARPCs are interfaced with fibronectin (FN) micropatterns, in the absence of exogenous chemicals or cellular reprogramming. We obtain the differentiation towards tubular cells of ARPCs cultured in basal medium conditions, the tubular commitment thus being specifically induced by micropatterned substrates. We characterize the stability of the tubular differentiation as well as the induction of a polarized phenotype in micropatterned ARPCs. Thus, the developed cues, driving the functional commitment of ARPCs, offer a route to recreate the microenvironment of the stem cell niche in vitro, that may serve, in perspective, for the development of ARPC-based bioengineered devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadult stem cells 3aadults 3abiocompatible materials 3acell differentiation 3aculture media 3aextracellular matrix 3afibronectins 3ahumans 3aphenotype 0aHuman kidney 0aAdult renal stem cells 0aDifferentiation 0aTubular commitment 0aMicropatterning1 aPortone, Alberto1 aMoffa, Maria1 aPersano, Luana1 aDe Luca, Maria1 aPaiano, Aurora1 aSallustio, Fabio1 aSchena, Francesco P.1 aBucci, Cecilia1 aPisignano, Dario0 tBiomaterials.g2016 July, v. 94 p.57-69dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.03.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03181naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245012400164300002000288520153300308592002801841596009601869650002201965650003701987650002802024650001902052650001502071650001702086650001102103650001202114650002102126650001602147650001602163653003102179653001902210653004802229653001802277653001802295700005902313700006302372700005802435773014202493856007902635852000902714655001202723IND60776316520221117110421.0220505e20220421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077631652DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c015502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shaoning10aIn Situ Orthorhombic to Amorphous Phase Transition of Nb₂O₅ and Its Temperature Effect on Pseudocapacitive Behavior  ap. 19426-19436.  aNiobium pentoxide (Nb₂O₅) represents an exquisite class of negative electrode materials with unique pseudocapacitive kinetics that engender superior power and energy densities for advanced electrical energy storage devices. Practical energy devices are expected to maintain stable performance under real-world conditions such as temperature fluctuations. However, the intercalation pseudocapacitive behavior of Nb₂O₅ at elevated temperatures remains unexplored because of the scarcity of suitable electrolytes. Thus, in this study, we investigate the effect of temperature on the pseudocapacitive behavior of submicron-sized Nb₂O₅ in a wide potential window of 0.01–2.3 V. Furthermore, ex situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal the amorphization of Nb₂O₅ accompanied by the formation of NbO via a conversion reaction during the initial cycle. Subsequent cycles yield enhanced performance attributed to a series of reversible Nbⱽ, ᴵⱽ/Nbᴵᴵᴵ redox reactions in the amorphous LiₓNb₂O₅ phase. Through cyclic voltammetry and symmetric cell electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, temperature elevation is noted to increase the pseudocapacitive contribution of the Nb₂O₅ electrode, resulting in a high rate capability of 131 mAh g–¹ at 20,000 mA g–¹ at 90 °C. The electrode further exhibits long-term cycling over 2000 cycles and high Coulombic efficiency ascribed to the formation of a robust, [FSA]⁻-originated solid-electrolyte interphase during cycling.  aPublisher supplied data  a19H02811cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectric power 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aniobium 3aphase transition 3atemperature 3avoltammetry 0apseudocapacitive materials 0aniobium oxides 0alithium storage mechanism rate capabilities 0aionic liquids 0aamorphization1 aHwang, Jinkwang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4800-31581 aMatsumoto, Kazuhiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0770-92101 aHagiwara, Rika1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7234-39800 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Apr. 21, v. 14, no. 17 p.19426-19436dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c015503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04155naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245018400204300001400388520248600402592002802888650001502916650001602931650000902947650001502956650001202971650001502983650002202998650001303020650001503033650001403048650001503062650001903077650001803096650002003114650001803134650001503152650001803167650000903185650001703194651001003211653003803221653001703259653002203276653002003298653002403318700002003342700001603362700001803378700001403396773008503410856008503495852000903580655001203589IND60589691720221120044115.0200503e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058969172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2017.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5887-959710aMagnetic susceptibility characteristics of surface soils in the Xilingele grassland and their implication for soil redistribution in wind-dominated landscapes: A preliminary study  ap. 33-41.  aWind erosion processes in the typical temperate Xilingele grassland of North China result in significant regional surface soil fine particle and carbon loss. They increasingly restrict local grass industry sustainable production and grassland ecosystem protection. It is challenging to link wind erosion and deposition at landscape scale using classical field monitoring or the expensive fallout environmental radionuclides tracing techniques. The low-cost but efficient magnetic susceptibility (MS) technique has been successfully demonstrated to have great potential to trace soil water erosion processes and patterns at large spatial and temporal scales. However, so far soil wind erosion research using MS technique has not been reported. This study had a trial to determine the variations of soil magnetic susceptibility on relative flat grassland by a grid soil sampling and to establish the relationship between wind erosion parameters and variations of MS in surface soils. 160 grid sampling sites were spaced at an interval of 400m across a study transect with 12.8km long and 1.6km wide. 319 soil samples were collected from the surface soils (0–1cm and 1–6cm layers). Grazing intensity of the sampling sites were investigated, and the samples were measured for mass-specific low-frequency magnetic susceptibility (χₗf), absolute frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility (χfd), percentage frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility (χfd%), soil grain size and organic carbon concentrations. The results showed that the χₗf, χfd and χfd% values in surface soils ranged from 30.0 to 97.8×10⁻⁸m³kg⁻¹, 1.2 to 6.1×10⁻⁸m³kg⁻¹ and from 3.2 to 8.0%, respectively. The variations of soil χₗf values were closely related to grazing intensity, soil grain size and organic carbon concentrations, suggesting that soil erosion processes were very sensitive to soil properties. Moreover, the MS parameters (χₗf, χfd%) were positively correlated with the soil erosion rates and negatively correlated with the dust deposition rates, indicating that MS parameters could potentially identify the erosion and dust deposition stages of wind dominated erosion processes in semi-arid grassland, respectively. These preliminary experimental results implied that magnetic susceptibility signals in surface soils will hopefully serve as a useful tool in the accuracy assessment of wind dominated erosion and deposition in the temperate grassland regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3acorrelation 3adust 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3agrazing intensity 3aindustry 3alandscapes 3amagnetism 3amonitoring 3aorganic carbon 3aradionuclides 3asoil properties 3asoil sampling 3asoil water 3awater erosion 3awind 3awind erosion 3aChina 0aMagnetic susceptibility technique 0aWind erosion 0aGrazing intensity 0aSoil grain size 0aTemperate grassland1 aZhang, Zhuodong1 aZhang, Keli1 aLiu, Hongyuan1 aFu, Suhua0 tCatena.g2018 Apr., v. 163 p.33-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2017.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245011900170300001800289500002000307520167900327592002802006650001502034650001502049650002202064650002702086650001302113650001002126650000902136650001702145650001202162650001102174650000702185650002302192650002102215650001502236700003102251700003402282773013202316856007302448852000902521655001202530IND60572094120221118064201.0170712e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057209412DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.52142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrera‐González, Ana M10aAdsorption of textile dyes present in aqueous solution and wastewater using polyelectrolytes derived from chitosan  ap. 1488-1495.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Adsorption is one of the most commonly used methods for the removal of textile dyes because of its low cost and ease of operation. Nowadays, unconventional materials capable of specific interactions such as polyelectrolytes are being proposed to be used as adsorbents. This work presents the results of the application of chemically modified polyelectrolytes derived from chitosan containing amino and sulfonate groups in the adsorption of four textile dyes, as well as the treatment of wastewater from the textile industry. RESULTS: By optimizing the conditions of static adsorption, approximately 90% of the cationic dyes present in an aqueous solution with an initial concentration of 300 mg dm⁻³ and a basic pH of around 11.5 were removed. Anionic dyes almost reach 100% adsorption on the polyampholytes. The point of zero charge (pHpzc) was determined, and it was found that both polyampholytes exhibited a basic character on their surface (pHpzc > 8.7). The adsorption isotherms for the cationic and anionic dyes fit Langmuir's model, and the values for RL indicated that the process of adsorption for cationic and anionic dyes is energetically favorable on both polyampholytes. CONCLUSIONS: The chemical modification introducing sulfonate groups on chitosan does not affect its natural ability to adsorb anionic dyes, but it also allows it to adsorb high concentrations of cationic dyes. This way, semisynthetic polyelectrolytes were capable of improving the quality of wastewaters treated by adsorption by reducing their pH, making it less alkaline, and decreasing the color, contents of suspended solids, and COD. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical oxygen demand 3achitosan 3acolor 3adyes 3aelectrolytes 3afabrics 3amodels 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3atextile industry 3awastewater1 aPeláez‐Cid, Alejandra A1 aCaldera‐Villalobos, Martín0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2017 July, v. 92, no. 7 p.1488-1495dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.52143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245012800167300001800295520097100313592002801284650002601312650002401338650002601362650002501388650002801413650001301441650000901454653001701463653001401480653001801494653000901512653002301521653002601544653002401570700001801594700001901612700001501631700001801646700005701664773014801721856008001869852000901949655001201958IND60608707720221116200810.0180808e20180727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060870772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b030872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yuanqiong10aDesign, Synthesis, and Biological Activity of β-Carboline Analogues Containing Hydantoin, Thiohydantoin, and Urea Moieties  ap. 8253-8261.  aA series of novel β-carboline derivatives was designed by combining the anti-tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) lead compound tetrahydro-β-carboline ester with the hydantoin, thiohydantoin, and urea motifs. These derivatives were synthesized from tetrahydro-β-carboline ester via a structural diversity-oriented synthesis in one step, and their biological activities were evaluated.

Compared with the lead compounds, some of these derivatives showed good insecticidal activity against Plutella xylostella and Culex pipiens pallens. At the same time, these derivatives also showed broad-spectrum fungicidal activity.

Here we describe two AR-mediated pathways in granulosa cells that regulate ovarian follicular development and therefore female fertility. First, we show that androgens attenuate follicular atresia through nuclear and extranuclear signaling pathways by enhancing expression of the microRNA (miR) miR-125b , which in turn suppresses proapoptotic protein expression. Second, we demonstrate that, independent of transcription, androgens enhance follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor expression, which then augments FSH-mediated follicle growth and development. Interestingly, we find that the scaffold molecule paxillin regulates both processes, making it a critical regulator of AR actions in the ovary. Finally, we report that low doses of exogenous androgens enhance gonadotropin-induced ovulation in mice, further demonstrating the critical role that androgens play in follicular development and fertility. These data may explain reported positive effects of androgens on ovulation rates in women with diminished ovarian reserve. Furthermore, this study demonstrates mechanisms that might contribute to the unregulated follicle growth seen in diseases of excess androgens such as polycystic ovary syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aandrogens 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3afemale fertility 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3afollicle-stimulating hormone receptors 3afollicular atresia 3agranulosa cells 3agrowth and development 3aknockout mutants 3amice 3amicroRNA 3aovulation 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3aprotein synthesis 3asignal transduction 3awomen1 aPrizant, Hen1 aLight, Allison1 aBiswas, Anindita1 aHayes, Emily1 aLee, Ho-Joon1 aBarad, David1 aGleicher, Norbert1 aHammes, Stephen R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Feb. 25, v. 111, no. 8 p.3008-3013dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13189781113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04461naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016100167520274200328592002803070650002303098650002503121650001903146650000903165650001603174650002003190650002003210650001903230650002003249650001903269650002103288650001103309650001803320650002403338650002303362653000703385653000803392653000903400653000703409653000703416653000703423653000803430653000703438653000703445653000703452653001803459653002103477653001703498653002203515653002703537700002103564700002003585700001303605700002303618773011103641856008603752852000903838655001203847IND60689843120221121023842.0200612e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068984312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1092532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanzl, M.I.10aVariability in lag-duration of Campylobacter spp. during enrichment after cold and oxidative stress and its impact on growth kinetics and reliable detection  aCampylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli continue to be the leading cause of zoonotic gastroenteritis in the European Union, making reliable detection in food important. Low storage temperatures and atmospheric oxygen concentrations during food production can cause sub-lethal damage or transient non-culturability which is why ISO 10272-1:2017 includes an enrichment step to repair cell damage and increase cell concentrations, thereby supporting detection of campylobacters from foods.The aim of this study was to assess the variability in lag-duration of C. jejuni and C. coli during enrichment after different food-relevant stress treatments and evaluate its impact on growth kinetics and reliability of detection outcomes. Therefore, 13 C. jejuni and 10 C. coli strains were subjected to cold stress during refrigerated and frozen storage. Refrigerated storage did not significantly reduce culturability, but frozen storage reduced cell concentrations by 1.6 ± 0.1 log₁₀cfu/ml for both species.Subsequently, cells were enriched following ISO 10272-1:2017-A and cell concentrations were determined over time and lag-duration and growth rate were determined by fitting the Baranyi-model. Without prior stress treatment, mean lag-duration for C. jejuni and C. coli was 2.5 ± 0.2 h and 2.2 ± 0.3 h, respectively. Refrigerated storage increased lag-duration for C. jejuni to 4.6 ± 0.4 h and for C. coli to 5.0 ± 0.4 h and frozen storage increased lag-duration to 5.0 ± 0.3 h and 6.1 ± 0.4 h for C. jejuni and C. coli, respectively.Comparison of strain- and biological variability showed that differences in recovery after cold stress can be attributed mainly to strain variability since strain variability after refrigeration and freeze stress increased respectively 3-fold and 4-fold while biological variability remained constant.A subset of strains was also subjected to oxidative stress that reduced cell concentrations by 0.7 ± 0.2 log₁₀ cfu/ml and comparison of recovery patterns after oxidative and freeze stress indicated that recovery behaviour was also dependent on the stress applied. A scenario analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of heterogeneity in outgrowth kinetics of single cells on the reliability of detection outcomes following ISO protocol 10272-1:2017. This revealed that a ‘worst-case’-scenario for successful detection by a combination of the longest lag-duration of 7.6 h and lowest growth rate of 0.47 h⁻¹ still resulted in positive detection outcomes since the detection limit was reached within 32.5 h. This suggests that other factors such as competitive microbiota can act as a causative factor in false-negative outcomes of tested food samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter coli 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aEuropean Union 3acold 3acold stress 3adetection limit 3afood production 3afrozen storage 3agastroenteritis 3amicroorganisms 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3arefrigeration 3astorage temperature 3astrain differences 0aBB 0aCAB 0aESBL 0aEU 0aFS 0aHI 0aISO 0aRC 0aRS 0aST 0aBaranyi-model 0aISO 10272-1:2017 0aBolton broth 0aSub-lethal injury 0aBacterial growth curve1 aZwietering, M.H.1 aHazeleger, W.C.1 aAbee, T.1 aden Besten, H.M.W.0 tFood research international.g2020 Aug., v. 134 p.109253-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1092533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002700156245008300183300001500266500001500281520153800296592002801834650002601862650001801888650002601906650001201932650001901944650003101963650001801994650001302012650001802025650001702043650001402060653002302074653002602097653001002123653001702133653001902150653001302169653001802182700002002200700002802220700002302248700002202271700001802293700002702311700002402338700002202362700002402384700002302408700002302431700006302454773009102517856009002608852000902698655001202707IND60606787820221118002749.0180730e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060678782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.03.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Mónica P.A.10aIn vitro and in vivo assessment of heart-homing porous silicon nanoparticles  ap. 93-104.  a2019-12-06  aChronic heart failure, predominantly developed after myocardial infarction, is a leading cause of high mortality worldwide. As existing therapies have still limited success, natural and/or synthetic nanomaterials are emerging alternatives for the therapy of heart diseases. Therefore, we aimed to functionalize undecylenic acid thermally hydrocarbonized porous silicon nanoparticles (NPs) with different targeting peptides to improve the NP's accumulation in different cardiac cells (primary cardiomyocytes, non-myocytes, and H9c2 cardiomyoblasts), additionally to investigate the behavior of the heart-targeted NPs in vivo. The toxicity profiles of the NPs evaluated in the three heart-type cells showed low toxicity at concentrations up to 50 μg/mL. Qualitative and quantitative cellular uptake revealed a significant increase in the accumulation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)-modified NPs in primary cardiomyocytes, non-myocytes and H9c2 cells, and in hypoxic primary cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes. Competitive uptake studies in primary cardiomyocytes showed the internalization of ANP-modified NPs takes place via the guanylate cyclase-A receptor. When a myocardial infarction rat model was induced by isoprenaline and the peptide-modified [¹¹¹In]NPs administered intravenously, the targeting peptides, particularly peptide 2, improved the NPs' accumulation in the heart up to 3.0-fold, at 10 min. This study highlights the potential of these peptide-modified nanosystems for future applications in heart diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aintravenous injection 3aheart failure 3amyocardial infarction 3asilicon 3acardiomyocytes 3aatrial natriuretic peptide 3aanimal models 3atoxicity 3ananoparticles 3aisoprenaline 3amortality 0aTargeting peptides 0aMyocardial infarction 0aHeart 0atherapeutics 0aPorous silicon 0aIn vivo 0aNanoparticles1 aRanjan, Sanjeev1 aCorreia, Alexandra M.R.1 aMäkilä, Ermei M.1 aKinnunen, Sini M.1 aZhang, Hongbo1 aShahbazi, Mohammad-Ali1 aAlmeida, Patrick V.1 aSalonen, Jarno J.1 aRuskoaho, Heikki J.1 aAiraksinen, Anu J.1 aHirvonen, Jouni T.1 aSantos, Hélder A.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7850-63090 tBiomaterials.g2016 July, v. 94 p.93-104dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.03.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013400167300001600301520096000317592002801277650001901305650002301324650001501347650002401362650001701386650002901403650000901432650001201441650002901453650002801482651001001510651001101520651001801531700002101549773007801570856008401648852000901732655001201741IND60096406120221119072700.0141104e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009640612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2012.02.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLund, Henrik14aThe economic crisis and sustainable development: The design of job creation strategies by use of concrete institutional economics  ap. 192-200.  aThis paper presents Concrete Institutional Economics as an economic paradigm to understand how the wish for sustainable energy in times of economic crisis can be used to generate jobs as well as economic growth. In most countries, including European countries, the USA and China, the implementation of sustainable energy solutions involves the replacement of imported fossil fuels by substantial investments in energy conservation and renewable energy (RE). In such situation, it becomes increasingly essential to develop economic thinking and economic models that can analyse the concrete institutions in which the market is embedded. This paper presents such tools and methodologies and applies them to the case of the Danish heating sector. The case shows how investments in decreasing fossil fuels and CO₂ emissions can be made in a way in which they have a positive influence on job creation and economic development as well as public expenditures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aeconometric models 3aemployment 3aenergy conservation 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3amarkets 3arenewable energy sources 3asustainable development 3aChina 3aEurope 3aUnited States1 aHvelplund, Frede0 tEnergy.g2012 July, v. 43, no. 1 p.192-200dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2012.02.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245016400168300001800332520116500350592002801515650002301543650002201566650001801588650001201606650003001618650002501648650001801673650001801691650001701709650001301726650004701739650001401786650001101800700002601811700002201837700002101859773012501880856007502005852000902080655001202089IND60534752220170613000000.0160803e20130820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053475222DNAL7 a10.1021/es40215192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaurand, Pierre-Emmanuel10aCoupling of Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Profiles Analysis and High Resolution Capillary Electrophoresis System for the Assessment of Chemical Genotoxicity  ap. 9505-9513.  aCadmium (Cd) can be toxic to terrestrial snails, but few data are available about its genotoxic effects on early life stages (ELS). The aim of this study was to investigate the genotoxic potential of Cd in embryos of Helix aspersa using a new approach that couples Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and a high-resolution capillary electrophoresis system (HRS). Clutches of H. aspersa were exposed to Cd solutions (2, 4, and 6 mg/L) from the beginning of their embryonic development. In addition to a dose-dependent effect of Cd on hatching rate, DNA fragmentation was observed in embryos that were exposed to 6 mg Cd/L. The analysis of RAPD products with HRS showed differences between the profiles of exposed and nonexposed embryos, starting at 2 mg Cd/L. In comparison to the profiles of the control samples, all profiles from the exposed snails exhibited an additional 270 bp DNA fragment and lacked a 450 bp DNA fragment. These profile modifications are related to the genotoxic effect of Cd on the ELS of H. aspersa. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of coupling RAPD and HRS for a rapid and efficient screening of the effects of chemicals on DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aDNA fragmentation 3aHelix aspersa 3acadmium 3acapillary electrophoresis 3adevelopmental stages 3adose response 3aembryogenesis 3agenotoxicity 3ahatching 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3ascreening 3asnails1 ade Vaufleury, Annette1 aScheifler, Renaud1 aCapelli, Nicolas0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 Aug. 20, v. 47, no. 16 p.9505-9513dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes40215193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002200160245005000182300001600232500000900248520205400257592002802311650001002339650002202349650002002371650002202391700002002413700002402433773012302457852000902580856009602589655001202685IND2059057720221117234902.0191122e199609  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205905772DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1996.00021962008800050005x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoote, Kenneth J.10aPotential Uses and Limitations of Crop Models  ap. 704-716.  aepub  aCrop models have many current and potential uses for answering questions in research, crop management, and policy. Models can assist in synthesis of research understanding about the interactions of genetics, physiology, and the environment, integration across disciplines, and organization of data. They can assist in preseason and in-season management decisions on cultural practices, fertilization, irrigation, and pesticide use. Crop models can assist policy makers by predicting soil erosion, leaching of agrichemicals, effects of climatic change, and large-area yield forecasts. Cautions and limitations in model uses are suggested, because appropriate use for a particular purpose depends on whether the model complexity is appropriate to the question being asked and whether the model has been tested in diverse environments. There is a need for both complex and simple models. In some cases, simple models are not appropriate because they are not programmed to address a particular phenomenon. In other cases, complex models are not appropriate because they may require inputs that are not practical to obtain in a field situation. Modelers need to be forthright in model description and promotion. For example, what does a given model respond to? What are the limitations of the model? What factors does the model not address? What are the limitations of inputs to run the models? Examples are given of model use to evaluate genetic improvement in photosynthesis and seed-filling duration, yield response to planting date and row spacing, and effects of change in seasonal temperature. We believe that use of crop growth models will play an increasingly important role in research understanding, crop management, and policy questions. Contribution from Florida Agric. Exp.

During the initiation of protein synthesis, for instance, mRNA selection for translation seems to be mediated by different eIF4F-like complexes, which may play a significant role in parasite adaptation to different hosts. In eukaryotes, the heterotrimeric eIF4F complex (formed by eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A) mediates mRNA recognition and ribosome binding and participates in various translation regulatory events. Six eIF4Es and five eIF4Gs have been described in trypanosomatids with several of these forming different eIF4F-like complexes. This has raised questions about their role in differential mRNA translation. Here we have studied further TbEIF4E2, the least known eIF4E homologue from Trypanosoma brucei, and found that it is not associated with an eIF4G homolog. It is, however, associated with mature mRNAs and binds to a histone mRNA stem-loop-binding protein (SLBP), one of two Trypanosoma SLBP homologs (TbSLBP1 and TbSLBP2). TbSLBP1 is more similar to the mammalian counterpart while TbSLBP2 is exclusive to trypanosomatids and related organisms. TbSLBP2 binds to TbEIF4E2 through a conserved central region missing in other SLBP homologs. Both SLBPs, as well as TbEIF4E2, were found to localize to the cytoplasm. TbEIF4E2 and TbSLBP2 are differentially expressed during cell culture, being more abundant in early-log phase, with TbSLBP2 also showing cell-cycle dependent expression. The new data reinforce unique aspects of the trypanosomatid eIF4Es, with the TbEIF4E2–TbSLBP complex possibly having a role in differential selection of mRNAs containing stem-loop structures.  aPublisher supplied data  aPAR-08-222cFogarty International Center  aAI056034cNational Institutes of Health  aAI073806cNational Institutes of Health  aTW009035cNational Institutes of Health  aGM089778cNational Institutes of Health  a401282/2014-7cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3acell culture 3acell cycle 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahistones 3ahosts 3amammals 3amessenger RNA 3aparasites 3aprotein synthesis 3aribosomes1 aMoura, Danielle M.

In this work, we have developed a COF with a low band gap by integrating electron-deficient thienoisoindigo and electron-rich triphenylamine. The intramolecular charge-transfer effect combining the extended length of the π-conjugated backbone of COF endow it with broad absorption even to the second near-infrared region. After optimizing the solvent, a uniform size and colloidal stable COF is obtained. Benefiting from the coplanar structure of the monomer, this COF achieves a considerable photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 48.2%. With these advantages, it displays convincing cancer cell killing effect upon laser irradiation in vitro or in vivo. This work provides a simple and practical method to acquire promising a COF-based phototherapy reagent that is applied in biomedicine field.  aPublisher supplied data  a51973214cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aabsorption 3acancer therapy 3airradiation 3amedicine 3aneoplasm cells 3aphototherapy 3asolvents 0athienoisoindigo 0acovalent organic framework 0aphotothermal therapy 0asize controllable 0adonor−acceptor structure1 aLi, Chaonan1 aYuan, Xiaodie1 aWu, Qihang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4228-32861 aJiang, Bowen1 aXie, Zhigang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2974-18250 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Apr. 21, v. 14, no. 17 p.19129-19138dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c017013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245018400165300001800349520137000367592002801737650001201765650002201777650003401799650001601833650002901849650001901878700001901897700001601916700001601932700001501948700001701963773010001980856007802080852000902158655001202167IND60519263920221120191406.0160424e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051926392DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2016001712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Shengqiang10aEnantioseparation of 2‐(substituted phenyl)propanoic acids by high‐speed countercurrent chromatography and investigation of the influence of substituents in enantiorecognition  ap. 1567-1573.  aThis paper concentrates on the enantioseparation of racemic 2‐(substituted phenyl)propanoic acids by high‐speed countercurrent chromatography with substituted β‐cyclodextrin as the chiral selector, and an investigation of the influence of the substituent on the benzene ring in enantiorecognition between the chiral selector and enantiomer of each racemate is presented. This is an extension research of our previous work on the enantioseparation of 2‐phenyl propanoic acid derivatives, to investigate the relationship between the value of enantioseparation factor and the different substituent on the benzene ring. In total, ten racemic 2‐(substituted phenyl)propanoic acids were investigated, of which four including 2‐(4‐nitrophenyl)propanoic acid, 2‐(4‐methylphenyl)propanoic acid, 2‐(4‐hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid, and 2‐(4‐chlorophenyl)propanoic acid, were studied by countercurrent chromatography for the first time, and two racemates were successfully enantioseparated. The distribution ratio and enantioseparation factor for all the ten racemates were determined by enantioselective liquid–liquid extraction. The results showed that an electron‐donating group on the benzene ring presents a higher enantiorecognition induced by chiral selector than that of racemates with an electron‐withdrawing group on the benzene ring.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aenantiomers 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3apropionic acid1 aWang, Xiaoping1 aLu, Mengxia1 aXiong, Qing1 aWang, Qian1 aYan, Jizhong0 tJournal of separation science.g2016 Apr., v. 39, no. 8 p.1567-1573dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2016001713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113024004000156040001800196100002200214245010400236300001600340520089500356592002801251596004501279650002501324650001301349650001501362650001501377650001101392650001301403650001301416650001101429650001201440650002401452650001501476650002301491650000901514653002101523653002701544653001701571653002401588653002501612700002201637700001701659700001801676700001701694773010601711856008701817852000901904655001201913IND50069542220221120192016.0200405e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006954222DNAL7 a240015622pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.08.0302chorus7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.08.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Brandon W.10aEnhancement in enzymatic hydrolysis by mechanical refining for pretreated hardwood lignocellulosics  ap. 353-360.  aThis study investigated the effectiveness of mechanical refining to overcome the biomass recalcitrance barrier. Laboratory scale refining was conducted via PFI mill and valley beater refiners using green liquor and Kraft hardwood pulps. A strong positive correlation was determined between sugar recovery and water retention value. Refining produced significant improvements in enzymatic hydrolysis yield relative to unrefined substrates (e.g., sugar recovery increase from 67% to 90%, for 15% lignin Kraft pulp). A maximum absolute enzymatic hydrolysis improvement with refining was observed at enzymatic hydrolysis conditions that produced intermediate conversion levels. For a 91% target sugar conversion, PFI refining at 4000 revolutions allowed for a 32% reduction in enzyme charge for 15% lignin content hardwood Kraft pulp and 96h hydrolysis time, compared to the unrefined material.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3ahardwood 3ahydrolysis 3akraft pulp 3alignin 3arefiners 3arefining 3asugars 2aBiomass 2aEnzymesxmetabolism 2aHydrolysis 2aLigninxmetabolism 2aWood 0aHardwood biomass 0aBiochemical conversion 0aPretreatment 0aMechanical refining 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis1 aVenditti, Richard1 aPark, Sunkyu1 aJameel, Hasan1 aKoo, Bonwook0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Nov., v. 147 p.353-360dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.08.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011600155300001800271500002000289520142600309592002801735650001101763650001201774650001701786650001301803650001701816650002401833650002801857650002101885650001601906650001301922700002001935700001501955700001701970700001701987700001202004700001402016773013202030856007302162852000902235655001202244IND60572094520221118064134.0170712e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057209452DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.51732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Xiaobin10aEffect of microbubble diameter, alkaline concentration and temperature on reactive oxygen species concentration  ap. 1738-1745.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: In comparison with ordinary bubbles, microbubbles exhibit low floating rate and high surface charge density. More importantly, microbubbles shrink gradually and the gas–liquid interface charges congest significantly, generating large surface potential and energy, which promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when microbubbles eventually collapse. In this study, size‐controllable microbubbles were introduced to alkaline solutions by titanium microporous filters, and the effects of microbubble diameter, alkaline concentration and temperature on the formation of ROS were examined. RESULTS: Maximum ROS concentration was obtained by using a microporous filter with average pore size of 25 µm and 40 µm in NaOH and KOH solutions, respectively. Further, with increase in alkaline concentration and temperature, the formation of ROS both exhibited parabolic trends, and optimal temperature for ROS formation was determined to be 65 °C. The maximum ROS concentration was 1.05 mmol L⁻¹ and 3.51 mmol L⁻¹ in NaOH and KOH solutions, respectively, after aerating for 60 min. CONCLUSION: The formation of ROS is dependent on the bubble size and solution composition and is influenced by both temperature and alkaline concentration. The results further extend the range of ROS application and provide references for ROS regulations in alkaline media. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3afilters 3amicrobubbles 3aporosity 3aporous media 3apotassium hydroxide 3areactive oxygen species 3asodium hydroxide 3atemperature 3atitanium1 aWang, Zhonghang1 aLv, Yeqing1 aWang, Shaona1 aZheng, Shili1 aDu, Hao1 aZhang, Yi0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2017 July, v. 92, no. 7 p.1738-1745dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.51733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245017800165300002000343520128700363592002801650650001201678650001701690650001501707650002501722650001301747650001101760650001901771650001901790650001901809650001701828650001801845650001901863650001301882650001901895650001201914650001701926650000901943650001701952700002501969700001801994700002502012700002302037700002102060700002202081773012302103856007402226852000902300655001202309IND60640487420221117163415.0190504e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064048742DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra03401b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Arijita10aTowards the realization of luminescence from visible emitting trivalent lanthanides (Sm, Eu, Tb, Dy) in polar zinc sulfide nanoparticles: evaluation of in vitro cytotoxicity  ap. 43304-43315.  aThis work reports on the realization of luminescence from four visible emitting trivalent lanthanide (Ln) cations [samarium (Sm), europium (Eu), terbium (Tb) and dysprosium (Dy)] in polar zinc sulfide nanoparticles, Zn(Ln)S. Among the Zn(Ln)S nanoparticles studied, noticeable lanthanide cation centered luminescence has only been realized from the Zn(Tb)S and Zn(Eu)S nanoparticles in water, whereas no such effect has been observed in the corresponding Sm and Dy containing nanoparticles. In all the nanoparticles with characteristic lanthanide luminescence, the nanoparticles were found to be acting as an optical antenna and protector matrix, in order to realize luminescence from the respective lanthanide cations. The results have been rationalized with the lanthanide cations acting as charge (hole and/or electron) traps in the semiconductor nanoparticle matrix along with associated environmental effects. A comparison of the corresponding hydrophobic Zn(Tb)S nanoparticles reveal significant differences in photophysical properties. Finally, the hydrophilic Zn(Tb)S nanoparticles have been examined for in vitro cytotoxicity and the results indicate potential anti-cancer therapy for human mammary adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231) with the capability of cellular imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3acytotoxicity 3adysprosium 3aenvironmental impact 3aeuropium 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3aluminescence 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3asamarium 3asemiconductors 3aterbium 3atherapeutics 3azinc 3azinc sulfide1 aDebnath, Gouranga H.1 aAhir, Manisha1 aBhattacharya, Saurav1 aUpadhyay, Priyanka1 aAdhikary, Arghya1 aMukherjee, Prasun0 tRSC advances.g2016 May 03, v. 6, no. 49 p.43304-43315dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra03401b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03741naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245014800158300002000306520129800326592002801624596009801652596010701750596010701857596010701964596014102071596011402212596011702326596011402443650001102557650001102568650001402579650001302593650001702606650001202623650001402635653002902649653002802678653003002706653002102736653001902757653003502776700001202811700001602823700001702839700001602856700001702872700001802889700005002907773014202957856007903099852000903178655001203187IND60776316920221117110224.0220505e20220422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077631692DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c017162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Cheng10aOne-Pot Preparation of Lithium Compensation Layer, Lithiophilic Layer, and Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Lean-Lithium Metal Anode  ap. 19437-19447.  aLithium metal is an ideal anode for high-energy-density batteries. However, the low Coulomb efficiency and the generation of dendrites pose a significant limitation to its practical application, while the excess lithium in the battery also generates serious safety concerns. Herein, a layer-by-layer optimized multilayer structure integrating an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (LiF) layer, a lithiophilic (LiₓAu alloy) layer, and a lithium compensation layer is reported for a lean-lithium metal battery, where each layer acts synergistically to stabilize the lithium deposition behaviors and enhances the cycling performance of the battery. The optimized anode could effectively induce homogeneous reversible lithium deposition under the synergistic effect of multilayer films and keep the integrity of the morphological structure unbroken during the deposition. The presence of the lithium compensation layer allows the half-cell to have a high initial CE of 158.9%, and the action of the LiF layer and lithiophilic layer maintains an average CE of 98.8% over 160 cycles, which further demonstrates the stability of the structure. As a result, when combined with LiFePO₄ cathode, an initial capacity of 148 mAh g–¹ and a retention rate of 97.5% over 130 cycles were achieved.  aPublisher supplied data  a51702247cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aWUT:c, Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002338  aWUT:c, Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002338  aWUT:c, Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002338  aWUT:2021-ZD-1cState Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processingdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100011302  a2020KF0021cSanya Science and Education Innovation Park of Wuhan University of Technologydhttps://doi.org/NA  a202110497013cNational Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for College Studentsdhttps://doi.org/NA  a520LH056cHainan Provincial Joint Project of Sanya Yazhou Bay Science and Technology Citydhttps://doi.org/NA 3aalloys 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acathodes 3aelectrolytes 3alithium 3asynergism 0alean-lithium metal anode 0alithium supplementation 0aphysical vapor deposition 0alithium fluoride 0aartificial SEI 0alithiophilic current collector1 aLi, Yan1 aYu, Yongkun1 aShen, Chunli1 aZhou, Cheng1 aDong, Chenxu1 aZhao, Tianhao1 aXu, Xu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3309-75960 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Apr. 22, v. 14, no. 17 p.19437-19447dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c017163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245013600191300001800327520119400345592002801539650002201567650002101589650001301610650001901623650000901642650001701651650002001668650001801688650000701706650003301713650003301746650001701779700001701796700002101813700002101834773013601855856008101991852000902072655001202081IND50090631820221117180644.0141211e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009063182DNAL7 a247285712pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-014-2777-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyoubi-Feiz, Baharak10aElectrosorption and photocatalytic one-stage combined process using a new type of nanosized TiO2/activated charcoal plate electrode  ap. 8555-8564.  aIn the present study, an activated charcoal (AC) plate was prepared by physical activation method. Its surface was coated with TiO₂nanoparticles by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method. The average crystallite size of TiO₂nanoparticles was determined approximately 28 nm. The nature of prepared electrode was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurement before and after immobilization. The electrosorption and photocatalytic one-stage combined process was investigated in degradation of Lanasol Red 5B (LR5B), and the effect of dye concentration, electrolyte concentration, pH, voltage, and contact time was optimized and modeled using response surface methodology (RSM) approach. The dye concentration of 30 mg L⁻¹, Na₂SO₄concentration of 4.38 g L⁻¹, pH of 4, voltage of 250 mV, and contact time of 120 min were determined as optimum conditions. Decolorization efficiency increased in combined process to 85.65 % at optimum conditions compared to 66.03 % in TiO₂/AC photocatalytic, 20.09 % in TiO₂/AC electrosorption, and 1.91 % in AC photocatalytic processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivated carbon 3acharcoal 3adecolorization 3adyes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrophoresis 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area1 aAber, Soheil1 aKhataee, Alireza1 aAlipour, Esmaeel0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 July, v. 21, no. 14 p.8555-8564dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-2777-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03589naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245009400206300001800300506007600318520142600394592002801820506003701848650000801885650002501893650001401918650001301932650001801945650001301963650002701976650002002003650001102023650001802034650001402052650001602066650001602082650000902098650002702107650001802134650003002152650001802182650001302200653002002213653002602233653001002259653001302269653001402282700001702296700002102313700002002334700002202354700002202376700001902398700002402417700001902441700001802460700002302478700001902501700002202520700001502542700001902557700001802576773017302594856007902767852000902846655001202855IND60230314420221207120917.0150614e20140225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023031442DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13192681112doi7 aPMC39399242pmcid7 a245161632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobiyama, Kouji10aNonagonistic Dectin-1 ligand transforms CpG into a multitask nanoparticulate TLR9 agonist  ap. 3086-3091.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCpG DNA, a ligand for Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), has been one of the most promising immunotherapeutic agents. Although there are several types of potent humanized CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), developing “all-in-one” CpG ODNs activating both B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells forming a stable nanoparticle without aggregation has not been successful. In this study, we generated a novel nanoparticulate K CpG ODN (K3) wrapped by the nonagonistic Dectin-1 ligand schizophyllan (SPG), K3-SPG. In sharp contrast to K3 alone, K3-SPG stimulates human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to produce a large amount of both type I and type II IFN, targeting the same endosome where IFN-inducing D CpG ODN resides without losing its K-type activity. K3-SPG thus became a potent adjuvant for induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses, particularly CTL induction, to coadministered protein antigens without conjugation. Such potent adjuvant activity of K3-SPG is attributed to its nature of being a nanoparticle rather than targeting Dectin-1 by SPG, accumulating and activating antigen-bearing macrophages and dendritic cells in the draining lymph node. K3-SPG acting as an influenza vaccine adjuvant was demonstrated in vivo in both murine and nonhuman primate models. Taken together, K3-SPG may be useful for immunotherapeutic applications that require type I and type II IFN as well as CTL induction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aToll-like receptor 9 3aadjuvants 3aagonists 3aanimal models 3aantigens 3acell-mediated immunity 3adendritic cells 3ahumans 3aimmunotherapy 3ainfluenza 3alymph nodes 3amacrophages 3amice 3amononuclear leukocytes 3ananoparticles 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aschizophyllan 3avaccines 0ainnate immunity 0atwo-photon microscopy 0aMARCO 0aSiglec-1 0aβ-glucan1 aAoshi, Taiki1 aNarita, Hirotaka1 aKuroda, Etsushi1 aHayashi, Masayuki1 aTetsutani, Kohhei1 aKoyama, Shohei1 aMochizuki, Shinichi1 aSakurai, Kazuo1 aKatakai, Yuko1 aYasutomi, Yasuhiro1 aSaijo, Shinobu1 aIwakura, Yoichiro1 aAkira, S.,1 aCoban, Cevayir1 aIshii, Ken J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Feb. 25, v. 111, no. 8 p.3086-3091dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13192681113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245023800170300001400408520149300422592002801915650002101943650002501964650001701989650001502006650000902021650001602030650002502046650001002071650001202081650001102093650001402104650001602118650003702134650004402171650001802215650001402233650001602247650004302263650002602306650002402332653002502356653001002381653001102391653000902402700001902411700001402430700001502444700001402459700001902473700001702492700001702509700001302526700001902539700002002558700001802578700001702596700001802613773010402631856008502735852000902820655001202829IND60568105620221120145314.0180831e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056810562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2017.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Xiao-dong10aStPBS2, a MAPK kinase gene, is involved in determining hyphal morphology, cell wall development, hypertonic stress reaction as well as the production of secondary metabolites in Northern Corn Leaf Blight pathogen Setosphaeria turcica  ap. 30-38.  aMitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) is a crucial component in the MAPK signaling pathway. However, the functions of MAPKKs in foliar pathogens remain poorly understood. In the current study, a MAPKK gene designated as StPBS2 was cloned from Setosphaeria turcica and the functions of this gene were investigated by RNAi technology. Four independent StPBS2 gene silence transformants with different efficiencies were confirmed by real time PCR. Compared to the wild type strain (WT), these transformants showed decreased colony growth, shortened hyphae cell length, broadened cell width and an obvious reduction in conidium yield. Moreover, the cell wall of the transformants was thicker and they were also more sensitive to substances that interfere with cell wall biosynthesis than WT. Additionally, the transformants displayed higher sensitivity to hypertonic stress than WT and the sensitivity was associated with the level of silencing of StPBS2. They were also resistant to the fungicides iprodione, procymidone and fludioxonil, to which WT almost completely sensitive. The transformants produced more red secondary metabolites than WT and the production was enhanced with increasing silencing level and increased glucose content in PDA medium. Our results suggest that StPBS2 is involved in morphogenesis, condiogenesis, cell wall development, hypertonic stress reaction and resistance to fungicides, as well as in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in S. turcica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aSetosphaeria turcica 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3acorn 3afludioxonil 3afungicide resistance 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahyphae 3aiprodione 3aleaf blight 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3amorphogenesis 3apathogens 3aprocymidone 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asecondary metabolites 3asignal transduction 0aSetosphaeria turcica 0aMAPKK 0aStPBS2 0aRNAi1 aFeng, Sheng-ze1 aZhao, Jie1 aTang, Cong1 aTian, Lan1 aFan, Yong-shan1 aCao, Zhi-yan1 aHao, Zhi-min1 aJia, Hui1 aZang, Jin-ping1 aZhang, Yun-feng1 aHan, Jian-min1 aGu, Shou-qin1 aDong, Jin-gao0 tMicrobiological research.g2017 Aug., v. 201 p.30-38dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2017.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245021500164300001800379500001500397520140300412592002801815650001901843650000801862650002001870650001101890650001301901650002101914650000901935650001501944650001601959650001201975650002501987650003102012650003302043650000702076650001902083650001802102650002602120650001902146653000902165773010002174856007802274852000902352655001202361IND60519264120221120222010.0160424e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051926412DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2015012002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWerner, Justyna10aDetermination of metal ions in tea samples using task‐specific ionic liquid‐based ultrasound‐assisted dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction coupled to liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection  ap. 1411-1417.  a2019-12-06  aTask‐specific ionic liquid‐based ultrasound‐assisted dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction was used for the preconcentration of cadmium(II), cobalt(II), and lead(II) ions in tea samples, which were subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography with UV detection. The proposed method of preconcentration is free of volatile organic compounds, which are often used as extractants and dispersing solvents in classic techniques of microextraction. A task‐specific ionic liquid trioctylmethylammonium thiosalicylate was used as an extractant and a chelating agent. Ultrasound was used to disperse the ionic liquid. After microextraction, the phases were separated by centrifugation, and the ionic liquid phase was solubilized in methanol and directly injected into the liquid chromatograph. Selected microextraction parameters, such as the volume of ionic liquid, the pH of the sample, the duration of ultrasound treatment, the speed and time of centrifugation, and the effect of ionic strength, were optimized. Under optimal conditions an enrichment factor of 200 was obtained for each analyte. The limits of detection were 0.002 mg/kg for Cd(II), 0.009 mg/kg for Co(II), and 0.013 mg/kg for Pb(II). The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated by an analysis of the Certified Reference Materials (INCT‐TL‐1, INCT‐MPH‐2) with the recovery values in the range of 90–104%.  aPublisher supplied data 3asolubilization 3atea 3adetection limit 3acobalt 3amethanol 3achelating agents 3alead 3ametal ions 3aultrasonics 3acadmium 3aultrasonic treatment 3avolatile organic compounds 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3apH 3aionic strength 3aionic liquids 3aliquid chromatography 3acentrifugation 0aions0 tJournal of separation science.g2016 Apr., v. 39, no. 8 p.1411-1417dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2015012003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245010200201300002000303520120900323592002801532596007601560650001201636650002101648650001401669650001101683650001301694650001701707650001201724650001601736653001801752653003501770653001701805653002301822653001701845700005601862700006101918700005601979700006302035773014202098856007902240852000902319655001202328IND60776314020221117105531.0220505e20220425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077631402DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.2c001812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImel, Adam E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3177-784610aMicroemulsions as Emerging Electrolytes: The Correlation of Structure to Electrochemical Response  ap. 20179-20189.  aWe describe the structural studies of microemulsions (μEs) prepared from water, toluene, butanol, and polysorbate 20 (PS20) that we recently used as electrolytes. Small-angle neutron scattering was used to monitor the development of the bicontinuous system as a function of the water-to-surfactant mass ratio on a constant oil-to-surfactant dilution line, revealing how the domain size, correlation length, amphiphilicity factor, and bending moduli change with composition. Kratky and Porod analyses are also employed, providing further structural detail of the scattering domains. We demonstrate that controlling the water-to-surfactant ratio with a constant oil-to-surfactant dilution affects the bicontinuous phase, reveals a sizeable compositional region with structural similarities, and provides insight into the correlation of structure to physical properties. Voltammetric results are presented to examine how the evolution of the bicontinuous structure formed in a μE prepared from water, toluene, butanol, and PS20 contributes to the electrochemical response. These findings, therefore, provide essential information that will guide the formulation of μEs as electrolytes for energy storage.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE-SC0019409cBasic Energy Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006151 3abutanol 3aelectrochemistry 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3aneutrons 3apolysorbates 3atoluene 3avoltammetry 0amicroemulsion 0asmall-angle neutron scattering 0abicontinuous 0acyclic voltammetry 0aflow battery1 aBarth, Brian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3887-60541 aHayes, Douglas G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0303-14111 aDadmun, Mark1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4304-60871 aZawodzinski, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2690-87840 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Apr. 25, v. 14, no. 17 p.20179-20189dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c001813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011800161300001800279520137300297592002801670650001501698650003001713650002301743650002001766773010801786856008101894852000901975655001201984IND60519260920221122032434.0160602e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051926092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-016-1320-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYazdi, J.10aDecomposition based Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithms for Design of Large-Scale Water Distribution Networks  ap. 2749-2766.  aIn last two decades, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have shown their merit for solving different optimization problems within the context of water resources and environmental engineering. MOEAs mainly use the concept of Pareto dominance for obtaining the trade-off solutions considering different criteria. A new alternative method for solving multiobjective problems is multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) which uses scalarizing the objective functions. In this paper, decomposition strategies are developed for the large-scale water distribution network (WDN) design problems by integrating the concepts of harmony search (HS) and genetic algorithm (GA) within the MOEA/D framework. The proposed algorithms are then compared with two well-known non-dominance based MOEAs: NSGA2 and SPEA2 across four different WDN design problems. Experimental results show that MOEA/D outperform the Pareto dominance methods in terms of both non-domination and diversity criteria. MOEA/D-HS in particular could provide very high quality solutions with a uniform distribution along the Pareto front preserving the diversity and dominating the solutions of the other algorithms. It suggests that decomposition based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms are very promising in dealing with complicated large-scale WDN design problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenvironmental engineering 3awater distribution 3awater resources0 tWater resources management.g2016 June, v. 30, no. 8 p.2749-2766dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-016-1320-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002900166245013400195300001800329520132900347592002801676650001101704650001701715650001701732650002401749650001601773650003701789650001101826650002001837650001201857650001201869650002001881650002101901650000901922650001601931650002701947650001701974650002101991650001602012650002902028650003102057650001802088650001102106650002002117650001102137650001102148650003002159650004702189650004402236650001802280650000902298650002702307700002102334700003202355700002302387773010602410856008102516852000902597655001202606IND50069441420221121031233.0150209e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006944142DNAL7 a232479282pmid7 a10.1007/s00394-012-0481-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan de Lagemaat, Monique10aIncreased gain in bone mineral content of preterm infants fed an isocaloric, protein-, and mineral-enriched postdischarge formula  ap. 1781-1785.  aPURPOSE: Preterm infants are at risk for suboptimal bone mineralization. Postnatal bone formation requires optimal nutritional composition. This study evaluated the effect of isocaloric, protein-, and mineral-enriched postdischarge formula (PDF), standard term formula (TF), and human milk (HM) on gain in bone mineral content (BMC) of preterm infants between term age (40 weeks postmenstrual age) and 6 months corrected age (CA). METHODS: Between term age and 6 months CA, 93 preterm infants were randomized to be fed PDF (n = 52) or TF (n = 41) and 46 preterm infants were fed HM. Weight (g) and length (cm) were measured at birth, term age, and 6 months CA. BMC (g) was measured by whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at term age and 6 months CA. RESULTS: Gain in BMC (expressed as median with interquartile range) between term age and 6 months CA was higher in PDF-fed infants (102.3 (32.4) g) compared to TF- and HM-fed infants (91.6 (24.5) and 84.5 (33.3) g, respectively), adjusted for gender, gestational age, birthweight, and gain in weight and length. CONCLUSION: Between term age and 6 months CA, isocaloric PDF enhances gain in BMC of preterm infants, independent of gain in weight and length. We speculate that higher gain in BMC during infancy may improve adult bone mass in preterm infants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abirth weight 3abone density 3abone mineralization 3abreast milk 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3agender 3agestational age 3ainfancy 3ainfants 3amineral content 3anutrient content 3arisk 3aweight gain 2aAbsorptiometry, Photon 2aBirth Weight 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weight 2aBone Densityxphysiology 2aCalcification, Physiologic 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aGestational Age 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Formulaxchemistry 2aInfant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aInfant, Prematurexgrowth & development 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aMilk, Humanxchemistry1 aRotteveel, Joost1 avan Weissenbruch, Mirjam M.1 aLafeber, Harrie N.0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2013 Oct., v. 52, no. 7 p.1781-1785dSpringer-Verlagx1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-012-0481-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245011400181520110800295592002801403650002901431650001201460650001101472650001601483650001101499650002101510650001501531650001301546650003001559650002601589650000901615650001101624650002001635650001501655653001301670653002901683653001901712653001501731653001501746700002501761700001701786700002201803773010601825856008701931852000902018655001202027IND60689840420221121072928.0200523e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068984042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1233692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatakojwala, Ranaprathap10aHydrothermal liquefaction of biogenic municipal solid waste under reduced H2 atmosphere in biorefinery format  aMunicipal solid waste (MSW), an inexorable by-product of anthropogenic activities composes of nearly 50% of the organic (biogenic) fraction.

Food, vegetable, and composite wastes were evaluated as feedstocks to produce HTL derivatives in the form of liquor (biocrude and aqueous phase), biochar and bio-gas. The biocrude (HTLOF) showed middle oil as major fraction along with C₆-C₂₂ compounds. Composite waste resulted in relatively higher yield of biocrude fraction. The aqueous phase (HTLAF) documented the presence of reducing sugars, sotolon and furfurals as major fraction. Biochar (HTLBC) composition showed maximum carbon fraction followed by hydrogen and oxygen.

Yard preferences are generally closely related to actual yard landscapes, but differences in the drivers of and constraints on preferences relative to actual landscaping have not been well explored. In this study, we conducted a resident survey to consider the relationship between preferred and actual yard grassiness in the desert city of Phoenix, AZ, where outdoor water use makes up over two-thirds of residential water consumption. Using a robust theoretical approach including both attitudinal and structural drivers, we examined the relative importance of various attitudes as well as social and parcel attributes as drivers of preferred and actual yard grassiness. We found that nearly half of surveyed residents had less grass than they would prefer, and that existing yard grassiness is best explained by structural characteristics out of the variables we considered. Yard preferences, however, were better explained by attitudinal and social characteristics. The mismatch between actual and preferred yard grassiness revealed a latent demand for grass in this arid city, which could lead to shifts in water-conserving landscaping if structural constraints on landscaping behavior change. Additionally, the relative importance of structural constraints in determining actual yard grassiness, and the differences in important predictors of yard preferences as opposed to actual yards, suggest that appeals to resident attitudes and values are unlikely to shift yard landscaping.  aPublisher supplied data  aEF-1638725cNational Science Foundation  aSES-1462086cNational Science Foundation  aDEB-1832016cNational Science Foundation 3abehavior change 3agrasses 3asurveys1 aLarson, Kelli L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6558-26871 aAndrade, Riley1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3640-60130 tUrban ecosystems.g2020 June, v. 23, no. 3 p.659-673dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870259x1083-81557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-020-00928-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01903naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008500165300001600250520101900266592002801285650001501313650002901328650002501357650001801382700002301400773011201423856008101535852000901616655001201625IND60602876020221119080424.0180711e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060287602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00267-018-1037-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Song S.10aOn Abandoning Hypothesis Testing in Environmental Standard Compliance Assessment  ap. 183-189.  aWe use basic characteristics of statistical significance test to argue the abandonment of hypothesis testing in environmental standard (or criterion) compliance assessment. The typical sample size used for environmental assessment is small, and the natural variation of many water quality constituent concentrations is high. These conditions lead to low statistical power of the hypothesis tests used in the assessment process. As a result, using hypothesis testing is often inefficient in detecting noncompliance. When a noncompliance is detected, it is frequently due to sampling or other types of error. We illustrate the problems using two examples, through which we argue that these problems cannot be resolved under the current practice of assessing compliance one water at a time. We recommend that the hypothesis testing framework be replaced by a statistical estimation approach, which can more effectively leverage information from assessments on similar waters using a probabilistic assessment approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompliance 3aenvironmental assessment 3astatistical analysis 3awater quality1 aMiltner, Robert J.0 tEnvironmental management.g2018 Aug., v. 62, no. 2 p.183-189dSpringer USwJournal:jnl8014x0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-018-1037-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011300161300002000274520175700294592002802051650001502079650001102094650001402105650001902119650001302138650001302151650001302164650003002177650001902207650001702226650000902243650001302252650001202265650002202277650001102299650004402310650001502354650001302369650002002382700002002402700002402422773012402446856007402570852000902644655001202653IND60640484020221122032036.0190504e20160426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064048402DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra03339c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Ary R.10aDFT simulations of ⁷Li solid state NMR spectral parameters and Li⁺ ion migration barriers in Li₂ZrO₃  ap. 41015-41024.  aLithium zirconate (LZO) is a prototype material for studies of Li⁺ ion mobility with a wide range of possible applications such as a ceramic breeder for nuclear reactors, a reversible sorbent for carbon dioxide capture, a coating for cathodes and anodes or even directly as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful experimental technique with the potential to provide microscopic insights into Li⁺ ion dynamics in solid materials, in particular if combined with theory to interpret the measured spectra. We use first-principles atomistic simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the Li⁺ ion migration mechanisms in LZO. Computed barrier heights for several possible Li⁺ ion exchange pathways are in very good agreement with the experimentally reported values and confirm the relevance of lithium vacancies for the observed Li⁺ ion mobilities. Additionally, ⁷Li NMR isotropic spectral parameters such as quadrupolar coupling constants and chemical shifts, can be obtained by the gauge-including projector-augmented-wave (GIPAW) method in very good agreement with the experimental values, underpinning the validity of the computational models. The close analysis of these spectral parameters shows a clear correlation to simple descriptors for the local structural environment of the Li⁺ ions, opening up a pathway to further modelling based on computationally cheaper methods. We note, however, that there is also a consistently poor agreement with experimental data for ⁷Li anisotropic properties like the asymmetry parameter of the electric field gradient (EFG) tensor, which calls for further theoretical method development in this field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aanodes 3aasymmetry 3acarbon dioxide 3acathodes 3aceramics 3acoatings 3adensity functional theory 3aelectric field 3aion exchange 3aions 3aisotropy 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprototypes 3asorbents 3astable isotopes1 aReuter, Karsten1 aScheurer, Christoph0 tRSC advances.g2016 Apr. 26, v. 6, no. 47 p.41015-41024dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra03339c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245015900193300001800352520153300370592002801903650001001931650002401941650002501965650001901990650002902009650000902038650000902047650001602056650001702072650002002089650002302109650001302132650002102145650002102166650002002187650001102207650001202218650001802230650001002248650001402258650004302272650001102315650001402326650001602340700002102356700002602377700002302403700002302426700002902449773010902478856008102587852000902668655001202677IND50090625120221122221102.0150216e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009062512DNAL7 a244644762pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-014-9913-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyes-Becerril, Martha10aSingle or combined effects of Lactobacillus sakei and inulin on growth, non-specific immunity and IgM expression in leopard grouper (Mycteroperca rosacea)  ap. 1169-1180.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the single or combined effects of Lactobacillus sakei with inulin suitable for immunological in vivo studies in farmed fish. By in vitro assays, L. sakei strain 5-4 showed antibacterial activities against all assayed fish pathogens (except the Vibrio harveyi strain CAIM-1793). L. sakei was able to survive at high fish bile concentrations. Fermentation of the agave inulin resulted in a large increase in number of lactobacilli. For the in vivo study, fish were fed for 8 weeks four practical diets: control diet (control), L. sakei 5-4 (10⁷ CFU/g), inulin (1 % or 10 g/kg) and L. sakei + inulin (10⁷ CFU/g + 10 g/kg). The weight gain showed clearly the synergistic effect of L. sakei 5-4 and inulin at 6 and 8 weeks of treatments. Leopard grouper fed with L. sakei alone or combined with inulin have significantly increased the assayed physiological and humoral immune parameters. By real-time PCR assays, the mRNA transcripts of immunoglobulin M (IgM) were found to be higher expressed in intestine, head kidney, mucus, gill, spleen and skin. Moreover, mRNA expression levels of IgM in head kidney and anterior intestine were measured by real-time PCR. L. sakei 5-4 and L. sakei + inulin supplemented diet up-regulated the expression of IgM at week 4 and 8 in intestine and head kidney, respectively. These results support the idea that the L. sakei 5-4 alone or combined with agave inulin improved growth performance and stimulates the immune system of leopard grouper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgave 3aLactobacillus sakei 3aMycteroperca rosacea 3aVibrio harveyi 3aantibacterial properties 3abile 3adiet 3afarmed fish 3afermentation 3agene expression 3agrowth performance 3aimmunity 3aimmunoglobulin M 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3ainulin 3akidneys 3amessenger RNA 3amucus 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aspleen 3asynergism 3aweight gain1 aAscencio, Felipe1 aGracia-Lopez, Vicente1 aMacias, Ma.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to determine degree of proteolysis. The main changes detected by FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy were degradation of protein backbones manifested in the spectra as an increase in terminal carboxylic acid vibrations, a decrease in CN vibration, as well as an increase in skeletal vibrations. A reduction in β-sheet secondary structures was also detected, while α-helix secondary structure seemed to stay relatively unchanged.

The Net Energy Balance (NEB) and Renewability indicate energy gain for palm biodiesel and its co-products as compared to fossil energy inputs. In addition, life cycle assessment also reveals lower values of environmental impact potentials of biodiesel as compared to conventional diesel. For example, palm biodiesel can provide greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction of around 46–73% as compared to diesel. Nitrogen-fertilizer production and application in the plantation and the air emissions from the ponds treating palm oil mill effluent (POME) are found to be the major environmental aspects. However, the energy and environmental performances depend on various factors such as the management efficiency of empty fruit bunches (EFB) and POME and the possible land-use change in the future. Recommendations are made for improving environmental performance of palm biodiesel and for securing the long-term availability of crude palm oil supply with a view towards sustainable palm biodiesel production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiodiesel 3acoproducts 3aemissions 3aenergy balance 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gases 3aland use change 3alife cycle assessment 3aoil mill effluents 3apalm oils 3aponds 3aproduction technology 3aThailand1 aGheewala, Shabbir H.0 tEnergy.g2012 July, v. 43, no. 1 p.306-314dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2012.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245012400164300001800288520145700306592002801763650001601791650002501807650002601832650001301858650001201871650001501883650001401898650000701912650001901919650001401938650001701952650001901969650001201988700002202000700002102022700002102043700002002064700001702084700002002101700002002121700002102141700002002162773012502182856007502307852000902382655001202391IND60534750020221120121707.0160803e20130820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053475002DNAL7 a10.1021/es401450v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoliker, Deborah L.10aEvaluating Chemical Extraction Techniques for the Determination of Uranium Oxidation State in Reduced Aquifer Sediments  ap. 9225-9232.  aExtraction techniques utilizing high pH and (bi)carbonate concentrations were evaluated for their efficacy in determining the oxidation state of uranium (U) in reduced sediments collected from Rifle, CO. Differences in dissolved concentrations between oxic and anoxic extractions have been proposed as a means to quantify the U(VI) and U(IV) content of sediments. An additional step was added to anoxic extractions using a strong anion exchange resin to separate dissolved U(IV) and U(VI). X-ray spectroscopy showed that U(IV) in the sediments was present as polymerized precipitates similar to uraninite and/or less ordered U(IV), referred to as non-uraninite U(IV) species associated with biomass (NUSAB). Extractions of sediment containing both uraninite and NUSAB displayed higher dissolved uranium concentrations under oxic than anoxic conditions while extractions of sediment dominated by NUSAB resulted in identical dissolved U concentrations. Dissolved U(IV) was rapidly oxidized under anoxic conditions in all experiments. Uraninite reacted minimally under anoxic conditions but thermodynamic calculations show that its propensity to oxidize is sensitive to solution chemistry and sediment mineralogy. A universal method for quantification of U(IV) and U(VI) in sediments has not yet been developed but the chemical extractions, when combined with solid-phase characterization, have a narrow range of applicability for sediments without U(VI).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aanaerobic conditions 3aanion exchange resins 3aaquifers 3abiomass 3amineralogy 3aoxidation 3apH 3apolymerization 3asediments 3aspectroscopy 3athermodynamics 3auranium1 aCampbell, Kate M.1 aFox, Patricia M.1 aSinger, David

Here, we investigated colonization and habitat selection of the European hare (Lepus europaeus), a declining farmland species, in urban areas in Denmark, using a combination of citizen science data and transect counts. Further, we estimated the population density of urban hares in Aarhus, Denmark’s second largest city. Our results provide the first evidence that hares have established populations in urban areas, potentially in response to decreasing habitat quality in rural areas due to agricultural intensification. The hare density in Aarhus was ca. 8 hares per km², which is comparable to or slightly higher than hare abundance estimates from various pastural areas in Europe, suggesting that urban areas provide suitable habitat for hares. Hare habitat selection was generally associated with areas consisting of large lawns, such as high buildings and parks, which potentially provide high-quality forage throughout the year. Considering the increasing expansion of urban areas and deteriorating habitat quality of agricultural areas, urban planning that incorporates habitat requirements for wildlife could help to support urban animal populations, especially for species of conservation concern.  aPublisher supplied data  a-cMiljøstyrelsen 3aLepus europaeus 3aagricultural land 3acitizen science 3aforage 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahares 3aintensive farming 3apopulation density 3aurbanization 3awildlife 3aDenmark1 aSunde, Peter0 tUrban ecosystems.g2020 June, v. 23, no. 3 p.543-554dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870259x1083-81557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-020-00943-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01952naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007700140245010400217300001800321520078600339592002801125650002301153650002301176650002201199650001901221650001501240650001701255650002201272650001201294650001601306700001501322700001801337700001801355773013401373856007401507852000901581655001201590IND60659735020221119110440.0190823e20130124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065973502DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc37616d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalasingamThese authors contributed equally to this work., Suresh Kannan10aImprovement of dye-sensitized solar cells toward the broader light harvesting of the solar spectrum  ap. 1471-1487.  aDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been extensively evolved for the past two decades in order to improve their cell performance. From the commercialization point of view, the overall solar to electrical energy conversion efficiency should compete with other solar cells. But, due to structural restrictions of DSSC using the liquid electrolyte and a space requirement between two electrodes, the direct tandem construction of DSSCs by stacking of repeating units is highly limited. In this feature article, important research trials to overcome these barriers and a recent research trend to improve the light harvesting strategies mainly panchromatic engineering, various tandem approaches such as parallel tandem, series tandem, p–n tandem etc., have been briefly reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3acommercialization 3aelectric power 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy conversion 3aliquids 3asolar cells1 aLee, Minoh1 aKang, Man-gu,1 aJun, Yongseok0 tChemical communications.g2013 Jan. 24, v. 49, no. 15 p.1471-1487dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2cc37616d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024003700128040001800165100001200183245014200195300001800337520113000355592002801485596007001513596007901583596006601662596007001728596006301798596006301861650001201924650001401936650001201950650001001962650002201972650001301994650002002007650001002027650001402037650002002051650002302071650002602094650003102120653003602151653001702187653002302204653004202227653003602269700001902305700001302324700002202337700002402359700002102383700006402404773014802468856008102616961001302697852000902710655001202719IND60608705620221116200739.0180808e20180629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060870562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b000882doi7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b000882chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Qi10aUsing a Vegetative Environmental Buffer to Reduce the Concentrations of Volatile Organic Compounds in Poultry-House Atmospheric Emissions  ap. 8231-8236.  aGround-level ozone is formed when volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react with hydroxyl radicals and nitrogen oxides in the presence of ultraviolet light. Research has typically focused on the release and control of VOCs from hydrocarbon processing; however, agricultural activities, such as poultry production, can also be VOC sources and potentially contribute to ozone pollution. Therefore, this study examines the emission of C₂–C₆ VOCs from poultry houses and the use of a vegetative environmental buffer (VEB) as a potential mitigation strategy. Sampling campaigns were conducted at two farms, one with and one without a VEB. Of the nine compounds measured, methanol, ethanol, and acetone were the primary VOCs emitted and had the largest ozone-formation potential (OFP). A significantly larger decrease in the OFP for methanol as a function of distance from the poultry house was observed at the farm with the VEB as compared with at the farm without the VEB. These results suggest that besides being a visual barrier and particulate screen, VEBs can provide some control of VOCs emitted from poultry production.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cNatural Resources Conservation Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009171  cOklahoma State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007069  cPennsylvania State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008321  cUniversity of Delawaredhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006094  cUniversity of Marylanddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008510 3aacetone 3aemissions 3aethanol 3afarms 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amethanol 3anitrogen oxides 3aozone 3apollution 3apoultry housing 3apoultry production 3aultraviolet radiation 3avolatile organic compounds 0avolatile organic compound (VOC) 0aVOC emission 0apoultry production 0avegetative environmental buffer (VEB) 0aozone-formation potential (OFP)1 aTorrents, Alba1 aLi, Hong1 aBuser, Michael D.1 aMcConnell, Laura L.1 aDowney, Peter M.1 aHapeman, Cathleen J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3439-28260 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 June 29, v. 66, no. 31 p.8231-8236dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b000883Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03769naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009700169300001600266520207600282592002802358650002202386650002802408650001402436650002902450650002202479650001702501650003802518650001502556650001902571650001102590650002102601650001702622650001802639650002502657650001302682650001602695653006002711653003002771653003402801653003302835653002202868653001902890653002302909700002202932700002102954700002702975700002303002773010603025856008703131852000903218655001203227IND60568102720221122042305.0180830e20171105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056810272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.04.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPucek, Agata10aPhosphatidylcholine with conjugated linoleic acid in fabrication of novel lipid nanocarriers  ap. 377-388.  aExploration of novel lipid-based formulations has been an aim for researchers over the last decades. Lipid nanoparticles have been extensively studied as bioactive agent carriers in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields. In our studies, we have provided properties of two different types of lipid nanocarriers, i.e. solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) prepared via high pressure homogenization. The choice of surfactants in the structural design is one of the most significant approaches to achieve nanocarriers with desirable parameters that acquire both good stability and requested physical state.The present work has been carried out to explore the potential for fabrication of stable and nearly monodisperse lipid nanoparticles stabilized by functionalized phosphatidylcholine, i.e., 1,2-di(conjugated)linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ((CLA)PC) which may comprise a potential lipid prodrug. Additionally, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ((SA)PC) was taken into account as the surfactant to be compared. The sizes of the studied nanosystems (about 130–230nm in diameter DH) along with the size distribution (polydiyspersity index PdI below 0.3) were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS), while the morphology was imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The studied nanoparticles physical state was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The NLCs have shown less ordered crystalline structure than the SLNs nanoproducts, this observation being conferred by the inclusion of a liquid lipid. The in vitro cytotoxicity studies were performed on human cancer epidermoid carcinoma (A431) and MeWo cells using trypan blue staining and MTT assays. Nanocarriers labeled by cyanine IR-780 were efficient in bioimaging (MeWo). Our results give new insights into the lipid nanoparticles containing the pharmaceutically promising (CLA)PC and may serve as guidelines for design and preparation of new effective delivery nanosystems, including anti-cancer applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic force microscopy 3acarcinoma 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3acrystal structure 3acytotoxicity 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aguidelines 3ahomogenization 3ahumans 3alight scattering 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aphosphatidylcholines 3astaining 3asurfactants 0a1,2-Di(conjugated)linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 0aSolid lipid nanoparticles 0aNanostructured lipid carriers 0aHigh pressure homogenization 0aStability studies 0aPhysical state 0aCytotoxic activity1 aNiezgoda, Natalia1 aKulbacka, Julita1 aWawrzeńczyk, Czesław1 aWilk, Kazimiera A.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Nov. 05, v. 532 p.377-388dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.04.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245009800177300001600275520141400291592002801705650001701733650002501750650001801775650001601793650001601809650001401825650001301839650001501852650001501867650001901882650001301901650001401914650001001928650002201938650001201960650002201972650003101994650004002025650000902065650001902074650001302093650002502106650000902131650001702140650001202157650004002169653001302209653002602222653003602248653001702284700002802301700002102329700002102350700003002371700002702401700002302428700003002451700002302481773009102504856009002595852000902685655001202694IND60606785620221118003236.0180730e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060678562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.02.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontazeri, Leila10aImprovement of islet engrafts by enhanced angiogenesis and microparticle-mediated oxygenation  ap. 157-165.  aA major hindrance in islet transplantation as a feasible therapeutic approach for patients with type 1 diabetes is the insufficient oxygenation of the grafts, which results in cell death in portions of the implant. Here we address this limitation through the application of oxygen-generating microparticles (MP) and a fibrin-conjugated heparin/VEGF collagen scaffold to support cell survival by using a β cell line and pancreatic rat islets. MP are composed of a polyvinylpyrrolidone/hydrogen peroxide (PVP/H2O2) core and poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) shell, along with immobilized catalase on the shell. The presence of MP is sufficient to reduce hypoxia-induced cell dysfunction and death for both cell types, resulting in localization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) into the cytoplasm and enhanced metabolic function. After co-transplantation of MP and a reduced islet mass (250 islet equivalents) within an angiogenic scaffold in the omental pouch of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nude mice, we have observed significantly promoted graft function as evidenced by improved blood glucose levels, body weight, glucose tolerance, serum C-peptide, and graft revascularization. These results suggest that the developed platform has great potential to enhance the efficacy for implants in cases where the cell dosage is critical for efficacy, such as islet transplantation and ischemic tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3abiochemical pathways 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3ac-peptide 3acatalase 3acell death 3acell lines 3acell viability 3acollagen 3acytoplasm 3adeath 3aglucose tolerance 3aheparin 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3amice 3amicroparticles 3apatients 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3arats 3atherapeutics 3atissues 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aDiabetes 0aIslet transplantation 0aOxygen-generating microparticle 0aAngiogenesis1 aHojjati-Emami, Shahriar1 aBonakdar, Shahin1 aTahamtani, Yaser1 aHajizadeh-Saffar, Ensiyeh1 aNoori-Keshtkar, Marjan1 aNajar-Asl, Mostafa1 aAshtiani, Mohammad Kazemi1 aBaharvand, Hossein0 tBiomaterials.g2016 May, v. 89 p.157-165dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.02.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008100156300001800237520116000255592002801415650004901443650002001492650001301512650001301525650002401538650002301562650001601585650002001601650002201621700001701643700001701660700001501677700001601692700001701708773012501725856007501850852000901925655001201934IND60534750220170605000000.0160803e20130820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053475022DNAL7 a10.1021/es401490t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFourdrin, C.10aWater Radiolysis in Exchanged-Montmorillonites: The H2 Production Mechanisms  ap. 9530-9537.  aThe radiolysis of water confined in montmorillonites is studied as a function of the composition of the montmorillonite, the nature of the exchangeable cation, and the relative humidity by following the H₂ production under electron irradiation. It is shown that the main factor influencing this H₂ production is the water amount in the interlayer space. The effect of the exchangeable cation is linked to its hydration enthalpy. When the water amount is high enough to get a basal distance higher than 1.3 nm, then a total energy transfer from the montmorillonite sheets to the interlayer space occurs, and the H₂ production measured is very similar to the one obtained in bulk water. For a basal distance smaller than 1.3 nm, the H₂ production increases with the relative humidity and thus with the water amount. Lastly, electron paramagnetic resonance measurements evidence the formation of a new defect induced by ionizing radiation. It consists of a hydrogen radical (H₂ precursor) trapped in the structure. This implies that structural hydroxyl bonds can be broken under irradiation, potentially accounting for the observed H₂ production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenergy transfer 3aenthalpy 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aionizing radiation 3airradiation 3amontmorillonite 3arelative humidity1 aAarrachi, H.1 aLatrille, C.1 aEsnouf, S.1 aBergaya, F.1 aLe Caër, S.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 Aug. 20, v. 47, no. 16 p.9530-9537dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes401490t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01928naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011400168520061000282592002800892650001200920650001800932650001900950650003100969650002001000650001301020653003201033653002801065653002701093653001501120653003101135700001801166700001301184700001501197700001701212700001201229700001901241700001601260700001601276773010601292856008701398852000901485655001201494IND60689840920221120175618.0200523e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068984092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1234162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Huanfei10aKey process parameters for deep eutectic solvents pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass materials: A review  aDeep eutectic solvent (DES) has been considered as a novel green solvent for lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment.

However, the toxicity of QDs is largely unknown and the underlying mechanism is still undefined. This study was conducted to examine the hepatotoxicity of CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs and the underlying mechanism. In hepatic L02 cells, the QDs caused cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. The QDs were then shown to activate the NLR pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in hepatocytes, leading to a novel pro-inflammatory form of cell death named pyroptosis. Further experiments demonstrated that the QDs induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production, and that both a mtROS and a total ROS scavenger attenuated QDs-induced NLRP3 activation and pyroptosis. In addition, QDs increased cytoplasmic calcium (Ca²⁺) levels, while a Ca²⁺ release antagonist and chelator alleviated QDs-induced mtROS, NLRP3 activation and subsequent pyroptosis in hepatocytes. In vivo, QDs administration induced liver inflammation and dysfunction. Moreover, the QDs also resulted in NLRP3 activation in liver tissue. However, QDs-induced liver inflammation and dysfunction were abolished in NLRP3 knockout mice. Also, an elevation in mtROS was observed in liver after QDs administration, and the mtROS scavenger suppressed liver NLRP3 activation, inflammation and dysfunction induced by QDs. Our data suggest that QDs induced hepatocyte pyroptosis, liver inflammation and dysfunction via NLRP3 activation, which was caused by QDs-triggered mtROS production and Ca²⁺ mobilization. Our results provide novel insights into QDs-induced hepatotoxicity and the underlying mechanism, facilitating control of the side effects of QDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aantagonists 3acalcium 3acell death 3achelating agents 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatotoxicity 3ainflammasomes 3ainflammation 3aknockout mutants 3aliver 3amitochondria 3aquantum dots 3areactive oxygen species 3azinc sulfide 0aQuantum dots 0aHepatocyte pyroptosis 0aLiver inflammation 0aNLRP3 0aReactive oxygen species 0aCalcium mobilization 0aQDs 0aNLRP3 0amtROS 0aASC 0aIL-1β 0aPAMPs 0aDAMPs 0aTEM 0aNAC 0a2-APB 0aNLRP3 KO 0aLDH 0aTNF-α 0asiRNA 0aHBSS 0aWT 0aCasp1 p20 0apro-Casp1 0aFCM 0amRNA 0aMPO 0aCXCL1 0aALP 0aALT 0aAST 0aYVAD 0aTEMPO 0aH&E 0aγGT1 aXu, Shangcheng1 aChen, Haiyan1 aHe, Mindi1 aDeng, Youcai1 aCao, Zhengwang1 aPi, Huifeng1 aChen, Chunhai1 aLi, Min1 aMa, Qinlong1 aGao, Peng1 aJi, Yan1 aZhang, Lei1 aYu, Zhengping1 aZhou, Zhou0 tBiomaterials.g2016 June, v. 90 p.27-39dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245005800207300001800265506007600283520157300359592002801932506003701960650002101997650002202018650001502040650001802055650001302073650002402086650001002110650001202120650002102132650001802153650002302171650001802194700002002212700001902232700002502251700002202276773017302298856007902471852000902550655001202559IND60230311620221207050826.0150614e20140225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023031162DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13159741112doi7 aPMC39398762pmcid7 a244532122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLybecker, Meghan14aThe double-stranded transcriptome of Escherichia coli  ap. 3134-3139.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAdvances in high-throughput transcriptome analyses have revealed hundreds of antisense RNAs (asRNAs) for many bacteria, although few have been characterized, and the number of functional asRNAs remains unknown. We have developed a genome-wide high-throughput method to identify functional asRNAs in vivo. Most mechanisms of gene regulation via asRNAs require an RNA–RNA interaction with its target RNA, and we hypothesized that a functional asRNA would be found in a double strand (dsRNA), duplexed with its cognate RNA in a single cell. We developed a method of isolating dsRNAs from total RNA by immunoprecipitation with a ds-RNA specific antibody. Total RNA and immunoprecipitated dsRNA from Escherichia coli RNase III WT and mutant strains were deep-sequenced. A statistical model was applied to filter for biologically relevant dsRNA regions, which were subsequently categorized by location relative to annotated genes. A total of 316 potentially functional asRNAs were identified in the RNase III mutant strain and are encoded primarily opposite to the 5′ ends of transcripts, but are also found opposite ncRNAs, gene junctions, and the 3′ ends. A total of 21 sense/antisense RNA pairs identified in dsRNAs were confirmed by Northern blot analyses. Most of the RNA steady-state levels were higher or detectable only in the RNase III mutant strain. Taken together, our data indicate that a significant amount of dsRNA is formed in the cell, that RNase III degrades or processes these dsRNAs, and that dsRNA plays a major role in gene regulation in E. coli .  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aNorthern blotting 3aantibodies 3aantisense RNA 3abacteria 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agenes 3amutants 3aprecipitin tests 3aribonucleases 3astatistical models 3atranscriptome1 aZimmermann, Bob1 aBilusic, Ivana1 aTukhtubaeva, Nadezda1 aSchroeder, Renée0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Feb. 25, v. 111, no. 8 p.3134-3139dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13159741113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245007700168300001600245520099200261592002801253650004401281650002201325650001401347650001301361650002001374650001901394650001101413650001201424650001601436650001801452650001201470650001501482653001201497653001501509653000801524653001101532653001201543700001901555700001901574700001801593773010601611856008701717852000901804655001201813IND60568103020221122033020.0180830e20171105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056810302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.04.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvanova, T.10aSol-gel derived ZnO:Y nanostructured films: Structural and optical study  ap. 363-368.  aThe study is focused on the sol-gel derived ZnO:Y nanostructured films with different yttrium concentrations. The sol-gel Y doped ZnO films have been successfully deposited on Si and quartz substrates by spin coating method. The effect of thermal treatment is researched depending on their structural and optical properties. The annealing temperatures are changed in the range of 300–800°C. XRD patterns reveal that the crystallization of Y doped ZnO films is significantly deteriorated and the broader and less intense XRD lines are observed compared to single ZnO. The XRD analysis shows that increasing the yttrium contents and the annealing temperatures lead to the formation of cubic yttrium oxide. This conclusion has been confirmed by FTIR analysis. Optical transmittance in the visible spectral range diminishes with yttrium doping especially significant for ZnO:Y films with highest Y content. The determined optical band gaps of ZnO:Y films are wider compared to single ZnO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aannealing 3acoatings 3acrystallization 3aheat treatment 3aquartz 3asilicon 3atemperature 3atransmittance 3ayttrium 3azinc oxide 0aSol-gel 0aThin films 0aZnO 0aDoping 0aOptical1 aHarizanova, A.1 aKoutzarova, T.1 aVertruyen, B.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Nov. 05, v. 532 p.363-368dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.04.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245009400210300001800304506007600322520172100398592002802119506003702147650003102184650001402215650001802229650001102247650001402258650001802272650001702290650001302307650001102320700002802331700002202359700002502381700001902406700001902425700002702444700002302471700002202494700002502516773017302541856007902714852000902793655001202802IND60230311720221207065525.0150614e20140225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023031172DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13161781112doi7 aPMC39399182pmcid7 a245161582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMackenzie, Karen J.10aEffector and central memory T helper 2 cells respond differently to peptide immunotherapy  ap. E784-E793.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPeptide immunotherapy (PIT) offers realistic prospects for the treatment of allergic diseases, including allergic asthma. Much is understood of the behavior of naive T cells in response to PIT. However, treatment of patients with ongoing allergic disease requires detailed understanding of the responses of allergen-experienced T cells. CD62L expression by allergen-experienced T cells corresponds to effector/effector memory (CD62L ˡᵒ) and central memory (CD62L ʰⁱ) subsets, which vary with allergen exposure (e.g., during, or out with, pollen season). The efficacy of PIT on different T helper 2 (Th2) cell memory populations is unknown. We developed a murine model of PIT in allergic airway inflammation (AAI) driven by adoptively transferred, traceable ovalbumin-experienced Th2 cells. PIT effectively suppressed AAI driven by unfractionated Th2 cells. Selective transfer of CD62L ʰⁱ and CD62L ˡᵒ Th2 cells revealed that these two populations behaved differently from one another and from previously characterized (early deletional) responses of naive CD4 ⁺ T cells to PIT. Most notably, allergen-reactive CD62L ˡᵒ Th2 cells were long-lived within the lung after PIT, before allergen challenge, in contrast to CD62L ʰⁱ Th2 cells. Despite this, PIT was most potent against CD62L ˡᵒ Th2 cells in protecting from AAI, impairing their ability to produce Th2 cytokines, whereas this capacity was heightened in PIT-treated CD62L ʰⁱ Th2 cells. We conclude that Th2 cells do not undergo an early deletional form of tolerance after PIT. Moreover, memory Th2 subsets respond differently to PIT. These findings have implications for the clinical translation of PIT in different allergic scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aallergens 3aanimal models 3aasthma 3acytokines 3aimmunotherapy 3ainflammation 3apatients 3apollen1 aNowakowska, Dominika J.1 aLeech, Melanie D.1 aMcFarlane, Amanda J.1 aWilson, Claire1 aFitch, Paul M.1 aO’Connor, Richard A.1 aHowie, Sarah E.

The mgtC transcript includes a long leader region that harbors a short proline codon-rich ORF—termed mgtP —the translation of which is predicted to favor formation of one of two alternative stem-loop structures. We now report that the mgtP proline codons are critical for expression of the mgtC coding region inside host cells, for Salmonella survival inside macrophages, and for virulence in mice. We determine that the mgtP proline codons mediate the response to proline-charged tRNA ᴾʳᵒ, the levels of which decrease under proline limitation and/or hyperosmotic stress. The host compartment harboring Salmonella appears to be limited in proline because proline auxotrophs were defective for intramacrophage survival and virulence in mice. Salmonella seems to experience hyperosmotic stress during infection because osmotically regulated genes were highly induced inside phagocytic cells. Replacing mgtP proline codons with codons specifying threonine converted the mgtC leader into a threonine-responding element. Our findings indicate that an attenuation-like mechanism governs transcription elongation into the mgtCBR coding region. Moreover, they highlight how pathogens construe host signals by the effect they have on bacterial constituents.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aauxotrophs 3acodons 3amacrophages 3amice 3aoperon 3apathogens 3aproline 3athreonine 3atransfer RNA 3avirulence 0aleader mRNA 0atranscription attenuation1 aChoi, Jeongjoon1 aGroisman, Eduardo A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Feb. 25, v. 111, no. 8 p.3140-3145dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13162091113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01991naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245018200169300001600351520092400367592002801291650001401319650001401333650001101347650001101358650001401369650001401383700002501397700001901422700002301441700001801464773007801482856008401560852000901644655001201653IND60096403720221119073023.0141104e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009640372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2012.01.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrana, Roberto12aA wide range kinetic modeling study of pyrolysis and oxidation of methyl butanoate and methyl decanoate. Note I: Lumped kinetic model of methyl butanoate and small methyl esters  ap. 124-139.  aA lumped kinetic model of methyl butanoate pyrolysis and oxidation is presented and discussed in this work. The hierarchical approach first required the development and validation of sub-mechanisms of small esters such as methyl formate, methyl acrylate and methyl crotonate. A broad-ranging validation of the whole kinetic scheme of methyl butanoate oxidation was then carried out through comparisons with experimental data obtained in shock tube devices, plug flow and jet stirred reactors, rapid compression machines and premixed laminar flames. A detailed analysis of laminar flame speeds complements and extends this kinetic study. The lumped model predicts a wide range of experiments well, thus constituting a flexible and reliable kinetic scheme despite the reduced number of species involved. Moreover, this lumped approach and the proposed model lay the foundation for an extension to biodiesel fuel modeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3aequipment 3aesters 3amodels 3aoxidation 3apyrolysis1 aFrassoldati, Alessio1 aCuoci, Alberto1 aFaravelli, Tiziano1 aRanzi, Eliseo0 tEnergy.g2012 July, v. 43, no. 1 p.124-139dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2012.01.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007800165300002000243500001900263520106900282592002801351596008701379650001501466650001201481650001601493650002601509650001301535650001401548650001401562650001101576650002401587650001301611700002701624700002401651700001501675773016801690856008301858852000901941655001201950IND60693843520221120223735.0200517e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069384352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-06193-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Weixing10aEvaluation of groundwater hardness removal using activated clinoptilolite  ap. 17541-17549.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCurrent study aimed to investigate modified natural clinoptilolite for removal of calcium and magnesium from the groundwater. Feasibility of clinoptilolite for groundwater hardness removal in production and operation was verified by static adsorption experiment and the experiment of fixed bed and degasification column. Subsequently, the main parameters for groundwater treatment using clinoptilolite were also explored. Results show that in the process of clinoptilolite in adsorption is dominant reaction process. The adsorption equilibrium time was unchanged when the hardness of raw water changes from 450 to 550 mg/L. With respect to comparative analysis of price and performance, NaCl found to be the most suitable clinoptilolite regenerated agent. The adsorption efficiency was high when the residence time was 20–25 min in the pilot experiments. The reaction mechanism was mainly substitution reaction according to ion equilibrium, and the treatment capacity of the degasifier combined with the fixed bed was 20% higher than that of with only fixed bed.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFC0809904cNational Key Technologies Research and Development Program (China) 3aadsorption 3acalcium 3agroundwater 3agroundwater treatment 3ahardness 3amagnesium 3apollution 3aprices 3areaction mechanisms 3aresearch1 aSingh, Rajendra Prasad1 aJothivel, Saravanan1 aFu, Dafang0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 May, v. 27, no. 15 p.17541-17549dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06193-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245008700166300001800253520099100271592002801262650001901290650001701309650001001326650002101336650001601357650001201373650000901385650002301394650002501417650001701442650001401459650001201473650001601485650001101501650000901512650001101521653002201532653002001554653002601574653002401600653000901624653001601633700002001649700002001669700002001689700001901709700002501728700002701753700006201780773014801842856008001990852000902070655001202079IND60608706020221116200804.0180808e20180713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060870602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b018352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Sandeep10aMicrobial Protein Produced from Brown Seaweed and Spruce Wood as a Feed Ingredient  ap. 8328-8335.  aThe conversion of nonedible biomass to protein for use in feed is an attractive strategy toward improved sustainability in aquaculture. We have studied the possibility to produce protein-rich yeast Candida utilis on a medium consisting of enzymatically hydrolyzed sulphite-pulped spruce wood, mainly providing glucose, and enzymatically hydrolyzed brown seaweed, supplemented with ammonium sulfate. The results show that this blend constitutes a complete fermentation medium that enables good growth rates and cell yields. Results from a salmon feeding trial showed that the yeast can replace parts of a traditional fishmeal diet without harmful effects, although the apparent protein digestibility coefficient for the yeast was suboptimal. While further optimization of both the fermentation process and downstream processing is needed, the present proof-of-concept study shows a path to the production of microbial protein based on a simple, local and sustainable fermentation medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida utilis 3aPhaeophyceae 3aPicea 3aammonium sulfate 3aaquaculture 3abiomass 3adiet 3adigestible protein 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afermentation 3afish meal 3aglucose 3aingredients 3asalmon 3awood 3ayeasts 0amicrobial protein 0aseaweed, spruce 0aenzymatic hydrolysate 0ayeast, fermentation 0afeed 0aaquaculture1 aHansen, Line D.1 aHansen, Jon Ø.1 aMydland, Liv T.1 aHorn, Svein J.1 aØverland, Margareth1 aEijsink, Vincent G.

Contrary to medium and large municipalities, small systems do not have appropriate equipment to face important variations of raw water quality, and they do not have enough information either on the impact of these alterations. The objective of this study is to develop a decision-making tool to small system operators allowing the determination of risk periods, based on easily accessible measures. The impact of several raw water quality parameters and climate factors on drinking water quality was under study. A stepwise regression analysis was applied to determine the most important factors. Two of them were retained: the level of UV₂₅₄ of raw water and average maximal air temperature of 15 days before measurement. These factors are representative of raw water quality or meteorological conditions and are easily accessible to systems with restricted financial capacities. A logistic regression analysis contributed to the estimation of the probability to provide drinking water of bad quality (defined by a drinking water quality index). Finally, results of the analysis were synthetized in a visual tool, allowing the identification of risk periods using the known values of UV₂₅₄ and average maximal air temperature of 15 days. This tool may strongly contribute to the improvement of drinking water management in small systems, as it provides easily accessible information on the risks of deterioration of drinking water quality using two simple parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimatic factors 3adecision support systems 3adrinking water 3aequipment 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3awater management 3awater quality1 aDelpla, I.1 aSadiq, R.1 aRodriguez, M.

However, the lithium metal may react with the electrolyte, resulting in the instability of the solid/liquid interface. The solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer was found to affect the interface stability of the lithium metal anode; the real structure of SEI couldn’t be accurately analyzed so far. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) has been thought as a powerful tool to carry out three-dimensional (3D) characterization and structural reconstruction at a high-resolution nanoscale, as well as detect ionized elements and molecule fragments at the ppb level due to its excellent sensitivity. Herein, we employed TOF-SIMS to investigate the chemical composition of SEI at the surface of the lithium metal anode after electrochemical cycles. We find that SEI is not a completely dense interface layer. The organic phase of SEI can accommodate part of the electrolyte, enhancing the lithium-ion conductivity. Meanwhile, SEI is an interface layer that changes with the state of the electrolyte, and this process of change is expressed by conventional characterization methods. However, the distribution of lithium salt can be analyzed by TOF-SIMS to judge the change degree of SEI. Our work provides significant guidance for accurately characterizing the SEI layer, as well as constructing a more realistic interface layer model.  aPublisher supplied data  a22075026cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2020M680374cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002858 3aanodes 3achemical composition 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3aionization 3aliquids 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 0alithium metal battery 0aSEI 0aTOF-SIMS 0ainterfacial layer 0aexcellent sensitivity1 aXu, Fan1 aSong, Tinglu0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Apr. 26, v. 14, no. 17 p.20197-20207dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.2c008423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
