S.14aThe 2014 southeast Brazil austral summer drought: regional scale mechanisms and teleconnections  ap. 3737-3752.  aThe southeast region of Brazil experienced in austral summer 2014 a major drought event leading to a number of impacts in water availability for human consumption, agricultural irrigation and hydropower production. This study aims to perform a diagnostic analysis of the observed climate conditions during this event, including an inspection of the occurred precipitation anomalies in the context of previous years, and an investigation of possible relationships with sea surface temperatures and atmospheric circulation patterns. The sea surface temperature analysis revealed that the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean region near the coast of southeast Brazil showed strong negative association with precipitation over southeast Brazil, indicating that increased sea temperatures in this ocean region are consistent with reduced precipitation as observed in summer 2014. The circulation analysis revealed prevailing anti-cyclonic anomalies at lower levels (850 hPa) with northerly anomalies to the west of southeast Brazil, channeling moisture from the Amazon towards Paraguay, northern Argentina and southern Brazil, and drier than normal air from the South Atlantic Ocean towards the southeast region of Brazil. This circulation pattern was found to be part of a large-scale teleconnection wave train linked with the subsidence branch of the Walker circulation in the tropical east Pacific, which in turn was generated by an anomalous tropical heat source in north/northeastern Australia. A regional Hadley circulation with an ascending branch to the south of the subsidence branch of the Walker circulation in the tropical east Pacific was identified as an important component connecting the tropical and extratropical circulation. The ascending branch of this Hadley circulation in the south Pacific coincided with an identified Rossby wave source region, which contributed to establishing the extratropical component of the large-scale wave train connecting the south Pacific and the Atlantic region surrounding southeast Brazil. This connection between the Pacific and the Atlantic was confirmed with Rossby ray tracing analyses. The local circulation response was associated to downward air motion (subsidence) over Southeast Brazil, contributing to the expressive negative precipitation anomalies observed during summer 2014, and leading to a major drought event in the historical context. The analysis of atmospheric and oceanic patterns of this event helped defining a schematic framework leading to the observed drought conditions in southeast Brazil, including the involved teleconnections, blocking high pressure, radiative and humidity transport effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric circulation 3aclimate 3acoasts 3adrought 3aheat 3ahumans 3ahumidity 3airrigated farming 3asubsidence 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3awater power 3aArgentina 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aAustralia 3aBrazil 3aParaguay1 ade Oliveira, Cristiano Prestrelo1 aAmbrizzi, Tércio,1 aReboita, Michelle Simões1 aCarpenedo, Camila Bertoletti1 aCampos, José Leandro Pereira Silveira1 aTomaziello, Ana Carolina Nóbile1 aPampuch, Luana Albertani1 aCustódio, Maria de Souza1 aDutra, Lívia Marcia Mosso1 aDa Rocha, Rosmeri P.1 aRehbein, Amanda0 tClimate dynamics.g2016 June, v. 46, no. 11-12 p.3737-3752dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-015-2800-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245010600164300001400270500001100284520084600295592002801141596004501169596006601214596006901280650002101349650001901370650002001389650001601409650001501425650002101440650000901461650002401470700002001494700002101514700001701535700001801552700001801570700001601588773011101604856008001715852000901795655001201804IND60786766920221119073213.0220805e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078676692DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.125082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jong-Sub,10aMicroRNA‐101b attenuates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by inhibiting protein kinase C epsilon signaling  ap. 16-27.  aLETTER  aPreviously, a surgical regression model identified microRNA‐101b (miR‐101b) as a potential inhibitor of cardiac hypertrophy. Here, we investigated the antihypertrophic mechanism of miR‐101b using neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. miR‐101b markedly suppressed agonist‐induced cardiac hypertrophy as shown by cell size and fetal gene expression. By systems biology approaches, we identified protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) as the major target of miR‐101b. Our results from qRT‐PCR, western blot, and luciferase reporter assays confirm that PKCε is a direct target of miR‐101b. In addition, we found that effectors downstream of PKCε (p‐AKT, p‐ERK1/2, p‐NFAT, and p‐GSK3β) are also affected by miR‐101b. Our study reveals a novel inhibitory mechanism for miR‐101b as a negative regulator of cardiac hypertrophy.  aPublisher supplied data  c2016 GIST Research Institute (GRI) Grant  aNRF‐2013M3A9A7046297cNational Research Foundation of Korea  cKorea Government, the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning 3aWestern blotting 3acardiomyocytes 3agene expression 3ahypertrophy 3aluciferase 3aprotein kinase C 3arats 3aregression analysis1 aYang, Dong Kwon1 aPark, Jei Hyoung1 aKim, Jin Ock1 aPark, Woo Jin1 aCho, Chunghee1 aKim, Do Han0 tFEBS letters.g2017 Jan., v. 591, no. 1 p.16-27dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.125083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012700173300001600300520190500316592002802221650001702249650000902266650001702275650001502292650001602307650002202323650001202345650001502357650001102372650002102383650001402404650002102418650001802439653001002457653001002467653002402477653003102501653001602532653001502548700001802563773008502581856008402666852000902750655001202759IND60113861020221118002954.0161019e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011386102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2013.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVera-Jimenez, N.I.10aCarp head kidney leukocytes display different patterns of oxygen radical production after stimulation with PAMPs and DAMPs  ap. 231-236.  aWound healing and tissue regeneration are essential mechanisms to ensure the survival and health of any organism. Despite this, only a few studies have been devoted to study tissue regeneration during wound healing in fish. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), in particular hydrogen peroxide, play an important dual role both for promoting tissue repair, but also for eradication of pathogens. This study aims at dissecting the contribution of PAMPs (using β-glucan) and DAMPs in the respiratory burst response of carp head kidney-derived leukocytes, and address their contribution to wound healing processes. Consistent with a pathogen eradication strategy, ROS responses to PAMP stimulation (β-glucan) was fast, vigorous and highly dominated by production of superoxide anion. In contrast, stimulation with DAMPs led to a slow, subtle but long-lasting production of oxygen radicals dominated by hydrogen peroxide. Using an in vitro model of scratch-wounded CCB fibroblast cell cultures and a novel PhotoID proliferation assay, stimulation with low and continuous levels of hydrogen peroxide (5μM) led to a slight increase in the percentage of wound recovery and thus promoted wound closure. In contrast, high doses of hydrogen peroxide (300μM) impaired fibroblast scratch-wound recovery and caused cell death. These results elucidate the capacity of hydrogen peroxide to influence the fate of tissue regeneration through the establishment of environments suitable for promoting either tissue regeneration or oxidative stress and thereby potential tissue damage. Direct in vitro stimulation with β-glucans did not impact fibroblast scratch-wound recovery, which further suggests that interaction with tissue-resident leukocytes or other components of the fish immune system are required to induce fibroblast proliferation and thus for the accelerated wound healing promoted by β-glucan stimulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-glucans 3acarp 3acell culture 3acell death 3afibroblasts 3ahydrogen peroxide 3akidneys 3aleukocytes 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3apathogens 3asuperoxide anion 3atissue repair 0aPAMPs 0aDAMPs 0aTissue regeneration 0aRespiratory burst kinetics 0aCommon carp 0aβ-Glucans1 aNielsen, M.E.0 tMolecular Immunology.g2013 Oct., v. 55 p.231-236dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2013.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245010800167300001600275520146400291592002801755650002401783650001301807650001301820650001501833650001301848650001001861650002301871650002501894653003901919653002501958653003201983700001902015700002402034773012802058856008002186852000902266655001202275IND60480768120221119074045.0160706e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048076812DNAL7 a10.3138/jvme.1111.112R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArlt, Sebastian P.10aTraining Evidence-Based Veterinary Medicine by Collaborative Development of Critically Appraised Topics  ap. 111-118.  aIn current veterinary education, skills such as retrieving, critically appraising, interpreting, and applying the results of published scientific studies are rarely taught. In this study, the authors tested the concept of team-based development of critically appraised topics (CATs) in training students in evidence-based veterinary medicine (EBVM). The 116 participants were in their fifth year and attending the clinical rotation at the Clinic for Animal Reproduction. Students developed 18 CATs of varying quality on topics of their choice. Preparing the CATs in teams stimulated discussion on the topic and the quality of the retrieved papers. Evaluation of the project revealed that more than 90% of the students endorsed training in critical appraisal of information in veterinary education. In addition, more than 90% considered the development of CATs an effective exercise for assessing the quality of scientific literature. A provided literature evaluation form was perceived as a useful tool for systematically summarizing a publication's quality. In conclusion, team-based development of CATs during clinical rotations is highly valuable for training in EBVM. Learning and intrinsic motivation seem to be enhanced by creating a situation similar to veterinary practice because the task is embedded into an authentic clinical problem. This approach to clinical training helps to prepare students to integrate evidence from literature into practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal reproduction 3aexercise 3alearning 3amotivation 3astudents 3ateams 3aveterinary clinics 3aveterinary education 0aevidence-based veterinary medicine 0aveterinary education 0acritically appraised topics1 aHaimerl, Peggy1 aHeuwieser, Wolfgang0 tJournal of veterinary medical education.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 39, no. 2 p.111-118dUniversity of Toronto Pressx0748-321X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3138%2Fjvme.1111.112R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245012800177300001600305520107300321592002801394650001501422650002701437650001501464650000901479653002901488653001101517653001501528653001301543653000801556700002301564700002101587773010101608856008501709852000901794655001201803IND60573685420221122004528.0170724e20170902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057368542DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2016.11708922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKutlug Sahin, Emrehan10aInvestigation of automatic feature weighting methods (Fisher, Chi-square and Relief-F) for landslide susceptibility mapping  ap. 956-977.  aIn landslide susceptibility mapping, factor weights have been usually determined by expert judgements. A novel methodology for weighting landslide causative factors by integrating statistical feature weighting algorithms was proposed. The primary focus of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of automatic feature weighting algorithms, namely Fisher, Chi-square and Relief-F algorithms. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was used as a benchmark method to compare the performances of the weighting algorithms. All weighted factors were tested using factor-weighted overlay method, and quality of these maps was assessed using overall accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC) and success rate curve. In addition, Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test was applied to evaluate statistical differences between both estimated overall accuracies and AUCs, respectively. Results showed that the weights determined by feature weighting methods outperformed the conventional AHP method by about 6% and this level of differences was found to be statistically significant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ageographical variation 3alandslides 3arisk 0aLandslide susceptibility 0aFisher 0aChi-square 0aRelief-F 0aAHP1 aIpbuker, Cengizhan1 aKavzoglu, Taskin0 tGeocarto international.g2017 Sept. 2, v. 32, no. 9 p.956-977dTaylor & Francisx1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2016.11708923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011200164300001800276520195500294592002802249650001502277650001502292650002102307650002302328650001202351650002102363650002902384650002302413650003102436650001202467650001602479650001302495650002602508650001502534650001502549700001902564700002502583700002502608700002502633700002302658700001702681700002202698773015702720856007902877852000902956655001202965IND60114847020221117213706.0141124e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011484702DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.112.0390572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibson, Andrew10aEffect of fruit and vegetable consumption on immune function in older people: a randomized controlled trial  ap. 1429-1436.  aBackground: Fruit and vegetable (FV) intake, which is often low in older people, is associated with reduced chronic disease risk.Objective: We determined whether increased FV intake improves measures of immune function.Design: We conducted a randomized controlled trial (The Ageing and Dietary Intervention Trial) in 83 healthy volunteers aged 65–85 y with low FV intakes (≤2 portions/d); 82 subjects completed the intervention. Participants were assigned to continue their normal diets or to consume ≥5 FV portions/d for 16 wk. At 12 wk, tetanus toxoid (0.5 mL intramuscular) and Pneumovax II vaccine (0.5 mL intramuscular; both vaccines from Sanofi Pasteur) were administered. FV intake was monitored by using diet histories, and biomarkers of nutritional status were assessed. The primary endpoint was the antibody response to vaccination. Specific antibodies binding to tetanus toxoid (total IgG) and pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (total IgG and IgG2) were assessed at baseline and 16 wk. Participants were recruited between October 2006 and June 2008.Results: The change in FV consumption differed significantly between groups [mean change in number of portions (95% CI): in the 2-portion/d group, 0.4 portions/d (0.2, 0.7 portions/d); in the 5-portion/d group, 4.6 portions/d (4.1, 5.0 portions/d); P < 0.001)] and also in micronutrient status. Antibody binding to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (total IgG) increased more in the 5-portion/d group than in the 2-portion/d group [geometric mean (95% CI) of the week 16:baseline ratio: 3.1 (2.1, 4.4) and 1.7 (1.3, 2.1), respectively; P = 0.005)]. There was no significant difference in the increases in antibody binding to tetanus toxoid.Conclusion: Increased FV intake improves the Pneumovax II vaccination antibody response in older people, which links an achievable dietary goal with improved immune function.

It has been shown that differences in behavioral responses of juveniles are minimal at a stable temperature (approximately 20°C). Gradually rising or falling temperatures lead to an increase in the variation of behavioral parameters. Response to rising temperature is more pronounced in juvenile roach individuals produced by breeders from the Rybinsk Reservoir tributary, while response to decreasing temperature is, on the contrary, more pronounced in individuals produced by breeders from the nonfreezing Moskva River area.

However, compared to mammalian, only a few plant Znfs have been functionally characterized. Here, T-DNA inserted gds1 (growth, development and splicing 1) mutant, displayed abnormal growth throughout the lifecycle owing to the reduction of cell size and number. Inverse PCR analysis revealed that the abnormal growth was caused by the disruption of At3g47120, which encodes a C3H42 protein belonging to the C-X7-C-X5-C-X3-H class of the Znf family. GDS1 was ubiquitously transcribed, but shows high levels of expression in young seedling and unexpanded new leaves. In gds1, the transcripts of many growth- and development-related genes were down-regulated, and the auxin response was dramatically reduced. A fluorescence-based assay revealed that the GDS1 protein was localized to the nucleus, prominently in the speckle compartments. Its arginine/serine dipeptide-rich-like (RS-like) domain was essential for nuclear localization. In addition, the SR1, SRm102 and U1-70K components of the U1 spliceosome interacted with GDS1 in the nuclear speckle compartments. Taken together, these suggest that GDS1, a nuclear-speckle-associated Znf, might play a significant role in splicing during plant growth and development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aauxins 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3aplant growth 3aplant stress 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aregulatory proteins 3aseedlings 3aspliceosomes 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransfer DNA 3azinc finger motif 0aC3H-type zinc finger protein 0aGDS1 0aInverse PCR analysis 0aPlant growth and development 0aNuclear speckles 0aSplicing1 aJeon, Su Jeong1 aHwang, Sung Min1 aHong, Jong Chan1 aBahk, Jeong Dong0 tPlant science.g2016 Sept., v. 250 p.141-153dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2016.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03535naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008700171300001800258520236200276592002802638650001202666650001902678650002302697650001802720650001402738650000902752650001302761650001402774650002202788650001502810650000902825650001102834651001102845700002102856700002702877700002302904773010802927856008103035852000903116655001203125IND60520929520221121025043.0160526e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052092952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-015-2777-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrzeciak, Tomasz M.10aCan we trust climate models to realistically represent severe European windstorms?  ap. 3431-3451.  aCyclonic windstorms are one of the most important natural hazards for Europe, but robust climate projections of the position and the strength of the North Atlantic storm track are not yet possible, bearing significant risks to European societies and the (re)insurance industry. Previous studies addressing the problem of climate model uncertainty through statistical comparisons of simulations of the current climate with (re-)analysis data show large disagreement between different climate models, different ensemble members of the same model and observed climatologies of intense cyclones. One weakness of such evaluations lies in the difficulty to separate influences of the climate model’s basic state from the influence of fast processes on the development of the most intense storms, which could create compensating effects and therefore suggest higher reliability than there really is. This work aims to shed new light into this problem through a cost-effective “seamless” approach of hindcasting 20 historical severe storms with the two global climate models, ECHAM6 and GA4 configuration of the Met Office Unified Model, run in a numerical weather prediction mode using different lead times, and horizontal and vertical resolutions. These runs are then compared to re-analysis data. The main conclusions from this work are: (a) objectively identified cyclone tracks are represented satisfactorily by most hindcasts; (b) sensitivity to vertical resolution is low; (c) cyclone depth is systematically under-predicted for a coarse resolution of T63 by both climate models; (d) no systematic bias is found for the higher resolution of T127 out to about three days, demonstrating that climate models are in fact able to represent the complex dynamics of explosively deepening cyclones well, if given the correct initial conditions; (e) an analysis using a recently developed diagnostic tool based on the surface pressure tendency equation points to too weak diabatic processes, mainly latent heating, as the main source for the under-prediction in the coarse-resolution runs. Finally, an interesting implication of these results is that the too low number of deep cyclones in many free-running climate simulations may therefore be related to an insufficient number of storm-prone initial conditions. This question will be addressed in future work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3acost effectiveness 3adata analysis 3aequations 3aheat 3aindustry 3ainsurance 3amodel uncertainty 3aprediction 3arisk 3astorms 3aEurope1 aKnippertz, Peter1 aPirret, Jennifer S.

We present a consistent survey across New Zealand’s subantarctic of the relationships between front positions, bathymetry and water masses. The northwest side of the Campbell Plateau is comparatively warm due to a southward extension of the STF over the plateau. The SAF is steered south and east by the combined effect of the plateau and Macquarie Ridge, with waters originating in the SAF also found north of the plateau. Formation of Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) is confirmed, with a deep reservoir of SAMW persisting nearly a year after formation. Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) is observed around the edges of the plateau, but not present on the plateau, confirming that the waters on the plateau are isolated from deeper Southern Ocean.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreshwater 3aresearch 3asurveys 3aAntarctic region 3aNew Zealand 0aCampbell Plateau 0asubantarctic 0aPacific Ocean 0aoceanography1 aWilliams, Michael J.

Piglets (n=82) were isolated for 30 days and confirmed negative for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, and IAV infections. A subset (n=28) was vaccinated on day post inoculation (DPI) −42 and −21 with a commercial multivalent vaccine. On DPI 0, pigs were intratracheally inoculated with contemporary isolates of H1N1 (n=35) or H3N2 (n=35) or served as negative controls (n=12). OF (n=370) was collected DPI 0–16 and NS (n=924) DPI 0–6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16. The association between IAV detection and variables of interest (specimen, virus subtype, assay, vaccination status, and DPI) was analyzed by mixed-effect repeated measures logistic regression and the results used to calculate the probability (pˆ) of detecting IAV in OF and NS over DPI by assay. Vaccination (p-value<0.0001), DPI (p-value<0.0001), and specimen-assay interaction (p-value<0.0001) were significant to IAV detection, but virus subtype was not (p-value=0.89). Vaccination and/or increasing DPI reduced pˆ for all assays. VI was more successful using NS than OF, but both VI and POC were generally unsuccessful after DPI 6. Overall, rRT-PCR on OF specimens provided the highest pˆ for the most DPIs, yet significantly different results were observed between the two laboratories independently performing rRT-PCR testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aMycoplasma hyopneumoniae 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aantigen detection 3anose 3apiglets 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avaccination 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aInfluenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtypexgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aInfluenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtypexgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMouthxsecretionxvirology. 2aNosexvirology 2aProbability 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxdiagnosisxvirology. 2aTime Factors 0aInfluenza A virus 0aSwine 0aOral fluids 0aNasal swabs 0aPCR 0aVirus isolation1 aPrickett, John1 aKittawornrat, Apisit1 aZhou, Fanghong1 aRauh, Rolf1 aNelson, William1 aO’Connell, Cate1 aBurrell, Angela1 aWang, Chong1 aYoon, Kyoung-Jin1 aZimmerman, Jeffrey J.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2013 Oct. 25, v. 166, no. 3-4 p.450-460dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01057naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011400167300001600281520024900297592002800546650001800574650001600592650001900608651001300627773009400640856004800734852000900782655001200791IND50089037520221119150439.0140426e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008903752DNAL7 a10.1134/S00138738140201462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedvedev, L.

Both of the polymer networks are stable in various solvents and thermally stable.

FCTCz exhibits a high carbon dioxide uptake ability of 4.63 mmol g⁻¹ at 1.13 bar and 273 K with a hydrogen uptake ability of 1.94 wt% (1.13 bar/77 K). In addition, both of the polymer networks exhibit good ideal CO₂/N₂ selectivity (26–29) and CO₂/CH₄ selectivity (5.2–5.8) at 273 K.

However, there is much discrepancy in the literature regarding the proposed benefits of protein supplementation during prolonged resistance-type exercise training in younger and older populations.Objective: The objective of the study was to define the efficacy of protein supplementation to augment the adaptive response of the skeletal muscle to prolonged resistance-type exercise training in younger and older populations.Design: A systematic review of interventional evidence was performed through the use of a random-effects meta-analysis model. Data from the outcome variables fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass, type I and II muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) leg press strength were collected from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of dietary protein supplementation during prolonged (>6 wk) resistance-type exercise training.Results: Data were included from 22 RCTs that included 680 subjects. Protein supplementation showed a positive effect for FFM (weighted mean difference: 0.69 kg; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.91 kg; P < 0.00001) and 1-RM leg press strength (weighted mean difference: 13.5 kg; 95% CI: 6.4, 20.7 kg; P < 0.005) compared with a placebo after prolonged resistance-type exercise training in younger and older subjects.Conclusion: Protein supplementation increases muscle mass and strength gains during prolonged resistance-type exercise training in both younger and older subjects.  aPublisher supplied data 3adietary protein 3aexercise 3amuscle protein 3aprotein supplements 3ameta-analysis 3amuscles 3amodels 3askeletal muscle 3asystematic review 3aclinical nutrition 3arandomized clinical trials 3amuscle fibers 3aingestion 3alean body mass 0afat free mass1 aRes, Peter T1 ade Groot, Lisette CPGM1 aSaris, Wim HM1 avan Loon, Luc JC0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2012 Dec., v. 96, no. 6 p.1454-1464dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.112.0375563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007700168300001800245520085700263592002801120650001101148650001601159650001901175650001501194650002301209650002101232653003501253653003101288653001801319653000901337700002201346773010301368856008501471852000901556655001201565IND60573685720221122004543.0170724e20170902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057368572DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2016.11881632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Ankita13aAn Information fusion approach for PALSAR data to retrieve soil moisture  ap. 1017-1033.  aEstimation of vegetation covered soil moisture with satellite images is still a challenging task. Several models are available for soil moisture retrieval in which water cloud model (WCM) is most common. But, it requires an estimation of accurate vegetation parameterization. Thus, there is a need to develop such an approach for soil moisture retrieval which minimize these limitations. Therefore, this paper deals with the soil moisture retrieval using fully polarimetric SAR data by fusing the information from different bands. Various polarimetric indices and observables were critically analysed, and found that the index; SPAN (total scattered power) gives better information of vegetation cover as compared to other indices/observables. Based on this, WCM model has been modified using SPAN as parameter and soil moisture content were retrieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3apolarimetry 3aremote sensing 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3avegetation cover 0aSynthetic aperture radar (SAR) 0abackscattering coefficient 0asoil moisture 0aSPAN1 aSingh, Dharmendra0 tGeocarto international.g2017 Sept. 2, v. 32, no. 9 p.1017-1033dTaylor & Francisx1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2016.11881633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015500168300001600323520150100339592002801840650001601868650001901884650002301903650001501926650001401941650002201955650002501977650001302002650001602015650001302031650001502044650000902059650001902068650001702087650001502104651002102119653001902140653001502159653001302174653004502187653002102232653002102253700001902274700001902293700005802312773011802370856008502488852000902573655001202582IND60593480420221119133854.0180429e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059348042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGwak, Jae Ha10aOptimal location selection for the installation of urban green roofs considering honeybee habitats along with socio-economic and environmental effects  ap. 125-133.  aThis study proposes a new framework for the selection of optimal locations for green roofs to achieve a sustainable urban ecosystem. The proposed framework selects building sites that can maximize the benefits of green roofs, based not only on the socio-economic and environmental benefits to urban residents, but also on the provision of urban foraging sites for honeybees. The framework comprises three steps. First, building candidates for green roofs are selected considering the building type. Second, the selected building candidates are ranked in terms of their expected socio-economic and environmental effects. The benefits of green roofs are improved energy efficiency and air quality, reduction of urban flood risk and infrastructure improvement costs, reuse of storm water, and creation of space for education and leisure. Furthermore, the estimated cost of installing green roofs is also considered. We employ spatial data to determine the expected effects of green roofs on each building unit, because the benefits and costs may vary depending on the location of the building. This is due to the heterogeneous spatial conditions. In the third step, the final building sites are proposed by solving the maximal covering location problem (MCLP) to determine the optimal locations for green roofs as urban honeybee foraging sites. As an illustrative example, we apply the proposed framework in Seoul, Korea. This new framework is expected to contribute to sustainable urban ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3acost estimates 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aeducation 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental impact 3aforaging 3agreen roofs 3ahabitats 3ahoney bees 3arisk 3asocioeconomics 3aspatial data 3astormwater 3aKorean Peninsula 0aUrban foraging 0aGreen roof 0aHoneybee 0aMaximal covering location problem (MCLP) 0aOptimal location 0aSpatial big data1 aLee, Bo Kyeong1 aLee, Won Kyung1 aSohn, So Young1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3958-22690 tJournal of environmental management.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 189 p.125-133dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014600169300001600315500001500331520097300346592002801319650002301347650002601370650003801396650001201434650003401446650001101480650003501491653003201526700002201558773013201580856008201712852000901794655001201803IND60616316420221119030359.0181016e200105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061631642DNAL7 a10.1177/1040638701013003152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlavsic, Mark Z.10aEvaluation of a New Sandwich Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for Detection of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus in Unprocessed Fetal Bovine Serum  ap. 261-262.  a2019-12-06  aA new sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (S-ELISA) kit that uses raw (unprocessed) fetal bovine serum (FBS) as the testing sample was evaluated for upstream bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) testing. Pooled FBS samples (n = 84) were tested using the S-ELISA. Thirty serum samples originating from persistently infected (PI) calves that had been confirmed by virus isolation (VI) as BVDV positive and another 30 samples previously confirmed by VI as BVDV negative were also evaluated. Of the 84 field samples, the S-ELISA detected 13 (15.5%) BVDV-positive specimens. When these 13 positive samples were tested by VI and immunofluorescent assay, 11 (84.6%) were positive and 2 (15.4%) were negative. The S-ELISA was positive for all 30 PI samples (100%) and negative for all 30 negative samples (100%). These data indicate that the new kit is a relatively reliable diagnostic tool and can be considered for upstream detection of BVDV-contaminated raw FBS pools.  aPublisher supplied data 3afetal bovine serum 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aviruses 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3acalves 3afluorescent antibody technique 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus1 aProdafikas, Gilda0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 13, no. 3 p.261-262dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638701013003153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151242006800170245008400238300001600322520067100338592002801009650001201037650001201049650001301061650001201074650000901086650001201095650000901107650002001116650001001136650001101146651001101157653001201168653002201180653001701202653003101219653001101250653001901261653002201280653002801302700002101330700002001351773016401371856008501535852000901620655001201629IND60590431320200827000000.0180313e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059043132DNAL7 a10.1016/S0007-9960(17)30196-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharby, Judith10aDairy products in France: market evolution and role in the diet14aLes produits laitiers en France : évolution du marché et place dans la diète  ap.

Instead, ecologists and evolutionary biologists are focusing on close relatives of S. cerevisiae, the seven species in the genus Saccharomyces. The best‐studied Saccharomyces yeast, after S. cerevisiae, is S. paradoxus, an oak tree resident throughout the northern hemisphere. In addition, several more members of the genus Saccharomyces have recently been discovered. Some Saccharomyces species are only found in nature, while others include both wild and domesticated strains. Comparisons between domesticated and wild yeasts have pinpointed hybridization, introgression and high phenotypic diversity as signatures of domestication. But studies of wild Saccharomyces natural history, biogeography and ecology are only beginning. Much remains to be understood about wild yeasts' ecological interactions and life cycles in nature. We encourage researchers to continue to investigate Saccharomyces yeasts in nature, both to place S. cerevisiae biology into its ecological context and to develop the genus Saccharomyces as a model clade for ecology and evolution. © 2014 The Authors.

Lymphodepletion and exogenous γc cytokine administration can improve T cell persistence following adoptive transfer, but their effects are not uniform and toxicities are significant. To overcome these limitations, we designed a chimeric γc cytokine receptor (CγCR) composed of Interleukin-7 (IL-7) tethered to IL-7Rα/CD127 that confers exogenous cytokine independent, cell intrinsic, STAT5 cytokine signals. We additionally show that this design is modular in that the IL-2Rβ/CD122 cytoplasmic chain can be exchanged for that of IL-7Rα/CD127, enhancing Shc activity. When expressed in central memory-derived primary human CD8+ CTL (TE/CM), these CγCRs signal according to their corresponding wild-type counterparts to support exogenous cytokine independent viability and homeostatic proliferation, while retaining full effector function. In vivo studies demonstrate that both CγCR-CD127+ and CγCR-CD122+ CD8+ TE/CM engraft in mice and persist in an absence of exogenous cytokine administration. Engrafted CγCR-CD127+ CD8+ TE/CM preferentially retain central memory marker expression in vivo demonstrating a dichotomy between CD127 versus CD122 signaling. Together, these results suggest that expression of CγCR in therapeutic T cells may aid in the in vivo persistence of these cells, particularly under conditions of limiting homeostatic cytokines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3acytokine receptors 3ahumans 3ain vivo studies 3ainterleukin-7 3amice 3aviability 0aCγCR 0aIL 0aTE/CM 0aCTL 0aU 0aREM 0aChimeric receptor 0aAdoptive immunotherapy 0aCytokine signaling1 aProsser, Megan E.1 aMahadev, Vaidehi1 aWang, Xiuli1 aAguilar, Brenda1 aBrown, Christine E.1 aForman, Stephen J.1 aJensen, Michael C.0 tMolecular Immunology.g2013 Nov., v. 56 p.1-11dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2013.03.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245012700206300001800333506007600351520090700427592002801334506003701362650001601399650001601415650001401431650002301445650002301468650002301491650001701514650002301531650001101554650001301565650002301578650002201601650002201623650001401645700002701659700002101686700002801707773011801735856008101853852000901934655001201943IND60566250620221207054651.0170407e20170407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056625062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b001962doi7 aPMC55353002pmcid7 a282946182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrost, Grant
B.10aMechanistic Model for Enantioselective Intramolecular Alkene Cyanoamidation via Palladium-Catalyzed C–CN Bond Activation  ap. 3721-3726.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe studied key aspects of the mechanism of Pd-catalyzed C–CN bond activation and intramolecular enantioselective alkene cyanoamidation. An Abboud–Abraham–Kamlet–Taft (AAKT) linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) model for enantioselectivity was established. We investigated the impact of Lewis acid (BPh₃), Lewis base (DMPU), and no additives. BPh₃ additive led to diminished enantioselectivity and differing results in ¹³CN crossover experiments, initial rate kinetics, and natural abundance ¹²C/¹³C kinetic isotope effect measurements. We propose two catalytic mechanisms to account for our experimental results. We propose that the DMPU/nonadditive pathway passes through a κ²-phosphoramidite-stabilized Pd⁺ intermediate, resulting in high enantioselectivity. BPh₃ prevents the dissociation of CN–, leading to a less rigid κ²-phosphoramidite-neutral Pd intermediate.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLewis acids 3aLewis bases 3aadditives 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adissociation 3aenantioselectivity 3aenergy 3aisotopes 3amechanistic models 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3apalladium1 aSerratore, Nicholas A.1 aOgilvie, Jodi M.1 aDouglas, Christopher J.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2017 Apr. 07, v. 82, no. 7 p.3721-3726dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.7b001963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013100173300001400304520109100318592002801409650000901437650001501446650001201461650002001473650001801493650003201511650002001543650001501563650002301578653001701601653002901618653003801647653002901685700002701714700002801741700002101769700002301790700002401813700003401837700003401871773009301905856008601998852000902084655001202093IND60526124220221121090619.0190403e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052612422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelani, Miriam M.10aEffects of pineapple byproduct and canola oil as fat replacers on physicochemical and sensory qualities of low-fat beef burger  ap. 69-76.  aPineapple byproduct and canola oil were evaluated as fat replacers on physicochemical and sensory characteristics of low-fat burgers. Five treatments were performed: conventional (CN, 20% fat) and four low-fat formulations (10% fat): control (CT), pineapple byproduct (PA), canola oil (CO), pineapple byproduct and canola oil (PC). Higher water and fat retention and lower cooking loss and diameter reduction were found in burgers with byproduct addition. In raw burgers, byproduct incorporation reduced L*, a*, and C* values, but these alterations were masked after cooking, leading to products similar to CN. Low-fat treatments were harder, chewier, and more cohesive than full-fat burgers. However, in Warner Bratzler shear measurements, PA and PC were as tender as CN. In QDA, no difference was found between CN and PC. Pineapple byproducts along with canola oil are promising fat replacers in beef burgers. In order to increase the feasibility of use of pineapple byproduct in the meat industry, alternative processes of byproduct preparation should be evaluated in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3acanola oil 3acooking 3acooking quality 3afat replacers 3alivestock and meat industry 3ameat byproducts 3apineapples 3asensory properties 0aFat-replacer 0aTexture profile analysis 0aQuantitative descriptive analysis 0aPhysicochemical analysis1 aShirado, Giovanna A.N.1 aMargiotta, Gregório B.1 aSaldaña, Erick,1 aSpada, Fernanda P.1 aPiedade, Sonia M.S.1 aContreras-Castillo, Carmen J.1 aCanniatti-Brazaca, Solange G.0 tMeat science.g2016 Feb., v. 112 p.69-76dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.10.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003300140245015300173300001600326520177900342592002802121596015902149650002202308650000802330650002202338650002202360650001302382650001002395650001202405650001602417650001002433650001202443650001002455650001502465650001102480650001602491650000902507650002302516650001902539651001302558651001402571653001202585653001502597700002102612700002502633700006402658700001802722773013302740856007502873852000902948655001202957IND60687157520221122000545.0200623e20200109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068715752DNAL7 a10.1093/jme/tjz1622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRincón-Galvis, Helen Jineth10aTemporal Variation of the Presence of Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) Into Rural Dwellings in the Department of Casanare, Eastern Colombia  ap. 173-180.  aRhodnius prolixus (Stål, 1859) is the major vector of Trypanosoma cruzi in Colombia and Venezuela. The species is strongly associated with high-altitude ecotopes, such as sylvatic palms (Attalea butyracea), where spatially and temporally stable infestations are established. We investigated temporal variation in regards to the presence of R. prolixus in rural dwellings in the department of Casanare (eastern Colombia) over a period of 12 mo. Thirty houses were sampled from January to December 2017 by installing Maria sensors, collecting triatomines through community entomological surveillance, and conducting a monthly search in each house. The collection of specimens from the houses varied significantly by month with the higher number of collections occurring in the low-rainfall season and the lower number of collections occurring in the months of increased precipitation. The proportions of males, females, and nymphs also varied significantly throughout the time period: nymphs (fifth instar only) were reported only during May, July, and September and significantly greater numbers of females than males were reported in the inspected dwellings in all months. Density, crowding, and colonization indices varied according to the season. A bloodmeal analysis revealed 17 different hosts. A total of 42 randomly selected R. prolixus specimens were subjected to molecular analyses for detection of T. cruzi DNA with 22 found positive (infection prevalence of 52%). In conclusion, we observed a high presence of R. prolixus (infected with T. cruzi) in dwellings close to native palm plantations. These findings indicate a high risk of vector transmission of T. cruzi for people in the study areas and challenges for the current vector control schemes in the region.  aPublisher supplied data  cDirección de Investigación e Innovación from Universidad del Rosario and by Fundación Universitaria Internacional del Trópico Americano (Unitrópico) 3aAttalea butyracea 3aDNA 3aRhodnius prolixus 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aaltitude 3ablood 3afemales 3ahematophagy 3ahosts 3ainstars 3amales 3amonitoring 3anymphs 3aplantations 3arisk 3atemporal variation 3avector control 3aColombia 3aVenezuela 0adensity 0adispersion1 aUrbano, Plutarco1 aHernández, Carolina1 aRamírez, Juan David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1344-93121 aFlorin, David0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2020 Jan. 09, v. 57, no. 1 p.173-180dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl45776x1938-29287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjz1623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009300168300001400261520108600275536028701361592002801648650002201676650001801698650001301716650001401729650001901743650002201762650001601784650001901800653001701819653002301836653002501859653002501884700001501909700001501924700001701939773013401956856008602090852000902176655001202185IND60728241920221121061529.0220106e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072824192DNAL7 a10.1080/02773813.2020.18568812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yating10aCellulosic fiber filter with special wettability for efficient water/fuel oil separation  ap. 25-33.  aHydrophobic/oleophilic filters have great potential for application in oil/water separation. Herein, we describe the successful preparation of environment friendly superhydrophobic cellulosic fiber filter to remove water from diesel. The modified TiO₂ particles were used to fabricate the rough structure of superhydrophobic filter paper via a dip-coating method with epoxy resin as a binder. With the further dipping modification by hexadecyltrimethoxysilane (HDTMS), the filter paper obtained excellent water-resistance with water contact angle (WCA) ranging from 126.0° to 151.8°, and strong stability against acid, alkali and UV lights. In this work, it was found that the WCA was proportional to the surface roughness. The obtained hydrophobic filter papers could selectively absorb oil from water-containing fuel oil and could separate water/fuel oil mixture very efficiently with separation efficiency higher than 99%. This simple and mild strategy would inspire the large-scale fabrication of multifunctional surfaces for practical applications in water/oil separation.  aThis work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (22005065), the Scientific Research Fund of Guangdong University of Petrochemical Technology (2019rc050, 2019rc051) and the Science and Technology Planning Project of Maoming (2019399, 2019416).  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulosic fibers 3acontact angle 3aepoxides 3afuel oils 3ahydrophobicity 3asurface roughness 3awettability 3awood chemistry 0aFilter paper 0a(super)hydrophobic 0a(nano)TiO2 particles 0awater/oil separation1 aLi, Huixin1 aLiu, Xueyi1 aYu, Chenghua0 tJournal of wood chemistry and technology.g2021 Jan. 1, v. 41, no. 1 p.25-33dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl33236x1532-23197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02773813.2020.18568813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005400145245021000199300001800409520061000427592002801037596009201065596009801157596009801255596010001353596009601453650002801549650001101577650002601588650002101614650001301635650002201648700001701670700001601687700005801703700002101761700001401782700002201796700001901818700002001837700002101857700001101878700001701889700001901906700001601925700005301941773013401994856008002128852000902208655001202217IND60786767420221119074629.0220805e20220726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078676742DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.2c003822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3107-294X10aSynthesis of 4-Tetrazolyl-Substituted 3,4-Dihydroquinazoline Derivatives with Anticancer Activity via a One-Pot Sequential Ugi-Azide/Palladium-Catalyzed Azide-Isocyanide Cross-Coupling/Cyclization Reaction  ap. 9488-9496.  aA new one-pot preparation of 4-tetrazolyl-3,4-dihydroquinazolines has been reported.

S35-S47.  aThe objective of this work was to i) describe the dietary & nutritional patterns of French yogurt consumers and to ii) compare the French trends with other comparable studies in the world. In France, based on the nationally representative Food Behavior and Consumption survey (CCAF 2010), three groups of children (3-17 years, 1 171 subjects) and four groups of adults (25-64 years, 986 subjects) were studied. In children and adults, large consumers of yogurt (> 6 servings per week) had a more adequate dietary pattern – with more fruits, vegetables, soups & dairy products, compared to non-consumers or small consumers. We also observed among children a lower consumption of sweet products and fats and among adults, more fish and less prepared meals or alcoholic beverages. Nutritional intakes and adequacy to local recommendations (PNNS criteria) were shown to be better when yogurt consumption was higher. Yogurt can be considered as a marker of good nutrition patterns in France. These results were consistent with already-published data from several other countries in which we observed similar trends, despite very different dietary habits and types of markets. Yogurt could be considered “universally” as a marker of a good diet quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aalcoholic beverages 3achildren 3aeating habits 3afish 3afruits 3alipids 3amarkets 3anutritional adequacy 3asoups 3asurveys 3avegetables 3ayogurt 3aFrance 0aYaourt 0aProduits laitiers frais 0aApports nutritionnels 0aConsommation alimentaire 0aSuivi des recommandations 0aANC 0aEnfants 0aAdultes 0aYogurt 0aFresh Dairy 0aFood intake 0aNutrient intake 0aNutrition adequacy 0aDRI 0aChildren 0aAdults1 aHébel, Pascale,0 tCahiers de nutrition et de diététique.g2017 Dec., v. 52 p.S35-S47dElsevier Masson SASaSociété Française de NutritionwJournal:jnl17549x0007-99607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0007-9960(17)30197-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01694naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245004800167300001600215520066100231592002800892650001100920650002100931650001300952650002700965650001200992650001801004650001401022650001701036700002601053700001801079700002401097773013201121856008201253852000901335655001201344IND60616316720221119030555.0181016e200107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061631672DNAL7 a10.1177/1040638701013004122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeBey, Brad M.10aDigital Papillomatosis in a Confined Beagle  ap. 346-348.  aPapillomavirus-induced papillomas were diagnosed on multiple digits of all 4 feet of a young Beagle.

METHODS: An in vitro BBB model, established by co-culturing brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVEC) and astroglial cells (AC) isolated from rat brain, was exposed to EMP at 100 kV/m and 400 kV/m, respectively. Permeability of the model was assayed by measuring the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) transmission at different time points. Levels of BBB tight junction-related proteins were measured at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 h after EMP exposure by Western blotting. RESULTS: The TEER level was lower in BBB model group than in control group at 12 h after EMP, exposure which returned to its normal level at 24 h. The 24 h recovery process was triphasic and biphasic respectively after EMP exposure at 100 kV/m and 400 kV/m. Following exposure to 400 kV/m EMP, the HRP permeability increased at 1-12 h and returned to its normal level at 24 h. Western blotting showed that the claudin-5 and ZO-1 protein levels were changed after EMP exposure. CONCLUSION: EMP exposure at 100 kV/m and 400 kV/m can increase the permeability of in vitro BBB model and BBB tight junction-related proteins such as ZO-1 and claudin-5 may change EMP-induced BBB permeability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3aelectrical resistance 3aendothelial cells 3amodels 3apermeability 3aperoxidase 3aproteins 3arats1 aDING, Gui Rong1 aZhang, Jie,1 aZHOU, Yong Chun1 aZHANG, Yan Jun1 aGUO, Guo Zhen0 tBiomedical and environmental sciences.g2013 Feb., v. 26, no. 2 p.128-137dElsevier B.V.x0895-39887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3967/0895-3988.2013.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245017300162300001600335520172400351592002802075650002702103650002302130650001802153650001602171650001802187650001202205650002002217650001302237650001202250650001302262650001702275651001102292653002002303653001702323653002702340700002202367700001502389700002402404700002102428773014202449856007802591852000902669655001202678IND60480768720221119074032.0160706e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048076872DNAL7 a10.3138/jvme.0212-016R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoe, Jason B.10aUnderstanding Veterinary Students' Use of and Attitudes toward the Social Networking Site, Facebook, to Assist in Developing Curricula to Address Online Professionalism  ap. 297-303.  aSocial media is an increasingly common form of communication, with Facebook being the preferred social-networking site among post-secondary students. Numerous studies suggest post-secondary students practice high self-disclosure on Facebook. Research evaluating veterinary students' use of social media found a notable proportion of student-posted content deemed inappropriate. Lack of discretion in posting content can have significant repercussions for aspiring veterinary professionals, their college of study, and the veterinary profession they represent. Veterinarians-in-training at three veterinary colleges across Canada were surveyed to explore their use of and attitude toward the social networking site, Facebook. Students were invited to complete an online survey with questions relating to their knowledge of privacy in relation to using Facebook, their views on the acceptability of posting certain types of information, and their level of professional accountability online. Linear regression modeling was used to further examine factors related to veterinary students' disclosure of personal information on Facebook. Need for popularity (p<.01) and awareness of consequences (p<.001) were found to be positively and negatively associated, respectively, with students' personal disclosure of information on Facebook. Understanding veterinary students' use of and attitudes toward social media, such as Facebook, reveals a need, and provides a basis, for developing educational programs to address online professionalism. Educators and administrators at veterinary schools may use this information to assist in developing veterinary curricula that addresses the escalating issue of online professionalism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aeducation programs 3alinear models 3aoccupations 3aprofessionals 3aschools 3asocial networks 3astudents 3asurveys 3ateachers 3auniversities 3aCanada 0aprofessionalism 0asocial media 0acurriculum development1 aWeijs, Cynthia A.1 aMuise, Amy1 aChristofides, Emily1 aDesmarais, Serge0 tJournal of veterinary medical education.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 39, no. 3 p.297-303dUniversity of Toronto PresswJournal:2049x0748-321X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3138/jvme.0212-016R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01717naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005400145245016000199300001800359520048200377592002800859596009800887596010100985650002301086650002501109650002201134700001701156700001901173773013401192856008001326852000901406655001201415IND60786767620221119074344.0220805e20220708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078676762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.2c004482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Qijian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3135-127110aDiastereoselective and E/Z-Selective Synthesis of Functionalized Quinolizine Scaffolds via the Dearomative Annulation of 2-Pyridylacetates with Nitroenynes  ap. 9507-9517.  aAn organocatalytic Michael/aza-Michael cascade reaction was developed to build the functionalized quinolizine scaffolds in 60–82% yields, excellent diastereoselectivities, and E/Z selectivities.

It is found that there exists a threshold of the volcanic forcing above 15 W/m² to lead the El Niño-like warming in the climate model. When the volcanic forcing is above this threshold forcing, then the intensity of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is weakened and its position is shifted to the south. This might be associated with the processes of less evaporation in the subtropical cloudless region by a cooling due to the reduction of net surface shortwave radiation. Concurrently, a weakening of ITCZ is associated with a weakening of the trade winds and the subsequent Bjerknes feedback causes El Niño-like warming. Therefore, El Niño-like warming events can occur when volcanic eruption is above threshold forcing, implying that there exists a certain level of radiative forcing change which is capable of changing the state of tropical Pacific sea surface temperature. The last millennium simulation of Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project Phase 3 climate models also indicates that there may exist a threshold forcing to lead the El Niño-like warming, which has been also discussed in the present study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3acooling 3aevaporation 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3apaleoclimatology 3aradiative forcing 3asurface water temperature 3atrade winds1 aYeh, Sang-Wook1 aKug, Jong-Seong1 aPark, Young-Gyu1 aPark, Jae-Hun1 aPark, Rokjin1 aSong, Chang-Keun0 tClimate dynamics.g2016 June, v. 46, no. 11-12 p.3725-3736dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-015-2799-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01987naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009500159300001800254520095600272592002801228650001701256650001101273650001101284650001201295650001301307650003401320650002201354650001101376650000801387700001801395700002001413773012101433856007401554852000901628655001201637IND60666869420221119033336.0190919e20141211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066686942DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra09400j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManikandan, P.12aA nano-granular Sn impregnated NiTi alloy matrix anode for high voltage Li-ion pouch cells  ap. 3844-3853.  aA well-characterized nano-granular Sn impregnated inactive NiTi alloy matrix has been synthesized through a viable and facile mill-heat method as a suitable anode matrix for Li-ion batteries.

Linear programming was used to develop CFR using locally available and acceptable foods based on livelihood- and age-group-specific dietary patterns observed through 24 h dietary recalls. Within each livelihood group, the nutrient potential of age-group-specific v. consolidated CFR across the three age groups was tested. Three food-insecure counties in northern Kenya; namely, settled communities from Isiolo (n 300), pastoralist communities from Marsabit (n 283) and agro-pastoralist communities from Turkana (n 299). Breast-fed IYC aged 6–23 months (n 882). Age-specific CFR could achieve adequacy for seven to nine of eleven modelled micronutrients, except among 12–23-month-old children in agro-pastoralist communities. Contribution of Fe, Zn and niacin remained low for most groups, and thiamin, vitamin B₆ and folate for some groups. Age-group-consolidated CFR could not reach the same level of nutrient adequacy as age-specific sets among the settled and pastoralist communities. Context- and age-specific CFR could ensure adequate levels of more modelled nutrients among settled and pastoralist IYC than among agro-pastoralist communities where use of nutrient-dense foods was limited. Adequacy of all eleven modelled micronutrients was not achievable and additional approaches to ensure adequate diets are required. Consolidated messages should be easier to implement as part of a behaviour change strategy; however, they would likely not achieve the same improvements in population-level dietary adequacy as age-specific CFR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagropastoralism 3abehavior change 3abreast feeding 3achildren 3acomplementary feeding 3acomplementary foods 3adiet recall 3aeating habits 3afolic acid 3ainfants 3airon 3alinear programming 3alivelihood 3aniacin 3anutrients 3apyridoxine 3athiamin 3azinc 3aKenya 0aOptifood 0aInfant and young child feeding 0aComplementary feedingrecommendations1 aKnight, Frances A1 aTumilowicz, Alison1 aHotz, Christine1 aChege, Peter1 aFerguson, Elaine L0 tPublic health nutrition.g2017 Apr., v. 20, no. 6 p.971-983dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800160031163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011800127300001600245500012700261520118400388650001601572650001101588650002301599650001901622650002101641650001701662650001401679650001401693650001301707650002101720650001301741650001101754700001701765700001501782700001801797700001901815773009401834852000901928930003301937945001301970946001301983655001201996IND2208002120221117054406.0001128e200004  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220800212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConner, J.A.10aBiotreatment of refinery spent-sulfidic caustic using an enrichment culture immobilized in a novel support matrix  ap. 707-719.  aProceedings of the Twenty-First Symposium on Biotechnology for Fuels and Chemicals, May 2-6, 1999, Fort Collins, Colorado.  aSodium hydroxide solutions are used in petroleum refining to remove hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and mercaptans from various hydrocarbon streams. The resulting sulfide-laden waste stream is called spent-sulfidic caustic. An aerobic enrichment culture was previously developed using a gas mixture of H2S and methylmercaptan (MeSH) as the sole energy source. This culture has now been immobilized in a novel support matrix, DuPont BIO-SEP beads, and is used to biotreat a refinery spent-sulfidic caustic containing both inorganic sulfide and mercaptans in a continuous flow, fluidized-bed column bioreactor. Complete oxidation of both inorganic and organic sulfur to sulfate was observed with no breakthrough of H2S and <2 ppmv of MeSH produced in the bioreactor outlet gas. Excessive buildup of sulfate (>12 g/L) in the bioreactor medium resulted in an upset condition evidenced by excessive MeSH breakthrough. Therefore, bioreactor performance was limited by the steady-state sulfate concentration. Further improvement in volumetric productivity of a bioreactor system based on this enrichment culture will be dependent on maintenance of sulfate concentrations below inhibitory levels. 3abioreactors 3aenergy 3aenrichment culture 3afluidized beds 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amethanethiol 3aoxidation 3apetroleum 3arefining 3asodium hydroxide 3asulfates 3asulfur1 aBeitle, R.R.1 aDuncan, K.1 aKolhatkar, R.1 aSublette, K.L.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2000 Spring, v. 84/86 p.707-719x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02924naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245007400123300001600197500012700213520182700340650002102167650001202188650001502200650001602215650001802231650001902249650001002268650002502278700001302303700001502316700001402331700001602345700001502361773009402376852000902470930003302479945001302512946001302525655001202538IND2207996220221117053751.0001128e200004  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220799622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChua, H.10aDesign and performance of a fibrous bed bioreactor for odor treatment  ap. 469-478.  aProceedings of the Twenty-First Symposium on Biotechnology for Fuels and Chemicals, May 2-6, 1999, Fort Collins, Colorado.  aBiological processes have become popular for odor treatment. In this study, a novel fibrous bed bioreactor was applied for treatment of odorous gas. The column reactor was packed with spirally wound fibrous sheet material on which a consortium of microorganisms selected from activated sludge was immobilized. The first stage of this work comprised a preliminary study that aimed at investigating the feasibility of the fibrous bed bioreactor for treatment of odorous volatile fatty acids (VFAs). In this stage, the performance of a fibrous bed bioreactor at increasing mass loadings ranging from 9.7 to 104.2 g/(m3(.)h) was studied. VFA removal efficiencies above 90% were achieved at mass loadings up to 50.3 g/(m3(.)h). At a mass loading of 104.2 g/(m3(.)h), removal efficiency was found to be 87.7%. In the second stage of the work, the process was scaled up with design and operational considerations, namely, packing medium, process condition, and configuration selections. A trickling biofilter with synthetic fibrous packing medium was selected. It was operated under countercurrent flow of gas and liquid streams. The effects of inlet concentration and empty bed retention time on bioreactor performance were studied. The bioreactor was effective in treating odorous VFAs at mass loadings up to 32 g/(m3(.)h), at which VFAs started to accumulate in the recirculation liquid, indicating that the biofilm was unable to degrade all the VFAs introduced. Although VFAs accumulated in the liquid phase, the removal efficiency remained above 99%, implying that the biochemical reaction rate, rather than gas-to-liquid mass transfer rate, was the limiting factor of this process. The bioreactor was stable for long-term operation; no clogging and degeneration of the packing medium was observed during the 4-mo operation. 3aactivated sludge 3abiofilm 3abiofilters 3abioreactors 3amass transfer 3amicroorganisms 3aodors 3avolatile fatty acids1 aLi, X.Z.1 aYu, P.H.F.1 aTam, C.Y.1 aHuang, Y.L.1 aYang, S.T.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2000 Spring, v. 84/86 p.469-478x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02578naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002000146245013000166300001600296520100300312650001501315650002001330650002601350650001601376650001101392650000901403650000901412650001901421650001701440650002301457650001601480650001901496650001201515650001101527650001501538650001801553650001101571650001601582650001301598650001401611650002801625650001901653650005001672650001601722653002701738700001501765700001401780700001601794700001601810773008201826852000901908930003301917945002501950946001301975655001201988IND4362605220221117053743.0040520e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436260522DNAL7 a152592322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Nine primiparous Holstein-Friesian cattle were challenged with approximately 150 cfu of Staph. aureus ATCC29740 by intramammary infusion on d 6, 7, and 8 of lactation. Serum Cu, Zn, and Fe concentrations were determined immediately before and at 24, 48, and 72 h after the final intramammary infusion of Staph. aureus. Infection status (cfu/mL of Staph. aureus), milk somatic cell count, and mastitis score were also determined at these times. Infection resulted in a decrease in mean serum Cu, Zn, and Fe concentrations to 89, 83, and 81% of preinfection concentrations at 24 h postchallenge. One-way analysis of variance for repeated measures demonstrated a significant change in serum zinc concentration. The reductions in trace mineral concentrations were of less magnitude than observed following experimental E. coli mastitis. 3adairy cows 3abovine mastitis 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3ablood serum 3acopper 3azinc 3airon 3audder quarters 3ainflammation 3asomatic cell count 3aplate count 3adisease course 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCell Count 2aCopperxblood 2aFemale 2aIronxblood 2aKinetics 2aLactation 2aMastitis, Bovinexblood 2aMilkxcytology 2aStaphylococcal Infectionsxbloodxveterinary. 2aZincxblood 0asubclinical infections1 aLuby, C.D.1 aViera, L.1 aTyler, J.W.1 aCasteel, S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2004 Apr., v. 87, no. 4 p.976-979x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/07/08  aOther US 7aarticle03770naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001500163245010700178300001800285500001500303520167700318650001501995650001602010650001902026650002002045650002002065650002802085650002102113650002302134650000902157650002102166650002402187650002802211650002802239650001502267650002302282650001602305650004702321650001202368650002302380650001502403650004302418650004602461650001602507650001102523650001402534650004102548650001402589650002102603650003102624650002802655650001402683650001902697651001102716651001102727653002002738653002102758700001402779700001302793700001302806700001602819700001302835773008402848852000902932930003302941945002502974946001302999655001203012IND4362607820221117054138.0040520e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436260782DNAL7 a152592352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHojman, D.10aRelationships between milk urea and production, nutrition, and fertility traits in Israeli dairy herds  ap. 1001-1011.  a2019-12-05  aThe objectives of this study were to identify and evaluate production and environmental factors that influence milk urea (MU) in Israeli dairy herds, to analyze the relationships between MU concentration and nutritional variables, and to examine a possible association between MU and pregnancy rate (PR). Production and environmental data were obtained from the Israeli Dairy Herd Improvement (DHI) Center (n = 1,279,600). Programmed total mixed rations (feeds and quantities) on milk-test day were collected from 42 dairy herds. Data on 36,073 cows that were inseminated close to milk-test day and pregnancy diagnosis results were obtained from the DHI data bank. Highly significant positive relationships were found between MU concentration and milk yield and fat percentage; relationships between MU and milk total protein percentage and somatic cell count were negative. Milk urea levels were higher during the summer months and were higher for adult cows. These levels increased as lactation progressed. Milk urea was positively associated with dietary levels of crude protein, ruminal digestible protein, and neutral detergent fiber contents; it was negatively associated with ration energy and nonstructural carbohydrate contents. Significant influences of specific feeds on MU were detected. A significant negative association was found between MU level and PR. Least squares means for PR for cows in the lowest and highest MU quartiles were 38.4 and 36.1%, respectively. Increasing levels of MU were negatively related to reproductive performance of dairy cows, but the risk of nonpregnancy caused by high levels of MU was lower than reported in previous studies. 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3apregnancy rate 3alactation stage 3alactation curve 3aartificial insemination 3afemale fertility 3aseasonal variation 3aurea 3alactation number 3amilk fat percentage 3aneutral detergent fiber 3amilk protein percentage 3amilk yield 3asomatic cell count 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCell Count 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEnvironment 2aFemale 2aFertility 2aInsemination, Artificialxveterinary 2aLactation 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistryxcytology. 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aPregnancy 2aUreaxanalysis 3aIsrael 0aIsrael 0adietary protein 0amilk composition1 aKroll, O.1 aAdin, G.1 aGips, M.1 aHanochi, B.1 aEzra, E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2004 Apr., v. 87, no. 4 p.1001-1011x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/07/07  aOther US 7aarticle02879naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001600163245008100179300001600260500001500276520146200291650001901753650003201772650002001804650001901824650002001843650001901863650002201882650002001904650001101924650002001935650001001955650004001965650001602005650003102021650004102052650001302093653001202106653002002118700001602138700001802154700001702172700001502189700001602204773008202220852000902302945002502311946001302336655001202349IND4362430420221117054007.0040510e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436243042DNAL7 a152026592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCaccamo, M.10aMeasurement of gas holes and mechanical openness in cheese by image analysis  ap. 739-748.  a2019-12-05  aA method to measure the amount of the surface area of cheese slices occupied by gas holes was developed to reflect the relative gas production among different cheeses. A digital camera mounted on a copy stand with lighting was used to make digital images of each slice of cheese. A commercial digital image analysis software program was used and an algorithm was written to measure the area of the image of the cheese slice occupied by holes. The image was cropped and scanned to determine which color channel produced the best image contrast. The MATLAB program allowed the user to eliminate mechanical openness or false holes and then to scan the image to produce a percent distribution of pixels in the image as a function of pixel intensity. The user then determined a threshold value to differentiate pixels that were in holes from those representing areas with no holes. The percentage of the total surface area occupied by holes was calculated. The coefficient of variation of the method ranged from 2.43% with gas holes of about 1% of the surface of the cheese slice to a coefficient of variation of 0.92% with gas holes of about 6.8% of the surface area of the cheese slice. Examples of applications of this method are given for Emmental, Ragusano, and Cheddar cheeses. The method can be used as a tool in research studies to correlate the amount of gas production with manufacturing conditions or as a quality control tool in cheese manufacturing. 3aimage analysis 3agas production (biological) 3aproduct defects 3aCheddar cheese 3aEmmental cheese 3adigital images 3acomputer software 3aquality control 2aCheese 2aFood Technology 2aGases 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aPhotography 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSignal Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aSoftware 0acheeses 0aRagusano cheese1 aMelilli, C.1 aBarbano, D.M.1 aPortelli, G.1 aMarino, G.1 aLicitra, G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2004 Mar., v. 87, no. 3 p.739-748x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  aINDdJITe2004/05/17  aOther US 7aarticle03020naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009900124300001600223500012800239520127600367650002401643650000801667650002101675650001301696650001301709650002101722650001201743650002301755650001501778650001501793650002301808650001501831650000901846650004401855650002501899650001401924650001301938650001401951650003901965650002402004650002102028650001602049650001402065650002302079650002702102650001902129650002502148700001602173700001602189700001302205700001302218700001302231773009402244852000902338930003302347945001302380946001302393655001202406IND2324445420221117054347.0011213e200104  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232444542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaw, K.H.10aProduction of polyhydroxybutyrate by Bacillus species isolated from municipal activated sludge  ap. 515-524.  aProceedings of the Twenty-second Symposium on Biotechnology for Fuels and Chemicals, May 7-11, 2000, Gatlinburg, Tennessee.  aPlastic wastes are considered to be severe environmental contaminants causing waste disposal problems. Widespread use of biodegradable plastics is one of the solutions, but it is limited by high production cost. Biologic wastewater treatment generates large quantities of biomass as activated sludge. Only a few reports focus on the potential of utilizing resident Bacillus species from activated sludge in polyhydroxbutyrate (PHB) production as well as the production of PHB from food wastes. They have attractive properties such as short generation time, absence of endotoxins, and secretion of both amylases and proteinases that can well utilize food wastes for nutrients, which can further reduce the cost of production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). Two PHA-producing strains, HF-1 and HF-2, were isolated from activated sludge. HF-1 outperformed HF-2 in terms of growth and PHB production in hydrolyzed soy and malt wastes.

Oxygen limitation and initial xylose concentration had strong influences on xylitol production by Candida tropicalis ATCC 96745. Under semiaerobic conditions, xylitol yield was highest (0.62 g/g), whereas under aerobic conditions volumetric productivity was highest (0.90 g/[L(.)h]). In the presence of glucose, xylose utilization was strongly repressed and sequential sugar utilization was observed. Ethanol produced from the glucose caused a 50% reduction in xylitol yield when the ethanol concentration exceeded 30 g/L. When complex synthetic hemicellulosic sugars were fermented, glucose was initially consumed followed by a simultaneous uptake of the other sugars. The highest xylitol yield (0.84 g/g) and volumetric productivity (0.49 g/[L(.)h]) were obtained for substrates containing high arabinose and low glucose and mannose contents. 3aCandida tropicalis 3aaeration 3aaerobic conditions 3aarabinose 3aethanol 3aexperimental design 3afermentation 3agalactose 3aglucose 3amannose 3aoxygen 3axylitol 3axylose1 aHensirisak, P.1 aAgblevor, F.A.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2001 Spring, v. 91/93 p.423-435x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle03371naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001100146245009900157300001800256500001500274520158200289650002701871650001901898650001901917650001601936650001201952650001201964650001401976650002001990650002002010650002402030650001102054650000702065650001402072650001602086650001702102650001502119650002802134650001202162650002902174650004402203650002202247650001502269650002002284650001302304650003102317650002002348650001602368650002002384653001702404653000802421653001802429653003002447653001802477653002102495700001802516773008302534852000902617930003302626945002502659946001302684655001202697IND4363019220221117053141.0040624e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436301922DNAL7 a127785692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMa, Y.10aSerum protein and casein concentration: effect on pH and freezing point of milk with added Co2  ap. 1590-1600.  a2019-12-05  aThe objective of this study was to determine the effect of protein concentration and protein type [i.e., casein (CN) and serum protein (SP)] on pH (0 degrees C) and freezing point (FP) of skim milk upon CO2 injection at 0 degrees C. CN-free skim milks with increasing SP content (0, 3, and 6%) and skim milks with the same SP content (0.6%) but increasing CN content (2.4, 4.8, and 7.2%) were prepared using a combination of microfiltration and ultrafiltration processes. CO2 was injected into milks at 0 degrees C using a continuous flow carbonation unit (230 ml/min). Increasing SP or CN increased milk buffering capacity and protein-bound mineral content. At the same CO2 concentration at 0 degrees C, a milk with a higher SP or a higher CN concentration had more resistance to pH change and a greater extent of FP decrease. The buffering capacity provided by an increase of CN was contributed by both the CN itself and the colloidal salts solublized into the serum phase from CN upon carbonation. Skim milks with the same true protein content (3%), one with 2.4% CN plus 0.6% SP and one with 3% SP, were compared. At the same true protein content (3%), increasing the proportion of CN increased milk buffering capacity and protein-bound mineral content. Milk with a higher proportion of CN had more resistance to pH change and a greater extent of FP decrease at the same carbonation level at 0 degrees C. Once CO2 was dissolved in the skim portion of a milk, the extent of pH reduction and FP depression depended on protein concentration and protein type (i.e., CN and SP). 3achemical concentration 3afreezing point 3acarbon dioxide 3atemperature 3alactose 3abuffers 3askim milk 3amineral content 3afood processing 3anonprotein nitrogen 3acasein 3apH 3ainjection 3acarbonation 3atotal solids 3asolubility 3amilk protein percentage 2aAnimals 2aBlood Proteinsxanalysis 2aCarbon Dioxidexadministration & dosage 2aCaseinsxanalysis 2aFiltration 2aFood Technology 2aFreezing 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMilkxchemistry 2aTemperature 2aUltrafiltration 0afood science 0aash 0aserum protein 0afreezing point depression 0amilk proteins 0amilk composition1 aBarbano, D.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2003 May, v. 86, no. 5 p.1590-1600x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20050627b00000000c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/05/24  aOther US 7aarticle03061naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002600163245013300189300001800322500001500340520137700355650001701732650002801749650001201777650001101789650001901800650002101819650002601840650001301866650002001879650002301899650003601922650002401958650002701982650003102009650003002040650002202070650002402092650003402116650003402150650001902184653002302203653001902226653002002245653002002265700001602285700001902301773008302320852000902403930003302412945002502445946001302470655001202483IND4362639120221117053500.0040521e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436263912DNAL7 a152910042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The volatile compound composition of (60%) cheese medium (pH 5.8) deacidified by Debaryomyces hansenii (DCM(Dh)) was compared with the one deacidified by Kluyveromyces marxianus (DCM(Km)). It was determined by dynamic headspace extraction, followed by gas chromatography separation and quantification as well as by mass spectrometry identification. Whatever the media tested, a first class of volatile compounds can be represented by the ones not produced by any of the yeasts, but some of them are affected by K. marxianus or by D. hansenii. A second class of volatile compounds can be represented by the ones produced by K. marxianus, which were essentially esters. Their concentrations were generally higher than their thresholds, explaining the DCM(Km) global fruity odor. A third class can be represented by the ones generated by D. hansenii, which were essentially methyl ketones with fruity, floral (rose), moldy, cheesy, or wine odor plus 2-phenylethanol with a faded-rose odor. The impact of methyl ketones on the DCM(Dh) global flavor was lower than the impact of 2-phenylethanol and even negligible. Therefore, the global faded-rose odor of D. hansenii DCM can be explained by a high concentration of 2-phenylethanol. 3acheesemaking 3aKluyveromyces marxianus 3acheeses 3aesters 3aodor compounds 3aflavor compounds 3aDebaryomyces hansenii 3aalcohols 3adeacidification 3aphenolic compounds 2aCheesexanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aChromatography, Gas 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKluyveromycesxmetabolism 2aMass Spectrometry 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aPhenylethyl Alcoholxanalysis 2aSaccharomycetalesxmetabolism 2aVolatilization 0avolatile compounds 0amethyl ketones 0aMuenster cheese 0a2-phenylethanol1 aCorrieu, G.1 aSpinnler, H.E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2004 May, v. 87, no. 5 p.1545-1550x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20040603b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/06/03  aOther US 7aarticle02671naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245007800163300001800241520156200259650001801821650001601839650002001855650001901875650001201894650001901906650002001925650001601945650002301961650001801984650003302002650002102035700002602056700001602082773008302098852000902181930003302190945002502223946001302248655001202261IND4362628820221117053348.0040521e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436262882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Model whey powders were prepared by colyophilization of lactose with increasing quantities of β-lactoglobulin. These colyophilized β-lactoglobulin:lactose powders, assigned as BL powders, were stored from 0.11 to 0.95 a(w). The water sorption behavior of BL powders was studied gravimetrically, and the state of lactose was investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Before storage, BL powders were amorphous. After storage, a loss of water was observed on moisture sorption isotherms of BL powders. It was related to the formation of lactose crystals, detected by DSC and SEM analysis, and to the structural collapse of the powders. Water loss due to lactose crystallization was shifted to higher a(w) with increasing β-lactoglobulin content in BL powders. Moreover, kinetics of moisture sorption demonstrated that β-lactoglobulin was also responsible for a slower crystallization process in BL powders. Then, the water sorption behavior of BL powders was very different from the behavior of the 2 compounds mixed after separate lyophilization. All these results pointed out interaction between lactose and β-lactoglobulin, which appeared during lyophilization and still occurred during storage. This lactose/β-lactoglobulin interaction stabilized model whey powders against lactose crystallization. 3awater content 3awhey powder 3astorage quality 3alactoglobulins 3alactose 3awater activity 3acrystallization 3astabilizers 3asorption isotherms 3afreeze drying 3ascanning electron microscopy 3achemical bonding1 aScher, Jeffrey Noyes.1 aDesobry, S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2004 May, v. 87, no. 5 p.1158-1166x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20040525b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/05/24  aOther US 7aarticle02913naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002000146245009200166300001800258500001500276520147400291650001501765650001101780650001101791650001301802650002001815650003101835650001201866650001601878650001201894650002101906650002301927650001101950650001101961650003001972650002002002650001102022650001702033653002002050653001202070653001002082653001302092653001402105700001702119700001602136700001702152700001502169773008302184852000902267930003302276945002502309946001302334655001202347IND4362630020221117053711.0040521e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436263002DNAL7 a152909682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFregonesi, J.A.10aEffect of rubber flooring in front of the feed bunk on the time budgets of dairy cattle  ap. 1203-1207.  a2019-12-05  aThe objective of this experiment was to study the effect of rubber flooring in front of the feed bunk on the immediate behavioral response of dairy cattle. Four groups of 12 dairy cattle were alternately housed in sections of a free-stall barn with either 1.85 m of rubber flooring or grooved concrete in the area in front of the feed bunk. Rubber flooring did not affect time spent eating. However, animals showed a slight, but detectable, increase in time standing without eating on the rubber surface (5.5%) compared with concrete (4.8%). For reasons that are unclear, this increase in time spent standing was not limited to the area in front of the feed bunk; animals spent 11.0% of the available time standing elsewhere in the pen (outside of the free stall but not in front of the feed bunk) when they had access to the rubber flooring, compared with 9.0% when housed with access to only concrete floors. In addition, animals spent slightly less time lying in the free stall when they had access to rubber in front of the feed bunk (52.5 vs. 54.3%). Time spent engaged in behaviors such as standing elsewhere in the pen and eating were variable over time. For example, time spent eating declined from 23.1 to 17.4% over the 6-wk trial. In conclusion, dairy cattle with access to rubber flooring in front of the feeder showed small differences in where and how much time they spent standing, although the biological implications of these small changes are unclear. 3adairy cows 3afloors 3arubber 3adrinking 3asocial behavior 3agrooming (animal behavior) 3aposture 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aCattlexphysiology 2aEating 2aFemale 2aFloors and Floorcoverings 2aHousing, Animal 2aRubber 2aTime Factors 0aanimal behavior 0afeeders 0alying 0astanding 0aingestion1 aTucker, C.B.1 aWeary, D.M.1 aFlower, F.C.1 aVittie, T.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2004 May, v. 87, no. 5 p.1203-1207x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20040525b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/05/25  aOther US 7aarticle03500naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001700163245014000180300001800320500001500338520158500353650001501938650002301953650002401976650002602000650001502026650002402041650002102065650002702086650001302113650001802126650001902144650001702163650002302180650001902203650002402222650001202246650002102258650001502279650001602294650001102310650002402321650002402345650002102369650000902390650003102399650002802430650001902458650002002477650001102497650003402508651001102542651001102553653002502564653002202589653001502611700001302626773008302639852000902722930003302731945002502764946001302789655001202802IND4362638720221117053531.0040521e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436263872DNAL7 a152910012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Female fertility was measured as the inverse of the number of inseminations to conception in percent. Variance components were estimated using both the repeatability AM and multitrait AM. The multitrait heritabilities for individual parities were greater than the heritabilities from the repeatability AM, and heritabilities decreased with an increase in parity number. Heritabilities were higher for production traits, lower for SCS, and lowest for female fertility. The genetic correlations were higher than the environmental correlations. Genetic correlations between parities decreased with an increase in the difference in parity number, but all were greater than 0.5. The environmental correlations were higher for production traits, lower for SCS, and close to zero for female fertility. In the analysis of the complete milk recorded population, genetic trends from the repeatability and multitrait models were very similar. The genetic trend for SCS was economically unfavorable until 1993, and favorable since then. The genetic trend for female fertility was close to zero, but the annual environmental trend was -0.2%. The multitrait lactation model is an attractive compromise between repeatability lactation models, which do not account for maturing trends across parities, and test-day models, which are much more demanding computationally. 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3amathematical models 3aparity (reproduction) 3aestimation 3agenetic correlation 3afemale fertility 3aphenotypic correlation 3aHolstein 3agenetic trend 3amilk fat yield 3aheritability 3asomatic cell count 3abreeding value 3aquantitative traits 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgenetics 2aCell Count 2aEnvironment 2aFemale 2aFertilityxgenetics 2aLactationxgenetics 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMale 2aMilkxchemistryxcytology. 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aModels, Animal 2aModels, Genetic 2aParity 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 3aIsrael 0aIsrael 0arepeatability models 0amultitrait models 0amilk yield1 aEzra, E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2004 May, v. 87, no. 5 p.1519-1527x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20040603b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/06/03  aOther US 7aarticle02827naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002600163245009200189300001800281500001500299520121600314650001701530650001201547650001201559650002801571650001801599650002601617650002401643650000701667650001001674650001301684650002601697650002001723650001301743650001301756650003101769650002501800650001001825650002701835650003101862650001301893650003001906650002601936650002201962650003401984653002102018700001602039700001902055773008302074852000902157930003302166945002502199946001302224655001202237IND4362639020221117053653.0040521e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436263902DNAL7 a152910032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLeclercq-Perlat, M.N.14aThe color of Brevibacterium linens depends on the yeast used for cheese deacidification  ap. 1536-1544.  a2019-12-05  aThe color of smear cheeses (Muenster) is traditionally thought to be due to the bacterial flora, e.g., Brevibacterium linens. This study was carried out to evaluate indirect effects of yeast on the color of B. linens. A 60% cheese medium was desacidified with Debaryomyces hansenii or Kluyveromyces marxianus until pH 5.8 was reached. After inactivation of the yeast and addition of agar-NaCl, B. linens was inoculated on the medium surface and incubated at 12 C from d 2 to 28. For each bacterial biofilm, color was evaluated by L*C*h (brightness, chroma, hue angle) spectrocolorimetry. After d 14 (D. hansenii deacidification) and d 21 (K. marxianus desacidification), the color level (as a function of all 3 factors) of B. linens biofilms became maximal and remained so until d 28. Debaryomyces hansenii 304 (LGMPA) was less efficient for deacidification than K. marxianus Laf5. However, color intensity (function of chroma only) was higher when D. hansenii was used. The yeast used had an effect on the composition of the cheese medium in relation to production and consumption of metabolites during deacidification. The results concerning color are discussed with respect to this cheese medium composition. 3acheesemaking 3alactose 3abiofilm 3aKluyveromyces marxianus 3aculture media 3aBrevibacterium linens 3anonprotein nitrogen 3apH 3acolor 3alactates 3aDebaryomyces hansenii 3adeacidification 3apigments 2aBiofilms 2aBrevibacteriumxmetabolism 2aCheesexmicrobiology 2aColor 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aKluyveromycesxmetabolism 2aLactic Acidxanalysis 2aLactosexanalysis 2aSaccharomycetalesxmetabolism 0anitrogen content1 aCorrieu, G.1 aSpinnler, H.E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2004 May, v. 87, no. 5 p.1536-1544x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20040603b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/06/03  aOther US 7aarticle03708naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001600163245011100179300001800290500001500308520188400323650001502207650002302222650002402245650001402269650002202283650002402305650001902329650002502348650002102373650001102394650001902405650001202424650003202436650001302468650005502481650001102536650002402547650002102571650004802592650001602640650002002656650002802676650003402704650002402738650001302762651001402775651001402789653002202803653001502825653002202840700001602862700001702878773008302895852000902978930003302987945002503020946001303045655001203058IND4362636220221117053351.0040521e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436263622DNAL7 a152909952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTsuruta, S.10aGenetic correlations among production, body size, udder, and productive life traits over time in Holsteins  ap. 1457-1468.  a2019-12-05  aGenetic correlations among milk, fat, and protein yields; body size composite (BSC); udder composite (UDC); and productive life (PL) in Holsteins were investigated over time. The data set contained 25,280 records of cows born in Wisconsin between 1979 and 1993. The multiple trait random regression (MT-RR) animal model included registration status, herd-year, age group, and stage of lactation as fixed effects; additive genetic effects with random regressions (RR) on year of birth using the first-order Legendre polynomial; and residual effects. Heterogeneous residual variances were considered in the model. Estimates of variance components and genetic correlations among traits from MT-RR were compared with those estimated with a multiple trait interval (MT-I) model, which assumed that every 3-yr interval was a separate trait and included the same effects as in the MT-RR model except for the RR. Genetic correlations estimated with MT-RR and MT-I models over time among all traits were compared with correlations among breeding values predicted with the single trait (ST) model without RR. Correlations among breeding values predicted with MT-RR, ST, and MT models were also calculated. Additive genetic and residual variances for all traits except PL increased over time; those for PL were constant. As a result, heritability estimates had no significant changes during the 15 yr. Genetic correlations of PL with milk, fat, protein, and BSC declined to zero or negative; those with UDC remained positive. Correlations among breeding values predicted with ST, MT, and MT-RR models were relatively high for all traits except PL. Genetic correlations between PL and other traits varied over time, with some correlations changing sign. For accurate indirect prediction of PL from other traits, the genetic correlations among the traits need to be re-estimated periodically. 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3amathematical models 3alongevity 3abody conformation 3agenetic correlation 3amilk fat yield 3astatistical analysis 3agenetic variance 3audders 3abreeding value 2aAnimals 2aBody Constitutionxgenetics 2aBreeding 2aCattlexanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aLactationxgenetics 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMammary Glands, Animalxanatomy & histology 2aMathematics 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aRegression Analysis 2aSoftware 3aWisconsin 0aWisconsin 0aanimal morphology 0amilk yield 0aresidual variance1 aMisztal, I.1 aLawlor, T.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2004 May, v. 87, no. 5 p.1457-1468x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20040602b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/06/02  aOther US 7aarticle03385naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100002100180245007700201300001800278500001500296520168600311650001701997650001202014650001502026650001802041650001202059650001002071650000802081650002002089650001702109650001502126650002102141650001902162650001002181650003102191650001102222650002102233650001702254650002202271650002202293650001602315650001202331650002102343650002302364650001102387650001202398650002302410650001102433650001702444650001202461653002002473653002302493653002202516653001002538773008302548852000902631930003302640945002502673946001302698655001202711IND4362634920221117053414.0040521e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436263492DNAL7 a152909852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPhillips, C.J.C.14aThe effects of forage provision and group size on the behavior of calves  ap. 1380-1388.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of providing alternative forages to individual or group-reared calves on their behavior were examined in 2 experiments. In experiment 1, 24 calves were reared in groups of 3 or individually in straw-bedded pens from age 1 to 7 wk. One-half of the calves in each treatment were provided with ad libitum cut perennial ryegrass herbage. Grass intakes and time spent eating grass were greater for grouped calves than for individual calves. Providing grass reduced concentrate intake of grouped calves and reduced the time that all calves, but particularly individual calves, spent eating straw bedding. Ruminating time was increased by offering grass to grouped calves compared with individual calves. Grass reduced the frequency of calves licking their buckets and their pen, vocalizing, and investigating their pen. Particularly for grouped calves provision of grass reduced all grooming. Group rearing reduced the frequency of calves licking their bucket, vocalizing, and investigating their pen, but had no effect on the frequency of pen licking. Calves were weaned at wk 7 and transferred to indoor silage feeding or grazing. Most effects of group rearing and grass provision were not maintained after weaning, but calves that had received grass ate for longer periods when turned out to pasture. In experiment 2, 72 calves were offered a mixture of straw, molasses, and pot ale syrup or grass hay. Calves offered the straw mixture ate more forage and concentrates and grew faster than calves offered hay. It was concluded that nontraditional forages, such as fresh grass and straw mixtures, could benefit the behavior and growth of calves compared with hay and straw. 3acalf feeding 3agrazing 3agroup size 3agroup housing 3aposture 3avices 3ahay 3aliveweight gain 3agroup effect 3arumination 3avoluntary intake 3aLolium perenne 3astraw 3agrooming (animal behavior) 3acalves 3alitter (bedding) 3acalf housing 3arumen development 3afeed concentrates 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aCattlexphysiology 2aEating 2aPoaceae 2aPopulation Density 2aSilage 2aTime Factors 2aWeaning 0aanimal behavior 0aindividual housing 0aabnormal behavior 0alying0 tJournal of dairy science.g2004 May, v. 87, no. 5 p.1380-1388x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20040527b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/05/27  aOther US 7aarticle03952naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001500163245009600178300001800274500001500292520187800307650001602185650002102201650001202222650001902234650001802253650002002271650001502291650002302306650001502329650002502344650002002369650001202389650001102401650002802412650001402440650001302454650001202467650002002479650002302499650002402522650001302546650002202559650001402581650001802595650000702613650001202620650002302632650001402655650002502669650001102694650002702705650002202732650001402754650001802768650002202786650002302808650001302831653001402844653001902858653001502877700002602892700001702918700001702935700001602952700001502968773008302983852000903066930003303075945002503108946001303133655001203146IND4362635020221117053421.0040521e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436263502DNAL7 a152909862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRemond, D.10aEffect of corn particle size on site and extent of starch digestion in lactating dairy cows  ap. 1389-1399.  a2019-12-05  aTwo experiments were conducted to determine the effects of corn particle size (CPS) on site and extent of starch digestion in lactating dairy cows. Animals were fitted with ruminal, duodenal, and ileal cannulas. Dry corn grain accounted for 36% of dry matter intake. In experiment 1, 6 cows were used in a duplicate 3 x 3 Latin square design. Semiflint corn was used. Corn processing methods were grinding, medium rolling, and coarse rolling. The mean particle size of the processed corn was 730, 1807, and 3668 micrometer, respectively. Rumen digestibility of starch linearly decreased from 59% with ground corn to 36% with coarsely rolled corn. Similarly, small intestine digestibility linearly decreased with increased CPS, and consequently, the amount of starch digested in the small intestine was not affected by corn processing. In experiment 2, 4 cows were used in a 2 x 2 crossover design. Dent corn was used. Corn processing methods were grinding and coarse rolling. The mean particle size of the processed corn was 568 and 3458 m, respectively. Rumen digestibility of starch decreased from 70% with ground corn to 54% with coarsely rolled corn. Small intestine digestibility of starch was not significantly affected by CPS, and the amount of starch digested in the small intestine tended to be greater for rolled than for ground corn. In both experiments, starch total tract digestibility decreased with increased CPS. In conclusion, CPS is an efficient tool to manipulate rumen degradability of cornstarch. In midlactation cows, the decrease in the amount of starch digested in the rumen between grinding and coarse rolling is partly compensated for by an increase in the amount of starch digested in the small intestine with dent genotype, but with semiflint genotype postruminal digestion is not increased and rumen escape starch is not utilized by the animal. 3acow feeding 3anitrogen balance 3aammonia 3amilk fat yield 3adigestibility 3asmall intestine 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3aflint corn 3avolatile fatty acids 3alarge intestine 3arolling 3astarch 3amilk protein percentage 3acultivars 3aZea mays 3alactose 3afeed processing 3arumen fermentation 3amilk fat percentage 3agrinding 3adry matter intake 3adent corn 3aparticle size 3apH 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDigestion 2aDuodenumxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aIleumxmetabolism 2aLactation 2aParticle Size 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aStarchxmetabolism 2aZea mays 0adigestion 0asemiflint corn 0amilk yield1 aCabrera-Estrada, J.I.1 aChampion, M.1 aChauveau, B.1 aCoudure, R.1 aPoncet, C.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2004 May, v. 87, no. 5 p.1389-1399x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20040527b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/05/27  aOther US 7aarticle02502naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245009900168300001400267520127300281650002701554650004301581650001301624650002501637650001101662650001001673650001801683650002401701650001501725650001001740651001001750651001001760653001101770700002501781700002201806773012601828852000901954856008501963930003302048946001102081655001202092IND4399897720221117053401.0080113e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439989772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-007-9210-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadr, Abdelfattah 10aOrigin and ancestry of Egyptian clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) As revealed by AFLP markers  ap. 21-31.  aThe origin and ancestry for Egyptian clover, Trifolium alexandrinum, was examined using AFLP data. The data support a close relationship of T. alexandrinum accessions from Syria and Egypt to T. apertum, T. berytheum, and T. salmoneum. However, crossability and geographic distributions suggest that T. apertum is an unlikely progenitor. In contrast, T. salmoneum appears to be the most probable progenitor for Syrian material of Egyptian clover, although a close relationship to T. berytheum was also revealed. The ability of these species to cross freely indicates that T. salmoneum and T. berytheum may be regarded as the primary ancestors from, which man domesticated Egyptian clover through artificial selection in Syria. Following domestication, the earlier forms of the crop species could have been taken into rain-fed cultivation in Palestine and irrigated cultivation in Egypt. In this regard, the domestication of Egyptian clover may be analogous to other crops, such as barley and wheat, which were also domesticated in the Fertile Crescent and taken into cultivation in the Nile Valley. It appears that genetic improvement of the crop occurred in Egypt after cultivation, and that the varieties that were developed in Egypt were later distributed worldwide. 3aTrifolium alexandrinum 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aancestry 3aartificial selection 3abarley 3acrops 3adomestication 3agenetic improvement 3airrigation 3awheat 3aEgypt 3aSyria 0aOrigin1 aEl-Shazly, Hanaa H. 1 aWatson, Linda E. 0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2008 Feb., v. 55, no. 1 p.21-31dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0925-98647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-007-9210-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01648naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245016400168300001600332520041200348650003700760650001500797650001500812650001400827650000900841651001200850651001100862651001000873653003000883653001700913653001500930653002700945700001800972773013400990852000901124856008501133930003301218946001101251655001201262IND4393064720221117053337.0070715e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439306472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-007-9220-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaghetti, Gaetano 14aThe Corsican citron melon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.)

However, the impact of biomass and surfactants on gas/liquid (G/L) mass transfer needs to be better evaluated because the effects on the mass transfer coefficient KL and the interfacial area a, respectively, remains misunderstood.RESULTS: This study showed that, first, the surfactant extract produced by Rhodococcus erythropolis reduced the surface hydrophobicity of the biomass. Secondly, an optimal concentration appeared to exist for both components, respectively 0.5 g L⁻¹ and 0.7 g L⁻¹ for biomass (B) and surfactant extract (SE) when the global mass transfer coefficient (KLa) of oxygen was measured in a silicone oil/water TPPB. However, the combination of B and SE was found to induce a negative synergism. In particular, SE improved the interfacial area a by increasing the bubble diameter, while B reduced it as soon as a concentration of 1 g L⁻¹ was exceeded. In contrast, the SE acted negatively on the KL, while B improved it overall.CONCLUSION: Better consideration is needed of the effect of biotic components in order to understand the phenomenon of G/L mass transfer in a TPPB. The behaviour of biomass growth and surfactants may strongly influence the mathematical models proposed in the literature. 3aRhodococcus erythropolis 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3aeffluents 3ahydrophobicity 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3aoils 3aoxygen 3asilicone 3asurfactants 3asynergism 3avolatile organic compounds1 aGillet, Sébastien1 aDelvigne, Frank1 aBlecker, Christophe1 aLebeau, Frédéric1 aWathelet, Jean-Paul1 aManigat, Geralda1 aThonart, Philippe0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2009 Sept., v. 84, no. 9 p.1274-1283dJohn Wiley '' Sons, Ltd.x0268-25757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.21723Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02542naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002900137245008100166300001800247500002400265520141700289650001401706650001401720650002201734650002601756650001201782650001501794650002001809650000701829650001701836650001301853650002001866700003801886700002301924773013501947852000902082856007702091655001202168IND4424672820221117053350.0090814s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442467282DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.21832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMercader-Trejo, Flora E.10aMercury(II) removal using polymer inclusion membranes containing Cyanex 471X  ap. 1323-1330.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Regulatory controls to limit mercury emissions in waters have impacted on the development of membrane extraction-based methodologies for its separation. The specific advantages (effective carrier immobilization, easy preparation, versatility, and good mechanical properties) of polymer inclusion membranes (PIMs) make them suitable for this purpose. In this work a novel procedure using PIMs for mercury separation with a commercial available extractant (Cyanex 471X) is described and evaluated through the determination of the efficiency parameters (permeability, selectivity, stability) and membrane characterization.RESULTS: Using a membrane composed of 30% cellulose triacetate (CTA), 60% 2-nitrophenyl octyl ether (NPOE), and 10% w/w Cyanex 471X a 0.1 mmol dm⁻³ Hg(II) solution prepared in 0.01 mol dm⁻³ HCl was transported to a 0.05 mol dm⁻³ NaCl solution at pH 12.3 with permeability values in the feed and strip phases of 0.25 and 0.15 cm min⁻¹, respectively. A diffusive Fickian-type mechanism was inferred from the results. High separation factors ranging between 2 and 5900, less than 11% of competing metal ions transported, active transport of the metal ion and a successful reuse of the PIM were achieved.CONCLUSION: Optimized PIMs using Cyanex 471X represent an interesting alternative for Hg(II) removal from waters showing high efficiency factors and easy implementation. 3acellulose 3aemissions 3ahydrochloric acid 3amechanical properties 3amercury 3ametal ions 3anutritive value 3apH 3apermeability 3apolymers 3asodium chloride1 aRodríguez de San Miguel, Eduardo1 ade Gyves, Josefina0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2009 Sept., v. 84, no. 9 p.1323-1330dJohn Wiley '' Sons, Ltd.x0268-25757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.21833Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02834naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245010500153300001800258500002400276520168500300650002901985650002602014650004302040650001802083650001502101650002002116650002002136700001802156700001602174700001402190700002002204700002702224773013502251852000902386856007702395655001202472IND4424672720221117053727.0090814s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442467272DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.21812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChhatre, S.10aUse of PAT principles for the open-loop control of laboratory and pilot-scale chromatography columns  ap. 1314-1322.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Recently, there has been increased interest in employing process analytical technologies (PAT) that combine an understanding of how operating parameters affect product quality together with real-time analysis to achieve efficient process manipulation during operation and thereby ensure that product outputs meet specifications. Primarily intended as the basis of control strategies for full-scale manufacturing systems, such techniques can bring significant benefits for steps such as chromatographic separations. Rapid at-line monitoring of a target product can also enable the design of more sophisticated development trials than are generally used at present, whereby data gathered during development can be used to initiate the use of control techniques that drive a process to achieve target values for outputs such as yield or purity. Furthermore, the acquisition of rapid at-line data also frees the operator from having to perform potentially laborious off-line assays.RESULTS: To demonstrate the value of such an approach, a target product (alcohol dehydrogenase) produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) was monitored in real time by stopped-flow analysis (SFA) every 45 s. The at-line monitoring system of the HIC step used in both packed and expanded bed modes provided a visual description of product levels, facilitating a real-time representation of yield.CONCLUSION: This PAT information enabled process control wherein the load cycle was regulated successfully to a pre-specified set-point to achieve a desired level of breakthrough and so ensure that the product met its target specification. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3ahydrophobic interaction chromatography 3amanufacturing 3amonitoring 3aprocess control 3aproduct quality1 aBou-Habib, G.1 aSmith, M.P.1 aHoare, M.1 aBracewell, D.G.1 aTitchener-Hooker, N.J.0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2009 Sept., v. 84, no. 9 p.1314-1322dJohn Wiley '' Sons, Ltd.x0268-25757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.21813Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02198naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013000166300001600296500002400312520097500336650002801311650001301339650001401352650001801366650001601384650000901400650001001409650001501419650001401434650002201448650001801470650002301488651001401511700002401525700002401549700002101573773010001594852000901694856008501703655001201788IND4424645520221117053939.0090814s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442464552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10498-008-9043-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffman, Adam R.10aCharacteristics and Influence of Phosphorus Accumulated in the Bed Sediments of a Stream Located in an Agricultural Watershed  ap. 371-389.  aIncludes references  aWe investigated the accumulation and influence of bioavailable P (BAP) in sediments of a stream located in an agricultural area of the Lake Mendota watershed in Wisconsin, USA. During hydrologic events, the stream carried high concentrations of suspended sediment (up to 250 mg/l) and BAP (up to 2.5 mg/l). Bed sediments were highly enriched in BAP, as inventories of BAP in the top 10 cm of sediment ranged from 143 to 14,500 μg P/cm². Space variations in BAP inventories were related to site-specific hydrodynamics and geochemical factors, including iron (Fe; r ² = 0.71) and aluminum (Al; r ² = 0.54) concentrations. Most sites behaved as potential sinks for dissolved reactive phosphate during hydrologic events and potential sources during base-flow periods.

In controlled experiments, hornets can survive for 10 min at the temperature up to 47°C, whereas the temperature inside the bee balls does not rise higher than 45.9°C. We have found here that the CO₂ concentration inside the bee ball also reaches a maximum (3.6 ± 0.2%) in the initial 0-5 min phase after bee ball formation. The lethal temperature of the hornet (45-46°C) under conditions of CO₂ concentration (3.7 ± 0.44%) produced using human expiratory air is almost the same as that in the bee ball. The lethal temperature of the honeybee is 50-51°C under the same air conditions.

The preservation of the CRC proliferative potential as assayed by plating on standard LB agar was shown to depend on the conditions of the formation of the dormant cells. In aged post-stationary cultures of micrococci and arthrobacters grown under carbon and phosphorus limitation the number of colony-forming units (CFU/ml) of CRC decreased in the course of 3-9 month incubation to the level of 10⁶-10⁷ CFU/ml. However, M. luteus CRC obtained under carbon and nitrogen limitation and A. globiformis CRC obtained under nitrogen limitation and starvation completely lost their ability to form colonies on standard solid medium after 4-6 months of incubation and turned into a 'non-culturable' (non-platable) state. In this case, the ratio of live cells in the population of M. luteus and A. globiformis 'non-culturable' CRCs (determined by the Live/Dead staining test) was 10-44% of the total cell number. To study the possible preservation of proliferative potential in non-platable CRCs, various methods of their reactivation were applied. Although preincubation of CRC suspensions in a buffer solution of 0.1 M K₂HPO₄ (pH 7.4) or in the presence of lysozyme (1 or 10 μg/ml) resulted in increased numbers of live cells (determined by the Live/Dead test) or in disruption of the cell conglomerates, it did not increase considerably the CFU titer on LB medium. Variations in the medium composition, such as addition of sodium pyruvate as an antioxidant or dilution of the medium, promoted the formation of macrocolonies by a small portion of nonplateable CRC of M. luteus (50-80 CFU/ml), whereas the number of the cells capable of microcolony formation (mCFU) was 1.8-6.8 x 10⁵ mCFU/ml, exceeding the CFU titers by four orders of magnitude. The application of semisolid agar and the most probable number (MPN) method was the most efficient for determination of the mCFU titer, and an almost complete reversion of 'non-culturable' micrococcal CRCs to microcolony formation was observed (up to 2.3 x 10⁷ mCFU/ml). The usefulness of diluted complete media for the restoration of the colony-forming ability of the dormant forms was confirmed in experiments with 'nonculturable' CRCs of A. globiformis.

A significant heterogeneity of the population in terms of these parameters was revealed. Some cells within the population were more sensitive to nitrogen deficiency, and their photosynthetic apparatus was disrupted to a greater extent. The cells within a population also differed in terms of their ability to recover after incubation at low nitrogen levels. Enhancement of nitrogen deficiency resulted in an increase in the variability of the F o and F v/F m values of the cells. Fluorescence variability decreased at a less pronounced deficiency. Fluorescence variability should be taken into consideration in the studies concerning responses of algae to changes in nutrient contents. 3aThalassiosira 3afluorescence 3anitrogen 3aphotosystem II 3aplankton1 aIl'ash, L.

It had been known that l-phenylalanine 4-hydroxylase from Chromobacterium violaceum could convert l-tryptophan to 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan and l-phenylalanine to l-tyrosine; however, the activity for l-tryptophan was extremely low compared to l-phenylalanine activity levels. We used the information on the crystal structures of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases to generate C. violaceum l-phenylalanine 4-hydroxylase with high l-tryptophan hydroxylating activity. In silico structural modeling analysis suggested that hydrophobic and/or stacking interactions with the substrate and cofactor at L101 and W180 in C. violaceum l-phenylalanine 4-hydroxylase would increase hydroxylation activity. Based on this hypothesis, we introduced a saturation mutagenesis towards these sites followed by the evaluation of 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan productivity using a modified Gibbs assay. Three and nine positive mutants were obtained from the L101 and W180 mutant libraries, respectively. Among the mutants, L101Y and W180F showed the highest l-tryptophan hydroxylation activity at the respective residues. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed that k cat values for l-tryptophan hydroxylation were increased from 0.40 (wild-type) to 1.02 (L101Y) and 0.51 s⁻¹ (W180F). In addition, the double mutant (L101Y-W180F) displayed higher l-tryptophan hydroxylation activity than the wild-type and the W180F and L101Y mutants. The k cat value of L101Y-W180F increased to 2.08 s⁻¹, showing a 5.2-fold increase compared to wild-type enzyme levels. 3aChromobacterium violaceum 3acrystal structure 3ahydrophobicity 3ahydroxylation 3amodels 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aphenylalanine 3atryptophan 3atyrosine1 aHara, Ryotaro1 aNozawa, Ai0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2009 Sept., v. 108, no. 3 p.184-189dSociety for Bioscience and Bioengineering, Japan; Amsterdam, the Netherlandsx1389-17237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.04.0023Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03206naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002200148245014200170300001600312500002400328500001500352520144200367650002201809650002601831650002501857650001401882650002301896650001501919650001201934650002401946650001401970650001501984650002101999650001602020650001502036650001102051650001602062650003102078650002002109650001402129650002102143650002902164650001702193650000702210650001502217650002502232653002002257700001802277700001802295700001902313700002102332773017802353852000902531856008802540655001202628IND4424550620221117052722.0090814s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442455062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatanabe, Takashi10aCloning and characterization of a novel phytase from wastewater treatment yeast Hansenula fabianii J640 and expression in Pichia pastoris  ap. 225-230.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aPhosphohydrolysis of organic phosphorus compounds by acid phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.1 and EC 3.1.3.2) is an important method for efficient removal of phosphorus from high concentration organic wastewater. Another important method is supplementation of animal feed with phytase (EC 3.1.3.8 and EC 3.1.3.26), which improves the availability of phytate-phosphates (phosphate that are hydrolyzed by phytases), making it possible to add less phosphate to animal feed and resulting in the excretion of less phosphorus by the animals. In the present study, we purified a novel phytase from the wastewater treatment yeast Hansenula fabianii J640 (Hfphytase), cloned the 1456 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding Hfphytase, and characterized Hfphytase. The molecular weight of Hfphytase after deglycosylation by PNGaseF was 49 kDa. The optimal pH and temperature for enzyme activity were 4.5 and 50 °C, respectively. Hfphytase exhibits 40% identity with Debaryomyces castellii phytase, 37% identity with Aspergillus niger PhyB, and 34% identity with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pho5p. Recombinant Hfphytase was transformed and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The yield was 23 g/l by jar fermenter cultivation. The marked phosphohydrolysis activity exhibited by Hfphytase on six substrates (pNP-P, sodium phytate, glucose-1 phosphate, glucose-6 phosphate, α-glycerophosphate and β-glycerophosphate) indicated that it is a non-specific acid phosphatase. 3aAspergillus niger 3aKomagataella pastoris 3awastewater treatment 3a3-phytase 3aHansenula fabianii 3aphosphorus 3aanimals 3aopen reading frames 3a4-phytase 3aphosphates 3amolecular weight 3aphytic acid 3afermenters 3ayeasts 3atemperature 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aenzyme activity 3aexcretion 3aacid phosphatase 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aDebaryomyces 3apH 3awastewater 3aalkaline phosphatase 0aPichia pastoris1 aIkeda, Hiroko1 aMasaki, Kazuo1 aFujii, Tsutomu1 aIefuji, Haruyuki0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2009 Sept., v. 108, no. 3 p.225-230dSociety for Bioscience and Bioengineering, Japan; Amsterdam, the Netherlandsx1389-17237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.03.0213Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01187naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005600128300001800184520027000202650001900472650002200491650002500513650002300538650002300561651001300584651001300597700001600610700001700626700001400643700001400657700001400671700001800685773006900703852000900772939003300781946001100814655001200825IND9103909320221117053513.0911007s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910390932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHandjieva, N.10aMajoroside, an iridoid glucoside from Platago major  ap. 1317-1318.  aA new iridoid glucoside, majoroside, along with the known aucubin have been isolated from Plantago major from Bulgaria and Mongolia.

The decolorization mechanism of two triarylmethane dyes, namely, Basic Green 4 and Acid Violet 17 is reported using Cyathus bulleri laccase. Basic Green 4 was decolorized through N-demethylation by laccase alone, while in mediator assisted reactions, dye breakdown was initiated from oxidation of carbinol form of the dye. Benzaldehyde and N,N-dimethyl aniline were the major end products. With Acid Violet 17, laccase carried out N-deethylation and in mediator assisted reactions, oxidation of the carbinol form of the dye occurred resulting in formation of formyl benzene sulfonic acid, carboxy benzene sulfonic acid and benzene sulfonic acid. Toxicity analysis revealed that Basic Green 4 was toxic and treatment with laccase/mediators resulted in 80-100% detoxification. The treatment of the textile dye solution using laccase and 2,2'-azino-di-(-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) was demonstrated in an enzyme membrane reactor. At a hydraulic retention time of 6h, the process was operated for a period of 15 days with nearly 95% decolorization, 10% reduction in flux and 70% recovery of active ABTS. 3alaccase 3aCyathus 3adecolorization 3abioremediation 3abiotechnology 3asulfonic acids 3adyes 3aaniline 3aoxidation 3abenzene 3atoxicity 3abenzaldehyde 0asulfonic acid1 aMiśra, Saroja.1 aSreekrishnan, Trichur Ramaswamy0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2009 Aug. 10, v. 143, no. 1 p.69-78dElsevierx0168-16567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2009.06.0113Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01770naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002600149245007500175300001600250500002400266520084300290650001801133650001601151650001201167650001801179650003101197700001801228700002501246773009901271852000901370856008901379655001201468IND4423911520221117052606.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442391152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2009.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalasundaram, Bangaru10aAdvances in product release strategies and impact on bioprocess design  ap. 477-485.  aIncludes references  aIntracellular products such as recombinant insulin, which are typically produced in microbial host cells, demand a product release step to remove them from the cell. How this is performed determines the quantity of released contaminants, the particle size distribution of cell debris and the physical properties of the resultant process stream, which all impact on the performance of the downstream operations. Thus, achieving selective release of the desired product is crucial for improving the process economics. Advances in upstream processing (the bioreactor phase) have been successful in achieving high product titres, and downstream costs now typically dominate the overall manufacturing costs. Here, we review and discuss the selective release of products as a possible means of improving the efficiency of downstream processing. 3abioprocessing 3abioreactors 3ainsulin 3amanufacturing 3aparticle size distribution1 aHarrison, Sue1 aBracewell, Daniel G.0 tTrends in biotechnology.g2009 Aug., v. 27, no. 8 p.477-485dElsevier Sciencex0167-77997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2009.04.0043Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01631naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002100149245005100170300001600221500002400237520075700261650001701018650002201035650002101057650002201078700002201100700002201122773009901144852000901243856008901252655001201341IND4423911220221117053654.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442391122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2009.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatzen, Federico10aMembrane protein expression: no cells required  ap. 455-460.  aIncludes references  aStructural and functional studies of membrane proteins have been severely hampered by difficulties in producing sufficient quantities of properly folded protein products.

Owing to its inherent open nature, cell-free protein expression has become a highly promising tool for the fast and efficient production of these difficult-to-express proteins.

In a pH-stat fed-batch culture, supplementation with 40 mM of CaCO₃ increased the specific CoQ₁₀ content and oxidative stress by 22.4 and 48%, respectively. Also, the effect of Ca²⁺ on the increase of CoQ₁₀ content was successfully verified in a pilot-scale (300 L) fermentor. In this study, the increased oxidative stress in A. tumefaciens culture by the supplementation of Ca²⁺ is hypothesized to stimulate the increase of specific CoQ₁₀ content in order to protect the membrane against lipid peroxidation. Our results improve the understanding of Ca²⁺ effect on CoQ₁₀ biosynthesis in A. tumefaciens and should contribute to better industrial production of CoQ₁₀ by biological processes. 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3abiosynthesis 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3acell growth 3achromium 3acoenzyme Q10 3acopper 3aculture media 3afermenters 3airon 3alipid peroxidation 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3anickel 3aoxidative stress 3azinc1 aKim, Sang-yong.1 aSeo, Jin-Ho1 aJeya, Marimuthu1 aZhang, Ye-Wang1 aRamu, Thangadurai1 aKim, In-Won1 aLee, Jung-Kul0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2009 Aug., v. 32, no. 5 p.697-700dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-009-0318-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01678naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008800125300001800213300002300231500001500254520076900269650001101038650003101049650001901080650001101099653001301110653001701123653001901140653001401159700001701173773009501190852000901285939003301294946001301327655001201340IND9101639220221117053718.0910402e19900505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910163922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoke, S.S.10aEffect of aqueous swelling and stretching on the structure and properties of cotton  ap. 1967-1971.  ap. 1967-1971. ill.  a2019-12-05  aSpectacular changes in structure and properties of cotton have been found to result from swelling and stretching treatments in water. Fibers from one variety of cotton (Sudan) were swollen in water and stretched to their limit. While one lot was dried in the stretched state, another was allowed to dry in the slack condition after being subjected to stretch. The two types of treatments produced considerable changes in structural and physical properties, the stretch drying being more drastic. Enhancement of breaking load and tenacity without much loss in extensibility improved fibrillar orientation without change in crystallinity; reduction in ribbon width wall thickness and number of convolutions, etc. are some of the changes resulting from the treatment. 3acotton 3aphysicochemical properties 3aultrastructure 3adrying 0aswelling 0aplant fibers 0astretch drying 0atreatment1 aIyer, K.R.K.0 tJournal of applied polymer science.g1990 May 5, v. 39, no. 9 p.1967-1971x0021-89957nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01863naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245013200168300001800300500002400318520072300342650001201065650002601077650003701103650001901140650001701159650001101176650001301187700002001200700002301220700002101243700001901264700002001283773010101303852000901404856008801413655001201501IND4424258220221117052524.0090807s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442425822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.06.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShundo, Atsuomi10aControllable shape selectivity based on highly ordered carbonyl and methyl groups in simple β-structural polypeptide on silica  ap. 6170-6176.  aIncludes references  aPoly(l-alanine)-grafted porous silica (Sil-Ala₂₂) was prepared by polymerization of N-carboxyanhydride of l-alanine initiated by 3-aminopropylated silica.

Much time or peak capacity can be gained with the use of multiple parallel columns at the second-dimension while the aggregate time of separation increases only by the increment of the gradient time of the second-dimension. Multidimensional chromatographic systems are now used to perform many tasks ranging from routine, fast analyses to specialized, arduous separations. In this work, we focus on the advantages of a multiple, parallel columns approach to on-line multidimensional liquid chromatography systems. Calculations of the achievable peak capacities were made as functions of the number of columns operated in parallel. Increasing the number of second-dimension columns from one to two or three causes the largest increase in peak capacity with only a slight increase of aggregate time. We also present some practical aspects to consider when attempting multidimensional separations with multiple columns operated in parallel. 3acomputer software 3aequipment performance 3aliquid chromatography 3asystem optimization1 aHorváth, Krisztián.1 aGuiochon, Georges0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 Aug. 21, v. 1216, no. 34 p.6210-6217dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.06.0853Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01766naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245016800165300001800333500002400351520080400375650004301179650001801222650004401240700001801284773010101302852000901403856008801412655001201500IND4424258520221117053239.0090807s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442425852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.06.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shujun10aTheoretical and experimental comparison of mobile phase consumption between ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography  ap. 6204-6209.  aIncludes references  aUltra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) using small particles and very high pressure has demonstrated higher resolution and speed compared with conventional HPLC.

In addition, theoretical and experimental comparison of mobile phase consumption was made between isocratic HPLC and UPLC as well as between gradient HPLC and UPLC.

Two significantly distinct groups (designated A and B) were present in the genus, with a considerable net nucleotide sequence divergence between the two (8.4%). The two groups occurred sympatrically around the Japanese coast, as previously suggested by Sagara et al. (2005). Group A occurred mostly on the Pacific coast of eastern Japan, while group B was widely distributed along the Kuroshio Current, strongly suggesting different migration routes for each group. The morphological characteristics of the two group specimens were differentiated via the head bump, body proportions and shape of the clavus. Through the addition of Mola sequence data taken from outside Japan to our phylogenetic analyses, three independent groups, including groups A and B, were found, each with a wide geographical distribution, which suggests the presence of at least three independent species within the genus Mola. 3aMola 3acoasts 3ageographical distribution 3ahead 3amitochondrial genome 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aJapan1 aYamanoue, Yusuke1 aSagara, Kotaro1 aNishibori, Masahide1 aKuniyoshi, Hisato1 aUmino, Tetsuya1 aSakai, Yoichi1 aHashimoto, Hiroaki1 aGushima, Kenji0 tIchthyological research.g2009 July, v. 56, no. 3 p.232-244dSpringer Japanx1341-89987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-008-0089-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01820naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245008800158300001600246500002400262520089500286650001701181650001201198650001501210650001001225650001301235650001601248650001101264651001001275700001801285773009701303852000901400856008501409655001201494IND4424033120221117053621.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442403312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10228-009-0096-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Hao10aAge and growth of Schizothorax waltoni in the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, China  ap. 260-265.  aIncludes references  aAge and growth were studied for Schizothorax waltoni in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, southwest of China, from April 2004 to September 2006.

The von Bertalanffy growth parameters based on sectioned otolith data were L t = 689.8{1 - exp[0.051 (t + 3.275)]} for males, and L t = 691.1{1 - exp[0.056 (t + 2.466)]} for females. The slow growth and long life indicate that S. waltoni is vulnerable to overfishing and that harvesting strategies for the species should be conservative. 3aSchizothorax 3afemales 3aharvesting 3amales 3aotoliths 3aoverfishing 3arivers 3aChina1 aChen, Yi-Feng0 tIchthyological research.g2009 July, v. 56, no. 3 p.260-265dSpringer Japanx1341-89987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-009-0096-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03457naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245012600179300001600305500002400321500001500345520151700360650002301877650001501900650001101915650001301926650002501939650002601964650001401990650001302004650001802017650002802035650001802063650005202081650001202133650001702145650003102162650004002193650003102233650001502264650001102279650005802290650002502348650005102373650004402424650006002468650003002528653001002558700002202568700001902590700002302609700002902632773010002661852000902761856008502770655001202855IND4424005320221117052722.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442400532DNAL7 a194719692pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-009-0805-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSar, Aylin10aIdentification and characterization of demethylase JMJD1A as a gene upregulated in the human cellular response to hypoxia  ap. 223-234.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aHypoxia is commonly found in human solid cancers and serves as a selective environment for the survival of aggressive cancer cells and as protection from anti-cancer therapies. In addition to a shift to anaerobic metabolism, the cellular response to hypoxia includes cessation of cell division and/or cell death. These mechanisms have still not been defined. Identification of the members of hypoxia-induced growth arrest pathways remain incomplete. We have undertaken an expression microarray analysis of the cellular response to hypoxia in diverse cell lines. An identified cohort of genes is reliably upregulated in various cells in response to hypoxia, as validated by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). One of the upregulated targets corresponds to an expressed sequence tag encoded by JMJD1A (a gene also known as JHDM2A), which has been identified as a histone demethylase that regulates the transcription of androgen receptor targets. We confirm, by RT-PCR, the upregulation of JMJD1A after hypoxia and desferroxamine treatment in multiple cell lines. We also show that JMJD1A is predominantly, but not exclusively, a nuclear protein. Immunofluorescent staining of HeLa cells shows a shift of cytoplasmic JMJD1A into the nucleus on hypoxia treatment. Immunohistochemical staining has revealed that JMJD1A is widely expressed in tissues, even in cells that are not known to express the androgen receptor, and is significantly increased in smooth muscle cells upon hypoxia treatment. 3aandrogen receptors 3acell death 3ahumans 3ahistones 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amicroarray technology 3aneoplasms 3amyocytes 3asmooth muscle 3aexpressed sequence tags 3acell division 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ahypoxia 3aanaerobiosis 3agene expression regulation 2aCell Hypoxiaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aHypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunitxmetabolism 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aJumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aOxidoreductases, N-Demethylatingxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aUp-Regulationxphysiology 0agenes1 aPonjevic, Dragana1 aNguyen, Monica1 aBox, Adrian Harold1 aDemetrick, Douglas James0 tCell and tissue research.g2009 Aug., v. 337, no. 2 p.223-234dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-009-0805-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03387naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245008900181300001600270500002400286520171600310650001502026650002402041650001002065650002502075650002502100650001802125650000902143650001302152650001802165650005202183650002302235650003302258650001202291650002802303650004402331650006102375650002002436650002202456650000902478650002302487650001902510650003502529700002602564700001902590700002102609700002102630773010002651852000902751856008502760655001202845IND4424005020221117052515.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442400502DNAL7 a194490332pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-009-0812-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoell, Susan10aAgrin defines polarized distribution of orthogonal arrays of particles in astrocytes  ap. 185-195.  aIncludes references  aAccumulating evidence indicates that agrin, a heparan sulphate proteoglycan of the extracellular matrix, plays a role in the organization and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier. This evidence is based on the differential effects of agrin isoforms on the expression and distribution of the water channel protein, aquaporin-4 (AQP4), on the swelling capacity of cultured astrocytes of neonatal mice and on freeze-fracture data revealing an agrin-dependent clustering of orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs), the structural equivalent of AQP4. Here, we show that the OAP density in agrin-null mice is dramatically decreased in comparison with wild-types, by using quantitative freeze-fracture analysis of astrocytic membranes. In contrast, anti-AQP4 immunohistochemistry has revealed that the immunoreactivity of the superficial astrocytic endfeet of the agrin-null mouse is comparable with that in wild-type mice. Moreover, in vitro, wild-type and agrin-null astrocytes cultured from mouse embryos at embryonic day 19.5 differ neither in AQP4 immunoreactivity, nor in OAP density in freeze-fracture replicas. Analyses of brain tissue samples and cultured astrocytes by reverse transcription with the polymerase chain reaction have not demonstrated any difference in the level of AQP4 mRNA between wild-type astrocytes and astrocytes from agrin-null mice. Furthermore, we have been unable to detect any difference in the swelling capacity between wild-type and agrin-null astrocytes. These results clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that agrin plays a pivotal role for the clustering of OAPs in the endfoot membranes of astrocytes, whereas the mere presence of AQP4 is not sufficient for OAP clustering. 3aastrocytes 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3aextracellular matrix 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aneonates 3aproteoglycans 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3awater distribution 2aAgrinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aAquaporin 4xmetabolism 2aAstrocytesxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aCell-Derived Microparticlesxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aCells, Cultured 2aFreeze Fracturing 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning1 aFallier-Becker, Petra1 aDeutsch, Urban1 aMack, Andreas F.1 aWolburg, Hartwig0 tCell and tissue research.g2009 Aug., v. 337, no. 2 p.185-195dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-009-0812-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04486naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100003500178245019900213300001800412500002400430506007600454520174000530506003702270650002302307650001402330650001902344650001602363650001302379650001002392650001302402650001302415650001502428650001202443650002202455650001702477650002302494650001802517650001802535650001302553650001202566650002102578650003002599650001702629650002402646650001702670650002302687650001002710650001002720650003702730650002002767650002602787650001002813650001102823650002102834650002202855650003602877650001102913650004502924650003502969650002803004650002103032650003203053650005203085650003103137650007003168650002603238650002903264650002103293650004103314700002803355700002603383700003303409773010403442852000903546856007703555655001203632IND4423960020221207075416.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442396002DNAL7 a194014442pmid7 aPMC27136522pmcid7 a10.2337/dc09-04202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-García, M.

We aimed to study the determinants of serum ferritin levels in premenopausal women among indexes of insulin resistance, adiposity, hyperandrogenism, and genotypes pertaining to inflammation, oxidative stress, and iron metabolism. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 257 premenopausal women, classified depending on the presence or absence of PCOS, obesity, and/or abnormal glucose tolerance, underwent a complete metabolic evaluation, serum ferritin, haptoglobin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements, and genotyping for proinflammatory and prooxidant variants and mutations in the HFE gene. RESULTS: Serum ferritin concentrations were increased in women presenting with PCOS and/or abnormal glucose tolerance, independent of obesity. A stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis (R² = 0.18, P < 0.0001) retained menstrual dysfunction (β = 0.14, P = 0.035), free testosterone (β = 0.14, P = 0.052), insulin sensitivity index (β = -0.12, P = 0.012), the His63Asp variant in HFE (β = 0.16, P = 0.008), and abnormal glucose tolerance (β = 0.15, P = 0.015) as significant predictors of the logarithm of ferritin levels, whereas CRP, haptoglobin, waist-to-hip ratio, or variants in the TNFα, TNFRSF1B, IL6, IL6ST, IL6Rα, PON1, and HFE Cys282Tyr mutation exerted no influence. CONCLUSIONS: Androgen excess (partly because of hyperandrogenemia and partly because of menstrual dysfunction), insulin resistance, abnormal glucose tolerance, and the HFE His63Asp variant correlate with ferritin levels in premenopausal women.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aC-reactive protein 3aadiposity 3aanimal ovaries 3ablood serum 3aferritin 3agenes 3agenomics 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3ainterleukin-6 3alinear models 3amutation 3aobesity 3aoxidative stress 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3apremenopause 3aregression analysis 3atestosterone 3awaist-to-hip ratio 3awomen 2aAdult 2aAryldialkylphosphatasexgenetics 2aBody Mass Index 2aDNAxbloodxgenetics. 2aExons 2aFemale 2aFerritinsxblood 2aGenetic Variation 2aGlucose Intolerancexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aInflammationxgeneticsxphysiopathology. 2aInsulin Resistancexphysiology 2aInterleukin-6xgenetics 2aIronxmetabolism 2aMenstrual Cyclexphysiology 2aObesityxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aOxidative Stressxgenetics 2aPolycystic Ovary Syndromexgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPremenopausexphysiology 2aReference Values 2aSTAT6 Transcription Factorxgenetics1 aLuque Ramírez, Manuel.1 aSan-Millán, José L.1 aEscobar-Morreale, Héctor F.0 tDiabetes care.g2009 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1525-1530dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc09-04203Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03477naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002200178245010200200300001800302500002400320506007600344520140500420506003701825650001801862650001101880650002001891650001801911650001401929650001201943650001101955650001701966650001201983650004001995650001102035650001702046650001002063650001102073650001702084650001402101650002402115650003002139650002002169650001402189650004402203650006402247650003702311650001102348650005002359650002902409650001502438650002902453650003202482650001802514650002102532650002202553700002002575700001802595773010402613852000902717856007702726655001202803IND4423959520221207075431.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442395952DNAL7 a194876332pmid7 aPMC27136162pmcid7 a10.2337/dc09-02122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, Rohana J.10aEffects of Acute Insulin-Induced Hypoglycemia on Spatial Abilities in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes  ap. 1503-1506.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of acute insulin-induced hypoglycemia on spatial cognitive abilities in adult humans with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixteen adults with type 1 diabetes underwent two counterbalanced experimental sessions: euglycemia (blood glucose 4.5 mmol/l [81 mg/dl]) and hypoglycemia (2.5 mmol/l [45 mg/dl]). Arterialized blood glucose levels were maintained using a hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp technique. During each session, subjects underwent detailed assessment of spatial abilities from the Kit of Factor-Referenced Cognitive Tests and two tests of general cognitive function. RESULTS: Spatial ability performance deteriorated significantly during hypoglycemia. Results for the Hidden Patterns, Card Rotations, Paper Folding, and Maze Tracing tests were all impaired significantly (P [less-than or equal to] 0.001) during hypoglycemia, as were results for the Cube Comparisons Test (P = 0.03). The Map Memory Test was not significantly affected by hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoglycemia is a common side effect of insulin therapy in individuals with type 1 diabetes, and spatial abilities are of critical importance in day-to-day functioning. The deterioration in spatial abilities observed during modest experimental hypoglycemia provides novel information on the cerebral hazards of hypoglycemia that has potential relevance to everyday activities.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacute effects 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3ablood glucose 3acognition 3aglucose 3ahumans 3ahypoglycemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3amemory 3atherapeutics 2aAdult 2aAffect 2aAge of Onset 2aAttention 2aAuditory Perception 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Mass Index 2aCognition 2aCognition Disordersxchemically induced 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xbloodxdrug therapyxpsychology. 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemiaxchemically inducedxpsychology. 2aInsulinxadverse effects 2aMotivation 2aNeuropsychological Tests 2aPattern Recognition, Visual 2aReaction Time 2aSpace Perception 2aVisual Perception1 aFrier, Brian M.1 aDeary, Ian J.0 tDiabetes care.g2009 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1503-1506dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc09-02123Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03036naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002900178245010400207300001800311500002400329506007600353520105800429506003701487650001601524650001301540650002301553650001101576650001201587650001401599650001601613650003101629650001001660650001501670650001001685650000901695650004701704650005301751650002301804650001101827650001901838650001101857650001601868650001601884650002601900650001501926650002201941650001501963650002401978650005702002650001902059650001602078651002502094700003202119700002802151700001702179773010402196852000902300856007702309655001202386IND4423958920221207055725.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442395892DNAL7 a194708402pmid7 aPMC27136432pmcid7 a10.2337/dc09-04792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiménez-Garcia, Rodrigo10aPrevalence and Predictors of Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening Among Spanish Women With Diabetes  ap. 1470-1472.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To examine the use of mammography and Papanicolaou (Pap) smear among women with diabetes and to identify predictors of adherence to these tests. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed data of a nationally representative sample of Spanish women. Diabetes status was self-reported. Screenings were assessed asking whether they had a mammography (greater-than-or-equal40 years) and a Pap smear (18-69 years) within the previous 2 and 3 years, respectively. RESULTS: Women with diabetes were less likely to receive mammography (57.9%) or have a Pap smear (61.5%) than women without diabetes (mammography 61.9%, P < 0.05; Pap smear 65.6%, P < 0.05). After adjusting for age, educational level, income, comorbidity, tobacco use, obesity, and physician visits, the corresponding odds ratios remained significant (0.84, 95% CI 0.72-0.97) and (0.82, 95% CI 0.66-0.98). Higher educational level was a positive predictor for both tests among diabetic women. CONCLUSIONS: Spanish women with diabetes underuse breast and cervical cancer screening tests.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomorbidity 3adiabetes 3aeducational status 3aincome 3aobesity 3ascreening 3atobacco use 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3awomen 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBreast Neoplasmsxeconomicsxepidemiology. 2aDiabetes Complicationsxeconomicsxepidemiology. 2aEducational Status 2aFemale 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aMammography 2aMiddle Aged 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aOdds Ratio 2aPapanicolaou Test 2aPrevalence 2aRegression Analysis 2aUterine Cervical Neoplasmsxeconomicsxepidemiology. 2aVaginal Smears 2aYoung Adult 0aSpainxepidemiology.1 aHernandez-Barrera, Valentin1 aCarrasco-Garrido, Pilar1 aGil, Ángel.0 tDiabetes care.g2009 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1470-1472dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc09-04793Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04099naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100001700178245010600195300001800301500002400319506007600343520199600419506003702415650002002452650002002472650001702492650001202509650001702521650001202538650004002550650002102590650001302611650001902624650003102643650002302674650001902697650001602716650001002732650001702742650004702759650001302806650004502819650006402864650001102928650001102939650003102950650005902981650004703040650003003087650000903117650001603126650002603142650001503168650002603183650001603209700002203225773010403247852000903351856007703360655001203437IND4423957520221207055752.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442395752DNAL7 a194708372pmid7 aPMC27136112pmcid7 a10.2337/dc08-22562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeyrot, Mark10aHow Does Treatment Satisfaction Work?: Modeling determinants of treatment satisfaction and preference  ap. 1411-1417.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: This study tested a model hypothesizing that treatment affects objective clinical outcomes, which in turn affect perceived consequences, which in turn affect satisfaction and preference judgments. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The model was tested in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial in which 266 patients with type 1 diabetes added active or placebo pramlintide to their insulin regimens. Objective clinical outcomes included changes in glucose and weight control, insulin requirements, incidence of hypoglycemia, and study drug tolerance. At the end of the trial, patients completed the validated PRAM-TSQ questionnaire measuring treatment satisfaction and preference and perceived medication benefits and side effects. RESULTS: Statistical modeling demonstrated that active pramlintide was significantly associated with greater treatment satisfaction, preference, and perceived benefits (all except hypoglycemia prevention), as well as objective clinical outcomes (weight loss, lower postprandial glucose [PPG], lower medication tolerance, more hypoglycemia). Perceptions of treatment consequences were sensitive and specific to their cognate objective clinical outcomes (no halo effects). Clinical outcomes (especially PPG) accounted for almost half of the effect of the study medication on treatment satisfaction and preference. Treatment satisfaction and preference were strongly related to the perceived benefits/side effects of the study medication, and these perceptions (especially glucose control) mediated most of the association of clinical outcomes with satisfaction and preference. CONCLUSIONS: This model received substantial empirical support. Improvements in objective clinical outcomes accounted for a large part of the association of pramlintide treatment with higher treatment satisfaction and preference. Perceived treatment consequences mediated the effect of objective clinical benefits on satisfaction with and preference for the study medication.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3adrug resistance 3adrug therapy 3aglucose 3ahypoglycemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ajob satisfaction 3apatients 3aquestionnaires 3arandomized clinical trials 3astatistical models 3aweight control 3aweight loss 2aAdult 2aAge of Onset 2aAmyloidxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aAppetite 2aBlood Glucosexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xbloodxdrug therapyxpsychology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemiaxepidemiology 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aInsulinxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aIslet Amyloid Polypeptide 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aModels, Psychological 2aPerception 2aPersonal Satisfaction 2aWeight Loss1 aRubin, Richard R.0 tDiabetes care.g2009 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1411-1417dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-22563Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02962naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002300178245013000201300001800331500002400349506007600373520108200449506003701531650002001568650001301588650001301601650001801614650001101632650001801643650001201661650001301673650001301686650001001699650001701709650004901726650004701775650003101822650001101853650002001864650002901884650001301913650005401926650004401980700002302024700002602047700001702073700001702090700002402107700002602131700002502157773010402182852000902286856007702295655001202372IND4423957920221207055806.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442395792DNAL7 a194359562pmid7 aPMC27136262pmcid7 a10.2337/dc09-02802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumaraguru, Janani10aTooth Discoloration in Patients With Neonatal Diabetes After Transfer Onto Glibenclamide: A previously unreported side effect  ap. 1428-1430.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To assess if tooth discoloration is a novel side effect of sulfonylurea therapy in patients with permanent neonatal diabetes due to mutations in KCNJ11. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 67 patients with a known KCNJ11 mutation who had been successfully transferred from insulin injections onto oral sulfonylureas were contacted and asked about the development of tooth discoloration after transfer. RESULTS: Altered tooth appearance was identified in 5 of the 67 patients. This was variable in severity, ranging from mild discoloration/staining (n = 4) to loss of enamel (n = 1) and was only seen in patients taking glibenclamide (glyburide). CONCLUSIONS: These previously unreported side effects may relate to the developing tooth and/or to the high local concentrations in the children who frequently chewed glibenclamide tablets or took it as a concentrated solution. Given the multiple benefits of sulfonylurea treatment for patients with activating KCNJ11 mutations, this association warrants further investigation but should not preclude such treatment.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3achildren 3adiabetes 3adiscoloration 3aenamel 3aglibenclamide 3ainsulin 3amutation 3apatients 3ateeth 3atherapeutics 2aDental Enamel Hypoplasiaxchemically induced 2aDiabetes Mellitusxdrug therapyxgenetics. 2aGlyburidexadverse effects 2aHumans 2aInfant, Newborn 2aInsulinxtherapeutic use 2aMutation 2aPotassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifyingxgenetics 2aTooth Discolorationxchemically induced1 aFlanagan, Sarah E.1 aGreeley, Siri Atma W.1 aNuboer, Roos1 aStøy, Julie1 aPhilipson, Louis H.1 aHattersley, Andrew T.1 aRubio-Cabezas, Oscar0 tDiabetes care.g2009 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1428-1430dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc09-02803Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04055naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002400178245009400202300001800296500002400314506007600338520191500414506003702329650002202366650001302388650001702401650001802418650001802436650001102454650001402465650001302479650000902492650002502501650001002526650000902536650004402545650005202589650001102641650001902652650003702671650001102708650004802719650008402767650000902851650007402860650001602934650003202950650001702982650008702999650001603086651001303102700002403115700002203139700003103161700002303192773010403215852000903319856007703328655001203405IND4423958420221207055731.0090731s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442395842DNAL7 a196385242pmid7 aPMC27136152pmcid7 a10.2337/dc08-20282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLafata, Jennifer E.10aSustained Hyperglycemia Among Patients With Diabetes: What matters when action is needed?  ap. 1447-1452.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To estimate prevalence of, and factors associated with, sustained periods of hyperglycemia among patients with diabetes and factors associated with receipt of appropriate care once A1C values are persistently elevated. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Among patients initiating oral monotherapy (n = 5,070), Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods were used to estimate time to, and factors associated with, sustained hyperglycemia (defined by two A1cs >8% and no recent medication intensification), and among those experiencing sustained hyperglycemia, time to, and factors associated with, appropriate receipt of care (i.e., medication intensification or achieving A1C [less-than or equal to]7%). RESULTS: Within 1 year, 8% experienced sustained hyperglycemia, with the proportion rising to 38% within 5 years. Patients using sulfonylurea had greater risk of hyperglycemia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.47 [95% CI 1.30-1.66]) compared with those initiating metformin. Risk increased with age (1.89 [1.27-2.83]), was greater for African Americans (1.19 [1.05-1.36]), and increased with A1C levels >7%. Among individuals with sustained hyperglycemia (n = 1,386), mean time to appropriate care was 9.7 months, with 25% not receiving appropriate care within 1 year. Shorter delays to appropriate care receipt were associated with increasing income (1.03 [1.00-1.07]), A1C >9% (1.38 [1.06-1.79]) and >11% (1.65 [1.25-2.18]), increasing medication adherence (1.03 [1.01-1.04]), and visits to primary care (4.22 [3.65-4.88]) or endocrinology (3.89 [2.26-6.70]). Longer delays were associated with increasing drug copayments (0.96 [0.93-0.98]). CONCLUSIONS: Patients incurring sustained hyperglycemia are at risk of further delays in appropriate management. Barriers to appropriate care include prescription drug copayments, few physician contacts, and other factors that are likely amenable to intervention.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfrican Americans 3adiabetes 3adrug therapy 3aendocrinology 3ahyperglycemia 3aincome 3ametformin 3apatients 3arisk 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAdult 2aAged 2aDiabetes Mellitusxbloodxdrug therapy. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxdrug therapy. 2aFemale 2aGroup Practice 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aHyperglycemiaxcomplicationsxepidemiology. 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aMale 2aMetforminxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aMiddle Aged 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aRisk Factors 2aSulfonylurea Compoundsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aYoung Adult 0aMichigan1 aDobie, Elizabeth A.1 aDivine, George W.1 aUlcickas Yood, Marianne E.1 aMcCarthy, Bruce D.0 tDiabetes care.g2009 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1447-1452dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-20283Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02425naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001700149245010800166300001600274500002400290520127900314650002001593650001801613650003101631650001001662650002001672650001401692650001101706650002101717650001601738650002101754700002001775700001601795700001501811700001701826773009801843852000901941856008901950655001202039IND4423583120221117053526.0090724s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442358312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2009.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, Yanqin10aEnhanced circulation half-life of site-specific PEGylated rhG-CSF: Optimization of PEG molecular weight  ap. 259-266.  aIncludes references  aRecombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) and its PEGylated product “mono-PEG20-GCSF” have already been widely used for treatment of all kinds of neutropenia. However, the high required dosage of mono-PEG20-GCSF made it relatively expensive in clinical use. We postulated that an N-terminal site-specific PEGylated rhG-CSF with higher PEG Mw (PEG30kDa) might be able to achieve longer circulation half-life while retaining its bioactivity, allowing the reduction of dosage for clinical use. rhG-CSF was PEGylated at the N-terminus by 5kDa, 10kDa, 20kDa and 30kDa methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-propionaldehyde (mPEG-ALD), and the four PEGylates were compared with respect to reaction, separation, characterization and also in vivo/in vitro activity, results showed that the mPEG-ALD of higher Mw demonstrated better N-terminal site-specific selectivity, separation purity and yield. The production cost and in vitro activity of mono-PEG30-GCSF and mono-PEG20-GCSF were almost the same, while mono-PEG30-GCSF showed longer in vivo circulation half-life and 60% higher drug bioavailability than mono-PEG20-GCSF. Consequently, mono-PEG30-GCSF shall be administered at a lower dosage than mono-PEG20-GCSF while retaining the same therapeutic efficacy. 3abioavailability 3abiotechnology 3acolony-stimulating factors 3adrugs 3aethylene glycol 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3amolecular weight 3aneutropenia 3aproduction costs1 aZhao, Yongjiang1 aLei, Jiandu1 aSu, Zhiguo1 aMa, Guanghui0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2009 July 15, v. 142, no. 3-4 p.259-266dElsevierx0168-16567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2009.05.0123Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02922naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245008200167300001400249520172100263650002001984650001102004650000902015650002802024650001702052650002502069650001602094650001402110650001602124650001502140650001002155700001802165700001902183700002502202700002202227700002102249700002002270773016802290856004502458852000902503655001202512IND60606036320221117052847.0180724e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060603632DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.253.1.662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMestrinho, Lisa A.10aOral and dental anomalies in purebred, brachycephalic Persian and Exotic cats  ap. 66-72.  aOBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of dental anomalies in brachycephalic cats from various geographic regions and analyze potential relationships with oral disease. DESIGN Prospective multicenter cross-sectional study. ANIMALS 50 purebred Persian (n = 42) and Exotic (8) cats. PROCEDURES Cats were anesthetized, and a complete dental examination, dental charting, 3-view oral photography, and full-mouth dental radiography were performed. RESULTS Malocclusions were observed in 36 (72%) cats. Crowding of the teeth was evident in 28 (56%) cats, with the incisors being most commonly affected. Malpositioned teeth were noted in 32 (64%) cats, with abnormal orientation being the most common anomaly followed by rotation and impaction. Numerical abnormalities were present in 38 (76%) cats, including 6 (12%) with hyperdontia and 32 (64%) with hypodontia. Periodontal disease was reported in 44 (88%) cats, and cats with periodontal disease were older than cats without. Tooth resorption was evident in 35 (70%) cats. Overall, 123 of 1,349 (8.7%) teeth had external inflammatory resorption and 82 (6.1%) had external replacement resorption. The premolar teeth were the teeth most commonly affected with inflammatory resorption, whereas the canine teeth were the teeth most commonly affected with replacement resorption. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that because of their brachycephaly, Persian and Exotic cats have unique oral and dental features that may predispose them to dental disease (eg, tooth resorption and periodontal disease).

Control procedures and formula were utilized with water absorption varied to obtain machineable doughs. Amylose content was lower in most partial waxy compared with normal wheats. The type of wheat starch did not affect most dough properties or tortilla diameter. Tortilla height and opacity were adversely affected by the decreased amount of amylose in partial waxy wheats. Sufficient leavening reactions occurred early in baking (after 10 sec) to yield an opaque disk, but some baked tortillas lost opacity and become partially transparent after baking. Starch gelatinizes, disperses, and retrogrades concurrently with the leavening reaction during the short (<30 sec) baking time. Amylose functionality during baking and cooling appears to be involved in the retention of air bubbles in tortillas. 3awheat 3awheat flour 3atortillas 3afood processing 3acooking quality 3amilling quality 3aamylose 3afood composition 3astorage quality 3afood storage 3arheological properties 0awaxy varieties1 aGraybosch, R.A.1 aAdams, J.L.0 tCereal chemistry.g2002 , v. 79, no. 2 p.210-214x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM.2002.79.2.2103Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02460naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001800147245009100165300001600256500001500272520139900287650002001686650002001706650002301726650001001749650001001759650001601769650001901785650001301804653002701817700001701844773007001861852000901931856008701940930003302027945001302060946001302073655001202086IND2333033320221117043828.0030612e200203  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233303332DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM.2002.79.2.2862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiotelli, E.10aEffect of small and large wheat starch granules on thermomechanical behavior of starch  ap. 286-293.  a2019-12-04  aThe physicochemical properties of small- and large-granule wheat starches were investigated to reveal whether gelatinization properties and rheological behavior differ between size classes of wheat starch. All samples contained 60% water (w/w, wb). The starch granule size and shape were examined by scanning electron microscopy in the separated A- and B-type granule populations and in the whole wheat starch granule population. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and electron spin resonance (ESR) analyses were performed in parallel with rheological measurements using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) to relate the viscoelastic changes to modifications in dynamic properties of aqueous solutions and structural disorganization of starch. The small (B-type) granules had slightly higher gelatinization temperature and lower gelatinization enthalpy than did the large (A-type) granules. Also, B-type granules had higher enthalpy for the amylose-lipid complex transition. Moreover, our results suggested that small granules have higher affinity for water at room temperature. It seems that there is a less ordered arrangement of the polysaccharide chains in the smaller granules when compared with the larger ones. These differences in functional properties of small and large granules suggested that the granule size distribution is an important parameter in the baking process. 3aviscoelasticity 3astarch granules 3athermal properties 3awheat 3awater 3atemperature 3agelatinization 3agelation 0arheological properties1 aLe Meste, M.0 tCereal chemistry.g2002 , v. 79, no. 2 p.286-293x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM.2002.79.2.2863Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02028naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072001700147072001700164100001200181245009800193300001600291500010000307520076000407650001701167650001001184650001701194650001901211650002101230650002001251650002401271650001001295650002501305650001801330650000801348650001301356773007001369852000901439856008701448930003301535945002501568946001301593655001201606IND4363267220221117043807.0040708e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436326722DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM.2003.80.4.3662doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The results indicate that in gluten stored at -15 degrees C, the water content in the gluten phase decreased by approximately equal to 1% over the first three weeks. An apparent steady state was attained over this period and the amount of ice did not increase further. Such changes were not observed for samples stored at -25 degrees C. Qualitatively similar observations were made for dough stored at either -15 or -25 degrees C. The greater sensitivity of dough to frozen storage is tentatively attributed to a slightly lower glass transition temperature in dough. 3awheat gluten 3adough 3awheat starch 3afrozen storage 3afreezing quality 3astorage quality 3astorage temperature 3awater 3aspatial distribution 3awater content 3aice 3aduration0 tCereal chemistry.g2003 , v. 80, no. 4 p.366-370x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM.2003.80.4.3663Available from publisher's Web site  a20050505b20050604c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/05/05  aOther US 7aarticle02865naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072001700147072001700164100001600181245009900197300001600296500010000312500001500412520132700427650001901754650001601773650001901789650002401808650002001832650002701852650001001879650002001889650001301909650001701922650002201939650002101961650001201982653002401994700001702018700001802035700001902053700001802072700002002090773007002110852000902180856008702189930003302276945002502309946001302334655001202347IND4363267320221117043756.0040708e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436326732DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM.2003.80.4.3712doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The storage time was varied from 1 to 16 weeks and the storage temperature was varied from -5 to -30 degrees C. After thawing, uniaxial and biaxial deformations, and stress relaxation measurements were performed on gluten. In System A, the major effects were noticed when the gluten was stored at -5 degrees C. Frozen storage induced a decrease in stress and in strain at breaking, but an increase in modulus (stress/strain) under uniaxial deformation. In System B, only stress relaxation measurements showed differences between the fresh gluten and the gluten stored at -18 degrees C. These results suggest that at -5 degrees C, gluten strands form more entanglements. Microscopic analyses of frozen gluten showed that, during the freezing step, ice crystals compressed the gluten. A significant phase separation was observed between gluten and ice but no difference was observed between the storage time and storage temperature. However, after thawing, gluten microstructure exhibited a structure similar to the fresh gluten, and the structure looks like a sponge (a fine gluten structure with tiny water pockets). 3amicrostructure 3adeformation 3afrozen storage 3astorage temperature 3astorage quality 3arheological properties 3awater 3asodium chloride 3aduration 3awheat gluten 3astress relaxation 3afreezing quality 3athawing 0aphysical properties1 aSmit, R.J.M.1 aAalst, H. van1 aEsselink, F.J.1 aWeegels, P.L.1 aAgterof, W.G.M.0 tCereal chemistry.g2003 , v. 80, no. 4 p.371-377x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM.2003.80.4.3713Available from publisher's Web site  a20050803b00000000c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/05/05  aOther US 7aarticle02967naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072001700147072001700164100002100181245007600202300001600278500011700294520130200411650001801713650001701731650002001748650001901768650002101787650001701808650001301825650002401838650001701862650002301879650001901902650000801921650002001929650001801949650004401967650003102011650002302042650001002065650002502075650001702100700001802117700001902135700002202154773007002176852000902246856008702255930003302342945002502375946001302400655001202413IND4363267720221117044929.0040708e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436326772DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM.2003.80.4.3962doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Developmentwnt.,  aStorage of dough at low temperatures (-20 degrees C) has a considerable effect on the final quality of baked bread; this is most obviously reflected in lowered specific volumes. In this study, a suite of structural characterization techniques is applied to examine the underlying mechanism of storage damage at the molecular, microstructural, and macroscopic level. By using infrared spectroscopy, the dehydration of the gluten component could be established at the molecular level, and its kinetics could be monitored in time. Time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) showed increased water mobility, which could be attributed to a release of water from the gluten matrix. At the microstructural level, the growth of ice crystals could be monitored by means of cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM). These ice crystals are preferably formed in gas cells with kinetics that are slower than those during infrared spectroscopy but similar to those in time-domain NMR. At the macroscopic level, ice crystals are not evenly distributed over the molded dough, nor are the gas cells homogeneously distributed over the dough. This has implications for the macroscopic water distribution during frozen storage, which could be substantiated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements. 3awater content 3afrozen dough 3astorage quality 3afrozen storage 3afreezing quality 3afood storage 3aduration 3abreadmaking quality 3awheat gluten 3achemical structure 3amicrostructure 3aice 3acrystallization 3afood analysis 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3awater 3aspatial distribution 3abakers yeast1 aAalst, H. van1 aMaliepaard, M.1 aDuynhoven, J.P.M.0 tCereal chemistry.g2003 , v. 80, no. 4 p.396-403x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM.2003.80.4.3963Available from publisher's Web site  a20050803b00000000c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/05/05  aOther US 7aarticle02441naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007800126300001600204520150400220650002501724650002301749650002101772650001901793650001601812650001401828650002301842651000901865653002001874653002601894700001801920773008501938852000902023930003302032945001302065946001302078655001202091IND2040600320221117043811.0940629e199403  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204060032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, S.G.10aOptimization of range improvements on sage-brush and pinyon-juniper sites  ap. 159-164.  aThe optimum combination of 3 range improvements was determined for private lands on Utah ranches. While many promising range improvements are available, determination of which alternatives to implement must consider the total ranch operation. Linear programming (LP) makes it possible to simultaneously determine the profit maximizing combinations of range improvements and how these improvements will affect the total ranch operation. The study examined 3 range improvements (revegetation, burning, and chemical brush control) for big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) and pinyon-juniper (Pinus spp.-juniperus spp.) on upland loam and upland shallow loam range sites. Net present value analysis and an LP model were used to identify the most efficient alternative, the limiting constraints, and the optimum levels and combinations of alternatives. The optimal solution ran 238 brood cows compared to 196 for the typical Utah ranch. Burning big sagebrush or pinyon-juniper infestations on crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum Fisch. ex Link) foothill ranges was the most profitable range improvement. Annual net cash incomes after burning sagebrush or pinyon-juniper on the upland loam site were $37,873 and $37,770, respectively, compared to $31,278 on the typical Utah cow-calf operation. The optimal solution will change as input and product prices change. The model was designed for application to specific ranches rather than to make general recommendations for the typical Utah ranch. 3aArtemisia tridentata 3aprescribed burning 3achemical control 3apinyon-juniper 3atebuthiuron 3abeef cows 3alinear programming 3aUtah 0asown grasslands 0agrassland improvement1 aWorkman, J.P.0 tJournal of range management.g1994 Mar., v. 47, no. 2 p.159-164x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01915naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154242010300172245010500275300001600380500002400396520086500420650002701285650001601312650001301328650001201341650001201353650001401365700001501379773014101394852000901535856005701544655001201601IND4456043020221117044017.0110408e196706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445604302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1967.tb00060.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurgerjon, A.10aContribution a l‘étude du spectre d'activité de différentes souches de bacillus thuringiensis10aContribution to the study of the spectrum of activity of different strains of bacillus thuringiensis  ap. 211-230.  aIncludes references  aSeven strains of B. thuringiensis , included in the first serotype list described by D e B arjac and B onnefoi , were compared for their activity of the "crystal-spore" complex against 24 species of Lepidoptera.

In contrast to the comparative qualitative activity of each strains for a given insect species, the "crossed" activity has a more objective significance, since it is more independent of the preparations used and the comparison criteria used. Strains belonging to the same serotype (biotypes) have a specific activity in the same way as those belonging to different serotypes. The strains tested did not reveal identical activity spectra with regard to insects with close systematic kinship. 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aLepidoptera 3abiotypes 3ainsects 3akinship 3aserotypes1 aBiache, G.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1967 June, v. 10, no. 2 p.211-230dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1967.tb00060.x 7aarticle03481naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245011700165300001600282520232700298650002302625650002402648650001202672650002602684650001502710650002102725650001402746650001302760651001102773700002302784700001602807700001902823700001702842700001702859700001702876773014902893856004403042852000903086655001203095IND60532001620221117044125.0160726e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053200162DNAL7 a10.13031/aea.32.113762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVisacki, Vladimir10aEffects of Sprayer Boom Height and Operating Pressure on the Spray Uniformity and Distribution Model Development  ap. 341-346.  aOne of the most important factors easily overlooked yet seriously influencing the efficiency of chemical crop protection is the uniformity of liquid distribution on the entire sprayer boom. The uniform distribution of crop protection chemicals is an important element for achieving the maximum efficiency of chemical treatments with minimum costs and minimum environmental contamination. It is expressed in percentages by the coefficient of variation. Three types of nozzles (ST 120-04, IDK 120-04, and IDKT 120-04) were used for testing the uniformity of liquid distribution in laboratory conditions at three different operating heights, which are commonly adopted for pesticide treatments in Serbia (0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 m), and six different pressures within the range recommended by the manufacturer (200, 250, 300, 350, 400, and 450 kPa). All three types of nozzles had flat jets but IDK and IDKT nozzles were air-injector nozzles. The IDKT nozzles had twin jets with an angle of 60 degrees between the two jets. An electronic spray scanner recorded the flow in the nozzles and the variation coefficient. The results of performed tests show significant differences between the set conditions. However, all nozzles had different coefficients of variation. The lowest coefficient was recorded with the air-injector nozzle, IDK 120-04. The flat spray nozzle ST 120-04 had the highest coefficient (from 8.545% to 7.226%) and all the others were within the acceptable 10% limits for the distribution uniformity. In general, a uniform distribution is enhanced with applications at greater heights and increased pressure does not ensure the constant distribution uniformity of injector nozzles in comparison with flat jet nozzles (in field conditions it is also necessary to take drift into account). At higher pressures, the distribution uniformity of air-injector nozzles is of poor quality due to greater liquid disintegration. The best possible application with this type of nozzle can be achieved at greater heights and medium application pressures. The results obtained in this research were used for the development of a mathematical model of CV changes in transversal distribution performed by the tested nozzles with respect to the pressure and sprayer boom height. The model can lead to better pesticide applications. 3achemical treatment 3amathematical models 3anozzles 3apesticide application 3apesticides 3aplant protection 3apollution 3asprayers 3aSerbia1 aSedlar, Aleksandar1 aGil, Emilio1 aBugarin, Rajko1 aTuran, Ján,1 aJanic, Todor1 aBurg, Patrik0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2016 May, v. 32, no. 3 p.341-346dAmerican Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.32.11376  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245006800135300001600203500002400219520199000243650001002233650001202243650002702255650000902282650001102291650002902302650002302331650002702354650001202381650002702393650001202420651000902432653002502441700001702466700001802483773008502501852000902586930003302595945001302628946001302641655001202654IND2180745920221117043801.0981030e199803  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218074592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlzerreca-Angelo, H.10aSheep grazing and plant cover dynamics of a shadscale community  ap. 214-222.  aSummary in Spanish.  aDespite extensive coverage and long-term use, the extent to which shadscale [Atriplex confertifolia (Torr. & Frem.) Wats.] community dynamics are driven by grazing rather than by climate and inherent plant characteristics is unresolved. We analyze a 59-year data set from the Desert Experimental Range, southwestern Utah, with the objective of discriminating between grazing and non-grazing effects on cover dynamics. Canopy cover of (5 x 20 ft) 9.3 m2 plots were estimated in 1935, 1958, 1969, 1975, and 1994. Treatments were time (5 dates), grazing (ungrazed versus grazed), and season (spring versus winter). Time was significant; total cover initially increased following release from uncontrolled grazing and improvement of climate (1935-58, P < 0.001), remained unchanged over the following dry interval (1958-69, P = 1.000), increased over a drier interval (1969-75, P < 0.001), and then decreased dramatically over the final wet period (1975-94, P < 0.001). Grazing was also significant (P < 0.001), but cover of ungrazed plots exceeded that of grazed plots only in 1975 and 1994 (P less than or equal to 0.033). The 6 dominant species showed varying responses to grazing and time, with some responding primarily to grazing (e.g., budsage, Artemisia spinescens D.C. Eaton in Wats.) and others responding primarily to time (climate, longevity, etc., e.g., Indian ricegrass, Oryzopsis hymenoides R. & S.). Similarly, seasonal effects were not universal. Shrub cover initially increased and then declined dramatically while grass cover monotonically increased. Results suggest that release from uncontrolled grazing coupled with improving climatic conditions were responsible for initial recovery of the community, but that over time, climate and inherent plant traits (e.g., longevity, establishment ecology, etc.) became relatively more important. For total cover and for many individual species, continued grazing affected the rate more than the direction of vegetation change. 3asheep 3agrazing 3aAtriplex confertifolia 3arain 3acanopy 3aKrascheninnikovia lanata 3aseasonal variation 3aAchnatherum hymenoides 3aHilaria 3aSporobolus cryptandrus 3abiomass 3aUtah 0aartemisia spinescens1 aSchupp, E.W.1 aKitchen, S.G.0 tJournal of range management.g1998 Mar., v. 51, no. 2 p.214-222x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03605naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002100183245015800204300001800362500002400380506007600404520108400480506003701564650002901601650001901630650001801649650001301667650001301680650002001693650001901713650001301732650001201745650001301757650001401770650002601784650001401810650001601824650001001840650001301850650001301863650002501876650004301901650002101944650003101965650005201996650003302048650004802081650004202129650002802171650002302199650002702222650001402249650004202263650005302305650003802358650004902396650004102445650003102486700002302517700001902540700002002559700001802579700002202597773010702619852000902726856008202735856003002817655001202847IND4392809120221207084003.0070701e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439280912DNAL7 a175135022pmid7 aPMC19137322pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.106.0477952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolton, Nicholas10aTomato BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 Is Required for Systemin-Induced Root Elongation in Solanum pimpinellifolium but Is Not Essential for Wound Signaling  ap. 1709-1717.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe tomato Leu-rich repeat receptor kinase BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) has been implicated in both peptide (systemin) and steroid (brassinosteroid [BR]) hormone perception. In an attempt to dissect these signaling pathways, we show that transgenic expression of BRI1 can restore the dwarf phenotype of the tomato curl3 (cu3) mutation. Confirmation that BRI1 is involved in BR signaling is highlighted by the lack of BR binding to microsomal fractions made from cu3 mutants and the restoration of BR responsiveness following transformation with BRI1. In addition, wound and systemin responses in the cu3 mutants are functional, as assayed by proteinase inhibitor gene induction and rapid alkalinization of culture medium. However, we observed BRI1-dependent root elongation in response to systemin in Solanum pimpinellifolium. In addition, ethylene perception is required for normal systemin responses in roots. These data taken together suggest that cu3 is not defective in systemin-induced wound signaling and that systemin perception can occur via a non-BRI1 mechanism.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSolanum pimpinellifolium 3aalkalinization 3aculture media 3adwarfing 3aethylene 3agene expression 3agene induction 3ahormones 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aproteinase inhibitors 3areceptors 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asteroids 3atomatoes 2aAlkaliesxmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aBrassinosteroids 2aCholestanolsxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicrosomesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPeptidesxpharmacology 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 2aSolanumxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSteroids, Heterocyclicxpharmacology 2aTranscriptional Activation1 aCaño-Delgado, Ana1 aHarrison, Kate1 aMontoya, Teresa1 aChory, Joanne1 aBishop, Gerard J.0 tplant cell.g2007 May, v. 19, no. 5 p.1709-1717dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.106.0477953Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/ 7aarticle02280naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007100128300001600199520157100215650001101786650002101797650002201818650002001840773008601860852000901946930003301955945001301988946001302001655001202014IND2036578520221117044122.0940106e198909  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203657852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBransby, D.I.10aJustification for grazing intensity experiments: economic analysis  ap. 425-430.  aEconomic arguments in favor of grazing intensity trials are provided by economic analysis of grazing intensity results from Coastal, Callie and experimental hybrid S-16 bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L. Pers), and by emphasizing the biological and economic differences among cultivars. Cattle buying prices of $1.20, $1.30, and $1.40/kg and price margins (selling price minus buying price) from -$O.20 to $0.20 were considered on a return/ha and /animal basis, assuming land or capital to buy animals to be limiting, respectively. When price margin was -$O.20, the stocking rate at which profit/ha was maximized ranged from 4.19 to 5.85 animals/ha, while profit/animal was maximized between 4.77 and 6.89 animals/ha. Corresponding ranges in average weight of herbage present/ha which maximized profit/ha and /animal were 2.83 to 3.60 Mg and 2.34 to 3.72 Mg. For a price margin of $O.20, profit/ha and /animal were maximized at stocking rates of 7.36 to 9.86 and 4.14 to 5.93 animals/ha respectively, with corresponding levels of herbage present/ha in the ranges 0.33 to 1.79 Mg and 2.73 to 4.06 Mg. Relative differences in profit/ha and /animal among cultivars did not correspond to differences in gain/ha and /animal. Economic comparison of the cultivars considered in this study would have had little relevance if only one grazing intensity had been used in the field trial. Only grazing trials with several grazing intensities per treatment can allow for the determination of economic optimum grazing intensities in respect of a wide range in economic conditions. 3asteers 3aCynodon dactylon 3agrazing intensity 3aeconomic impact0 tJournal of range management.g1989 Sept., v. 42, no. 5 p.425-430x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02400naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006800127300001600195520167300211650002701884650000901911651001401920700001801934700001701952773008501969852000902054930003302063945001302096946001302109655001202122IND2036591020221117043014.0940106e198903  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203659102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeegan, T.W.10aAmerican jointvetch improves summer range for white-tailed deer  ap. 128-134.  aLivestock production is limited on upland forested sites in the Southeast by the low quality of native range. Supplemental feeding in the form of improved pastures has dramatic effects on herd production and individual animal performance. Similar relationships probably exist for wild herbivores; and food plots with highly palatable, high quality forages might improve animal performance for wild as well as domestic herbivores. Sixteen American jointvetch (Aeschynomene americana) plots (mean +/- SE = 0.21 +/- 0.02 ha) were established in pastures adjacent to mixed pine (Pinus spp.)-hardwood habitat on a 980-ha tract in southeast Louisiana to estimate the influence of summer-fall food plots on diets of free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). American jointvetch accounted for 32.4% of the dry matter in deer diets and occurred in 90.7% of fecal pellet groups. Individual deer consumed about 0.45 kg (ovendry weight) of American jointvetch per day over 2 growing seasons. For all sampling periods, crude protein, phosphorus, in vitro digestible dry matter, and calcium levels were higher (P less than or equal to 0.006) in supplemented diets compared to native diets. Calcium:phosphorus ratios in supplemented diets were lower (P less than or equal to 0.0001) (improved) compared to ratios in native diets. Dietary crude protein, phosphorus, in vitro digestible dry matter, and calcium were positively associated (P less than or equal to 0.0001) with proportions of American jointvetch in deer diets. Warm-season food plots should be considered as viable options for intensive deer management programs in parts of the southeastern United States. 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3adiet 3aLouisiana1 aJohnson, M.K.1 aNelson, B.D.0 tJournal of range management.g1989 Mar., v. 42, no. 2 p.128-134x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01810naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245012300171300001600294500002400310520080400334650001601138650001001154650001501164650001001179650002101189650002801210650001101238650001401249650001101263773014401274852000901418856005701427655001201484IND4456045820221117044313.0110408e196709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445604582DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1967.tb02454.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLOWE, H.J.B.10aInterspecific differences in the biology of aphids (homoptera: aphididae) on leaves of vicia faba i. feeding behaviour  ap. 347-357.  aIncludes references  aAphids of six species settled on the undersurface of bean leaves in characteristic patterns.

Many probes of Myzus passed into spongy mesophyll alone. This apparently offered an alternative food source to them. The interspecific differences, which were matched by differences between age groups within species, are explained in terms of the differing proportions of the aphid populations exploiting the alternative food sources and of preferences for veins of a particular size. 3aAphis fabae 3aMyzus 3aVicia faba 3abeans 3afeeding behavior 3ainterspecific variation 3aleaves 3amesophyll 3aphloem0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1967 Sept., v. 10, no. 3-4 p.347-357dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1967.tb02454.x 7aarticle03987naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245014900171300001600320500002400336520232900360650002102689650002702710650002802737650001402765650001602779650002802795650001402823650003102837650001502868650001702883650002102900650002102921650001702942650002102959650001002980650000902990650002002999650001703019650001003036650001903046651001103065700002003076700001603096700002103112700002803133700002203161700002403183700002603207700002203233773010903255852000903364856004803373655001203421IND4426309320221117043652.0090918e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442630932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-009-0032-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta-Silva, João H.10aChronic undernutrition alters renal active Na⁺ transport in young rats: potential hidden basis for pathophysiological alterations in adulthood  ap. 437-445.  aIncludes references  aBackground Epidemiological studies in the northeastern region of Brazil show an association between hypertension and malnutrition, especially in areas where protein-deficient diets are combined with high salt intake.

Glomerular filtration rate, proximal Na⁺ reabsorption, distal Na⁺ delivery, urinary excretion of Na⁺ and water, and urine concentration capacity were evaluated from serum and urine concentrations of creatinine, Na⁺ and Li⁺, and by measurement of urinary volume and density. The (Na⁺ + K⁺)ATPase and the ouabain-insensitive Na⁺-ATPase were studied in vitro by measuring ATP hydrolysis. Expression of (Na⁺ + K⁺)ATPase was evaluated by immunodetection with the use of a specific antibody anti α1-catalytic subunit isoform. Results Undernourished rats reached early adulthood (14 weeks) with body and renal masses that were 2.3 times lower than controls. These rats became hypertensive (mean arterial pressure 18.7 ± 0.6 kPa vs 15.5 ± 0.9 kPa in control group) and showed augmented fractional proximal Na⁺ reabsorption (61.0 ± 0.3% vs 81.8 ± 2.2%) with a concomitant decrease in distal Na⁺ delivery (9.5 ± 0.5 μmol/min vs 14.0 ± 0.2 μmol/min per 100 g body weight). Urinary Na⁺ excretion was higher in BRD rats, (juvenile and adult) being however twice the increase in Na⁺ intake. The ATP-dependent Na⁺ transporters were affected in opposite ways. The (Na⁺ + K⁺)ATPase activity from undernourished rats fell by 30%, in parallel with a 20% decrease in its immunodetection, whereas the ouabain-insensitive Na⁺-ATPase, which is responsible for the fine-tune control of Na⁺ reabsorption, increased threefold. Conclusions We conclude that early alterations in proximal tubule Na⁺ pumps, together with an abnormally augmented urinary Na⁺ excretion, might be the link between undernutrition and late renal dysfunction. 3aactive transport 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aadulthood 3abody weight 3aepidemiological studies 3aexcretion 3aglomerular filtration rate 3ahydrolysis 3ahypertension 3ain vitro studies 3alow protein diet 3amalnutrition 3aproximal tubules 3apumps 3arats 3asodium chloride 3atransporters 3aurine 3awater activity 3aBrazil1 aSilva, Paulo A.1 aPedi, Nadir1 aLuzardo, Ricardo1 aEinicker-Lamas, Marcelo1 aLara, Lucienne S.1 aBezerra, Amélia M.1 aCastro-Chaves, Carmen1 aVieyra, Adalberto0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2009 Oct., v. 48, no. 7 p.437-445dD.

In recent years, considerable numbers of infertile men have sought ‘herbal remedies' as an effective treatment. Among ‘herbal remedies', saffron is recommended for male infertility in our community. The effect of saffron was evaluated compared with placebo for the treatment of idiopathic male factor infertility. The study included 260 infertile men with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) who were randomized to saffron 60 mg/day (130, group 1) or a similar regimen of placebo (130, group 2) for 26 weeks. The two groups were compared for changes in semen parameters and total seminal plasma antioxidant capacity. Saffron administration did not result in beneficial effects. At the end of the study no statistically significant improvements were observed in either group in any of the studied semen parameters (sperm density, morphology and motility) (all p = 0.1). At the end of the trial, patients in group 1 had a mean motility of 25.7 ± 2.4%, which was not statistically different from the mean of 24.9 ± 2.8% in the placebo group (p = 0.1). Normal sperm morphology was 18.7 ± 4.7% and 18.4 ± 4.3%, in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.1). Patients treated with saffron and placebo had a mean sperm density of 20.5 ± 4.6% and 21.4 ± 4.6% per mL, respectively (p = 0.1). Saffron administration did not improve total seminal plasma antioxidant capacity, compared with baseline (p = 0.1) and placebo subjects (p = 0.1). Based on Pearson correlations, each semen parameter did not correlate significantly with treatment duration, including sperm density (r = 0.146, p = 0.13), percent of motile sperm (r = 0.145, p = 0.15) and percent of sperm with normal morphology (r = 0.125, p = 0.30). Saffron does not statistically significantly improve semen parameters in infertile men with idiopathic OAT. If medical professionals want to prescribe herbal remedies for male infertility, previous rigorous scientific investigations, documenting their safety and efficacy are required. 3aCrocus sativus 3aantioxidant activity 3amen 3apatients 3aplacebos 3aprofessionals 3asaffron 3aseminal plasma 3aspermatozoa 2aAdult 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aCrocus 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aHumans 2aInfertility, Malexdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aKaryotyping 2aMale 2aPlacebos 2aProspective Studies 2aSemenxmetabolism1 aShafiei, Nayyer1 aSafarinejad, Shiva0 tPhytotherapy research.g2011 Apr., v. 25, no. 4 p.508-516dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.3294 7aarticle03643naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245010500185300001600290500002400306520128500330650001701615650001901632650002801651650001001679650001801689650001101707650001801718650000901736650002201745650002701767650002501794650000901819650001401828650002301842650002201865650002401887650001201911650003501923650002201958650001401980650003701994650002102031650001502052650001502067650001802082650004002100650001102140650001902151650003002170650001102200650006802211650000902279650002402288650002302312650003602335650003102371650003302402650002002435650003802455650003702493700001702530700001202547700002102559700002102580700001802601700001702619700002002636700001902656773010502675852000902780856004802789655001202837IND4411334620221117043514.0081010e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441133462DNAL7 a186708902pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-008-9379-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Shin-Young10aTumor targeting of humanized fragment antibody secreted from transgenic rice cell suspension culture  ap. 413-422.  aIncludes references  aThe tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 (TAG 72) has been shown to be expressed in the majority of human adenocarcinomas. In an effort to develop a technique for the safe and inexpensive production of large quantities of anti-TAG 72 humanized antibody fragments (hzAb) as a future source of clinical-grade proteins, we developed a transgenic rice cell suspension culture system. The in vivo assembly and secretion of hzAb were achieved in a transgenic rice cell culture under the control of the rice alpha amylase 3D (RAmy 3D) expression system, and the biological activities of plant-derived hzAb were determined to be quite similar to those of animal-derived antibody. Purified hzAb was shown to bind to the recombinant antigen, TAG 72, and to bind specifically to human LS 174T colon adenocarcinoma cells expressing the TAG 72 antigen, and this binding occurred to the same extent as was seen with animal-derived antibody. Plant-derived hzAb proved as effective as animal-derived antibody in targeting tumors of xenotransplanted LS 174T cells in nude mice. The results of this study indicate that the hzAb derived from plant cell suspension cultures may have great potential for pharmaceutical applications in the development of future cancer therapeutic and diagnostic protocols. 3aOryza sativa 3aadenocarcinoma 3acell suspension culture 3acolon 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3aimmunotherapy 3amice 3aneoplasm antigens 3arecombinant antibodies 3arecombinant antigens 3arice 3asecretion 3asuspension systems 3atransgenic plants 3axenotransplantation 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Neoplasmximmunology 2aBlotting, Western 2aCHO Cells 2aCell Culture Techniquesxmethods 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCricetinae 2aCricetulus 2aCulture Media 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFemale 2aFlow Cytometry 2aGlycoproteinsximmunology 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Fragmentsximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMucinsxmetabolism 2aNeoplasmsximmunologyxtherapy. 2aOryzaxcytologyxgenetics. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aProtein Binding 2aSubcellular Fractionsxmetabolism 2aXenograft Model Antitumor Assays1 aLee, Tae-Sup1 aKim, Ju1 aChŏng, Chae-ho.1 aChoi, Chang-Woon1 aKim, Tae-Geum1 aKwon, Tae-Ho1 aJang, Yong Suk.1 aYang, Moon-Sik0 tPlant molecular biology.g2008 Nov., v. 68, no. 4-5 p.413-422dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-008-9379-4 7aarticle03604naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245007800189300001600267500002400283500001500307520155700322650002101879650001901900650002101919650001301940650002201953650001201975650001201987650001401999650002802013650004802041650004402089650004002133650003502173650002502208650002502233650002902258650002802287650002102315650001902336650005602355650004702411653003002458653001302488653001302501653002402514653002002538653002902558653001902587700002102606700002002627700002102647700002402668700001702692700002002709700002302729700001702752773009702769852000902866856005502875655001202930IND4431120120221117044048.0100111e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443112012DNAL7 a197963702pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04034.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiemes, Silke10aRetromer recycles vacuolar sorting receptors from the trans-Golgi network  ap. 107-121.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aReceptor-mediated sorting processes in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells rely on mechanisms to recycle the receptors after completion of transport. Based on this principle, plant vacuolar sorting receptors (VSRs) are thought to recycle after dissociating of receptor-ligand complexes in a pre-vacuolar compartment. This recycling is mediated by retromer, a cytosolic coat complex that comprises sorting nexins and a large heterotrimeric subunit. To analyse retromer-mediated VSR recycling, we have used a combination of immunoelectron and fluorescence microscopy to localize the retromer components sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) and sorting nexin 2a (SNX2a) and the vacuolar sorting protein VPS29p. All retromer components localize to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), which is considered to represent the early endosome of plants. In addition, we show that inhibition of retromer function in vivo by expression of SNX1 or SNX2a mutants as well as transient RNAi knockdown of all sorting nexins led to accumulation of the VSR BP80 at the TGN. Quantitative protein transport studies and live-cell imaging using fluorescent vacuolar cargo molecules revealed that arrival of these VSR ligands at the vacuole is not affected under these conditions. Based on these findings, we propose that the TGN is the location of retromer-mediated recycling of VSRs, and that transport towards the lytic vacuole downstream of the TGN is receptor-independent and occurs via maturation, similar to transition of the early endosome into the late endosome in mammalian cells. 3aRNA interference 3aimage analysis 3aeukaryotic cells 3avacuoles 3aprotein transport 3amutants 3asorting 3areceptors 3afluorescence microscopy 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aProtoplastsxmetabolism 2aRNA Interference 2aSorting Nexins 2aVesicular Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2atrans-Golgi Networkxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0avacuolar sorting receptor 0aproteins 0aretromer 0atrans-Golgi network 0aearly endosomes 0apre-vacuolar compartment 0asorting nexins1 aLanghans, Markus1 aViotti, Corrado1 aScheuring, David1 aSan Wan Yan, Melody1 aJiang, Liwen1 aHillmer, Stefan1 aRobinson, David G.1 aPimpl, Peter0 tplant journal.g2010 Jan., v. 61, no. 1 p.107-121dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04034.x 7aarticle02245naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245008100131300001600212520138800228650001601616650002601632650001101658650001001669650000901679650002401688651001101712653001801723700002501741773008501766852000901851930003301860945001301893946001301906655001201919IND2038142420221117043656.0940323e199307  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203814242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacCracken, J.G.10aMass-diameter regressions for moose browse on the Copper River Delta, Alaska  ap. 302-308.  aRegression equations were developed to predict 3 mass components of 7 browse species important to moose (Alces gigas) on the Copper River Delta in southcentral Alaska. The accuracy of model predictions was the criterion for model selection. Model accuracy was evaluated using data splitting or jackknife procedures. Annual production of twigs and leaves and available twig mass on a stem were most accurately predicted from stem basal diameter with zero intercept models, zero intercept log-linear models, or log-log models. Twig mass eaten by moose was most accurately predicted from the diameter at the point of browsing of a twig with zero intercept or full linear models. Heteroskedasticity was significant (P < 0.05) in most of the data sets and could not be significantly reduced with log transformations or use of weighted least squares models. Heteroskedasticity appeared to have a relatively minor effect on model predictions. Most of the models gave mean predictions within +/- 20% of the actual values, particularly for the most ubiquitous species that were also the most important to moose. For each species, there were few differences (P < 0.05) in model coefficients between years and among habitat types. Differences in coefficient estimates appeared to be related to differences in stem morphology that were related to both site conditions and past browsing by moose. 3aAlces alces 3abotanical composition 3aleaves 3astems 3amass 3aregression analysis 3aAlaska 0abrowse plants1 aVan Ballenberghe, V.0 tJournal of range management.g1993 July, v. 46, no. 4 p.302-308x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02303naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007600129300001600205520154500221650001501766650002601781650002201807650002401829700001901853773008501872852000901957930003301966945001301999946001302012655001202025IND2038141420221117044234.0940323e199307  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203814142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLockwood, J.A.10aCatastrophe theory: a unified paradigm for rangeland ecosystem dynamics  ap. 282-288.  aRangeland ecologists have elucidated 2 apparently distinct processes underlying rangeland dynamics. In some cases, disturbed or recovering rangelands move through a gradual, continuous series of changes which has been termed succession. In other instances, rangeland dynamics are typified by sudden, discontinuous changes in the vegetation, and this has been cared state-and-transition. Catastrophe theory is a mathematical framework designed for the study of discontinuous phenomena, but it also generates models that permit continuous dynamics. Based on available literature, it appears that rangeland ecosystems conform to the mathematics of catastrophe theory. Rangelands exhibit the 5 essential symptoms of catastrophe systems: modality (distinct conditions or states of existence), inaccessibility (conditions which are very unstable), sudden changes (relatively rapid movement between states), hysteresis (processes associated with degradation or recovery are not readily reversible by simply inverting the sequence of events), and divergence (relatively small changes in initial conditions can result in dramatically different outcomes with time). Catastrophe theory has been successfully used to model rangeland grasshopper population dynamics, and it appears that many of the same control variables affecting insects (e.g., temperature and precipitation) may also underlie vegetative community dynamics. Application of catastrophe theory to empirical data sets will require relatively long-term but low-intensity research efforts. 3arangelands 3aecological succession 3alandscape ecology 3amathematical models1 aLockwood, D.R.0 tJournal of range management.g1993 July, v. 46, no. 4 p.282-288x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03850naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002100182245020400203300001600407500002400423506007600447520135500523506003701878650002001915650001601935650000801951650002501959650002901984650001702013650001902030650002202049650002202071650001702093650001202110650002302122650001102145650001302156650001102169650001402180650006602194650002402260650001702284650005602301650004902357650003902406650004102445650004602486650004402532650001302576650003602589650002802625650002302653650001402676650005002690650004202740650003702782650002302819650002702842651001002869700002002879700002502899773011402924852000903038856008103047655001203128IND4442022620221207060506.0100903e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444202262DNAL7 a205953482pmid7 aPMC29381582pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.110.1595662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalara, Vasiliki12aA Copal-8-ol Diphosphate Synthase from the Angiosperm Cistus creticus subsp. creticus Is a Putative Key Enzyme for the Formation of Pharmacologically Active, Oxygen-Containing Labdane-Type Diterpenes  ap. 301-310.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe resin of Cistus creticus subsp. creticus, a plant native to Crete, is rich in labdane-type diterpenes with significant antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. The full-length cDNA of a putative diterpene synthase was isolated from a C. creticus trichome cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence of this protein is highly similar (59%-70% identical) to type B diterpene synthases from other angiosperm species that catalyze a protonation-initiated cyclization. The affinity-purified recombinant Escherichia coli-expressed protein used geranylgeranyl diphosphate as substrate and catalyzed the formation of copal-8-ol diphosphate. This diterpene synthase, therefore, was named CcCLS (for C. creticus copal-8-ol diphosphate synthase). Copal-8-ol diphosphate is likely to be an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the oxygen-containing labdane-type diterpenes that are abundant in the resin of this plant. RNA gel-blot analysis revealed that CcCLS is preferentially expressed in the trichomes, with higher transcript levels found in glands on young leaves than on fully expanded leaves, while CcCLS transcript levels increased after mechanical wounding. Chemical analyses revealed that labdane-type diterpene production followed a similar pattern, with higher concentrations in trichomes of young leaves and increased accumulation upon wounding.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCistus creticus 3aEscherichia 3aRNA 3aamino acid sequences 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiosynthesis 3acDNA libraries 3achemical analysis 3acomplementary DNA 3aditerpenoids 3aenzymes 3aindigenous species 3aleaves 3aproteins 3aresins 3atrichomes 2aAlkyl and Aryl Transferasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBiocatalysis 2aCistusxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aDNA, Complementaryxisolation & purification 2aDiterpenesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aKinetics 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathways 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aCrete1 aPichersky, Eran1 aKanellis, Angelos K.0 tPlant physiology.g2010 Sept., v. 154, no. 1 p.301-310dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.110.1595663Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02277naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245009900122300001600221520144800237650002601685650002201711650001701733650002301750650001101773700001801784700002001802773008501822852000901907930003301916945001301949946001301962655001201975IND2038145920221117043346.0940323e199307  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203814592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, C.10aBroom snakeweed responses to drought.

Photosynthesis, conductance, and water-use efficiency  ap. 355-359.  aThe effects of water deficit on photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductance, canopy development, and water-use efficiency of broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae (Pursh) Britt and Rusby) were studied during the spring-summer growing season in pot-grown plants subjected to 5 soil water regimes. Stomatal conductance was proportionately more reduced by a mild water stress (soil water potential = -0.2 MPa) than were canopy development and photosynthesis. However canopy development was most affected by moderate to severe soil water deficit (< -1.1 MPa), followed by photosynthesis; transpiration and leaf conductance were least affected. When subjected to severe water stress, broom snakeweed controlled its water loss mainly through reduced canopy development rather than stomatal closure. Photosynthesis was more limited by mesophyll conductance than by stomatal conductance. Water-use efficiency was not affected by mild water stress. As soil water deficit developed, water-use efficiency declined, which was a response to nonstomatal limitation to photosynthesis and less sensitive stomata to severe water deficit. Broom snakeweed maintained positive net photosynthesis at soil water potential as low as -3.4 MPa and leaf water potential of -8.19 MPa. Waterspending behavior (low water-use efficiency) and high degree of drought tolerance were the main physiological characteristics of broom snakeweed subjected to water stress. 3aGutierrezia sarothrae 3adrought tolerance 3awater stress 3asoil water content 3acanopy1 aSosebee, R.E.1 aMcMichael, B.L.0 tJournal of range management.g1993 July, v. 46, no. 4 p.355-359x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03046naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010100128300001600229500001500245520210000260650002102360650002802381650001202409650001602421650002002437650002502457651001002482653002402492700001302516700001402529773008502543852000902628930003302637945001302670946001302683655001202696IND2038145020221117043710.0940323e199307  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203814502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichalk, D.L.10aImprovement of dry tropical rangelands in Hainan Island, China. 2.

The productivity and persistence of the grasses were tested on sandy (< 5 mg/kg available P) and loam sods (12-25 mg/kg) under cutting in a randomized block design with plots split for sequential sowings in 1981, 1982, and 1983. Grass response to legume-fixed and nitrogen fertilizer was also assessed. Thirteen of the 19 grasses tested under cutting established satisfactorily (density > 5 plants/m2), but only 6 cultivars produced yields > 1.5 metric tonne (t)/ha. Melinis minutiflora Beauv., Brachiaria decumbens Stapf. and Chloris gayana Kunth. yielded more than 1.5 t/ha in 3-year-old swards on both soils, whereas Panicum maximum Jacq. and Setaria sphacelata (Schum.) Stapf. ex Massey only performed well on fertile loam soil. Grass establishment was superior on sandy soil, but plant density did not correlate well with production which was higher on red loam soil due to better waterholding capacity and nutrient status. Compatibility of these successful grasses with companion legumes was low with legumes contributing < 0.4 t/ha to total yield of 3-year-old M. minutiflora, B. decumbens and P. maximum swards, and having minimal effect on soil nitrogen. Nitrogen fertilizer (50 kg N/ha/yr) more than doubled grass production, but was profitable only where grass response exceeded grass/legume swards > 4 t/ha. S. sphacelata was the only grass to form a stable mixture with companion legumes. [Macroptilium atropurpurem (D.C.) Urban and Stylosanthes guianensis (Aubl.) Sw.], which yielded more than 1.1 t/ha in 3-year-old swards on loam soil. This combination was recommended for improvement of loam soil rangelands. It is concluded from this study that range improvement with perennial grasses is confined to fertile soils, while direct broadcast of Stylosanthes legumes only into grazed native pastures is the practice recommended for improvement of infertile sandy soil until persistent low P tolerant grasses are found for the dry tropics. 3arange management 3ainterspecific variation 3agrasses 3asandy soils 3aclay loam soils 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aChina 0aspecies differences1 aFu, N.P.1 aZhu, C.M.0 tJournal of range management.g1993 July, v. 46, no. 4 p.339-345x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02474naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007100126300001200197520147300209650002701682650001801709650002301727650001701750650001901767650001501786651001101801653001801812653001801830653001701848653001901865700001601884700001901900700002001919773008101939852000902020930003302029945001302062946001302075655001202088IND2039282320221117043858.0940505e199401  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203928232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, J.A.10aSeeding Indian ricegrass in an arid environment in the Great Basin  ap. 2-7.  aIndian ricegrass [Oryzopsis hymenoides (R. & S.) Rickerl is a valuable forage species adapted to arid rangelands in temperate deserts. The purpose of this study was to test the influence of seeding date, depth, and rate on Indian ricegrass emergence and seedling establishment of acid scarified and intact caryopses (seeds). The seeding experiments were conducted on a wind eroding sand sheet of Lahontan age in western Nevada. During the initial year of planting, seeds of the cultivars Nezpar and Paloma Indian ricegrass were successfully established without pretreatment by acid scarification. Acid scarified seeds did not result in the established seedling stands in the field. Initial seedings were done in a season with prolonged moisture events with total precipitation about twice the average. Seedling stands of crested wheatgrass [Agropyron desertorum (Fisch.) ex Link Schult] as well as other exotic and native herbaceous and woody species were established during the first year. During the next 4 years crested wheatgrass seedlings were never again established. Indian ricegrass seedlings were established in 3 of the 4 subsequent years of seeding trials using a seeding rate of 0.8 seeds/cm of row and a seeding depth of 1 cm. Indian ricegrass seedling emergence was increased by either increasing the planting depth to 5 cm or by reducing the seeding rate to 0.03 seeds/cm of row. The ultra-low seeding rate resulted in a significant saving in seed cost. 3aAchnatherum hymenoides 3aplanting date 3aseedling emergence 3adesert soils 3avariety trials 3aarid zones 3aNevada 0ascarification 0aestablishment 0asowing rates 0aplanting depth1 aBlank, R.R.1 aLongland, W.S.1 aPalmquist, D.E.0 tJournal of range management.g1994 Jan., v. 47, no. 1 p.2-7x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02343naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005800127300001600185500001500201520152000216650002101736650002801757650001501785650002101800651001101821653002401832700001901856773008601875852000901961930003301970945001302003946001302016655001202029IND2037754720221117043039.0940308e199309  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203775472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarren, S.D.10aRevegetation strategies for Kaho'olawe Island, Hawaii  ap. 462-466.  a2019-12-05  aOver the past 2 centuries, the island of Kaho'olawe has suffered the ravages of war, slash-and-burn agriculture, and overgrazing. Today, much of the island is barren and severely eroded. A research project initiated in 1988 has sought to identify effective, economical techniques to revegetate portions of the island. Treatments included drill seeding plus several rates of fertilization with monoammonium phosphate (11-52-0). Some treatments also include jute netting for soil moisture conservation and erosion control. The effect of windbreak fencing was evaluated across all treatments. Drill seeding plus broadcast application of at least 62 kg ha(-1) N plus 291 kg ha(-1) P205 was the most cost-effective treatment. Jute netting and windbreak fencing significantly enhanced plant production, but the high cost of materials and maintenance limits their use to critical areas. The planted species with greatest promise for the windy, semiarid conditions on Kaho'olawe were buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.), bermudagrass [Cynodon dac- tylon (L.) Pers.] and weeping lovegrass [Eragrostis curvula (Schrad.) Nees]. Although not included in the seed mixture, Australian saltbush (Atriplex semibaccata R. Br.), a naturalized species, responded favorably to fertilization. A subsequent, larger scale revegetation project using a specially modified chisel plow seeder to scarify, plant, and apply in-furrow fertilization in a single-pass operation reduced the cost and improved the results of the revegetation process. 3arange management 3ainterspecific variation 3awindbreaks 3aland restoration 3aHawaii 0aspecies differences1 aAschmann, S.G.0 tJournal of range management.g1993 Sept., v. 46, no. 5 p.462-466x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02436naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245014100174300001600315500002400331500001500355520107300370650001901443650002201462650001701484650002001501650002101521650002401542650001201566650002501578650002501603650001501628650001601643650001001659650002501669653002701694700002801721700003101749700002201780700002601802773010501828852000901933856004801942655001201990IND4431444220221117043059.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443144422DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-009-0408-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuiñazú, Lorena Belén10aResponse of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) to single and mixed inoculation with phosphate-solubilizing bacteria and Sinorhizobium meliloti  ap. 185-190.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe objectives of this work were to phenotypically and genetically characterize alfalfa rhizosphere bacteria and to evaluate the effect of single or mixed inoculation upon nodulation and biological nitrogen fixation. Thirty-two strains showed tricalcium phosphate solubilization ability, and two of them caused bigger or equal solubilization halos than the control strain P. putida SP22. The comparison of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequences indicated that these strains are phylogenetically related to Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. A beneficial effect of both isolates on alfalfa growth was observed in coinoculation assays. Pseudomonas sp. FM7d caused a significant increase in root and shoot dry weight, length, and surface area of roots, number, and symbiotic properties of alfalfa plants.

The O-antigen structure of O86:B7 was solved recently in our laboratory. Comparison with the published structure of O86:H2 showed that both O86 subtypes shared the same O unit, yet each of the O antigens is polymerized from a different terminal sugar in a different glycosidic linkage. To determine the genetic basis for the O-antigen differences between the two O86 strains, we report the complete sequence of O86:B7 O-antigen gene cluster between galF and hisI, each gene was identified based on homology to other genes in the GenBank databases. Comparison of the two O86 O-antigen gene clusters revealed that the encoding regions between galF and gnd are identical, including wzy genes. However, deletion of the two wzy genes revealed that wzy in O86:B7 is responsible for the polymerization of the O antigen, while the deletion of wzy in O86:H2 has no effect on O-antigen biosynthesis. Therefore, we proposed that there must be another functional wzy gene outside the O86:H2 O-antigen gene cluster. Wzz proteins determine the degree of polymerization of the O antigen. When separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of O86:B7 exhibited a modal distribution of LPS bands with relatively short O units attached to lipid A-core, which differs from the LPS pattern of O86:H2. We proved that the wzz genes are responsible for the different LPS patterns found in the two O86 subtypes, and we also showed that the very short type of LPS is responsible for the serum sensitivity of the O86:B7 strain.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abiosynthesis 3ablood 3ablood groups 3agel electrophoresis 3agene banks 3aglycosidic linkages 3ahumans 3alipopolysaccharides 3amultigene family 3apolymerization 3aproteins 3asodium 3asugars 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aHumans 2aLipopolysaccharidesxchemistry 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Familyxgenetics 2aMutagenesis 2aO Antigensxgenetics 2aRestriction Mapping1 aYi, Wen1 aShao, Jun1 aLu, Yuquan1 aZhang, Wenpeng1 aSong, Jing1 aWang, Peng George0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2005 Dec., v. 71, no. 12 p.7995-8001dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.12.7995-8001.20053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle02885naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009300125300001600218520211900234650001102353650001102364651001202375653002102387700001702408700001602425773008602441852000902527930003302536945001302569946001302582655001202595IND2037750620221117043608.0940308e199309  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203775062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsko, T.J.10aResearch Observation: Chemical repellants to reduce grazing intensity on reclaimed sites  ap. 383-386.  aRevegetation of disturbed rangelands in western Canada is severely impeded by cattle grazing. Fencing to protect emergent vegetation is costly and restricts animal movement. Chemically repelling cattle from emergent vegetation may provide a convenient and economical alternative to fencing. This study determined whether certain repellents could reduce grazing intensity on vegetation to which they were applied compared to untreated vegetation. Canopy measurements were used to compare grazing intensity. Three trials were conducted on reclaimed land within the Aspen Parkland region of central Alberta. Time since reclamation was over 10 years in Trial A, 2 years in Trial B, and 3 weeks in Trial C. Pregnant mares' urine, Hinder (150 mg ml-1 ammonium soaps), Skoot (120 mg mi-1 tetramethylthiuram disulfide), and Deer-Away Big Game Repellent (37% putrescent egg solids) were evaluated. Two concentrations of each repellent were sprayed onto 1 X 3-m treatment plots randomized within blocks replicated 4 to 6 times. Plot canopies were measured either by gently resting a sheet of plastic laminate over the canopy, or by lowering a sliding bar attached perpendicularly to a meter stick until it contacted the uppermost leaves of the canopy, and recording the height of the sheet or bar above the soil surface. Canopies of plots treated with Big Game Repellent were taller than control plot canopies on each measurement date in all trials, indicating grazing was reduced. Big Game Repellent plots were also generally taller than plots treated with other repellents. Canopies of plots treated with pregnant mares' urine, Hindero, and Skooto generally did not differ from control plots, nor did they differ from each other in any trial. Low repellent concentrations did not reduce grazing in any trial, but high concentrations reduced grazing in all trials. Repellent effectiveness was not permanent since all canopy measurements became shorter with time. Big Game Repellent was effective in reducing grazing intensity by cattle, but practical use of repellents for grazing management requires further investigation. 3acattle 3acanopy 3aAlberta 0agrazing behavior1 aHardin, R.T.1 aYoung, B.A.0 tJournal of range management.g1993 Sept., v. 46, no. 5 p.383-386x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02672naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245008300193300001600276500002400292520148700316650001301803650002601816650001801842650001501860650001101875650001201886650001001898650002901908650001501937650001801952650001101970650002001981700002302001700002502024700002302049700001802072773009602090852000902186856005502195655001202250IND4459367820221117043502.0110625e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445936782DNAL7 a210872482pmid7 a10.1111/j.1745-6584.2010.00769.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVermeul, Vince R.10aRiver-Induced Flow Dynamics in Long-Screen Wells and Impact on Aqueous Samples  ap. 515-524.  aIncludes references  aPreviously published field investigations and modeling studies have demonstrated the potential for sample bias associated with vertical wellbore flow in conventional monitoring wells constructed with long-screened intervals. This article builds on the existing body of literature by (1) demonstrating the utility of continuous (i.e., hourly measurements for ∼1 month) ambient wellbore flow monitoring and (2) presenting results from a field experiment where relatively large wellbore flows (up to 4 L/min) were induced by aquifer hydrodynamics associated with a fluctuating river boundary located approximately 250 m from the test well. The observed vertical wellbore flows were strongly correlated with fluctuations in river stage, alternating between upward and downward flow throughout the monitoring period in response to changes in river stage. Continuous monitoring of ambient wellbore flows using an electromagnetic borehole flowmeter allowed these effects to be evaluated in concert with continuously monitored river-stage elevations (hourly) and aqueous uranium concentrations (daily) in a long-screen well and an adjacent multilevel well cluster. This study demonstrates that when contaminant concentrations within the aquifer vary significantly over the depth interval interrogated, river-induced vertical wellbore flow can result in variations in measured concentration that nearly encompass the full range of variation in aquifer contaminant concentration with depth. 3aaquifers 3afield experimentation 3ahydrodynamics 3amonitoring 3arivers 3auranium 3awells 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFlowmeters 2aHydrodynamics 2aRivers 2aWater Movements1 aMcKinley, James P.1 aNewcomer, Darrell R.1 aMackley, Robert D.1 aZachara, J.M.0 tGround water.g2011 July, v. 49, no. 4 p.515-524dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0017-467X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2010.00769.x 7aarticle01224naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115242012100134245011700255300001600372500002400388520011800412650002200530650001200552653002000564653002400584700002500608700001900633700001800652700001300670773014200683852000900825939003300834945000800867946001100875655001200886991592953110742620221117043822.0830328e198112  xx |||||o|||||||||||por||7 aPAR830028152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllenbogen, G.10aResults of the surgical treatment of non-advanced Chagas megaesophagus.

In the case of the degradation of pyrene dissolved in a non-water-soluble non-degradable solvent (2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane), by a Rhodococcus sp., two successive phases of exponential growth, during which over 80% of substrate degradation took place, were clearly characterized. During the second phase of biodegradation, rates of pyrene uptake were higher than those determined in abiotic conditions for the physicochemical transfer of pyrene from the solvent to the aqueous phase and no evidence for the presence of glycolipidic biosurfactants was obtained. The value of the specific growth rate for the first phase (mu max) was independent of the volume of the solvent phase and of the concentration of pyrene and was, in all cases, higher than that for the second phase (mu i). The mu i values increased with the volume of the solvent phase but were independent of pyrene concentration, a clear indication of an interfacial uptake mechanism. The experimental kinetic data fitted well with a mathematical model incorporating PAH uptake both from the interface and from the aqueous medium by a population consisting of adsorbed cells in dynamic equilibrium with the cells in the aqueous medium, interfacial uptake being predominant in these experiments. Similar results were obtained for the degradation of fluoranthene. This newly demonstrated mechanism of PAH uptake is of great significance for the degradation of higher PAHs. 3asoil bacteria 3apolluted soils1 aBlanchet, D.1 aVandecasteele, J.P.0 tMicrobiology.g1997 Apr., v. 143, no. pt.4 p.1087-1093aMicrobiology (Reading, England)x1350-08727nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03019naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245011000145300001600255300002100271520134300292650002001635650001401655650002001669650001401689650001701703650002001720650001001740650000901750650003001759650001201789650003901801650004901840650006301889650002101952650002201973650000901995650002502004650004302029650004802072650002102120650002202141650000902163650002502172650001702197650003802214650006302252700001602315773007902331852000902410939003302419946001302452655001202465IND8803446620221117043408.0880819e198808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880344662DNAL7 a28414392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, B.R.10aExcess vitamin A decreases the specific activity of galactosyltransferase in Golgi apparatus of rat liver  ap. 968-975.  ap. 968-975. ill.  aThis study investigated the effects of vitamin A excess on hepatic galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.13) activity in livers of rats achieved either by feeding of high levels of retinyl palmitate for 16 wk or gavaging with retinol in olive oil for 3 d. Both hypervitaminotic conditions were characterized by hepatic lipid accumulation. Golgi apparatus fractions were isolated and purity of the fractions was monitored by marker-enzyme analyses and electron microscopy. The quality of the fractions isolated from livers of rats receiving vitamin A excess was not different from that of fractions from control rats. An increase in fat-storing cells in liver, observed in vitamin A excess, coincided with the presence of a floating lipid layer present during isolation of the Golgi apparatus. Galactosyltransferase specific activity (with ovomucoid as acceptor) of Golgi apparatus of rats fed excess vitamin A was 27% of control with chronic feeding and 59% of control with administration by gavage. Activity of another luminally oriented protein, uridine 5'-diphosphate phosphatase, was increased under both in vivo regimens. Vitamin A content of Golgi apparatus, as determined by high performance liquid chromatography, correlated negatively with galactosyltransferase activity after both chronic and acute administration of excess vitamin A. 3anutrient excess 3avitamin A 3aenzyme activity 3agalactose 3atransferases 3aGolgi apparatus 3aliver 3arats 2aAcid Anhydride Hydrolases 2aAnimals 2aGalactosyltransferasesxmetabolism 2aGolgi Apparatusxenzymologyxultrastructure. 2aHypervitaminosis Axcomplicationsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aLipid Metabolism 2aLiverxenzymology 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aN-Acetyllactosamine Synthasexanalysis 2aPhosphoric Monoester Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aPyrophosphatases 2aRandom Allocation 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aTime Factors 2aUridine Monophosphatexmetabolism 2aVitamin Axadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivatives.1 aMorre, D.M.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1988 Aug., v. 118, no. 8 p.968-975x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880819c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02947naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245006700144300001600211300002100227520150000248650001001748650001101758650001401769650000901783650001101792650001401803650000901817650001201826650003101838650002601869650002801895650002301923650002101946650000901967650002601976650003502002650004002037650000902077650002502086650001102111653001502122700001602137700001702153700001702170700001602187700001402203700001502217700001502232773007902247852000902326939003302335946001302368655001202381IND8803004420221117043540.0880802e198807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880300442DNAL7 a33925922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNalbone, G.10aEffect of dietary salmon oil feeding on rat heart lipid status  ap. 809-817.  ap. 809-817. ill.  aFor 2 mo rats were fed a salmon oil diet (12.5%, wt/wt) supplemented with 4.5% (wt/wt) corn oil, a corn oil diet (17%, wt/wt) or a low fat diet (4.4%, wt/wt). Cardiac lipids were analyzed and fatty acid composition of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) was determined. Ventricular biopsies were taken for ultramicroscopic examination. Serum cholesterol, triglyceride, phospholipid and vitamin E concentrations were significantly lower in rats fed salmon oil than in those fed the other two diets, whereas serum transaminases and vitamin A were not significantly affected. Cardiac protein, phospholipid, triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations were unaffected by diet. Cardiac phospholipid composition remained unchanged and no significant changes in lyso-PC or lyso-PE levels were observed.However, the salmon oil diet produced a markedly lower n-6/n-3 ratio in both PE and PC than in the other two diets. This was the result of replacement of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), primarily 20:4n-6 with n-3 PUFA, primarily 22:6n-3. The unsaturation index of PC and PE was higher with the salmon oil diet than with the other two diets. Ventricular biopsies of rats fed salmon oil showed mild lipid accumulation associated with some lipofuscin-like material. It is suggested that, in rat heart, fish oil led to a moderate accumulation of lipids, the composition of which may include long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids and a degradative form of peroxidiz lipids. 3aheart 3asalmon 3afish oils 3adiet 3alipids 3avitamin E 3arats 2aAnimals 2aDietary Fatsxpharmacology 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFish Oilsxpharmacology 2aHistocytochemistry 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMale 2aMyocardiumxanalysis. 2aPhosphatidylcholinesxanalysis 2aPhosphatidylethanolaminesxanalysis 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aSalmon 0alipofuscin1 aTermine, E.1 aLeonardi, J.1 aPortugal, H.1 aLechene, P.1 aCalaf, R.1 aLafont, R.1 aLafont, H.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1988 July, v. 118, no. 7 p.809-817x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880802c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02080naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002000133245009000153300001800243300002600261500002300287520097300310650001401283650002001297650001901317650001201336650002701348650003101375650003101406650002201437650001101459650003701470653001601507653001401523773008201537852000901619939003301628945000801661946001301669655001201682991592948980742620221117043255.0881221e198811  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880034712DNAL7 a31429752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoeller, D.A.10aMeasurement of energy expenditure in free-living humans by using doubly labeled water  ap. 1278-1289.  ap. 1278-1289. charts.  aLiterature review.  aThe doubly labeled water method is a form of indirect calorimetry that has been developed only recently to the stage of application to human studies. The method measures integral CO2 production for up to 3 wk from the difference in elimination rates of deuterium and 18O from labeled body water. Validations against near-continuous respiratory gas exchange have demonstrated that the method is accurate and has a precision of 2-8% depending on the isotope dose and the length of the elimination period. Although the method has been validated, there is still some debate on refinements of the kinetic model that may lead to improve accuracy and precision. Because the method only requires periodic sampling of body fluids, it is nonrestrictive and ideally suited to use in free-living subjects. Recent applications of the method have included obesity research, determination of energy requirements in both developing and developed countries and studies of human growth. 3adeuterium 3astable isotopes 3acarbon dioxide 2aAnimals 2aBody Waterxmetabolism 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aDeuteriumxdiagnostic use. 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aHumans 2aOxygen Isotopesxdiagnostic use. 0aexpenditure 0aoxygen-180 tJournal of nutrition.g1988 Nov., v. 118, no. 11 p.1278-1289x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01538naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245009500150300001600245500001500261520024600276650002300522650002400545650002400569650001200593650003200605650002400637650006000661650003500721650001100756650002400767650002400791650000900815650001900824651001400843651001400857653001700871653001300888700001600901773010000917852000901017939003301026945000801059946001301067655001201080991592948050742620221117043731.0840723e198404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840043502DNAL7 a67376112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulley, R.C.10aDirofilaria immitis in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in an endemic area near Sydney, Australia  ap. 152-153.  a2019-12-04  aDirofilaria immitis in 6 of 68 red foxes, patent infections observed in 2 foxes, positive findings also found in dogs routinely examined from same locality, results reaffirm potential of red foxes to serve as reservoir hosts of this parasite 3adisease reservoirs 3aDirofilaria immitis 3anematode infections 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Wildxparasitology 2aDirofilaria immitis 2aDirofilariasisxepidemiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aDisease Reservoirsxveterinary 2aFemale 2aFoxesxparasitology 2aHeartxparasitology 2aMale 2aMicrofilariae. 3aAustralia 0aAustralia 0aepidemiology 0aNematoda1 aStarr, T.W.0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g1984 Apr., v. 20, no. 2 p.152-153wJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840723c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02283naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245009200135300001800227300003200245500015600277520096200433650000901395650001101404650001401415650001301429650002301442650001101465650002001476650002501496653001901521653002501540700002301565700002201588700002001610700002401630700002101654773009801675852001301773939003301786945000801819946001301827852000901840655001201849991592947330742620221117043752.0850405e198412  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850068402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatterson, K.Y.10aZinc, copper, and manganese intake and balance for adults consuming self-selected diets  ap. 1397-1403.  ap. 1397-1403. ill., charts.  a"Presented in part at the 67th Annual Meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology held in Chicago, IL, April 10-15, 1983."  aExtract: Twenty-eight adult men and women participated in a year-long study designed to determine accurately the nutrient intake of adults who lived at home and consumed self-selected diets. During 4 metabolic balance periods, 7 days each, corresponding to the seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter), duplicates of the diet, and all urine and feces were collected. Daily mean intakes for zinc and copper were 9.9 and 1.2 mg, respectively. These levels were less than the recommended daily intakes of 15 mg for zinc and 2 to 3 mg for copper. In contrast, the mean dietary intake of manganese was 3.0 mg/day which is within the suggested safe and adequate range of 2.5 to 5.0 mg. Metabolic balances were negative for all 3 elements possibly due to a reduction in food intake during the collection periods compared to the noncollection intervals. The collection of the duplicate diets apparently influenced the food intake during the collection weeks.

Diet records were kept daily and blood samples were collected at even intervals 5 times during the year. Plasma fatty acid levels were analyzed to determine any sex, age, or seasonal variations or if the plasma fatty acid levels could be correlated to dietary fat intake. In the population studied, there was a significant sex by age interaction, but no seasonal effect was observed. No major differences in plasma fatty acids related to diet were found. However, the younger men had the highest linoleic acid intake and the lowest plasma linoleic acid. Plasma linoleic acid levels for males older than 35 years of age (87.0 mg/dl) were significantly greater than for males younger than 36 years of age (67.9 mg/dl). The plasma linoleic acid levels of all the women were intermediate in value to the men but not different from each other (73.8 mg/dl for the younger women and 78.7 mg/dl for the older women). There was a significant sex effect in the relative percentage of plasma linoleic acid (34.4% for the women and 32.4% for the men), but no age or seasonal effect was observed.

The results obtained showed that newborns had 2.3 times higher vitamin B12 levels than their mothers and that the concentrations of this vitamin in the intervillous space of the placenta was 1.3- and 3.2-fold those encountered in the blood of newborns and mothers, respectively. These findings indicate that vitamin B12 accumulation by the placenta may represent an important factor in providing sufficient amount of this essential nutrient to the fetus. The relationship between folate and vitamin B12 concentration in the maternal, fetal and placental sera was also investigated. The highly significant correlation coefficient encountered and significantly higher serum folate concentrations in the group of parturients who received vitamin B12 supplementation during pregnancy indicate a close metabolic interrelationship between vitamin B12 and folate.

Effect of solid foods in a meal  ap. 199-208.  ap. 199-208. ill.  aExtract: The effect of adding solid foods--cornflakes, banana and hard-boiled egg--to a meal with 360 ml of intact milk containing 18 g of lactose was investigated in 13 lactose-malabsorbers and 10 lactose-absorbers chosen from 36 Guatemalan adults screened for their capacity to digest and absorb completely the lactose in this volume of milk. A 6-hour hydrogen breath test was used as the index of carbohydrate absorption. Minimal breath hydrogen was excreted by lactose-absorbers with either the intact milk alone, the intact milk with solid foods, or lactose-prehydrolyzed milk with solids. In lactose-malabsorbers, however, the 6-hour excretion of hydrogen with intact milk plus solid food was intermediary between milk alone and prehydrolyzed milk with solids. A relative net reduction of 47% in lactose malabsorption was produced by adding food, and the peak-rise in breath hydrogen was delayed by 2 hours. A physiological consequence of taking solid foods along with milk is a slower rate of colonic fermentation, and this may be the basis for reducing gastro-intestinal symptoms in lactose-intolerant malabsorbers.

One diet contained about 25 g neutral detergent fiber (NDF) in fruits and vegetables and included 100 g spinach, which is high in oxalic acid, every other day. The second diet was a low fiber diet that contained about 5 g NDF and the same amount of spinach as the first diet. On the basis of mean values for 6 wk, balances for calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc or manganese were not significantly different due to diet. Copper balances were significantly lower when the low fiber diet was consumed than when the diet containing fiber in fruits and vegetables and consequently a higher level of copper was consumed. Mineral balances were significantly different due to week. When results of both diets were considered together, mean mineral balances decreased at some time after wk 1 and returned to the wk 1 level during wk 6. Balances for wk 1 and 6 were not significantly different for any of the six minerals. These results demonstrate the importance of determining weekly balances for several weeks when conducting a human metabolic study. 3aoxalic acid 3amen 3adietary fiber 3abalance studies 2aAdult 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aFecesxanalysis. 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMineralsxmetabolism 2aOxalatesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aOxalic Acid 2aVegetables 0afruits 0amineral nutrition1 aPrather, E.S.1 aClark, W.M.1 aCanary, J.J.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1988 Oct., v. 118, no. 10 p.1197-1204x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20101118b20101204c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02677naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006000129300001600189500002400205520166400229650001101893650001201904650002601916650000901942650002301951650002201974650001501996651001502011653002202026653001602048653001202064700001502076700001902091700001702110773008402127852000902211930003302220945001302253946001302266655001202279IND2195983520221117042802.0981215e199805  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219598352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBecerra, R. de10aDiets of 3 cattle breeds on Chihuahuan Desert rangeland  ap. 270-275.  aSummary in Spanish.  aDiet botanical composition, fecal nitrogen percent, and fecal phosphorus percent were determined seasonally during 1991 and 1992 for 3 cattle breeds (Barzona, Brangus, Beefmaster) grazing late-seral Chihuahuan Desert rangeland in southcentral New Mexico. These 3 cattle breeds are considered to be well adapted to harsh environments. Cattle breed main effect was non-significant (P > 0.05) for diet botanical composition. However, season main effects (P < 0.05) did occur for some diet botanical composition components. Total grasses in cattle diets were highest in January and lowest in June. Dropseeds (Sporobolus sp.), black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda Torr.), and threeawns (Aristida sp.) were the primary grasses consumed by cattle. Forb consumption was highest in June lowest in January. Honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.) consumption by cattle was highest in August and lowest in January. It was the primary shrub in cattle diets. Breed X season interactions (P < 0.05) occurred for a few diet botanical composition components, but the small magnitude of the values and lack of consistency prevented drawing definite management implications. Fecal nitrogen values showed differences (P < 0.05) among breeds in some seasons. However due to lack of consistency no definite conclusions could be drawn regarding superiority of 1 breed compared to another in diet nutritional quality. Both fecal nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations showed cattle diets to be lowest in quality in winter and highest in summer. From a practical standpoint, this study showed no definite advantage of any breed studied in diet botanical composition or in diet quality. 3acattle 3aBrangus 3abotanical composition 3arain 3aseasonal variation 3abreed differences 3aBeefmaster 3aNew Mexico 0aselective grazing 0abeef breeds 0abarzona1 aWinder, J.1 aHolechek, J.L.1 aCardenas, M.0 tJournal of range management.g1998 May, v. 51, no. 3 p.270-275x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03058naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245019300146300002000339520141600359650002901775650001701804650002001821650002101841650003101862650002401893650001201917650002201929650001101951650004001962650003302002650003502035650004202070650004402112650001102156650002802167650001302195650000902208650004102217650002602258653001202284653001202296700001802308700001602326700001702342700001702359773009702376852000902473939003302482946001302515655001202528IND9201312920221117043626.0920309e19910605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920131292DNAL7 a19037912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuronio, R.J.10aAnalyzing the substrate specificity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase by co-expressing it with mammalian G protein alpha subunits in Escherichia coli  ap. 10498-10504.  aA dual plasmid system was used to examine the protein and acyl-CoA specificities of Saccharomyces cerevisiae myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) by co-expressing it in Escherichia coli with each of four homologous alpha subunits of the signal-transducing, heterotrimeric G proteins. Exogenous [3H]myristate was incorporated into rat Gi alpha 1 and rat Go alpha but not into bovine Gs alpha or human Gz alpha. Oxygen for methylene group substitutions in myristate result in analogs with comparable chain length and stereochemistry but marked reductions in hydrophobicity. Metabolic labeling studies with 6-, 11-, or 13-[3H]oxatetradecanoic acid indicated that they were incorporated into rat Gi alpha 1 and Go alpha with an efficiency that could be correlated with their accumulation into E. coli and their interactions with purified NMT in vitro. Octapeptides derived from the NH2-terminal sequences of these four G. polypeptides were tested as substrates for purified S. cerevisiae NMT. None were bound by the enzyme. Acidic residues at positions 7 and 8 appear to contribute to this effect; deletion of these two amino acids or addition of the next 9 residues of rat G alpha produced active substrates. These results imply that productive interactions between NMT and G. protein substrates in vivo require structural features that are not fully represented within their NH2-terminal 8 residues. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3atransferases 3agene expression 3aEscherichia coli 2aAcyltransferasesxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Western 2aCattle 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEscherichia colixenzymology 2aGTP-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlasmids 2aRats 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymology 2aSubstrate Specificity 0avectors 0acloning1 aRudnick, D.A.1 aAdams, S.P.1 aTowler, D.A.1 aGordon, J.I.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1991 June 5, v. 266, no. 16 p.10498-10504x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01644naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245011100123300001800234520074500252650001600997650002201013650002401035650002401059650002601083700001201109700001501121700001801136773011001154852000901264930003301273945001301306946001101319655001201330IND2047430420221117043902.0950822e199411  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204743042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAono, R.10aGenetic recombination after cell fusion of protoplasts from the facultative alkaliphile Bacillus sp.

Ideally, this coincides with the critical period of water demand for irrigation. The present study shows a clear trend in glacier retreat between 1963 and 2000 in the Sokoluk watershed, a catchment of the Northern Tien Shan mountain range in Kyrgyzstan. The overall area loss of 28% observed for the period 1963-2000, and a clear acceleration of wastage since the 1980s, correlate with the results of previous studies in other regions of the Tien Shan as well as the Alps. In particular, glaciers smaller than 0.5 km² have exhibited this phenomenon most starkly. While they registered a medium decrease of only 9.1% for 1963-1986, they lost 41.5% of their surface area between 1986 and 2000. Furthermore, a general increase in the minimum glacier elevation of 78 m has been observed over the last three decades. This corresponds to about one-third of the entire retreat of the minimum glacier elevation in the Northern Tien Shan since the Little Ice Age maximum. 3aglaciers 3airrigation water 3amountains 3arivers 3arunoff 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface area 3awatersheds 3aAlps region 3aKyrgyzstan1 aBilenko, Viktor1 aErshova, Natasha1 aHurni, Hans1 aYerokhin, Sergeji1 aMaselli, Daniel0 tClimatic change.g2008 Jan., v. 86, no. 1-2 p.227-234dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-007-9288-6 7aarticle02704naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245010400171300001600275500002400291520160300315650001401918650001001932650001301942650001901955650001201974650000901986650001401995650002202009650001602031650001202047650001002059650001002069700001702079700001702096700002402113773010502137852000902242856005502251655001202306IND4460077120221118063543.0110715e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446007712DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01284.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSULEMAN, NAZIA10aSexual differences in the attractiveness of figs to pollinators: females stay attractive for longer  ap. 417-424.  aIncludes references  a1. Figs on male dioecious fig trees (Ficus, Moraceae) are breeding sites for pollinator fig wasps (Hymenoptera, Agaonidae), but figs on female plants are traps that produce only seeds. As the short-lived fig wasps cannot reproduce in female figs, natural selection should favour individuals that avoid them. Several studies have failed to detect such discrimination, a result attributed to inter-sexual mimicry and ‘selection to rush' in the wasps, but their experiments failed to explicitly take into account fig age (how long they had been waiting to be pollinated). 2. We compared the relative attraction of male and female figs of known ages of the South East Asian Ficus montana Burm. f. to its pollina tor Liporrhopalum tentacularis Grandi and examined how the reproductive success of the plant and its pollinator change with the age of the figs. 3. Mean retention time for un-pollinated figs on female plants was 16 days whereas in male figs it was 12 days. Female figs remained attractive for up to 2 weeks, although the wasps were less willing to enter older figs. After pollinator entry, receptivity continued for several days, lasting longer in figs entered by a single wasp. Consistent with abortion rates, attractiveness persisted longer in female figs. Older figs produced fewer fig wasp offspring, but similar numbers of seeds. 4. The sexual differences in floral longevity in F. montana may represent part of a previously un-recognised reproductive strategy in some fig trees that allows male plants to ‘export' pollinators while also maintaining a resident fig wasp population. 3aAgaonidae 3aFicus 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3afemales 3afigs 3alongevity 3anatural selection 3apollinators 3aprogeny 3aseeds 3atrees1 aRAJA, SHAZIA1 aZhang, Yuan.1 aCOMPTON, STEPHEN G.0 tEcological entomology.g2011 Aug., v. 36, no. 4 p.417-424dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01284.x 7aarticle01685naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245008800199300001800287500002400305506007600329520041900405506003700824650002100861650001900882650000900901650000900910650002100919650002800940700001800968700001700986700002001003700002101023700001701044773013701061852000901198856008001207655001201287IND4444628720221207143317.0101105e20101115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444462872DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01009-102doi7 aPMC29761812pmcid7 a208707872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jee Yeon10aInactivation of Escherichia coli by Nanoparticulate Zerovalent Iron and Ferrous Ion  ap. 7668-7670.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe mechanism of Escherichia coli inactivation by nanoparticulate zerovalent iron (nZVI) and Fe(II) was investigated using reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenchers and probes, an oxidative stress assay, and microscopic observations.

It involved the use of the added tetraethylammonium acetate (TEAA) reagent, pH, and methanol as the significant parameters to find the optimum separation condition. A high resolution and selectivity of analytes was obtained by running the mobile phase in methanol-5 mM TEAA buffer = 35:65 (v/v, pH 4.5) at 280 nm. The mean recoveries ranged from 96.6 to 103.3% for AMP in the synthetic mixture, 97.6 to 103.0% for SUL, and 97.0 to 104.0% for CFP. The low LOD (<1.8 μg/mL) and low CV (<0.9%) assured that this method was sensitive and reproducible. The assay of analytes in commercial products exhibited that it was convenient and reproducible for routine analyses of these components in sterilized H₂O, saline, or 5% dextrose injection solutions. 3aacetates 3aampicillin 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acefoperazone 3aglucose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amethanol 3apH 3asulbactam1 aHuang, Yu-Chuan1 aLee, Chiu-Wey1 aLee, An-Rong1 aWang, Hsian-Jenn1 aChen, Su-Hwei0 tJournal of separation science.g2007 Oct., v. 30, no. 15 p.2407-2413dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2006005293Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03183naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002000142242009300162245008700255300001600342500002400358520189800382650002302280650002002303650002102323650001702344650002002361650001202381650001202393650001902405700002402424700002002448700001402468700002202482700001802504700002702522773014502549852000902694856008202703655001202785IND4396442520150910000000.0071021s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439644252DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2006251872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchäffer, Beat10aEinfluss der Zwischenlagerung auf die anfängliche Entwicklung rekultivierter Oberböden10aInfluence of temporary stockpiling on the initial development of restored topsoils  ap. 669-681.  aIncludes references  aDue to increasing construction and open-cast mining activities on fertile agricultural land, excavation, stockpiling, and restoration of soils have become important issues in soil protection. In this study, we performed a restoration experiment to investigate how the conditions during stockpiling may influence initial soil development and plant growth on a restored site. Four topsoils, which originated from two depths (with uninhibited and inhibited aeration) of a nontrafficked and a trafficked topsoil deposit, were repacked in strips and sown with three meadow-seed mixtures in strips perpendicular to the soil strips. During stockpiling as well as during the first 2 years after restoration, we assessed the physical and mechanical properties of the topsoils and (after restoration) also plant growth. None of the investigated properties of the topsoils was influenced by the depth in the deposit. In contrast, the coarse porosity and compression index were lower, whereas the bulk density and precompression stress were higher in the trafficked than in the nontrafficked topsoil deposit. However, these differences largely disappeared already in the course of soil restoration. Contrary to our expectations, the plants grew better on the soil of the trafficked topsoil deposit than on the soil of the nontrafficked topsoil deposit in the year of restoration. This might be attributed to the extremely dry and hot summer of that year. In the course of the 2 years following restoration, also the differences in plant growth tended to disappear. The remaining differences in bulk density and plant growth could not be attributed to differences in stockpiling conditions. The results suggest a re-examination of current soil restoration guidelines. The maximum permitted stockpiling heights for topsoils might be increased in order to reduce the areas required for temporary stockpiling. 3aagricultural soils 3acompacted soils 3aland restoration 3aplant growth 3asoil compaction 3astorage 3atopsoil 3atrafficability1 aEggenschwiler, Lisa1 aSuter, Brigitte1 aVogt, Lea1 aBuchter, Bernhard1 aPfister, Hans1 aSchulin, R.q(Rainer),0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2007 Oct., v. 170, no. 5 p.669-681dWiley-VCH VerlagwJournal:jnl64178x1436-87307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2006251873Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03328naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245010700184300001600291500002400307500001500331520143400346650002701780650000801807650002801815650002801843650001101871650001201882650002201894650001301916650001401929650001401943650001201957650001801969650001801987650002702005650003102032650002102063650002002084650002802104650002502132650004202157650004902199650003902248653001902287653002002306653001002326653002502336653002002361700001702381700001502398700001202413700002002425700001402445700001502459700001602474773009402490852000902584856008502593655001202678IND4396382920221118063437.0071021s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439638292DNAL7 a176050732pmid7 a10.1007/s10126-007-9014-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lingling10aFosmid Library Construction and Initial Analysis of End Sequences in Zhikong Scallop (Chlamys farreri)  ap. 606-612.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aZhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri Jones et Preston, 1904) is one of the most commercially important bivalves in China, but research on its genome is underdeveloped. In this study, we constructed the first Zhikong scallop fosmid library, and analyzed the fosmid end sequences to provide a preliminary assessment of the genome. The library consists of 133,851 clones with an average insert size of about 40 kb, amounting to 4.3 genome equivalents. Fosmid stability assays indicate that Zhikong scallop DNA was stable during propagation in the fosmid system. Library screening with two genes and seven microsatellite markers yielded between two and eight positive clones, and none of those tested was absent from the library. End-sequencing of 480 individual clones generated 828 sequences after trimming, with an average sequence length of 624 bp. BLASTN searches of the nr and EST databases of GenBank and BLASTX searches of the nr database resulted in 213 (25.72%) and 44 (5.31%) significant hits (E < e-⁵), respectively. Repetitive sequences analysis resulted in 375 repeats, accounting for 15.84% of total length, which were composed of interspersed repetitive sequences, tandem repeats, and low-complexity sequences. The fosmid library, in conjunction with the fosmid end sequences, will serve as a useful resource for physical mapping and positional cloning, and provide a better understanding of the Zhikong scallop genome. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aDNA 3atandem repeat sequences 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aclones 3aChlamys 3amolecular cloning 3ascallops 3ascreening 3adatabases 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNAxanalysis 2aDNA Primersxchemistry 2aFlow Cytometryxveterinary 2aGenomexgenetics 2aGenomic Library 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPectinidaexgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acidxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNAxveterinary 0afosmid library 0aChlamys farreri 0agenes 0afosmid end sequences 0aZhikong scallop1 aBao, Zhenmin1 aCheng, Jie1 aLi, Hui1 aHuang, Xiaoting1 aWang, Shi1 aZhang, Can1 aHu, Jingjie0 tMarine biotechnology.g2007 Oct., v. 9, no. 5 p.606-612dSpringer-Verlagx1436-22287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-007-9014-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03256naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002800181245015600209300001800365500002400383506007600407520157900483506003702062650003102099650002102130650001402151650002002165650001102185650001302196650001502209650005202224650001202276650001802288650001502306650002502321651001102346700002502357700002402382700002202406700003002428700003002458773013702488852000902625856008002634856004802714655001202762IND4399044520221207141120.0071216e20071215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439904452DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01428-072doi7 aPMC21681592pmcid7 a179339132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Allegra Kyria10aEvaluation of Removal of Noroviruses during Wastewater Treatment, Using Real-Time Reverse Transcription-PCR: Different Behaviors of Genogroups I and II  ap. 7891-7897.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNoroviruses, an important cause of gastroenteritis, are excreted by infected individuals and are therefore present in wastewater. We quantified norovirus genogroup I (GI) and GII in wastewater at different locations in France and evaluated removal by a range of treatment types, including basic (waste stabilization pond), current industry standard (activated sludge), and state-of-the-art (submerged membrane bioreactor) treatments. Noroviruses were quantified using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR). Mengovirus was used as a virus extraction control, and internal controls were used to verify the level of GI and GII rRT-PCR inhibition. A total of 161 (81 influent and 79 effluent) samples were examined; GI and GII were detected in 43 and 88% of the influent samples, respectively, and in 24 and 14% of the effluent samples, respectively. Physicians in France report far more cases of GII than GI during outbreaks; thus, the frequent presence of GI was unexpected. The GI influent concentrations were more variable, the peak GI influent concentrations were higher than the peak GII influent concentrations at all four sites (up to 1 x 10⁹ and 6 x 10⁷ genome copies/liter, respectively), and the average positive influent concentrations of GI were higher than the average positive influent concentrations of GII. The maximum effluent breakthrough concentrations were 6 x 10⁶ and 3 x 10⁶ genome copies/liter for GI and GII, respectively, indicating that the four treatment systems studied decreased the norovirus contamination load in receiving waters.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEncephalomyocarditis virus 3aactivated sludge 3aeffluents 3agastroenteritis 3agenome 3aindustry 3aphysicians 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 3awaste lagoons 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aFrance1 aLe Saux, Jean-Claude1 aParnaudeau, Sylvain1 aPommepuy, Monique1 aElimelech, M.q(Menachem)1 aLe Guyader, Françoise S.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2007 Dec. 15, v. 73, no. 24 p.7891-7897dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01428-073Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle03628naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002600155245007000181300001600251500002400267520171700291650001202008650001202020650001502032650001702047650001702064650001002081650001202091650001202103650001302115650003902128650001902167650001302186650002302199650002002222650001102242650004602253650002002299650002802319650003702347650002002384650006302404650007202467650006802539650002602607700002502633700002902658700002702687700002302714700002602737700002402763700002902787700003002816700002002846773008802866852000902954856003902963655001203002IND4459841520221118063636.0110708e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445984152DNAL7 a215479472pmid7 a10.1002/yea.18542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNevzglyadova, Olga V.14aThe effect of red pigment on the amyloidization of yeast proteins  ap. 505-526.  aIncludes references  aThe intensity of amyloid-bound thioflavine T fluorescence was studied in crude lysates of yeast strains carrying mutations in the ADE1 or ADE2 genes and accumulating the red pigment (a result of polymerization of aminoimidazoleribotide), and in white isogenic strains-either adenine prototrophs or carrying mutations at the first stages of purine biosynthesis. We found that the red pigment leads to a drop of amyloid content. This result, along with the data on separation of protein polymers of white and red strains in PAGE, suggests that the red pigment inhibits amyloid fibril formation. The differences in transmission of the thioflavine T fluorescence pattern by cytoduction and in blot-hybridization of pellet proteins of red and white [PSI⁺] strains with Sup35p antibodies confirmed this conclusion. Purified red pigment treatment also led to a decrease of fluorescence intensity of thioflavine T bound to insulin fibrils and to yeast pellet protein aggregates from [PSI⁺] strains. This suggests red pigment interaction with amyloid fibrils. Comparison of pellet proteins from red and white isogenic strains separated by 2D-electrophoresis followed by MALDI analysis has allowed us to identify 48 pigment-dependent proteins. These proteins mostly belong to functional classes of chaperones and proteins involved in glucose metabolism, closely corresponding to prion-dependent proteins that we characterized previously. Also present were some proteins involved in stress response and proteolysis. We suppose that the red pigment acts by blocking certain sites on amyloid fibrils that, in some cases, can lead in vivo to interfere with their contacts with chaperones and the generation of prion seeds. 3aadenine 3aamyloid 3aantibodies 3abiosynthesis 3afluorescence 3agenes 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3amutation 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aprotein aggregates 3astress response 3ayeasts 2aAmyloidxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDown-Regulation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPigments, Biologicalxmetabolism 2aProtein Binding 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 2aThiazolesxmetabolism1 aKuznetsova, Irina M.1 aMikhailova, Ekaterina V.1 aArtamonova, Tatyana O.1 aArtemov, Alexey V.1 aMittenberg, Alexey G.1 aKostyleva, Elena I.1 aTuroverov, Konstantin K.1 aKhodorkovskii, Mikhail A.1 aSoidla, Tonu R.0 tYeast.g2011 July, v. 28, no. 7 p.505-526dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0749-503X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.1854 7aarticle02398naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245012100168300001600289500002400305520124700329650001001576650002101586650001001607650001101617650001201628650001101640650001301651650001901664650001401683650001001697650002001707653002601727653002401753653002101777653001801798700002101816773009401837852000901931856004801940655001201988IND4398547420221118063606.0071209e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439854742DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-007-9291-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŻywiec, Magdalena10aSpatial and temporal patterns of rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.) regeneration in West Carpathian subalpine spruce forest  ap. 283-291.  aIncludes references  aNon-random seed shadows are commonly seen in plant species whose seeds are dispersed by animals, in particular by birds. The behaviour of birds can influence the spatial pattern of seed dispersal and, consequently, the entire regeneration process of fleshy-fruited trees. This study examined regeneration patterns in a fleshy-fruited tree species, rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.), growing in West Carpathian subalpine spruce forests, focussing on two problems: the temporal relationship between rowan regeneration and gap formation, and the spatial relationship between rowan regeneration and stand structure. It was found that rowan seedlings and saplings were recruited in advance of gap formation. Establishment of new rowan individuals in gaps was infrequent, but gaps enhanced their regeneration nearby under spruce canopy, where they occurred densely in a narrow belt about 15 m wide. Inside spruce stands, the highest density of young rowans was directly under crowns, especially near trunk bases. Few rowan saplings were found growing under mature rowan trees. The presence of a rowan seedling and sapling bank determines whether rowans fill spruce stand gaps. Dense rowan groves can develop mainly in extensive but slowly expanding gaps. 3aPicea 3aSorbus aucuparia 3abirds 3acanopy 3aforests 3agroves 3asaplings 3aseed dispersal 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3astand structure 0aDispersal limitations 0aFleshy-fruited tree 0aGap regeneration 0aSeedling bank1 aLedwoń, Mateusz0 tPlant ecology.g2008 Feb., v. 194, no. 2 p.283-291dSpringer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-007-9291-z 7aarticle02022naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245007600171300001400247500002400261520100600285650002201291650002101313650002001334650001001354650001801364650001101382650001401393650001301407650001101420651001701431700002401448700002001472773010401492852000901596856005501605655001201660IND4380994420221118063656.0060613e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438099442DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.2006.00139.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerguson, Shon14aThe political economy of farmland ownership regulations and land prices  ap. 59-65.  aIncludes references  aOne of the most ubiquitous forms of agricultural regulation is a restriction on farmland ownership. One Canadian example of a farmland ownership restriction is The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act (FSA), passed in 1974. The purpose of this article is to explain, using a political economy framework, why the FSA was implemented and to estimate the effect of the FSA on Saskatchewan farmland values. A Present Value (PV) model is used to estimate the relationship between land values, rents, and the regulation. The Hausman endogeneity test reveals that the regulation variable is endogenous with the land price. The sign of the regulation variable is negative, which fits with the theory, i.e., the more stringent the regulation the lower the land value. We estimate that the regulation lowered Saskatchewan farmland prices by an average of 4 to 34 US$/acre, depending on whether ordinary least squares (OLS) or two-stage least squares (TSLS) is employed in the estimation, over the period of 1974-2001. 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural law 3afarmland values 3afarms 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aownership 3apolitics 3aprices 3aSaskatchewan1 aFurtan, W.

Restrictions can be introduced for the total number of migrants, and the mating of particular pairs and their contribution. A full genetic diversity analysis of the population is carried out.

They have been reported to be both growth retarding and innocuous when fed to rats, and to have a broad range of bioactivities in vitro, suggested to be related to their ability to bind to proteins and modify membranes. This study was designed to test the effects of AR (purified from rye bran) on growth, tocopherol levels, and cholesterol levels in rats. Rats were fed 1 of 4 different levels of AR for 4 wk: 0 (control), 1, 2, and 4 g/kg diet. AR did not affect final body, liver, or lung weights. The AR diets increased the levels of gamma-tocopherol in liver and lungs (P < 0.05). To investigate whether AR could have increased gamma-tocopherol levels via inhibition of tocopherol-omega-hydroxylase, HepG2 cells were incubated with AR and the metabolism of gamma-tocopherol measured. AR significantly inhibited the conversion of gamma-tocopherol to its water-soluble hydroxychroman metabolite in vitro, indicating that AR may increase gamma-tocopherol levels via inhibition of tocopherol metabolism in vivo. The 4 g AR/kg diet decreased liver cholesterol (P < 0.001), but did not affect plasma lipids. AR were detected in the perirenal adipose tissue samples of rats fed AR, indicating that they can accumulate in the fatty tissues of rats. High levels of dietary AR moderately affect gamma-tocopherol, possibly via inhibition of tocopherol metabolism, and decrease liver cholesterol in rats. 3aadipose tissue 3aalkylresorcinols 3abinding proteins 3abioactive properties 3ablood lipids 3acholesterol 3aexperimental design 3agamma-tocopherol 3agrains 3aliver 3alungs 3amembrane proteins 3ametabolism 3arats 3arye bran 3awheat bran 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aBody Weight 2aEdible Grain. 2aDiet 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aLungxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMixed Function Oxygenasesxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aResorcinolsxpharmacokinetics 2aTissue Distribution 2agamma-Tocopherolxpharmacokinetics1 aChen, Y.1 aFrank, J.1 aSwanson, J.E.1 aParker, R.S.1 aKozubek, A.1 aLundh, T.1 aVessby, B.1 aAman, P.1 aKamal-Eldin, A.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2004 Mar., v. 134, no. 3 p.506-510dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245010900160300001600269500002400285500001500309520121600324650001601540650001601556650002201572650001201594650001501606650001601621650003001637650001301667650001501680651002001695653002701715700002001742700001701762773011601779852000901895856004801904655001201952IND4428343220221118064037.0091106e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442834322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-009-9500-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaseri, B.10aMaturation of pseudothecia and discharge of ascospores of Leptosphaeria maculans on oilseed rape stubble  ap. 523-531.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of temperature, wetness and darkness on formation of pseudothecia and the effect of temperature on the release of ascospores of L. maculans on oilseed rape stubble were studied in a controlled environment in South Australia. Pseudothecia of L. maculans developed at 5-20°C and the time taken to reach maturity and discharge ascospores decreased from 58 days at 5°C to 22.2 days at 15°C. The optimum temperature of those tested for pseudothecium maturation was between 15°C and 20°C but fewer pseudothecia were observed at 20°C than at 15°C. Exposure to a 12 h photoperiod enhanced pseudothecium formation on the stubble compared with continuous darkness. No pseudothecia formed on stubble moistened once a day at 15°C, whereas three sprays of water per day decreased maturation time in comparison with two sprays per day. More ascospores were released for a longer duration at 20°C than at 5-15°C, although peak sporulation occurred earlier at 5-10°C than at 20°C. These findings highlight the importance of moisture, temperature and light for production and release of inoculum from stubble. This information, combined with field data, may help to predict the onset of inoculum release. 3atemperature 3asporulation 3aPlenodomus lingam 3astubble 3aascospores 3aphotoperiod 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3ainoculum 3aprediction 3aSouth Australia 0aLeptosphaeria maculans1 aDavidson, J.

Here, we have characterized the pif-3 of AcMNPV in more detail. The pif-3 transcripts were detected from 12 to 96 h post-infection (hpi) in Sf9 cells infected with AcMNPV. Polyclonal antiserum first recognized a 25-kDa protein at 36 hpi. Western blot analysis indicated that PIF-3 is a component of occlusion-derived virus but not of budded virus. The subcellular localization demonstrated that the 21-amino-acid (aa) N-terminal hydrophobic domain of PIF-3, which is conserved in PIF-1, PIF2 and PIF-3, acts as a nuclear location signal and is essential for trafficking the protein to the nucleus. Deletion of either pif-3 or the 21-aa N-terminal hydrophobic domain of pif-3 from AcMNPV abolished per os infectivity but had no effect on the infectivity of the budded virus phenotype. 3aphenotype 3aopen reading frames 3aBaculoviridae 3aWestern blotting 3aAutographa californica 3apathogenicity 3aprotein transport 3aviruses 3ahydrophobicity 3aantiserum 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBaculoviridaexgenetics 2aCells, Cultured 2aDigestive Systemxvirology 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Deletion 2aGenes, Viral 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aInsect Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aLarvaxvirology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNuclear Localization Signalsxchemistry 2aNucleopolyhedrovirusesxchemistryxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aRNA, Viralxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpodopteraxcytologyxvirology. 2aSubcellular Fractionsxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 2aTransfection 2aViral Plaque Assay 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus1 aSong, J.1 aJiang, T.1 aLiang, C.1 aChen, X.0 tArchives of virology.g2007 Oct., v. 152, no. 10 p.1851-1858dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-007-1012-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02756naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245014200166300001400308500002400322520151700346650001401863650001201877650001501889650001401904650001501918650001001933650001201943650001301955650001001968650001401978650001201992650002102004653001602025653001402041653003602055700001802091700002302109773010802132852000902240856008502249655001202334IND4396228920221118064037.0071021s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439622892DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-007-0435-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAisenberg, Anita10aDaring females, devoted males, and reversed sexual size dimorphism in the sand-dwelling spider Allocosa brasiliensis (Araneae, Lycosidae)  ap. 29-35.  aIncludes references  aSexual selection theory predicts that a higher investment in offspring will turn females into the selective sex, while males will compete for accessing and courting them. However, there are exceptions to the rule. When males present a high reproductive investment, sex roles can reverse from typical patterns, turning males into the choosy sex, while females locate males and initiate courtship. In many spiders, males are smaller than females, wandering in search of sedentary females and maximizing the number of copulations. In the present study, we present findings on the sand-dwelling wolf spider, Allocosa brasiliensis, evidencing a reversal in typical courtship roles reported for the first time in spiders. Males were bigger than females. Females located males and initiated courtship. Copulation always occurred in male burrows and took place mainly in long burrows. Males donated their burrows to the females after copulation, closing the entrance before leaving with female cooperation from inside. Males would provide females with a secure place for ovipositing, being exposed to predation and diminishing their future mating possibilities until constructing a new burrow. The cost of vacating the burrow and losing the refuge in an unpredictable habitat, such as sand dunes, would explain the courtship roles reversal in this spider species. Results turn A. brasiliensis as a promising model for discussing the determinants of sex roles and the pressures that drive their evolution and maintenance. 3aLycosidae 3aburrows 3acopulation 3acourtship 3adimorphism 3adunes 3afemales 3ahabitats 3amales 3apredation 3aprogeny 3asexual selection 0aWolf spider 0aSex roles 0aSexual size dimorphism reversal1 aViera, Carmen1 aCosta, Fernando G.0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2007 Nov., v. 62, no. 1 p.29-35dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-007-0435-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02593naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245009700186300001600283500002400299520061100323650002700934650000900961650002300970650002100993650001601014650001101030650001401041650003701055650001601092650002801108650001201136650001601148650002901164650005201193650001101245650003401256650001401290650003501304650003401339650002101373650004001394650003401434650006001468650001701528650003601545651001101581651001101592653001701603653002001620653000801640653000801648700002701656700002301683700002601706773012901732852000901861856008501870655001201955IND4396169020221118064032.0071021s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439616902DNAL7 a177125062pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-007-9240-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalazar-Coria, L.10aPolyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metal evaluation after a diesel spill in Oaxaca, Mexico  ap. 462-467.  aIncludes references  aPollution in the marine environment due to a diesel spill takes days to months to complete natural remediation owing to its low volatility. Metal and PAH contamination caused by an accidental diesel spill were studied. V, Ni and Hg levels increased immediately after the spill, while PAH levels decreased after 1 month (79.4-7.6 μg kg-¹). At the diesel spill point, fluoranthene exceeded acute and chronic levels, although most of the PAHs were within the range of low effects. In fish body burden, the highest bioaccumulation factor (2.63 for naphthalene) was related to the lower molecular weight PAHs. 3abioaccumulation factor 3afish 3amarine environment 3amolecular weight 3anaphthalene 3anickel 3apollution 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aremediation 2aAccidents, Occupational 2aAnimals 2aBody Burden 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aFishes 2aGasolinexanalysisxtoxicity. 2aGeography 2aMercuryxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aMetalsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Weight 2aNaphthalenesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aNickelxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 2aVanadiumxanalysisxmetabolism. 3aMexico 0aMexico 0aDiesel spill 0aPAH body burden 0aTEL 0aPEL1 aAmezcua-Allieri, M.

This pathway is settled by pioneer neurons in the trigeminal ganglion and along which extend later-growing axons from the trigeminal ganglion and the hindbrain. Axons in this branch express a neuronal recognition molecule, Contactin 1, from the initial stage of its outgrowth in early tailbud embryos and form a tightly joined, strongly Contactin 1-positive fascicle in the later stages. When the expression vector encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein was electrotransfected into the brain neurons of early tailbud embryos, the fluorescence was detected in the hindbrain and the trigeminal nerve at late tailbud stages. Cotransfection of antisense vector caused knockdown of Contactin 1 concurrent with defasciculation and misguidance of the sensory axons in the trigeminal mandibular branch. The results suggest that Contactin 1 is required for the growing axon of hindbrain sensory neurons to recognize and follow the pathway settled by the pioneer neurons. 3aXenopus 3aabnormal

region (3'-UTR). Using a transient expression assay system with pancreatic cell lines, we demonstrated that luciferase reporter gene constructs show not only the elements with special sequences in 3'-UTR that can affect luciferase activity, but also elements containing random sequences that were ligated into the same site. The extent of the decrease in luciferase activity was dependent on the length of the DNA fragments. Our findings strongly suggested a need to re-examine the 3'-UTR characterizations of many eukaryotic genes which have been studied to date with luciferase reporter genes. 3a3' untranslated regions 3aDNA 3aluciferase 3areporter genes 2a3' Untranslated Regionsxanalysisxgenetics. 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aDNA Fragmentation 2aGenes, Reporterxgenetics 2aLuciferases, Fireflyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aPancreasxcytology 2aRNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional 2aRats 0aLuciferase reporter genes 0aPancreatic cell lines 0aPost-transcriptional regulation 0aUntranslated region analysis1 aZhang, Jingjing1 aZhang, Rihua1 aXue, Feifei1 aSun, Yujie1 aHan, Xiao0 tBiotechnology letters.g2007 Nov., v. 29, no. 11 p.1691-1696dSpringer Netherlandsx0141-54927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-007-9448-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01808naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245005700173300001600230500002400246520097800270650001201248650001401260650002701274650001201301700002201313773009401335852000901429856009201438655001201530IND4395299120221118063753.0070923s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439529912DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0310.2007.01404.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHöbel, Gerlinde10aSources of Selection on Signal Timing in a Tree Frog  ap. 973-982.  aIncludes references  aSignal-timing adjustment is common in communally signaling species, and there is large variation in signal-timing formats found in nature. We conducted a survey of geographic variation in female signal-timing preferences and male signaling behavior of a tree frog to test predictions of two hypotheses about the sources of selection acting on signal-timing behavior. We found that female preferences are important in shaping male signal timing, affecting the absolute placement of signals relative to the temporal limits of female preferences. Variation in other signal characters, particularly signal period, also affects signal timing, albeit in a more complicated pattern: the influence of signal period on signal timing varied between populations. Overall, our findings indicate that the evolution of male signal-timing behavior is strongly influenced by female preferences and by an interaction with other aspects of male signaling behavior such as male signal period. 3aHylidae 3aevolution 3ageographical variation 3asurveys1 aGerhardt, H.

These cultivars fruit on first year primocanes and can be mowed back to ground level each season for efficient fruiting and canopy management. Unlike primocane fruiting raspberry (Rubus idaeus) cultivars, the primocane blackberries as a group have less vigorous sucker production and for the initial 1-4 years, they maintain their initial plant spacing and the individual plant crowns can be identified each season at mow-down. Newly producing primocanes emerge from these crowns spaced at the initial plant spacing. Beginning in the 3th or 4th year, multiple shoots (“suckers”) will emerge between the initially established plant crowns. These sucker shoots increase cane density and will create more interplant competition and have the potential to adversely affect fruit quality and yield. During the 2014 season, we evaluated four thinning alternatives for controlling the density of emerging sucker shoots on a 5-year-old 'PrimeArk® 45' blackberry planting by removal of these plant shoots to ground level when suckers were 15 cm high or less. Treatments were: 1) no sucker removal (No); 2) removal of all suckers on one side of the row of established crowns (1×); 3) removal of all suckers on both sides of the row of established crowns (2×); or 4) removal of all suckers on either side of and between the original crowns (All). Treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Harvest began July 14, 2014 and weekly marketable fruit yield over the following five weeks was consistently lower each week when all interplant suckers were removed. Other thinning treatments did not significantly affect berry yield. Early season sucker thinning treatments did not affect fruit size. 3aRubus idaeus 3ablackberries 3acanopy 3acoasts 3acultivars 3afresh market 3afruit quality 3afruit yield 3afruiting 3aplanting 3aprimocanes 3araspberries 3ashoots 3aCalifornia0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 May 19, , no. 1133 p.207-210dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1133.31  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245011600168300001600284500013200300520126300432650001301695650001301708650001401721650002501735650001801760650001101778650001801789650000901807651001601816700001501832773014401847856005501991852000902046655001202055IND60563506320221118063817.0170223e20160519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056350632DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1133.342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAncay, A.10aInfluence of training systems and of cultivars on profitability of red currant production for fresh consumption  ap. 223-226.  aPaper presented at the XI International Rubus and Ribes Symposium held June 21-24, 2015, Asheville, NC United States of America  aTo compare two training systems and three red currant cultivars ('Red Poll', 'Rovada', 'Tatran') a trial was carried out in Switzerland in Bruson at 1100 m a.s.l. The considered training system for red currant production were: i) the traditional cordon training system (palmette system) with 3 not removed cordons (main branches) and 15 to 20 medium sized lateral braches per plant and ii) the V-training system with constantly renewed cordons, i.e., cordons were removed after 3 years at their basis (no permanent wood) and every year, 3 new cordons were established in order to obtain 2- and 3-year-old cordons producing fruits (V-system). The results over 7 years revealed that the V-training system had little influence on yield, cluster attributes and fruit quality, but a very positive incidence on the picking efficiency with 11% more fruits harvested per hour and on training investments with 15% less training hours. The economic performance of the new V-system was in average of the three cultivars 13% better than the traditional cordon system (palmette). 'Rovada' and 'Tatran' were more productive than 'Red Poll', mainly due to a higher number of clusters per plant. The economic performance was best for 'Rovada' and 'Tatran' grown in V-system. 3aaltitude 3abranches 3acultivars 3aeconomic performance 3afruit quality 3afruits 3aprofitability 3awood 3aSwitzerland1 aCarlen, C.0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 May 19, , no. 1133 p.223-226dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1133.34  aDNAL 7aarticle01486naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001700099040001800116100003400134245002900168300001600197520056400213650001300777650001100790650001900801650001600820650003200836650001600868650001000884650001100894650000900905650001100914650002000925650001400945653002300959773008000982852000901062939003301071945000801104655001201112991629193760742620221118063953.0780901e197804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7894834052DNAL7 a6456492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuskirk, E.

Little is known about whether relationships between alcohol consumption and injury vary between rural and urban adolescents. Purpose: To examine associations between alcohol and medically attended injuries by urban-rural geographic status using a representative national sample of Canadian adolescents. Methods: The study involved a secondary analysis of a national sample of Canadian adolescents aged 11-15 years (n = 7,031) from the 2001-2002 Health Behavior in School-Aged Children Survey. Respondents were classified into 5 geographic categories of rural-urban status. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine the magnitude and homogeneity of associations between drinking patterns and adolescent injuries across these 5 geographic groupings. Findings: Higher rates of alcohol consumption and adolescent injuries were observed in more rural areas. Alcohol consumption was significantly associated with higher risks for injury occurrence with evidence of a dose-related pattern of risk. Associations between alcohol consumption and injury were consistent by urban-rural geographic status. Conclusions: Misuse of alcohol is an important potential cause of injury. Adolescents whose lifestyle includes alcohol consumption experience higher risks for injury, and this association is observed consistently by urban-rural geographic status. Findings of this study emphasize a need to intervene with high-risk adolescents as a tertiary prevention strategy, irrespective of geographic background. 3arural health care 3aalcohol abuse 3aadolescents 3arural areas 3aurban areas 3awounds and injuries 3arisk assessment 2aAdolescent 2aAdolescent Behavior 2aAlcohol Drinkingxadverse effectsxepidemiology. 2aChild 2aFemale 2aHealth Behavior 2aHumans 2aMale 2aRural Populationxstatistics & numerical data 2aUrban Populationxstatistics & numerical data 2aWounds and Injuriesxepidemiology 3aCanada 0aCanadaxepidemiology.1 aLi, Dongguang1 aBoyce, William1 aPickett, William0 tJournal of rural health.g2008 Spring, v. 24, no. 2 p.143-147dBlackwell Publishing Incx0890-765X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.2008.00150.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100825b20100903c00000000  aINDdRLGe2008/06/20  aOther US 7aarticle03835naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002800189245003300217300001600250500002400266500001500290520177500305650002102080650002002101650002602121650001502147650002102162650001802183650002002201650002902221650002702250650001402277650001702291650002902308650002602337650002102363650002202384650001302406650001102419650001702430650003102447650003602478650004302514650001202557650003802569650003002607650001102637650002802648650001102676650000902687650002902696653003402725653001702759653002602776653001502802700001902817773011902836852000902955856009202964930003303056945002503089946001103114655001203125IND4404282720221118063751.0080412e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440428272DNAL7 a179276762pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-2995.2007.00366.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL800 0aL8101 aSeddighi, Mohammad Reza10aAnesthesia in Caspian ponies  ap. 237-241.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo evaluate some of the clinical and laboratory parameters following diazepam-acepromazine, thiopental, and halothane anesthesia in Caspian ponies. Prospective experimental trial. Six healthy Caspian ponies of both sexes, aged 11 ± 3 years and weighing 318 ± 71 kg. The ponies were pre-medicated with diazepam (0.2 mg kg⁻¹) and acepromazine (0.05 mg kg⁻¹) IV. Sodium thiopental 5% was administered IV, 10 minutes later and anesthesia was maintained with halothane in oxygen for 1 hour. Heart and respiratory rates, mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, and signs of anesthetic depth were monitored during anesthesia. Hematological and serum biochemical parameters were evaluated before anesthesia and at 1, 2, 3, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Urine specific gravity and cytology were evaluated at the same intervals following anesthesia. Parametric data were analyzed using repeated measures anova. Considerable sedation/tranquilization without excitement was achieved following pre-medication. Heart rate significantly increased and mild hypotension occurred during anesthesia. Sinus arrhythmia and second degree AV block occurred in five horses. Respiratory rate decreased during anesthesia, with an accompanying respiratory acidosis. Body temperature also decreased. Recovery was scored 'good' in four horses and 'satisfactory' in the other two. Blood urea nitrogen concentration was significantly increased at 1-3 hours post-anesthesia. Blood glucose was significantly increased at 48, 72, and 96 hours, and creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase were significantly increased at 24 and 48 hours post-anesthesia. This simple anesthetic protocol can be used in Caspian ponies and an acceptable anesthetic with a reasonable recovery can be expected. 3aveterinary drugs 3ablood chemistry 3aintravenous injection 3athiopental 3apharmacokinetics 3anormal values 3adrug evaluation 3acombination drug therapy 3arespiratory physiology 3ahalothane 3ahorse breeds 3apreanesthetic medication 3acardiovascular system 3aminiature breeds 3adrug interactions 3adiazepam 3ahorses 3aacepromazine 2aAcepromazinexpharmacology 2aAnesthesia, Generalxveterinary 2aAnesthetics, Intravenousxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Anxiety Agentsxpharmacology 2aDrug Therapy, Combination 2aFemale 2aHalothanexpharmacology 2aHorses 2aMale 2aThiopentalxpharmacology 0acirculatory system physiology 0aCaspian pony 0aCaspian (horse breed) 0aanesthesia1 aMohri, Mehrdad0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2008 May, v. 35, no. 3 p.237-241dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-29877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2007.00366.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080827b20080905c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/06/16  aNon-US 7aarticle04708naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002900181245018300210300001800393500002400411506007600435520195300511506003702464650001402501650002602515650002502541650001402566650001002580650002002590650003102610650001502641650001602656650002002672650001702692650002102709650002202730650003702752650001202789650003702801650002702838650001302865650001702878650002402895650002902919650002602948650003202974650001003006650001103016650002003027650002003047650003003067650003003097650001303127650002503140650001103165650003103176650003103207650003103238650004003269650004603309650000903355650002403364700001803388700002003406700002303426700001703449700002103466700002203487700001903509700002103528700002003549700002103569773011803590852000903708856008003717856004503797655001203842IND4384102220221207135555.0061007s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438410222DNAL7 a169882312pmid7 aPMC15949212pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00408-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOckenhouse, Christian F.10aCommon and Divergent Immune Response Signaling Pathways Discovered in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Gene Expression Patterns in Presymptomatic and Clinically Apparent Malaria  ap. 5561-5573.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUsing genome-wide expression profiles from persons either experimentally challenged with malaria-infected mosquitoes or naturally infected with Plasmodium falciparum malaria, we present details of the transcriptional changes that occur with infection and that either are commonly shared between subjects with presymptomatic and clinically apparent malaria or distinguish these two groups. Toll-like receptor signaling through NF-κB pathways was significantly upregulated in both groups, as were downstream genes that function in phagocytosis and inflammation, including the cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha, gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). The molecular program derived from these signatures illuminates the closely orchestrated interactions that regulate gene expression by transcription factors such as IRF-1 in the IFN-γ signal transduction pathway. Modulation of transcripts in heat shock and glycolytic enzyme genes paralleled the intensity of infection. Major histocompatibility complex class I molecules and genes involved in class II antigen presentation are significantly induced in 90% of malaria-infected persons regardless of group. Differences between early presymptomatic infection and natural infection involved genes that regulate the induction of apoptosis through mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and signaling pathways through the endogenous pyrogen IL-1β, a major inducer of fever. The induction of apoptosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with naturally acquired infection impacted the mitochondrial control of apoptosis and the activation of MAP kinase pathways centered around MAPK14 (p38α and p38β). Our findings confirm and extend findings regarding aspects of the earliest responses to malaria infection at the molecular level, which may be informative in elucidating how innate and adaptive immune responses may be modulated in different stages of infection.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCulicidae 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aantigen presentation 3aapoptosis 3afever 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aglycolysis 3aheat stress 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amalaria 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amononuclear leukocytes 3apatients 3aphagocytosis 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 2aAdult 2aFemale 2aFeverxgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aGenomics 2aGlycolysisxgenetics 2aHumans 2aImmunity, Activexgenetics 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aInterferon-gammaxgenetics 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearximmunology 2aMalaria, Falciparumxdiagnosisxgenetics. 2aMale 2aSignal Transduction1 aHu, Wan-chung1 aKester, Kent E.1 aCummings, James F.1 aStewart, Ann1 aHeppner, D.

In this study we report that C. trachomatis-infected cells proliferate more slowly than uninfected cells, suggesting that C. trachomatis may also manipulate the eukaryotic cell cycle. We further demonstrate that C. trachomatis infection destabilizes specific cell cycle proteins involved in the G2/M transition. C. trachomatis-infected cells, compared to uninfected cells, have lower levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1. Additionally, C. trachomatis infection induces an N-terminal truncation of the mitotic cyclin B1. Manipulation of the host cell cycle may represent a strategy used by C. trachomatis to ensure a stable environment conducive to bacterial growth and replication.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChlamydia trachomatis 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acytoskeleton 3aeukaryotic cells 3amicrobial growth 3apathogens 3aproteins 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCell Cycle 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCells, Cultured 2aChlamydia Infectionsxmetabolism 2aChlamydia trachomatis 2aCricetinae 2aCyclin Bxmetabolism 2aCyclin B1 2aHumans 2aMitosis 2aProtein Biosynthesis1 aMisaghi, Shahram1 aLafave, James N.1 aStarnbach, Michael N.0 tInfection and immunity.g2006 Oct., v. 74, no. 10 p.5602-5608dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00266-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://iai.asm.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle02502naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245009700167300001600264500002400280520147100304650001201775650001401787650002301801650002001824650001601844650001401860650001001874650001401884650001101898650001101909651001101920700001401931773011001945852000902055856007602064655001202140IND4384078620221118063953.0061007s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438407862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7348.2006.00088.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖberg, S.10aRecolonisation and distribution of spiders and carabids in cereal fields after spring sowing  ap. 203-211.  aIncludes references  aGeneralist predators are important for pest suppression during pest establishment because they may occur in the crop before and during pest arrival. However, different crop management practices can have a negative effect on predator populations. If so, there is a need for recolonisation by the predators to the crop fields. An important pest in Sweden is the bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, which migrates to cereal fields in spring. In turn, many cereal fields are spring sown and thus are disturbed by harrowing and sowing a short time before aphid arrival. In this study, three different questions about the populations of spiders and carabids in spring cereal crops were asked. First, does sowing in spring have a negative effect on the predators present in the fields? Second, if sowing has a negative effect on predator populations, do they recolonise the fields before pest arrival? Third, how are the predators distributed in the fields? We found that most carabids and most lycosid spiders were not affected by sowing and were distributed uniformly in the fields after sowing. Most linyphiid spiders were negatively affected by sowing, but then they recolonised the fields and were uniformly distributed in the fields after recolonisation. Thus, many spiders and carabids are present in the fields after sowing in spring and have the opportunity to suppress aphids during their establishment phase, which in turn may prevent a possible outbreak. 3aAraneae 3aCarabidae 3aRhopalosiphum padi 3acrop management 3agrain crops 3aharrowing 3apests 3apredators 3asowing 3aspring 3aSweden1 aEkbom, B.0 tAnnals of

in Pima Indians in Mexico and the U.S  ap. 1866-1871.  aOBJECTIVE:--Type 2 diabetes and obesity have genetic and environmental determinants. We studied the effects of different environments on these diseases in Pima Indians in Mexico and the U.S. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Adult Pima-Indian and non-Pima populations in the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico were examined using oral glucose tolerance tests and assessments for obesity, physical activity, and other risk factors. Results were compared with those from Pima Indians in Arizona. Both Pima populations were typed for DNA polymorphisms to establish their genetic similarity. RESULTS:--The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the Mexican Pima Indians (6.9%) was less than one-fifth that in the U.S. Pima Indians (38%) and similar to that of non-Pima Mexicans (2.6%). The prevalence of obesity was similar in the Mexican Pima Indians (7% in men and 20% in women) and non-Pima Mexicans (9% in men and 27% in women) but was much lower than in the U.S. Pima Indians. Levels of physical activity were much higher in both Mexican groups than in the U.S. Pima Indians. The two Pima groups share considerable genetic similarity relative to other Native Americans. CONCLUSIONS:--The much lower prevalence of type 2 diabetes and obesity in the Pima Indians in Mexico than in the U.S. indicates that even in populations genetically prone to these conditions, their development is determined mostly by environmental circumstances, thereby suggesting that type 2 diabetes is largely preventable. This study provides compelling evidence that changes in lifestyle associated with Westernization play a major role in the global epidemic of type 2 diabetes. 3aMexicans 3aAmerican Indians 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ainsulin resistance 3adisease prevalence 3arisk factors 3alifestyle 3aobesity 3afamilial incidence 3aglucose tolerance 3aphysical activity 3aenvironment 3agenetic polymorphism 3agender 3aage 3adeveloped countries 3aMexico 3aUnited States1 aBennett, Peter H.1 aRavussin, Eric1 aKidd, Judith R.1 aKidd, Kenneth K.1 aEsparza, Julian1 aValencia, Mauro E.0 tDiabetes care.g2006 Aug., v. 29, no. 8 p.1866-1871dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc06-01383Available from publisher's Web site  a20110503b20110603c00000000  aINDdTEMePNN 2011/0  aOther US 7aarticle03517naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245014100181300001800322520176700340650004302107650001702150650002502167650001902192650001702211650001702228650002302245650002202268650004502290650003402335650002402369650001102393650001102404650002602415650000902441650001602450650002402466650001602490650001702506700001902523700002102542700001602563700001902579700001902598700001702617700001802634700001902652700001802671773007302689852000902762856008502771930003302856945002502889946001302914655001202927IND4371896120221118063938.0050629e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437189612DNAL7 a159833252pmid7 a10.2337/diacare.28.7.17182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Ki-ho.10aProspective Study of Lipoprotein(a) as a Risk Factor for Deteriorating Renal Function in Type 2 Diabetic Patients With Overt Proteinuria  ap. 1718-1723.  aOBJECTIVE:--The effect of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] on the progression of diabetic nephropathy has not been evaluated yet. The aim of this study was to determine whether Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for deteriorating renal function in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--We conducted this prospective study in type 2 diabetic patients with overt proteinuria. Patients were divided into two groups according to their baseline serum Lp(a) level. Group 1 had Lp(a) levels </=30 mg/dl (n = 40) and group 2 had Lp(a) levels >30 mg/dl (n = 41). Patients were followed for 2 years. Progression of diabetic nephropathy was defined as a greater than twofold increase of follow-up serum creatinine concentration from the baseline value. RESULTS:--At baseline and during the follow-up, there was no difference in HbA[subscript 1c] and lipid profile between groups 1 and 2. However, serum creatinine was significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1 after 1 year (148.3 ± 78.0 vs. 108.1 ± 34.9 [micro]mol/l, P = 0.004) and after 2 years (216.9 ± 144.5 vs. 131.3 ± 47.3 [micro]mol/l, P = 0.001), although baseline serum creatinine did not differ significantly between groups. In all, 13 of 14 patients with progression of diabetic nephropathy (progressors) were from group 2. Baseline Lp(a) levels were higher in the progressors than in the nonprogressors (62.9 ± 26.7 vs. 33.5 ± 27.5 mg/dl, P < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression showed that baseline Lp(a) level was a significant and independent predictor of the progression of diabetic nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS:--Our study demonstrated that Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for the progression of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients with overt proteinuria. 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3alipoproteins 3adiabetic nephropathy 3arenal function 3ablood lipids 3arisk factors 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aCreatininexblood 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxurine. 2aDiabetic Nephropathiesxblood 2aDisease Progression 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLipoprotein(a)xblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aProspective Studies 2aProteinuria 2aRisk Factors1 aKo, Seung Hyun1 aKim, Hyung Wook.1 aAhn, Yu-Bae1 aLee, Jong Min.1 aSon, Hyun-Shik1 aYoon, Kun-Ho1 aCha, Bong-Yun1 aLee, Kwang-Woo1 aSon, Ho-Young0 tDiabetes care.g2005 July, v. 28, no. 7 p.1718-1723x0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/diacare.28.7.17183Available from publisher's Web site  a20110416b20110507c00000000  aINDdTEMePNN 2011/0  aOther US 7aarticle03977naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002000165245009100185300001800276500001500294520169700309650001402006650004302020650002102063650001002084650001402094650006002108650000902168650002502177650004702202650002802249650001602277650005202293650006802345650009302413650002302506650004702529650001102576650003702587650001102624650002502635650000902660650001602669650002602685650003202711650003202743650001702775651004002792653001802832653001502850700002002865700001602885700002402901700001902925700002302944700001902967700001802986700002303004773007403027852000903101856008603110930003303196945002503229946001303254655001203267IND4375629120221118063758.0051030e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437562912DNAL7 a162495372pmid7 a10.2337/diacare.28.11.26682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaton, Wayne J.14aThe Association of Comorbid Depression With Mortality in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes  ap. 2668-2672.  a2019-12-04  aOBJECTIVE:--We assessed whether patients with comorbid minor and major depression and type 2 diabetes had a higher mortality rate over a 3-year period compared with patients with diabetes alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--In a large health maintenance organization (HMO), 4,154 patients with type 2 diabetes were surveyed and followed for up to 3 years. Patients initially filled out a written questionnaire, and HMO-automated diagnostic, laboratory, and pharmacy data and Washington State mortality data were collected to assess diabetes complications and deaths. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios of death for each group compared with the reference group. RESULTS:--There were 275 (8.3%) deaths in 3,303 patients without depression compared with 48 (13.6%) deaths in 354 patients with minor depression and 59 (11.9%) deaths among 497 patients with major depression. A proportional hazards model with adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment found that compared with the nondepressed group, minor depression was associated with a 1.67-fold increase in mortality (P = 0.003), and major depression was associated with a 2.30-fold increase (P < 0.0001). In a second model that controlled for multiple potential mediators, both minor and major depression remained significant predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS:--Among patients with diabetes, both minor and major depression are strongly associated with increased mortality. Further research will be necessary to disentangle causal relationships among depression, behavioral risk factors (adherence to medical regimens), diabetes complications, and mortality. 3amorbidity 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ahealth insurance 3adeath 3amortality 2aBlack or African Americanxstatistics & numerical data. 2aAged 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAsian Peoplexstatistics & numerical data. 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aComorbidity 2aDepressionxepidemiologyxethnologyxmortality. 2aDepressive Disorder, Majorxepidemiologyxethnologyxmortality. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xdiagnosisxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxethnologyxpsychology. 2aEducational Status 2aWhite Peoplexstatistics & numerical data. 2aFemale 2aHealth Maintenance Organizations 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aTime Factors 0aWashingtonxepidemiologyxethnology 0acomplications 0adepression1 aRutter, Carolyn1 aSimon, Greg1 aLin, Elizabeth H.B.1 aLudman, Evette1 aCiechanowski, Paul1 aKinder, Leslie1 aYoung, Bessie1 aVon Korff, Michael0 tDiabetes care.g2005 Nov., v. 28, no. 11 p.2668-2672x0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/diacare.28.11.26683Available from publisher's Web site  a20110419b20110507c00000000  aINDdTEMePNN 2011/0  aOther US 7aarticle03018naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001900146245011200165300001800277520172100295650004302016650002302059650002602082650002302108650001402131650002602145650002202171650001802193650002102211650001802232650002202250650002402272650002902296650001202325700001902337773007402356852000902430856008602439930003302525945002502558946001302583655001202596IND4375631220221118063908.0051030e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437563122DNAL7 a10.2337/diacare.28.11.27802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamaoka, Kazue10aEfficacy of Lifestyle Education to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials  ap. 2780-2786.  aOBJECTIVE:--To evaluate the efficacy of lifestyle education for preventing type 2 diabetes in individuals at high risk by meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, as assessed by incidence and a reduced level of plasma glucose 2 h after a 75-g oral glucose load (2-h plasma glucose). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Through an electronic search, 123 studies were identified. A literature search identified eight studies that met strict inclusion criterion of meta-analysis for 2-h plasma glucose and five studies for the incidence of diabetes. All were randomized controlled trials of [>/=]6 months with lifestyle education that included a dietary intervention. Subjects were adults diagnosed as being at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The difference in mean reduction of 2-h plasma glucose from baseline to the 1-year follow-up and relative risk (RR) of the incidence of diabetes in the lifestyle education group versus the control group were assessed. Overall estimates were calculated using a random-effects model. Those estimates were confirmed by several models, and the possibility of selection bias was examined using a funnel plot. RESULTS:--Lifestyle education intervention reduced 2-h plasma glucose by 0.84 mmol/l (95% CI 0.39-1.29) compared with the control group. The 1-year incidence of diabetes was reduced by [approximately]50% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.44-0.69) compared with the control group. Results were stable and little changed if data were analyzed by subgroups or other statistical models. Funnel plots revealed no selection bias. CONCLUSIONS:--Lifestyle education was effective for reducing both 2-h plasma glucose and RR in high-risk individuals and may be a useful tool in preventing diabetes. 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ainsulin resistance 3adiet-related diseases 3adisease prevention 3alifestyle 3abehavior modification 3apatient education 3ameta-analysis 3ahealth education 3ablood glucose 3aglucose tolerance 3anutrition education 3anutritional intervention 3adieting1 aTango, Toshiro0 tDiabetes care.g2005 Nov., v. 28, no. 11 p.2780-2786x0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/diacare.28.11.27803Available from publisher's Web site  a20110504b20110603c00000000  aINDdTEMePNN 2011/0  aOther US 7aarticle02200naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245009200172300001600264520094400280650001801224650001301242650000901255650001101264650001801275650001501293650001101308650002301319650001501342650001801357653000801375653002201383653001701405700001701422700001801439700001701457700001901474773009901493852000901592856009401601930003301695945001301728946001301741655001201754IND2206125720221118063937.0000731e199907  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220612572DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4557.1999.tb00559.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, C.G.10aEvaluation of ground pork and pork sausage containing different forms of apple products  ap. 301-315.  aFat contents of ground pork were altered by reducing the amounts of fat trim incorporated and by the inclusion of different apple products (fresh, rehydrated, and sauce). Panelists could discriminate between ground pork containing 15% or 30% fat (without apples) and between ground pork with 0% or 15% apple (25% fat) but not between formulations with 15% or 25% fat and 10% apple (p<0.05). Incorporation of apple products (15% of total formulation weight) into reduced-fat pork sausage containing 15% fat yielded formulations with comparable flavor and preference scores to sausage with 30% fat, depending on the apple product. Total fat of cooked pork sausage can be reduced by approximately 35% by incorporation of apple products (15%) into reduced fat pork sausage. Inclusion of fresh or rehydrated apples did not significantly influence psychrotrophic bacteria populations or the color of pork sausage stored at 1-2C up to eight days. 3awater content 3asausages 3apork 3aapples 3ablended foods 3aapplesauce 3aflavor 3asensory evaluation 3ashelf life 3alipid content 0afat 0arehydrated apples 0afresh apples1 aPrijatna, D.1 aBusboom, J.R.1 aBrekke, C.J.1 aBoylston, T.D.0 tJournal of food quality.g1999 July, v. 22, no. 3 p.301-315wJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4557.1999.tb00559.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01931naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002700154245007600181300001600257500001500273520088400288650001201172650002301184650002401207650001901231650001001250650001001260650001401270653001101284700001301295773009901308852000901407856009401416930003301510945001301543946001301556655001201569IND2206326120221118063755.0000809e199910  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220632612DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4557.1999.tb00177.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández, Jerónimo.12aA research note: study of the quality of Pacharan by sensory evaluation  ap. 453-460.  a2019-12-04  aPacharan is a traditional drink of Navarra, Spain. This spirit is an alcoholic drink which ranges from intense pink to red in color and whose base is sloe (Prunus spinosa, L.) flavored with, the essential oils of aniseed and sugar. Sensory analysis was performed using samples from twenty-one different brands of commercial pacharan. Statistical techniques employed were formations of a linear correlation matrix, followed by factor analysis and multiple linear regression. Factor analysis permitted reduction of the sensory variables examined (color, aroma quality, flavor quality, sweetness, acidity and overall impression) to two factor variables ("flavor and aroma" and "color"). The position of the brands with respect to these two factors indicate the necessary changes to improve pacharan quality. The factors "flavor and aroma" had the chief effect on Overall Impression. 3aacidity 3asensory evaluation 3aalcoholic beverages 3aPrunus spinosa 3acolor 3aodors 3asweetness 0aflavor1 aCasp, A.0 tJournal of food quality.g1999 Oct., v. 22, no. 4 p.453-460wJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4557.1999.tb00177.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03968naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001800163245012200181300001600303520196200319650004002281650002302321650001502344650002202359650002102381650002402402650001202426650001002438650001802448650001002466650003002476650002802506650005502534650004002589650004102629650003902670650001302709650001102722650003502733650001102768650002302779650001502802650000902817650003202826650003102858650002402889651001202913700002102925700002002946700002002966700002902986700001603015700001803031700002203049773007103071852000903142856008403151930003303235945002503268946001303293655001203306IND4369624520141222000000.0050505e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436962452DNAL7 a157931722pmid7 a10.2337/diacare.28.4.7772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWadén, Johan10aLeisure Time Physical Activity Is Associated With Poor Glycemic Control in Type 1 Diabetic Women: The FinnDiane study  ap. 777-782.  aOBJECTIVE:--We studied the association between leisure time physical activity (LTPA) and glycemic control, insulin dose, and estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) in type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--This is a cross-sectional study of 1,030 type 1 diabetic patients participating in the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy Study, a nationwide multicenter study. LTPA was assessed by a validated 12-month questionnaire and expressed in metabolic equivalent (MET) units. Patients were grouped as sedentary (LTPA <10 MET h/week, n = 247), moderately active (LTPA 10-40 MET h/week, n = 568), and active (LTPA >40 MET h/week, n = 215). Outcome measures were HbA[subscript 1c], insulin dose, and eGDR (estimate of insulin sensitivity based on waist-to-hip ratio, hypertension, and HbA[subscript 1c]). RESULTS:--LTPA correlated with HbA[subscript 1c] in women (r = -0.12, P = 0.007) but not in men (r = -0.03, P = 0.592). Sedentary women had higher HbA[subscript 1c] than moderately active and active women: 8.8 ± 1.4% vs. 8.3 ± 1.4% vs. 8.3 ± 1.4% (P = 0.004), whereas HbA[subscript 1c] in men was 8.4 ± 1.3% vs. 8.2 ± 1.4% vs. 8.2 ± 1.3% (P = 0.774), respectively. In men, insulin doses were 0.74 ± 0.21 vs. 0.71 ± 0.20 vs. 0.68 ± 0.23 IU · kg⁻¹ · 24 h⁻¹ (P = 0.003). In both sexes, sedentary patients had lower eGDRs than active patients [median (interquartile range) 5.5 (4.0-8.2) vs. 6.8 (4.7-8.8) vs. 6.7 (4.6-8.6) mg · kg⁻¹ · min⁻¹; P < 0.01 for sedentary vs. others]. Age, obesity, smoking, insulin dose, social class, diabetic nephropathy, or cardiovascular disease did not explain the results. CONCLUSIONS:--Low levels of LTPA were associated with poor glycemic control in type 1 diabetic women. Men seem to use less insulin when physically active. Increased LTPA levels were associated with increased estimated insulin sensitivity. Longitudinal studies are needed to further clarify the effects of LTPA on type 1 diabetes. 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ainsulin resistance 3arecreation 3aphysical activity 3aglycemic control 3ahormone supplements 3ainsulin 3awomen 3ablood glucose 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xbloodxphysiopathology. 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxepidemiology 2aDiabetic Nephropathiesxepidemiology 2aDiabetic Retinopathyxepidemiology 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxanalysis. 2aHumans 2aLeisure Activities 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSex Characteristics 0aFinland1 aTikkanen, Heikki1 aForsblom, Carol1 aFagerudd, Johan1 aPettersson-Fernholm, Kim1 aLakka, Timo1 aRiska, Mikael1 aGroop, Per-Henrik0 tDiabetes care.g2005 Apr., v. 28, no. 4 p.777-782x0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/diacare.28.4.7773Available from publisher's Web site  a20110419b20110507c00000000  aINDdTEMePNN 2011/0  aOther US 7aarticle01460naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245011100169300001600280520022600296650000800522650001000530650002100540650002500561650002600586650001500612650000900627653001000636653001300646653001300659653002400672653002000696700001500716700001500731700003100746773009900777852000900876856009400885930003300979945001301012946001301025655001201038IND2202966020221118063826.0000310e199906  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220296602DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4557.1999.tb00550.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPino, J.A.10aApplication of multivariate statistical methods to differentiation of rum aged in two types of oak barrels  ap. 183-191.  aMultivariate statistical methods have been applied to analytical data for 14 major volatile compounds collected from various rum samples, in order to differentiate rums aged in two types of oak vessels, hogshead and pipe. 3arum 3aodors 3aflavor compounds 3achemical composition 3amultivariate analysis 3acontainers 3awood 0aaging 0aaged rum 0aoak wood 0ahogshead oak vessel 0apipe oak vessel1 aMarbot, R.1 aPérez, J.1 aNunez de Villavicencio, M.0 tJournal of food quality.g1999 June, v. 22, no. 2 p.183-191wJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4557.1999.tb00550.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02070naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001300154245012900167300001600296520097700312650001201289650001601301650001701317650002601334650003101360650002301391700001401414700001601428700001501444773009901459852000901558856009401567930003301661945001301694946001301707655001201720IND2202966120221118063942.0000310e199906  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220296612DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4557.1999.tb00551.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, C.10aAnalyzing and correlating instrumental and sensory data: a multivariate study of physical properties of cooked wheat noodles  ap. 193-211.  aThe physical characteristics and sensory properties of eight wheat noodles formulated with wheat gluten (0, 3 and 6%) and glyceryl monostearate (0, 1.4 and 2.8%) were investigated. Color parameters and texture attributes were instrumentally characterized. Four visually observed appearance attributes and four manually or orally assessed textural attributes, were sensorially profiled quantitatively. Glyceryl monostearate, at 1.4% and 2.8% fortification levels, had more profound influences than wheat gluten, at 3% and 6% fortification levels, and exhibited different behaviors in most of the physical and sensory properties of cooked noodles. These two additives well separated the eight noodle products along two independent dimensions. As to instrumental-sensory relations, principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares regression (PLS) and Procrustes analysis (PA) confirmed that the instrumental and sensory analysis procedures reached a true consensus. 3anoodles 3awheat flour 3awheat gluten 3aproximate composition 3aphysicochemical properties 3asensory evaluation1 aHsieh, F.1 aHeymann, H.1 aHuff, H.E.0 tJournal of food quality.g1999 June, v. 22, no. 2 p.193-211wJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4557.1999.tb00551.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02045naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245008000170300001400250520093900264650002201203650002001225650002701245650001001272650001201282650002301294650001001317650001101327650001001338653001901348700001601367700001701383773009701400852000901497856009401506930003301600945001301633946001301646655001201659IND2205227720221118063818.0000613e199903  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220522772DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4557.1999.tb00926.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, J.C.10aFunctional properties of sorghum flour as an extender in grond beef patties  ap. 51-61.  aPatties were formulated with 20% fat ground beef and sorghum flour (SF) at 2, 4, and 6% levels (10, 20, and 30% as rehydrated 1:4 with water).

Because beta-carotene is susceptible to oxidative degradation, particularly in dehydrated food materials exposed to atmospheric oxygen, several packaging conditions were evaluated for enhancement of beta-carotene retention in sweet potato flakes during storage. The flakes were packaged in either a polypropylene film (high oxygen permeability) with air headspace or a nylon laminate film (low oxygen permeability) with air headspace, under vacuum, or with an Ageless oxygen absorber sachet enclosed. Packaged flakes were stored in the dark at ambient laboratory temperature (approximately 23C), and beta-carotene content was determined at intervals from 0 to 210 day storage using reversed-phase liquid chromatography. Among the packaging conditions tested, beta-carotene retention was enhanced incrementally as the apparent availability of oxygen was reduced (nylon > polypropylene; oxygen absorber > vacuum > air headspace). The combined use of oxygen absorbers and flexible oxygen barrier film gave excellent retention of beta-carotene during the 210 day trial. 3asweet potatoes 3adried foods 3abeta-carotene 3afood packaging 3apackaging materials 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3afood preservation1 aWatkins, R.H.1 aSimunovic, N.1 aSolomons, N.1 aBulux, J.1 aBarrows, J.1 aSchwartz, S.J.0 tJournal of food quality.g1999 Mar., v. 22, no. 1 p.63-73wJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4557.1999.tb00927.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02790naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245008300170300001600253500002400269520171500293650002202008650001402030650001702044650001502061650001902076650001302095650002402108650001102132650003402143650000902177700001502186700002102201700001402222773011602236852000902352856005502361655001202416IND4387531920070303000000.0070204e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438753192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2389.2006.00819.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcelino, V.13aAn evaluation of 2D-image analysis techniques for measuring soil microporosity  ap. 133-140.  aIncludes references  aTo compare soil porosity measurements, manual, semiautomatic and automatic 2D-image analyses were performed on three sets of images of the same fields. The first and second image sets were obtained, by a fluorescence microscope, on the polished surfaces of soil blocks impregnated with a fluorescent resin and on the thin sections made from them, respectively. A scanning electron microscope in backscattered mode was used to acquire the third set of images on the thin sections. In the manual image analysis procedure, image segmentation was based on the best visual impression and carried out individually for each image with the UTHSCSA Image Tool software. For the semiautomatic method, the software μCTanalySIS was used; the images were segmented by double hysteresis, after interactive selection of the thresholding values. Automatic thresholding, based on an analysis of the image intensity histogram, was performed using the image analysis software Image-Pro® Plus. Average microporosity measurements were compared between image types and image analysis methods using marginal regression models for continuous outcomes. The mean area covered by pores was significantly different depending on the type of image and the method of image analysis. Results after the automatic procedure were significantly larger than after manual or semiautomatic thresholding. On the other hand, average porosities were larger for backscattered electron images than for fluorescent images, regardless of the image analysis procedure used. These results stress the need for standardization of image analysis protocols and warn of the dangers of comparing soil porosity measurements performed on different types of images. 3acomputer software 3aelectrons 3afluorescence 3ahysteresis 3aimage analysis 3aporosity 3aregression analysis 3aresins 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asoil1 aCnudde, V.1 aVansteelandt, S.1 aCarò, F.0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2007 Feb., v. 58, no. 1 p.133-140dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1351-07547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2006.00819.x 7aarticle02025naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245011300162300001800275500002400293520091800317650002201235650001101257650001901268650001701287650001801304650001501322650001501337650001701352650001601369650002701385700002101412700002101433700001701454773012301471852000901594856004801603655001201651IND4393701420221118062530.0070805e199711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439370142DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-997-0257-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Kuan-Ju10aSynthesis of cocoa butter equivalent by lipase-catalyzed interesterification in supercritical carbon dioxide  ap. 1477-1482.  aIncludes references  aWith supercritical carbon dixoide as a reaction medium, the syntheses of cocoa butter equivalent by interesterification with various lipases were investigated. The study showed that among those five lipases tested, lipase IM-20 from Mucor miehei was the most effective and specific in synthesizing this cocoa butter equivalent product by interesterification. The yields of cocoa butter equivalent are affected by pressure, substrate oil composition, solubility and co-solvent. The best reaction conditions were: reaction pressure at 1500 psi, triglyceride with high content of POP (P, palmitate; O, oleate) and POO, reaction medium with 5.0% water, and reaction temperature at 50°C. The major component of cocoa butter, POS (S, stearate), can be increased by 6.0% by adding a small amount of carbon dioxide. The yield and melting point of the purified cocoa butter equivalent are 53.0% and 34.3°C, respectively. 3aRhizomucor miehei 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acocoa butter 3amelting point 3aoleic acid 3asolubility 3astearic acid 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerol lipase1 aCheng, Hong-Ming1 aChang, Rey-Chang1 aShaw, Jei-Fu0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g1997 Nov., v. 74, no. 11 p.1477-1482dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-997-0257-z 7aarticle02750naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003100164245011900195300001600314500002400330520119100354650001601545650000801561650002001569650001301589650001601602650001901618650001101637650001701648650000901665650001201674650001301686650001701699650001301716650003101729650002401760650003901784650005901823650005501882650002001937650002801957650001301985700002501998700002102023700002802044773010302072852000902175856004802184655001202232IND4407293820221118062725.0080627e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440729382DNAL7 a184937212pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-008-9346-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtega-Galisteo, Ana Pilar10aArabidopsis DEMETER-LIKE proteins DML2 and DML3 are required for appropriate distribution of DNA methylation marks  ap. 671-681.  aIncludes references  aCytosine DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark for maintenance of gene silencing across cellular divisions, but it is a reversible modification. Genetic and biochemical studies have revealed that the Arabidopsis DNA glycosylase domain-containing proteins ROS1 (REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1) and DME (DEMETER) initiate erasure of 5-methylcytosine through a base excision repair process. The Arabidopsis genome encodes two paralogs of ROS1 and DME, referred to as DEMETER-LIKE proteins DML2 and DML3. We have found that DML2 and DML3 are 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases that are expressed in a wide range of plant organs. We analyzed the distribution of methylation marks at two methylated loci in wild-type and dml mutant plants. Mutations in DML2 and/or DML3 lead to hypermethylation of cytosine residues that are unmethylated or weakly methylated in wild-type plants. In contrast, sites that are heavily methylated in wild-type plants are hypomethylated in mutants. These results suggest that DML2 and DML3 are required not only for removing DNA methylation marks from improperly-methylated cytosines, but also for maintenance of high methylation levels in properly targeted sites. 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3acytosine 3aepigenetics 3agene silencing 3agenome 3aglycosylases 3aloci 3amutants 3amutation 3aplant organs 3aproteins 2a5-Methylcytosinexanalysis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDNA Glycosylasesxchemistryxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDNA Methylation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation1 aMorales-Ruiz, Teresa1 aAriza, Rafael R.1 aRoldán-Arjona, Teresa.0 tPlant molecular biology.g2008 Aug., v. 67, no. 6 p.671-681dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-008-9346-0 7aarticle02574naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245012300169300001600292500002400308520136500332650001401697650001001711650000901721650000901730650001901739650001201758650001101770650001401781650002501795650001501820650001201835650001501847650002401862650001201886650001401898650001101912651001201923700001801935700001801953773009301971852000902064856005502073655001202128IND4447927420221118062719.0110125e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444792742DNAL7 a10.1111/j.2006.0906-7590.04525.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXavier, J.C.10aDetermining prey distribution patterns from stomach-contents of satellite-tracked high-predators of the Southern Ocean  ap. 260-272.  aIncludes references  aThe distribution of many cephalopod, crustacean and fish species in the Southern Ocean, and adjacent waters, is poorly known, particularly during times of the year when research surveys are rare. Analysing the stomach samples of satellite-tracked higher predators has been advocated as a potential method by which such gaps in knowledge can be filled. We examined the viability of this approach through monitoring wandering albatrosses Diomedea exulans at their colony on Bird Island, South Georgia (54°S, 38°W) over the winters (May-July) of 1999 and 2000. At this time, these birds foraged in up to three different water-masses, the Antarctic zone (AZ), the sub-Antarctic zone (SAZ) and the sub-Tropical zone (STZ), which we defined by contemporaneous satellite images of sea surface temperature. A probabilistic model was applied to the tracking and diet data collected from 38 birds to construct a large-scale map of where various prey were captured. Robustness/sensitivity analyses were used to test model assumptions on the time spent foraging and relative catch efficiencies and to evaluate potential biases associated with the model. We were able to predict the distributions of a wide number of cephalopod, crustacean of fish species. We also discovered some of the limitations to using this type of data and proposed ways to rectify these problems. 3aCrustacea 3abirds 3adiet 3afish 3aimage analysis 3aislands 3aoceans 3apredators 3aprobabilistic models 3asatellites 3astomach 3asubtropics 3asurface temperature 3asurveys 3aviability 3awinter 3aGeorgia1 aTarling, G.A.1 aCroxall, J.P.0 tEcography.g2006 Apr., v. 29, no. 2 p.260-272dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2006.0906-7590.04525.x 7aarticle02616naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245008900165300001600254500002400270520166100294650002501955650001401980650001601994650001102010650001402021650001002035650002102045650001202066650001102078700002302089773010202112852000902214856005502223655001202278IND4447896020221118062541.0110125e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444789602DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01795.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Can10aDo dichogamy and herkogamy reduce sexual interference in a self-incompatible species  ap. 271-278.  aIncludes references  a1. Dichogamy and herkogamy respectively represent the temporal and spatial separation of male and female reproductive functions. They are regarded as mechanisms to avoid selfing, to promote outcrossing and, particularly in self-incompatible plants, to reduce sexual interference. However, little is known about the extent to which these mechanisms reduce sexual interference, and whether this reduction impacts fitness. 2. We studied patterns of dichogamy and herkogamy, their influence on sexual interference, and the fitness outcome in self-incompatible Passiflora incarnata. We manipulated flowers to be adichogamous or unisexual to evaluate fruit production under increased and decreased sexual interference. 3. Incomplete protandry guaranteed that almost half of the pollen could be successfully exported without interfering with the stigmas, indicating dichogamy may facilitate male pollination success. We found no difference in pollen deposition between natural and emasculated flowers, suggesting that herkogamy does not decrease self pollination. Increased herkogamy resulted in reduced pollen deposition and lower probability of setting fruits, however, a higher seed number. No difference in female fitness was detected under experimentally increased or decreased sexual interference. 4. Taken together, our results suggest that dichogamy is mostly driven by the advantage to male fitness and herkogamy is chiefly determined by female fitness. The lack of difference in female fitness under varied levels of sexual interference indicates that male function is more likely to play a role in shaping floral traits that reduce sexual interference. 3aPassiflora incarnata 3afruit set 3aoutcrossing 3apollen 3aprotandry 3aseeds 3aself-pollination 3aselfing 3astigma1 aGalloway, Laura F.0 tFunctional ecology.g2011 Feb., v. 25, no. 1 p.271-278dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01795.x 7aarticle02886naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245011300134300001800247500002800265500001500293520178200308650001502090650001702105650002202122650001202144650000902156650001602165650001902181650001602200650002002216650001802236650002302254650002002277653001102297700002102308700002202329773011502351852000902466946001302475655001202488IND4407753920221118062533.0080712s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440775392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHelmersson, Andreas14aThe Level of Free Intracellular Zinc Mediates Programmed Cell Death/Cell Survival Decisions in Plant Embryos  ap. 1158-1167.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019-12-06  aZinc is a potent regulator of programmed cell death (PCD) in animals. While certain, cell-type-specific concentrations of intracellular free zinc are required to protect cells from death, zinc depletion commits cells to death in diverse systems. As in animals, PCD has a fundamental role in plant biology, but its molecular regulation is poorly understood. In particular, the involvement of zinc in the control of plant PCD remains unknown. Here, we used somatic embryos of Norway spruce (Picea abies) to investigate the role of zinc in developmental PCD, which is crucial for correct embryonic patterning. Staining of the early embryos with zinc-specific molecular probes (Zinquin-ethyl-ester and Dansylaminoethyl-cyclen) has revealed high accumulation of zinc in the proliferating cells of the embryonal masses and abrupt decrease of zinc content in the dying terminally differentiated suspensor cells. Exposure of early embryos to a membrane-permeable zinc chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine led to embryonic lethality, as it induced ectopic cell death affecting embryonal masses. This cell death involved the loss of plasma membrane integrity, metacaspase-like proteolytic activity, and nuclear DNA fragmentation. To verify the anti-cell death effect of zinc, we incubated early embryos with increased concentrations of zinc sulfate. Zinc supplementation inhibited developmental PCD and led to suppression of terminal differentiation and elimination of the embryo suspensors, causing inhibition of embryo maturation. Our data demonstrate that perturbation of zinc homeostasis disrupts the balance between cell proliferation and PCD required for plant embryogenesis. This establishes zinc as an important cue governing cell fate decisions in plants. 3acell death 3azinc sulfate 3aDNA fragmentation 3aanimals 3azinc 3aPicea abies 3anuclear genome 3ahomeostasis 3aplasma membrane 3aembryogenesis 3acell proliferation 3asomatic embryos 0aplants1 avon Arnold, Sara1 aBozhkov, Peter V.0 tPlant physiology.g2008 July, v. 147, no. 3 p.1158-1167dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle02367naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001600157245012900173300001600302500002400318500001500342520101900357650002101376650001801397650002701415650001601442650001901458650000901477650001501486650003201501653001601533653001901549700001701568700001501585700001401600700001601614700001501630773009801645852000901743856008801752930003301840945002501873946001101898655001201909IND4404685620221118062536.0080421e20080509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440468562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5021 aJuárez, M.10aComparison of four extraction/methylation analytical methods to measure fatty acid composition by gas chromatography in meat  ap. 327-332.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFour different extraction-derivatization methods commonly used for fatty acid analysis in meat (in situ or one-step method, saponification method, classic method and a combination of classic extraction and saponification derivatization) were tested. The in situ method had low recovery and variation. The saponification method showed the best balance between recovery, precision, repeatability and reproducibility. The classic method had high recovery and acceptable variation values, except for the polyunsaturated fatty acids, showing higher variation than the former methods. The combination of extraction and methylation steps had great recovery values, but the precision, repeatability and reproducibility were not acceptable. Therefore the saponification method would be more convenient for polyunsaturated fatty acid analysis, whereas the in situ method would be an alternative for fast analysis. However the classic method would be the method of choice for the determination of the different lipid classes. 3ameat composition 3afood analysis 3afatty acid composition 3amethylation 3asaponification 3abeef 3aextraction 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 0afatty acids 0aderivatization1 aPolvillo, O.1 aContò, M.1 aFicco, A.1 aBallico, S.1 aFailla, S.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 May 9, v. 1190, no. 1-2 p.327-332dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.03.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080606b20080704c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/06/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03279naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100001700176245011900193300001400312500002400326500001500350520169300365650003402058650001402092650002502106650001802131650004002149650004102189650004102230650003602271650003602307650002402343653002702367653005402394700001902448700001902467700002402486700002502510773009602535852000902631856008802640930003302728945002502761946001102786655001202797IND4404687120221118062717.0080421e20080509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440468712DNAL7 a183749322pmid7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.02.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aJerz, Gerold10aSeparation of betalains from berries of Phytolacca americana by ion-pair high-speed counter-current chromatography  ap. 63-73.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe first preparative fractionation of betalain pigments by means of ion-pair high-speed counter-current chromatography (IP-HSCCC) from berry extracts of Phytolacca americana (Phytolaccaceae) is presented. A novel HSCCC solvent system consisting of 1-butanol-acetonitrile-water (5:1:6, v/v/v) was applied using ion-pair forming trifluoroacetic acid at low concentration (0.7%, v/v). Affinity of polar betacyanins and betaxanthins to the organic stationary phase of the biphasic HSCCC solvent mixture was considerably improved. Partitioning coefficient values and influence of increasing trifluoroacetic acid additions to the biphasic solvent mixture were measured for all identified betacyanins and betaxanthins. Gentle separation by IP-HSCCC of the injected pigment extract (900mg) yielded sufficient amounts of the principal pigments 15S-betanin/15R-isobetanin. The pure epimers separated by C₁₈-HPLC were immediately studied by one- and two-dimensional NMR. In the recovered fractions, minor concentrated betacyanins and betaxanthins were significantly enriched by IP-HSCCC and were detected for the first time in the extracts of P. americana. IP-HSCCC and C₁₈-HPLC were shown to be complementary techniques in the isolation procedure of recovering minor concentrated, highly polar and chemically instable betacyanins and betaxanthin from complex plant matrices. Altogether, identification of 17 betalains was achieved by HPLC-diode array detection-electrospray ionization MS/MS in the HSCCC fractions with their respective isomers, also resulting in the tentative elucidation of betacyanins with novel salicylic acid substitution pattern in the berry extracts of P. americana. 3acountercurrent chromatography 3abetalains 3aPhytolacca americana 3afractionation 2aBetalainsxisolation & purification 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCountercurrent Distributionxmethods 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aPhytolacca americanaxchemistry 2aReference Standards 0afruits (plant anatomy) 0aion-pair high-speed countercurrent chromatography1 aSkotzki, Tanja1 aFiege, Kathrin1 aWinterhalter, Peter1 aWybraniec, Sławomir0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 May 9, v. 1190, no. 1-2 p.63-73dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.02.0933Available from publisher's Web site  a20080606b20080704c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/06/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02441naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100002900158245009500187300001600282500002400298520115700322650001301479650002501492650002201517650002301539650002301562650001501585650001501600650001501615650002301630650001701653651001101670653002001681653002901701700001701730773009301747852000901840856008901849930003301938945002501971946001101996655001202007IND4404687920221118062610.0080421e20080530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440468792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP2001 aCarrera-Hernández, J.J.10aSpatio-temporal analysis of potential aquifer recharge: Application to the Basin of Mexico  ap. 228-246.  aIncludes references  aRegional estimates of aquifer recharge are needed in data-scarce regions such as the Basin of Mexico, where nearly 20 million people are located and where the Basin's aquifer system represents the main water source. In order to develop the spatio-temporal estimates of aquifer recharge and to analyze to what extent urban growth has affected aquifer recharge, this work presents a daily soil water balance which uses different vegetation and soil types as well as the effect of topography on climatological variables and evapotranspiration. The soil water balance was applied on a daily time step in the Basin of Mexico for the period 1975-1986, obtaining an annually-lumped potential recharge flow of 10.9-23.8m³/s (35.9-78.1mm) in the entire Basin, while the monthly values for the year with the largest lumped recharge value (1981=78.1mm) range from 1m³/s (0.3mm) in December to 87.9m³/s (23.7mm) in June. As aquifer recharge in the Basin mainly occurs by subsurface flow from its enclosing mountains as Mountain Block Recharge, urban growth has had a minimal impact on aquifer recharge, although it has diminished recharge in the alluvial plain. 3aaquifers 3agroundwater recharge 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3asoil water balance 3avegetation 3asoil types 3atopography 3aevapotranspiration 3aurbanization 3aMexico 0aBasin of Mexico 0adaily soil water balance1 aGaskin, S.J.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 May 30, v. 353, no. 3-4 p.228-246dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.02.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20081110b20081206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/11/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02754naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002000167245013400187300001600321500002400337500001500361520120100376650003701577650001501614650002201629650001601651650002101667650001801688650001301706650002201719653002401741653002901765653002401794653002401818653001901842653004401861653001701905653002401922700002001946700002201966773009301988852000902081856008902090930003302179945002502212946001102237655001202248IND4404688120221118062621.0080421e20080530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440468812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aMathon, Bree R.10aTransmissivity and storage coefficient estimation by coupling the Cooper-Jacob method and modified fuzzy least-squares regression  ap. 267-274.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTraditionally the Cooper-Jacob equation is used to determine the transmissivity and the storage coefficient for an aquifer using pump test results. This model, however, is a simplified version of the actual subsurface and does not allow for analysis of the uncertainty that comes from a lack of knowledge about the heterogeneity of the environment under investigation. In this paper, a modified fuzzy least-squares regression (MFLSR) method is developed that uses imprecise pump test data to obtain fuzzy intercept and slope values which are then used in the Cooper-Jacob method. Fuzzy membership functions for the transmissivity and the storage coefficient are then calculated using the extension principle. The supports of the fuzzy membership functions incorporate the transmissivity and storage coefficient values that would be obtained using ordinary least-squares regression and the Cooper-Jacob method. The MFLSR coupled with the Cooper-Jacob method allows the analyst to ascertain the uncertainty that is inherent in the estimated parameters obtained using the simplified Cooper-Jacob method and data that are uncertain due to lack of knowledge regarding the heterogeneity of the aquifer. 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3aestimation 3asimulation models 3afuzzy logic 3agroundwater flow 3aleast squares 3aaquifers 3ahydrologic models 0amathematical models 0aleast squares regression 0aCooper-Jacob method 0aregression analysis 0atransmissivity 0amodified fuzzy least-squares regression 0ahydrogeology 0astorage coefficient1 aOzbek, Metin M.1 aPinder, George F.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 May 30, v. 353, no. 3-4 p.267-274dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.02.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20081110b20081206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/11/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03490naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100002400188245011000212300001200322500002400334500001500358520108200373650003101455650002801486650001901514650003301533650001901566650001901585650001001604650001101614650001001625650002301635650001701658650002001675650001901695650002101714650001801735650002801753650001201781650002901793650002801822650005001850650001401900650005001914650002001964650002001984650007902004650004902083650003202132650001702164650003002181650002002211650005102231651001102282651002602293653001702319653001502336653003702351700002202388700002102410700002102431773009902452852000902551856009102560930003302651945002502684946001102709655001202720IND4404688820221118062516.0080421e20080615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440468882DNAL7 a182915412pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2008.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8001 aAl-Majali, Ahmad M.10aSeroprevalence of, and risk factors for, peste des petits ruminants in sheep and goats in Northern Jordan  ap. 1-8.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPeste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an economically important disease that affect sheep and goat industry in Asia and Africa.

Serum samples from 929 and 400 sheep and goats, respectively, corresponding to 122 sheep flock and 60 goats flock were collected. Seroprevalence was determined using PPR competitive ELISA. Health status and management information were collected using a semi-structured pre-tested questionnaire. The individual true prevalence of PPR in sheep and goats was 29 and 49%, respectively. The flock level true prevalence of PPR was 60 and 74% in sheep and goats, respectively. In both sheep and goat flocks, large flock size, visiting live animals market and inadequate veterinary services were identified as risk factors for PPR seropositivity. Mixed (sheep and goats) raising was identified as a risk factor for PPR seropositivity in sheep flocks only. 3apeste des petits ruminants 3aepidemiological studies 3aquestionnaires 3aSmall ruminant morbillivirus 3aseroprevalence 3ablood sampling 3asheep 3aflocks 3agoats 3adisease prevalence 3arisk factors 3arisk assessment 3asheep diseases 3aanimal transport 3agoat diseases 3across-sectional studies 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aGeography 2aGoat Diseasesxbloodxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aGoatsxvirology 2aLogistic Models 2aPeste-des-Petits-Ruminantsxbloodxepidemiologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aPeste-des-petits-ruminants virusximmunology 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 2aSheepxvirology 2aSheep Diseasesxbloodxepidemiologyxvirology. 3aJordan 0aJordanxepidemiology. 0amixed flocks 0aflock size 0aPeste-des-petits-ruminants virus1 aHussain, Nazmi O.1 aAmarin, Nadim M.1 aMajok, Aggrey A.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2008 June 15, v. 85, no. 1-2 p.1-8dElsevierx0167-58777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2008.01.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080821b20080905c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/08/13  aNon-US 7aarticle04177naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002100167245010100188300001600289500002400305500001500329520264200344650002302986650002203009650001603031650002103047650001503068650002403083650001903107650001103126650001303137650002203150650001003172651001103182653002403193653002503217653001603242653001803258700001803276700001703294700001703311700002703328700002003355773009303375852000903468856008903477930003303566945002503599946001103624655001203635IND4404688520221118062530.0080421e20080530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440468852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aMontzka, Carsten10aModelling the water balance of a mesoscale catchment basin using remotely sensed land cover data  ap. 322-334.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHydrological modelling of mesoscale catchments is often adversely affected by a lack of adequate information about specific site conditions. In particular, digital land cover data are available from data sets which were acquired on a European or a national scale. These data sets do not only exhibit a restricted spatial resolution but also a differentiation of crops and impervious areas which is not appropriate to the needs of mesoscale hydrological models. In this paper, the impact of remote sensing data on the reliability of a water balance model is investigated and compared to model results determined on the basis of CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) Land Cover as a reference. The aim is to quantify the improved model performance achieved by an enhanced land cover representation and corresponding model modifications. Making use of medium resolution satellite imagery from SPOT, LANDSAT ETM+ and ASTER, detailed information on land cover, especially agricultural crops and impervious surfaces, was extracted over a 5-year period (2000-2004). Crop-specific evapotranspiration coefficients were derived by using remote sensing data to replace grass reference evapotranspiration necessitated by the use of CORINE land cover for rural areas. For regions classified as settlement or industrial areas, degrees of imperviousness were derived. The data were incorporated into the hydrological model GROWA (large-scale water balance model), which uses an empirical approach combining distributed meteorological data with distributed site parameters to calculate the annual runoff components. Using satellite imagery in combination with runoff data from gauging stations for the years 2000-2004, the actual evapotranspiration calculation in GROWA was methodologically extended by including empirical crop coefficients for actual evapotranspiration calculations. While GROWA originally treated agricultural areas as homogeneous, now a consideration and differentiation of the main crops is possible. The accuracy was determined by runoff measurements from gauging stations. Differences in water balances resulting from the use of remote sensing data as opposed to CORINE were analysed in this study using a representative subcatchment. Resulting Nash-Sutcliff model efficiencies improved from 0.372 to 0.775 and indicate that the enhanced model can produce thematically more accurate and spatially more detailed local water balances. However, the proposed model enhancements by satellite imagery have not exhausted the full potential of water balance modelling, for which a higher temporal resolution is required. 3aevapotranspiration 3aagricultural land 3aurban areas 3avegetation cover 3awatersheds 3awatershed hydrology 3aremote sensing 3arunoff 3aland use 3ahydrologic models 3acrops 3aEurope 0aimpervious surfaces 0awater balance models 0aGROWA model 0awater balance1 aCanty, Morton1 aKunkel, Ralf1 aMenz, Gunter1 aVereecken, H.q(Harry)1 aWendland, Frank0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 May 30, v. 353, no. 3-4 p.322-334dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.02.0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20081110b20081206c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/11/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03839naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100002200188245014800210300001400358500002400372500001500396520150700411650001301918650003001931650001901961650002301980650001502003650002302018650001402041650002902055650001702084650001602101650001902117650003802136650001902174650002102193650001402214650002102228650001202249650002902261650001102290650004202301650002302343650005002366650001102416650006502427650008702492650000902579650001702588650003102605651001002636651002502646653002502671700002102696700002202717700002002739700002002759700002402779700002002803773010102823852000902924856009102933930003303024945002503057946001103082655001203093IND4404689720221118062623.0080421e20080615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440468972DNAL7 a183046632pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2008.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8101 aNardelli, Stefano10aDynamics of infection and immunity in a dairy cattle population undergoing an eradication programme for Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR)  ap. 68-80.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSeveral countries within the European Union (EU) have successfully eradicated Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), while others (e.g. Germany) are making efforts to achieve IBR-free status. EU member states IBR eradication programmes must meet Community legislation requirements that ban breeding farms from purchasing positive animals, from using whole-virus IBR vaccines, and from inseminating cows with semen from positive bulls. A follow-up study from 2002 to 2005 was carried out in the province of Trento (Italy), where a compulsory programme for IBR eradication was started in 1998. IBR outbreaks (identified on the basis of seroconversion of sentinel animals) were concentrated in larger positive herds. A higher incidence was recorded between 2003 and 2004. An association between markedly high temperatures in the summer of 2003 and virus reactivation has been suggested but is yet to be confirmed. The practice of driving cattle to common alpine pastures for the summer season did not play a significant epidemiological role in IBR transmission. Premising that only seronegative animals are allowed to enter dairy farms, animal movement increases the infection risk to a moderate extent. The long-term persistence of IBR antibodies was more pronounced in animals positive for antibodies to the glycoprotein E (gE). Scattered seroconversions, occurring mostly in positive herds, require careful interpretation in order to avoid overestimating the incidence of the infection at herd level. 3aimmunity 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3aseroprevalence 3adisease prevalence 3aantibodies 3aantibody detection 3aherd size 3adisease control programs 3adairy cattle 3aherd health 3aEuropean Union 3ainfectious bovine rhinotracheitis 3aseroconversion 3aanimal transport 3ainfection 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aCattle 2aCommunicable Disease Controlxmethods 2aDatabases, Factual 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aFemale 2aHerpesvirus 1, Bovineximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aInfectious Bovine Rhinotracheitisxepidemiologyximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aMale 2aRisk Factors 2aViral Proteinsximmunology 3aItaly 0aItalyxepidemiology. 0aBovine herpesvirus 11 aFarina, Giovanni1 aLucchini, Rosaria1 aValorz, Claudio1 aMoresco, Angela1 aDal Zotto, Riccardo1 aCostanzi, Carlo0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2008 June 15, v. 85, no. 1-2 p.68-80dElsevierx0167-58777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2008.01.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20080821b20080905c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/08/13  aNon-US 7aarticle04114naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100001600197245010200213300001400315500002400329500001500353520167200368650002102040650000902061650001902070650002702089650002302116650001502139650001802154650002402172650001102196650001302207650001802220650002102238650001202259650002202271650002102293650001202314650003002326650001802356650002802374650006702402650002802469650005002497650001102547650003002558650004202588650001102630650001402641650000902655650001902664650001502683650003202698650001002730650005602740650003002796651001302826651002802839653003402867653002002901700001602921700001802937700001802955700002002973700002102993773010103014852000903115856009103124930003303215945002503248946001103273655001203284IND4404689620221118062547.0080421e20080615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440468962DNAL7 a182433752pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2007.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL822 0aQ202 0aX3801 aNgowi, H.A.12aA health-education intervention trial to reduce porcine cysticercosis in Mbulu District, Tanzania  ap. 52-67.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe conducted a randomised community controlled trial to estimate the effectiveness of health and pig-management education intervention in reducing the incidence rate of porcine cysticercosis caused by Taenia solium in Mbulu District, northern Tanzania, between April 2002 and July 2004. We included a random sample of 827 pig-keeping households from 42 randomly selected villages in our 27-month study. We collected baseline data on the prevalence of porcine cysticercosis based on lingual examination of live pigs, and pig-management and sanitation knowledge and practices based on questionnaire interviews and observations. We allocated 21 of the villages to the health-education intervention, developed with community participation; we used stratified randomisation to balance the village-level baseline prevalence of porcine cysticercosis. From July 2003 to March 2004 following the intervention, we gave each participant household a sentinel piglet to raise (the timing was balanced between the intervention groups). Knowledge about the transmission and prevention of porcine cysticercosis was improved >42% in both groups when measured 10-12 months post-intervention. There was no improvement in observed practices in either group throughout the study period. However, the intervention had a significant reduction in the reported cases of household consumption of infected pork (a reduction by 20%). The intervention was associated with a considerable decrease in the incidence rate of porcine cysticercosis (incidence rate ratio 0.57) as measured by antigen-ELISA in sentinel pigs. Public education could lead to a reduction of the risk of infection in humans. 3ahealth education 3apork 3aswine diseases 3ahuman-animal relations 3afood contamination 3asanitation 3aTaenia solium 3atraditional farming 3atongue 3avillages 3acysticercosis 3asentinel animals 3apiglets 3adisease incidence 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Helminthxblood 2aBayes Theorem 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aCysticercosisxepidemiologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aCysticercusximmunology 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aFemale 2aHealth Educationxmethods 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aMale 2aPilot Projects 2aPrevalence 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aTaenia soliumximmunology 3aTanzania 0aTanzaniaxepidemiology. 0ahealth education intervention 0adisease control1 aCarabin, H.1 aKassuku, A.A.1 aMlozi, M.R.S.1 aMlangwa, J.E.D.1 aWillingham, A.L.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2008 June 15, v. 85, no. 1-2 p.52-67dElsevierx0167-58777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2007.12.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20080821b20080905c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/08/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02352naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155100002200164245007000186300001600256500002400272500001500296520098100311650001901292650002801311650002401339650001101363650001601374650001201390650002301402650002201425650001501447651001301462653002901475653002401504653001801528653001001546700002001556700002201576773010801598852000901706856008601715930003301801945002501834946001101859655001201870IND4404691520221118062605.0080421e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440469152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2008.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP050 0aF1201 aPerkins, Allan J.10aWinter bird use of seed-rich habitats in agri-environment schemes  ap. 189-194.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo assess the effectiveness of over-winter seed provision by agri-environment schemes, bird use of patches of seed-bearing crops was compared with that of other seed-rich habitats on 53 farms in eastern Scotland over three winters. Seed-bearing crops were the most frequently selected habitat, and held 28% of birds of the 10 species recorded. Outside schemes, cereal stubble was the most selected habitat and held 44% of birds. For nine species, seed-bearing crops were used by more birds than expected from the area of crop available in at least one winter, and five species were more likely to occur in first-winter patches, reflecting a greater abundance of cereal grain than in second-winter patches. For cereal grain specialists such as buntings, sowing cereal-based crops annually would ensure that grain is available in each winter, whilst either a 1-year or a 2-year crop would be appropriate for finches that favour oilseeds, and species with a more generalist diet. 3aagroecosystems 3ainterspecific variation 3ahabitat preferences 3awinter 3agrain crops 3astubble 3aseasonal variation 3aspecies diversity 3awild birds 3aScotland 0aagri-environment schemes 0aspecies differences 0acrop residues 0acrops1 aMaggs, Hywel E.1 aWilson, Jeremy D.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2008 July, v. 126, no. 3-4 p.189-194dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2008.01.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20080716b20080801c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/07/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02224naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164100001200173245010800185300001600293500002400309500001500333520090000348650002901248650001301277650002901290650002301319650001501342650001301357650001301370650001501383651001001398653001501408653001001423700001301433700001901446700001701465773010801482852000901590856008601599930003301685945002501718946001101743655001201754IND4404691720221118062512.0080421e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440469172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2008.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB100 0aJ200 0aX1001 aWu, Wei10aAssessing effects of digital elevation model resolutions on soil-landscape correlations in a hilly area  ap. 209-216.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of different grid sizes of digital elevation models (DEMs) on the relationship between soil properties and terrain attributes was examined by comparing six DEMs (4, 6, 8, 10, 20 and 30m). The study site was representative of a broad region of hilly landscapes in the southwestern China. The results showed that elevation, topographic wetness index (TWI), slope and natural logarithm of specific catchment area (SCA) varied with DEM grid size in a relatively clear direction except aspect and plan curvature. Different soil-landscape relationships were found across various DEM resolutions. The observations from this study indicate that the most accurate predict model is not always produced by the highest resolution DEM. The knowledge of which DEM resolution produces an appropriate model for a particular landscape can be used as a guideline for optimizing field sample strategies. 3asoil chemical properties 3asampling 3adigital elevation models 3asoil water content 3awatersheds 3aaltitude 3aaccuracy 3aprediction 3aChina 0atopography 0aslope1 aFan, Yan1 aWang, Zhengyin1 aLiu, Hongbin0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2008 July, v. 126, no. 3-4 p.209-216dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2008.01.0263Available from publisher's Web site  a20080716b20080801c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/07/08  aNon-US 7aarticle04052naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164072000900173100002400182245014000206300001600346500002400362500001500386520243900401650001802840650002002858650001902878650002002897650002202917650001802939650001302957650001002970650001202980650002102992650001303013650002003026650002003046650002103066650001903087650001903106650001503125650001103140651002503151653001903176700001903195773010803214852000903322856008603331930003303417945002503450946001103475655001203486IND4404691620221118062514.0080421e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440469162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2008.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL100 0aJ500 0aF1301 aRobertson, Fiona A.10aPhosphorus and nitrogen in soil, plants, and overland flow from sheep-grazed pastures fertilized with different rates of superphosphate  ap. 195-208.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEutrophication of waterways through delivery of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) from farmland is a problem in many countries. Loss of nutrients from grazed grassland via overland flow is well demonstrated, but the sources of these nutrients and the processes controlling their mobilization into water are not well understood. Much of the nutrient loss in overland flow from grazed pastures may be due to generally increased fertility of the soil-plant system (i.e. background or 'systematic' nutrient loss) rather than to immediate loss after fertilizer application [Nash, D., Clemow, L., Hannah, M., Barlow, K., Gangaiya, P., 2005. Modelling phosphorus exports from rain-fed and irrigated pastures in southern Australia. Aust. J. Soil Res. 43, 745-755]. The main aim of this study was to measure the effects of long-term (25 years) superphosphate (Ca(H₂PO₄)₂ +2CaSO₄) fertilizer application (0-23kg/(hayear)) on P and N in soil, plants, and potential background P and N movement in overland flow (generated using a rainfall simulator) from sheep-grazed pastures in southern Australia. Measurements were taken in autumn, under dry soil conditions, and in winter, under wet soil conditions, 12 and 15 months after the last fertilizer applications, respectively. Superphosphate application caused a strong increase in plant P, soil total P, Olsen P, and Colwell P; and a weaker increase in plant N, soil total N, and inorganic N (ammonium and nitrate). Soil P and N were concentrated in the surface 25mm of soil. Soil water-extractable P, calcium chloride-extractable P, and calcium chloride organic P were in general only poorly associated with fertilizer application. The concentration of P and, to a lesser extent, the concentration of N in overland flow increased with increasing fertilizer application and showed strong seasonal differences (0.06-0.77mgP/L and 0.6-5.5mgN/L in autumn; 0.04-0.20mgP/L and 0.4-1.7mgN/L in winter). The P in overland flow was predominantly dissolved reactive P in autumn and particulate P in winter. The N in overland flow contained significant proportions of dissolved organic N, dissolved inorganic N (ammonium and nitrate), and particulate N. The concentrations of P and N in overland flow usually exceeded State water quality targets (<0.04mgP/L and <0.90mgN/L), suggesting that background losses of nutrients from these pasture systems could contribute to the eutrophication of waterways. 3aoverland flow 3awater pollution 3asuperphosphate 3aplant nutrition 3aammonium nitrogen 3awater quality 3apastures 3asheep 3agrazing 3afertilizer rates 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3anutritive value 3anitrate nitrogen 3asoil fertility 3aeutrophication 3aphosphorus 3arunoff 3aVictoria (Australia) 0aforage quality1 aNash, David M.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2008 July, v. 126, no. 3-4 p.195-208dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2008.01.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20080716b20080801c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/07/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02289naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001200167245006800179300001600247500002400263520107300287650001301360650001701373650001801390650002501408650001901433650002201452653001601474653002301490700001401513700001101527700001301538700001401551700001401565773010901579852000901688856008901697930003301786945002501819946001101844655001201855IND4404657520221118062538.0080421e20080704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440465752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS100 0aM1101 aCui, Z.10aIonic interactions between sulfuric acid and chitosan membranes  ap. 111-116.  aIncludes references  aTreatment of chitosan with crosslinking agents is a common strategy for improving the performance of chitosan membranes in industrial applications. The preparation of sulfuric acid-crosslinked chitosan membranes was studied by infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and X-ray diffraction, to better understand the mechanism of sulfuric acid treatment. The results indicated that first H2SO4 protonated the chitosan amine groups, then the SO₄²- anions slowly interacted with chitosan NH3+ groups to form ionic bridges between the polymer chains. Kinetic analysis showed that protonation was the rate-limiting factor in the adsorption of sulfuric acid by the membrane. The strong interactions between chitosan NH3+ groups and SO₄²- anions were related to changes in membrane crystallinity. Protonation of 10-μm-thick chitosan membranes by 0.01 M sulfuric acid was accomplished within 5 min and complete ionic crosslinking required 30 min. The results of this study suggest better guidelines for treating chitosan membranes with divalent and multivalent acids. 3achitosan 3acrosslinking 3asulfuric acid 3aartificial membranes 3aacid treatment 3acrystal structure 0aprotonation 0aionic crosslinking1 aXiang, Y.1 aSi, J.1 aYang, M.1 aZhang, Q.1 aZhang, T.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2008 July 4, v. 73, no. 1 p.111-116dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.11.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20080520b20080606c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/05/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02558naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001200176245011700188300001500305500002400320500001500344520120700359650001301566650001901579650001601598650002301614650001401637653002801651653002501679653005301704653001601757700001301773700001401786700001301800700001201813773010801825852000901933856008901942930003302031945002502064946001102089655001202100IND4404656920221118062551.0080421e20080704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440465692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS100 0aM110 0aX3001 aHua, D.12aA novel method of controlled grafting modification of chitosan via RAFT polymerization using chitosan-RAFT agent  ap. 98-104.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe controlled grafting modification of chitosan has first been achieved by RAFT polymerization using chitosan-RAFT agent. The chitosan was first modified with S-1-dodecyl-S'-(*,*'-dimethyl-*''-acetic acid)trithiocarbonate (DDACT) to serve as RAFT agent, and then the controlled grafting polymerization of acrylic acid were performed. The resultant copolymers were characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD), high performance particle sizer (HPPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results indicate that the graft copolymers were successfully synthesized and that the grafting polymerization was a first-order reaction with respect to monomer concentration. The size distribution of chitosan-g-PAA in ethanol is very narrow, which may be associated with the grafting density and the “well-defined” PAAs onto chitosan from RAFT polymerization. TEM shows chitosan-g-PAA in dilute ethanol dispersions is roughly 80 nm in size with some aggregation. This work provides a new method to prepare chitosan grafting copolymers with controlled molecular weights and “well-defined” structures. 3achitosan 3apolymerization 3amethodology 3acomposite polymers 3asynthesis 0acontrolled modification 0agraft polymerization 0areversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer 0anew methods1 aTang, J.1 aCheng, J.1 aDeng, W.1 aZhu, X.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2008 July 4, v. 73, no. 1 p.98-104dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.11.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20080520b20080606c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/05/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03060naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100002200176245011200198300001600310500002400326500001500350520106700365650002601432650002301458650002101481650001201502650002201514650002301536650002201559650000701581650002801588650002001616650002001636650001801656650001201674650003801686650007101724650003901795650004701834650003401881650007501915650002101990650003702011650003802048653001702086653003502103700001702138700002302155773011402178852000902292856008802301930003302389945002502422946001102447655001202458IND4404676020221118062618.0080421e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440467602DNAL7 a180543552pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2007.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8231 aGreenwell, Pamela10aPurification and analysis of DNases of Tritrichomonas foetus: Evidence that these enzymes are glycoproteins  ap. 749-756.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTritrichomonas foetus is the causative agent of trichomoniasis. In cattle, infection results in economic losses to the beef and dairy industries due to abortion and infertility. Soluble DNases of T. foetus that play a role in pathogenesis and are potential therapeutic targets, were extracted and purified utilising lectin affinity chromatography. The DNases were bound to and eluted from Concanavalin A (Con A)-sepharose indicating that they are glycoproteins with α-linked mannose or glucose residues. The nature of the glycans carried on the eluted proteins in the fraction containing DNase activity was assessed using an enzyme-linked lectin assay. The lectin binding studies predict the presence of both N- and O-type glycans. Manganese was a potent (33%) activator of the DNase(s) whereas zinc inhibited enzyme activity by approximately 66%. The DNase(s) had a pH optimum of 4 and a molecular weight of 160kDa. The DNase(s) were able to completely degrade DNA from animal, plant, fungal, yeast and bacterial sources, but did not significantly degrade RNA. 3aTritrichomonas foetus 3adeoxyribonucleases 3amolecular weight 3alectins 3achemical analysis 3abinding properties 3aenzyme inhibitors 3apH 3aaffinity chromatography 3apolysaccharides 3aenzyme activity 3aglycoproteins 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, Affinityxmethods 2aDeoxyribonucleasesxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aElectrophoresis, Agar Gelxmethods 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethods 2aLectinsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aMolecular Weight 2aSepharosexanalogs & derivatives 2aTritrichomonas foetusxenzymology 0apurification 0alectin affinity chromatography1 aYounes, Maha1 aRughooputh, Sanjiv0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2008 June, v. 38, no. 7 p.749-756dElsevier Sciencex0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2007.10.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20090122b20090206c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/01/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03489naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194100002400203245008900227300001600316500002400332500001500356520137800371650002001749650001401769650003201783650002001815650001801835650001101853650002001864650001501884650002401899650002701923650001401950650001701964650001201981650002301993650002402016650001102040650003102051650002202082650002502104650002602129650002602155650002402181650001702205650002402222653001702246653002002263653002002283653002602303653001902329653002302348653002302371653001402394653001402408653002002422700002102442773011402463852000902577856008802586930003302674945002502707946001102732655001202743IND4404676520221118062532.0080421e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440467652DNAL7 a181647092pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2007.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL001 0aL823 0aL8221 aRutrecht, Samina T.14aThe life-history impact and implications of multiple parasites for bumble bee queens  ap. 799-808.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMost studies of the consequences of parasitism on fitness have examined single host-parasite systems. However, parasitological studies show that most hosts are constantly challenged by a complex parasite community. Thus, neither the response of hosts to individual parasite species nor the individual impact of these parasite species is likely to be as unconstrained as studies of single host-parasite systems might suggest. In this study, the parasite community structure in spring queens of the common European bumble bee, Bombus pratorum, was assessed. By capturing queens and allowing them to rear colonies in the laboratory, the relative impact of different parasite species on fitness across the annual host life-cycle could be examined. Of 160 queens, 67% were parasitised by one or more members of a five-species parasite community. The impact of parasites varied from being highly virulent to undetectable under benign laboratory conditions. The majority of multi-parasite infections involved a high impact parasite, which resulted in the removal of associated parasites from the host population. This study shows that, whilst multiple infections occur within individual hosts, most parasites act individually on their hosts. However, multiple parasite species in the host population may constrain the host population's ability to adapt to single parasite species. 3ainsect colonies 3aparasites 3ahost-parasite relationships 3amultiparasitism 3aqueen insects 3aBombus 3aCrithidia bombi 3aprevalence 3ainsect reproduction 3alife cycle (organisms) 3amortality 3aSphaerularia 2aAnimals 2aBeesxparasitology 2aDipteraxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aNematodaxphysiology 2aParasitesxphysiology 2aParasitologyxmethods 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aReproduction 2aSpecies Specificity 0alife history 0acolony founding 0aBombus pratorum 0aLocustacaris buchneri 0acolony fitness 0aSphaerularia bombi 0aparasite community 0aSyntretus 0aCrithidia 0aApicystis bombi1 aBrown, Mark J.F.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2008 June, v. 38, no. 7 p.799-808dElsevier Sciencex0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2007.11.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090122b20090206c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/01/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02792naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001800166245013300184300001600317500016200333500002400495500001500519520118100534650002101715650001901736650001301755650002601768650002201794650002801816650002301844650002101867653001701888653002801905653002901933653002801962700001801990700002002008700001802028773009802046852000902144856008802153930003302241945002502274946001102299655001202310IND4404681520221118062535.0080421e20080502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440468152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2007.11.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aF6001 aNa, Yun-Cheol10aStructural analysis of platycosides in Platycodi Radix by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 467-475.  aPaper presented at the 31st International Symposium on High Performance Liquid Phase Separations and Related Techniques held Jun 17-21, 2007, Ghent, Belgium.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPlatycosides extracted from Platycodi Radix were analyzed by HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization multistage tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS n ). Predominant [M +Na]⁺ ions in positive mode and [M -H]⁻ ions in negative mode in the direct ESI-MS spectra of extract provided information on molecular weights, but minor components and isomers could not be discriminated. However, combining HPLC and ESI-MS n , allowed eleven platycosides, including four acetylated platycodin isomers and two prosapogenines to be analyzed. During MS² analysis conducted to elucidate the structures of platycosides, fragment ions provided information on sugar moieties attached at C-28 of triterpene structure of the platycosides. Glycosidic bond cleavages at C-3 were revealed by fragment ions in MS³ spectra. Some characteristic fragment ions not related to sugar bond cleavage revealed that an esterified triterpene is linked to sugars at C-28. The only sugar ring-cross cleavage corresponding to 90Da in the negative MS² spectrum took place at an arabinosyl sugar moiety.

Expression of these two genes differs in that the Psagps2 gene shows comparatively higher expression in seeds relative to its expression in other tissues. Psagps2 expression also peaks midway through seed development at a time in which Psagps1 transcripts are still accumulating. The third cDNA isolated (Psagpl1) encodes the large subunit of ADPG-PPase. It shows greater selectivity in expression than either of the small subunit clones. It is highly expressed in sink organs (seed, pod, and seed coat) and undetectable in leaves. 3amessenger RNA 3atesta 3acomplementary DNA 3aseed development 3acotyledons 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aPisum sativum 3aenzyme activity 3apods 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCotyledonxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Complementaryxbiosynthesisxisolation & purification. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGlucose-1-Phosphate Adenylyltransferase 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleotidyltransferasesxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPeasxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSeedsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology 0akinases 0acloning 0aseeds 0agenbank/x96765 0aplant anatomy 0agenbank/x96764 0agenbank/x96766 0amolecular sequence data1 aPenton, A.1 aDunsmuir, P.1 aDooner, H.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1997 Feb., v. 33, no. 3 p.431-444x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02934naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002100141245010400162300001600266520170500282650003301987650001102020650001602031650001802047650001102065650002102076650001402097650002302111650001102134650001102145650001102156651001102167651001202178651001002190651001102200651001902211700001502230700001302245773009602258852000902354856008102363939003302444946001102477655001202488IND4457276120221118062221.0110429e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445727612DNAL7 a10.1038/ejcn.2010.2752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrichterborn, J.10aFine bakery wares with label claims in Europe and their categorisation by nutrient profiling models  ap. 307-312.  aBackground/Objectives: This study assesses a range of commercially available fine bakery wares with nutrition or health related on-pack communication against the criteria of selected nutrient profiling models. Different purposes of the application of nutrient profiles were considered, including front-of-pack signposting and the regulation of claims or advertising.Subjects/Methods: More than 200 commercially available fine bakery wares carrying claims were identified in Germany, France, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom and evaluated against five nutrient profiling models. All models were assessed regarding their underlying principles, generated results and inter-model agreement levels.Results: Total energy, saturated fatty acids, sugars, sodium and fibre were critical parameters for the categorisation of products. The Choices Programme was the most restrictive model in this category, while the Food and Drug Administration model allowed the highest number of products to qualify. According to all models, more savoury than sweet products met the criteria. On average, qualifying products contained less than half the amounts of nutrients to limit and more than double the amount of fibre compared with all the products in the study. None of the models had a significant impact on the average energy contents.Conclusions: Nutrient profiles can be applied to identify fine bakery wares with a significantly better nutritional composition than the average range of products positioned as healthier. Important parameters to take into account include energy, saturated fatty acids, sugars, sodium and fibre. Different criteria sets for subcategories of fine bakery wares do not seem necessary. 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aenergy 3afatty acids 3ahealth claims 3amodels 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3anutrition labeling 3asodium 3asugars 3asweets 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aSpain 3aSweden 3aUnited Kingdom1 aHarzer, G.1 aKunz, C.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2011 Mar., v. 65, no. 3 p.307-312x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2010.2753Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110429  aNon-US 7aarticle03057naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001800141245005900159300001600218520174000234650001601974650001601990650002202006650001502028650001602043650001002059650002202069650001702091650002302108650001802131650003502149650001202184650001402196650002202210650003502232650002902267650003202296650002502328700001602353773009602369852000902465856008102474939003302555946001102588655001202599IND4457275920221118062119.0110429e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445727592DNAL7 a10.1038/ejcn.2010.2772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStryjecki, C.10aFatty acid–gene interactions, adipokines and obesity  ap. 285-297.  aIt is now recognized that the low-grade inflammation observed with obesity is associated with the development of a wide range of downstream complications. As such, there is considerable interest in elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying the production of inflammatory molecules to improve the prevention and treatment of obesity and its co-morbidities. White adipose tissue is no longer considered a passive reservoir for storing lipids, but rather an important organ influencing energy metabolism, insulin sensitivity and inflammation by the secretion of proteins, commonly referred to as adipokines. Dysregulation of several adipokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and adiponectin, contributes to the low-grade inflammation that is a hallmark of obesity. Evidence now suggests that fatty acids represent a class of molecules that can modulate adipokine production, thereby influencing inflammatory status. Although the precise molecular mechanisms by which dietary fats regulate adipokine production remain unclear, recent findings indicate that diet–gene interactions may have an important role in the transcriptional and secretory regulation of adipokines. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes encoding TNF-α, IL-6 and adiponectin can modify circulating levels of these adipokines and, subsequently, obesity-related phenotypes. This genetic variation can also alter the influence of dietary fatty acids on adipokine production. Therefore, the current review will show that it is paramount to consider both genetic information and dietary fat intake to unravel the inter-individual variability in inflammatory response observed in intervention protocols targeting obesity. 3aadiponectin 3adietary fat 3aenergy metabolism 3afat intake 3afatty acids 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3ainterleukin-6 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3aobesity 3aphenotype 3aprotein secretion 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscription (genetics) 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3awhite adipose tissue1 aMutch, D.M.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2011 Mar., v. 65, no. 3 p.285-297x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2010.2773Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110429  aNon-US 7aarticle02921naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245014400144300001600288500001500304520080600319650001801125650001401143650002101157650002201178650001201200650001201212650002401224650002201248650002501270650002001295650002101315650004101336650001001377650002401387650003501411650002301446650003701469650004601506650003801552650009201590650002801682650002101710650007001731650003901801650004501840650002701885653001901912653001901931653001201950653002801962653002501990653004002015700001802055700002302073700001602096773008102112852000902193930003302202945001302235946001102248655001202259IND2057769520221118062231.0970617e199702  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205776952DNAL7 a90492742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorth, K.L.10aHMG-CoA reductase gene families that differentially accumulate transcripts in potato tubers are developmentally expressed in floral tissues  ap. 545-551.  a2019-12-05  aWe isolated two full-length cDNA clones encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) from potato (Solanum tuberosum) L. tubers. The clones, designated hmg2.2 and hmg3.3, are members of previously described gene subfamilies. In addition to being induced by arachidonic acid in tubers, hmg2.2 transcript accumulates developmentally in young flowers, and in mature sepals and ovaries, whereas transcript for hmg3.3 accumulates in mature petals and anthers. Our data suggest that members of specific HMGR-encoding gene subfamilies might be involved in both defense responses and flower development. Accumulation of different HMGR transcripts could provide some control of isoprenoid biosynthesis by producing isoforms specific for classes of end-products produced in particular tissues. 3amessenger RNA 3agynoecium 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3acorolla 3aanthers 3aopen reading frames 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3amultigene family 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductases 3acalyx 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArachidonic Acidxpharmacology 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxbiosynthesis 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aHydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductasesxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPlant Stemsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSolanum tuberosumxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aTranscription, Genetic 0agenbank/u51986 0agenbank/u51985 0aflowers 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase1 aStermer, B.A.1 aBhattaharyya, M.K.1 aDixon, R.A.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1997 Feb., v. 33, no. 3 p.545-551x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02731naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245012000144300001800264520083100282650002001113650002401133650001201157650002201169650001301191650001601204650002001220650002901240650001901269650002501288650002001313650001401333650002701347650001101374650002101385650003301406650002201439650004001461650002901501650002501530650003801555650003001593650002701623650004301650650002501693650002401718650002801742650002001770650002301790650002101813653002501834653001901859653001701878653002101895700001601916773008301932852000902015930003302024945001302057946001102070655001202081IND2059056920221118062224.0970819e199704  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205905692DNAL7 a91549912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFladung, M.10aExcision of the maize transposable element Ac in periclinal chimeric leaves of 35S-Ac-rolC transgenic aspen-Populus  ap. 1097-1103.  aThe transposable element Ac from maize, in combination with the phenotypic selectable marker rolC, was employed in transformation experiments of a hybrid aspen clone. A number of transgenic clones exhibited light-green sectors on green leaves. In vitro regeneration from leaves showing a high number of light-green spots resulted in R2 plants, which also showed light-green sectored leaves. However, only one out of 385 regenerated plants obtained showed green leaves. Both PCR and northern analysis indicated Ac excision and restoration of rolC expression. In Southern blot analysis of this green plant additional bands were observed as compared to the original R1 plant.

It is likely that this family of ZFP transcription factors will also be important in plants. We have used a PCR approach employing highly degenerate oligonucleotide primers to isolate several Arabidopsis genomic and cDNA clones encoding potential ZFPs. In addition we have used the sequence information from these clones to identify two ESTs as members of this family. Five two-fingered and one three-fingered ZFPs have been identified. Outside of the zinc finger regions, there is considerable sequence diversity, including the sequence and length of the interfinger region; the expression pattern of each gene is different. This is the first report of the isolation of a three-fingered plant C2H2 ZFP gene and we discuss its possible evolutionary origin from two-fingered ZFP genes. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscription factors 3amessenger RNA 3aregulator genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aopen reading frames 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenomic Library 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription Factor TFIIIA 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 2aZinc Fingers 0agenbank/x98677 0agenbank/x98675 0agenbank/x98674 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x98676 0agenbank/x98678 0agenbank/x98671 0agenbank/x98673 0agenbank/x98672 0agenbank/x98669 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/x986701 aMichael, A.J.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1997 Mar., v. 33, no. 4 p.615-624x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03025naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245009100146300001600237520134300253650002001596650000901616650001601625650002201641650001901663650002501682650001101707650002001718650001801738650001501756650001401771650001301785650002101798650003201819650002101851650001301872650001201885650003201897650005601929650002901985650004502014650004102059650004602100650002402146653001002170653001402180700001702194700001502211700001602226700001502242700001902257773008102276852000902357930003302366945001302399946001102412655001202423IND2059135620221118062132.0970825e199703  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205913562DNAL7 a91320542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerullo, J.M.10aDifferential accumulation of two glycine-rich proteins during cold-acclimation alfalfa  ap. 625-633.  aTwo mRNAs, MsaCiA and MsaCiB, encoding for proteins harboring glycine-rich motifs, accumulate in alfalfa during cold acclimation. Fusion polypeptides containing the amino acid sequences deduced from these mRNAs were produced in Escherichia coli and used to raise antibodies. Each antibody cross-reacted specifically with soluble polypeptides, MSACIA-32 and MSACIB, respectively. These polypeptides were detectable only in crowns of cold-acclimated plants, even though MsaCiA mRNA accumulated in both crowns and leaves during cold acclimation. The analysis of parietal proteins showed that several MSACIA-related proteins, with a molecular mass of 32, 41 and 68 kDa, did accumulate in leaf cell walls and one of 59 kDa crown cell walls. This diversity is most probably due to a tissue-specific maturation of MSACIA. A discrepancy was found between the time-course of accumulation of MSACIB and the one of the corresponding transcript. These results indicate that timing and localization of MSACIA and MSACIB expression are different, and suggest that this differential expression involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. Comparisons made among six cultivars of contrasting freezing tolerance suggest that low tolerance could be explained by failure to accumulate proteins like MSACIA and MSACIB at a sufficient level. 3aMedicago sativa 3acold 3aacclimation 3aprotein synthesis 3aplant proteins 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aleaves 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3acell walls 3acultivars 3afreezing 3awinter hardiness 2aAcclimatizationxphysiology 2aCold Temperature 2aFreezing 2aGlycine 2aMedicago sativaxphysiology 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsximmunology. 2aPlant Shootsxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxisolation & purification 2aRNA, Plantxisolation & purification 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aSpecies Specificity 0acrown 0atolerance1 aVezina, L.P.1 aRail, J.R.1 aLaberge, S.1 aNadeau, P.1 aCastonguay, Y.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1997 Mar., v. 33, no. 4 p.625-633x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02506naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245009100148300001600239500001500255520062700270650001800897650002200915650003000937650002000967650002300987650002801010650002501038650002001063650002201083650002501105650002101130650002601151650003401177650002401211650001801235650003301253650002001286650003401306650003001340650003601370650002801406650002901434650002901463650002901492650002501521650003401546653001501580653002301595653001901618653002801637653001901665653001901684700001801703773008101721852000901802930003301811945001301844946001101857655001201868IND2059137920221118062301.0970825e199703  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205913792DNAL7 a91320652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTruesdell, G.M.10aIsolation of pathogen/stress-inducible cDNAs from alfalfa by mRNA differential display  ap. 737-743.  a2019-12-05  aDifferential display of mRNA was used to isolate a full-length (SRG 1) and a partial (SRG2) alfalfa cDNA induced during infection with the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum trifolii.

SRG1 is a member of a gene family in alfalfa, which may also include the putative defense-related gene PR10. Unlike many defense-related genes described in similar systems, expression of SRG 1-like genes does not correlate with resistance to C. trifolii.

The chilling treatment strongly stimulated ACC oxidase activity, and to a lesser extent ACC synthase activity. At the same time, the levels of mRNAs hybridizing to ACC synthase and ACC oxidase probes increased dramatically. Fruit stored at 18 degrees C immediately after harvest did not exhibit any of these changes, while fruit that had been previously chilled exhibited a burst of ethylene production associated with high activity of ACC oxidase and ACC synthase upon rewarming. ACC oxidase mRNA strongly accumulated in rewarmed fruits, while ACC synthase mRNA level decreased. The chilling-induced accumulation of ACC synthase and ACC oxidase transcripts was strongly reduced when ethylene action was blocked during chilling with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP). Upon rewarming ACC synthase and ACC oxidase transcripts rapidly disappeared in 1-MCP-treated fruits. A five-week treatment of non-chilled fruits with the ethylene analog propylene led to increased expression of ACC oxidase and to ripening. However, ethylene synthesis, ACC synthase activity and ACC synthase mRNAs remained at very low level. Our data indicate that ACC synthase gene expression is regulated by ethylene only during, or after chilling treatment, while ACC oxidase gene expression can be induced separately by either chilling or ethylene. 3amessenger RNA 3aPyrus communis 3acomplementary DNA 3aaminocyclopropanecarboxylate oxidase 3acooling 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 3aethylene production 3aamino acid sequences 3apears 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3apostharvest physiology 3ametabolic inhibitors 2aAlkenesxpharmacology 2aAmino Acid Oxidoreductasesxbiosynthesis 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCold Temperature 2aCyclopropanesxpharmacology 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aEthylenesxbiosynthesis 2aFruitxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aLyasesxbiosynthesis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxbiosynthesis 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aRNA, Plantxanalysis 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0a1-methylcyclopropene 0agenbank/x87097 0alyases 0agenbank/x87112 0amolecular sequence data 0aoxygenases1 aTichit, L.1 aDao, P.1 aFillion, L.1 aNam, Y.W.1 aPech, J.C.1 aLatche, A.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1997 Mar., v. 33, no. 5 p.847-855x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03080naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245010800145300001600253500001500269520137600284650002501660650002201685650002401707650002501731650003401756650002101790650001201811650002401823650003901847650006901886650001801955650002301973650006101996650001702057650002802074650002102102650006702123650003002190650002702220653001202247653001902259653001702278653002802295653002502323700001702348700001502365773008002380852000902460930003302469945001302502946001102515655001202526IND2061578420221118062324.0980129e199705  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206157842DNAL7 a92078392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrankard, V.10aMolecular characterization of an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA coding for a monofunctional aspartate kinase  ap. 233-242.  a2019-12-05  aA cDNA clone encoding a monofunctional aspartate kinase (AK, ATP:L-aspartate 4-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.2.4) has been isolated from an Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension cDNA library using a homologous PCR fragment as hybridizing probe. Amplification of the PCR fragment was done using a degenerate primer designed from a conserved region between bacterial monofunctional AK sequences and a primer identical to a region of the A. thaliana bifunctional aspartate kinase-homoserine dehydrogenase (AK-HSDH). By comparing the deduced amino acid sequence of the fragment with the bacterial and yeast corresponding gene products, the highest identity score was found with the Escherichia coli AKIII enzyme that is feedback-inhibited by lysine (encoded by lysC). The absence of HSDH-encoding sequence at the COOH end of the peptide further implies that this new cDNA is a plant lysC homologue. The presence of two homologous genes in A. thaliana is supported by PCR product sequences, Southern blot analysis and by the independent cloning of the corresponding second cDNA (see Tang et al., Plant Molecular Biology 34, pp. 287-294 [this issue]). This work is the first report of cloning a plant putative lysine-sensitive monofunctional AK cDNA. The presence of at least two genes is discussed in relation to possible different physiological roles of their respective product. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acomplementary DNA 3aopen reading frames 3aamino acid sequences 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3amultigene family 3aintrons 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aAspartate Kinasexchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aGenes, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0akinases 0agenbank/x98873 0aak-lys1 gene 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aVauterin, M.1 aJacobs, M.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1997 May, v. 34, no. 2 p.233-242x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03941naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245015600146300001600302500006900318500001500387520162800402650001802030650001802048650002402066650002502090650002002115650002302135650002502158650004702183650002102230650002802251650004302279650002402322650001802346650002002364650004602384650003402430650005802464650005202522650006202574650005802636650002802694650002102722650004402743650002802787650002902815653001902844653001902863653001102882653001902893653002802912653002302940653001902963653001902982653001903001653001903020700001603039700001503055700001503070773008003085852000903165930003303174945001303207946001103220655001203231IND2061579020221118062406.0980129e199705  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206157902DNAL7 a92078432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOetiker, J.H.10aDifferential induction of seven 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase genes by elicitor in suspension cultures of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum)  ap. 275-286.  aThe accession number 496748 does not conform to standard format.  a2019-12-05  aThe key enzyme of ethylene biosynthesis, ACC synthase, is encoded by a multigene family. We describe three new DNA sequences encoding members of the ACC synthase family of the tomato. One of these sequences encodes a novel ACC synthase, LE-ACS6, which is phylogenetically related to the ACC syntheses LE-ACS1A and LE-ACS1B. Gene-specific probes for seven tomato ACC synthase genes were prepared. They were used for RNase protection assays to study the accumulation of ACC synthase transcripts in suspension-cultured tomato cells after the addition of an elicitor. The ACC synthase genes LE-ACS2, LE-ACS5 and LE-ACS6 were strongly induced by the elicitor. In contrast, the genes LE-ACS1B, LE-ACS3 and LE-ACS4 were constitutively expressed and LE-ACS1B was present at all times at a particularly high level. Thus, there are two groups of ACC synthase transcripts expressed in these cells, either elicitor-induced or constitutive. A transcript of LE-ACS1A was not detected. Despite the presence of LE-ACS1B, LE-ACS2, LE-ACS3, LE-ACS4 and LE-ACS5, there was only little ethylene produced in the absence of the elicitor. Increased ethylene production is usually correlated with the accumulation of ACC synthase transcripts, indicating that ethylene production is controlled via the transcriptional activation of ACC synthase genes. However, the abundance of several ACC synthase mRNAs studied was not strictly correlated with the rate of elicitor-induced ethylene production. Our data provide evidence that the activity of these ACC syntheses may not solely be controlled by the transcriptional activation of ACC synthase genes. 3amessenger RNA 3ayeast extract 3aethylene production 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3achromosome mapping 3anucleotide sequences 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 3amultigene family 3acell suspension culture 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCells, Cultured 2aEnzyme Inductionxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aFungal Proteinsxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aLyasesxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSolanum lycopersicumxcytologyxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aRibonucleasesxgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 0agenbank/u74459 0agenbank/u75692 0alyases 0agenbank/m38822 0amolecular sequence data 0agenetic regulation 0agenbank/u74461 0agenbank/u74458 0agenbank/u74462 0agenbank/u744601 aOlson, D.C.1 aShiu, O.Y.1 aYang, S.F.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1997 May, v. 34, no. 2 p.275-286x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01434naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005400128300001400182500009300196520038700289650001700676650002000693650004500713650002300758650002200781650001400803651001000817653002300827653001200850653002200862700001400884700001400898773008200912852000900994930003301003945001301036946001101049655001201060IND2062889720221118062244.0980403e199709  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206288972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshimura, A.10aLinkage map of phenotype and RFLP markers in rice  ap. 49-60.  aIn the special issue: Oryza : From molecule to plant / edited by T.

This results in the disappearance of a substantial number of local animal populations, and the consequent loss of their ability to adapt genetically to their local environments. A basic aim of conservation biology is to maintain genetic variability. This study characterizes and analyzes the genetic structure of a limited rare population, a local beef cattle breed from the Catalonian Pyrenees (Spain), Bruna dels Pirineus. Five hundred and forty-three individuals were analyzed for five polymorphic genetic loci. Animals were sorted according to two criteria: Region level (7 subpopulations) and Nucleus of Origin level (9 subpopulations). The genetic structures and relationships among these subpopulations are analyzed and principal migratory paths and rough estimates of inbreeding among the subpopulations are discussed. The migratory trend from the northwest (Pyrenean mountain areas) to the southeast (pre-Pyrenean areas) is confirmed. This breed exhibits genetic uniformity. The average genetic differentiation among subpopulations (Nucleus of Origin) was 1.6% (FST = 0.016; P < 0.001). The effective number of individuals exchanged between subpopulations (Nuclei) per generation (gene flow) is estimated to be 12.1. We propose the animals from Pyrenean mountain areas to be the nucleus of conservation and maintenance of genetic variability for this breed. This information could be integrated into the FAO Global Data Bank on Domestic Animal Diversity. 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3abeef cattle 3abreed differences 3adatabases 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ainbreeding 3aloci 3amigratory behavior 3awildlife management 3aSpain1 aPiedrafita, J.0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g1996 Sept., v. 24, no. 6 p.485-498x0305-19787nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle03032naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245008900186300001300275520151200288650001501800650001201815650001101827650001201838650001501850650002701865650000901892650003501901650001201936650001201948650001301960650002401973650001101997650002002008650002002028650001502048650000902063650002002072650003602092650002402128653002102152653001002173700001702183700001602200700002002216773010902236852000902345856009202354930003302446946001102479655001202490IND4400867620221118062045.0080203e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440086762DNAL7 a179565922pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2052.2007.01662.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStella, A.10aUse of linked loci as individuals or haplotypes for marker-assisted breed assignment  ap. 8-14.  aThe objective of this study was to use simulation to evaluate the benefits of considering haplotypes of loci when linked single nucleotide polymorphisms are used for breed assignment. Three breeds of 10 000 females each were simulated under eight scenarios that differed according to the number of generations separating the breeds, size of breed founder populations and recombination rate between linked loci. Molecular genotypes consisted of 20 groups of three linked loci each. Breed assignment was performed in the final generation and was based on the frequency method. Haplotypes were reconstructed using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Accuracy of breed assignment was based on the frequency of correct breed assignment. Assignment accuracy increased as more genotypes (loci or haplotypes) were considered and more animals were used to estimate genotypic frequencies within breed. For most scenarios, use of haplotypes yielded equal or greater accuracies than when loci were considered independent. The advantage of haplotypes tended to increase as linkage disequilibrium between adjacent loci increased. The greatest advantage for using haplotypes was observed when recombination rate was low (0.001), breeds were separated by few generations (100), and a relatively large number of founder animals (110) was used to form new breeds. In this situation, 90% accuracy of breed assignment was achieved using nine to 14 haplotypes (i.e. 27-42 loci) depending on breed, vs. 39-57 individual loci. 3aalgorithms 3aanimals 3abreeds 3afemales 3ahaplotypes 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aComputer Simulation 2aFemale 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Markers 2aHaplotypes 2aMale 2aModels, Genetic 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aSpecies Specificity 0abreed assignment 0alocus1 aPanzitta, F.1 aGandini, G.1 aBoettcher, P.J.0 tAnimal genetics.g2008 Feb., v. 39, no. 1 p.8-14dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0268-91467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2007.01662.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080203b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03243naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245012800168300001800296500002400314520201200338650002502350650001202375650001102387650002202398650001902420650000802439650000902447650001502456650002402471650002002495651001202515651001102527651001202538651002202550651001602572651001302588651001802601700001302619700002202632773008602654852000902740856004802749655001202797IND4385530720221118062115.0061126e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438553072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-006-0141-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen-Shlomo, Rachel10aPostglacial-period and Recent Invasions Shape the Population Genetics of Botryllid Ascidians along European Atlantic Coasts  ap. 1118-1127.  aIncludes references  aThe colonial urochordate Botryllus schlosseri is a sedentary species of Mediterranean origin that became cosmopolitan, probably because of postglacial-period dispersal and human-mediated invasions of colonies attached to ship hulls. Here we studied microsatellite allele diversity of Atlantic coast populations from an area ranging from European regions south of the last glacial front to regions that had been permanently ice-covered. Gene diversity levels varied dramatically among populations residing in areas subject to different glacial conditions. Five populations from the Iberian Peninsula, in an area south of the last glacial front, as well as two populations from presumed refugia in Brittany, expressed high gene diversity values (expected heterozygosity [He]: 0.76-0.80; average number of alleles per locus [A]: 7.25-8.75). Two populations inhabiting areas that experienced permafrost conditions (Helgoland Island, Germany, and Plymouth, England) had intermediate values (He: 0.40-0.42; A: 3.0-4.0), whereas the Auchenmalg, Scotland, population, from an area previously covered by ice, showed a remarkably low value (He: 0.17; A: 1.75). Therefore, most European populations of B. schlosseri mirrored the movement of the ice front in the last ice age. A second population from the area that was covered by permanent ice (Lossiemouth, Scotland), however, had a high He of 0.61 and an intermediate A of 3.67. Results were compared with recent invasions (populations less than 200 years old) in the United States and New Zealand that had a higher degree of genetic variation than the European native populations established thousands of years ago. Given the overall dearth of studies on this subject, we suggest that in contemporary established Botryllus populations, gene diversity is affected by ecological factors, some of which can be traced directly to the last ice age. Other parameters of gene diversity are influenced by selection pressure, which might be more intense in northern regions. 3aBotryllus schlosseri 3aalleles 3acoasts 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3aice 3aloci 3apermafrost 3apopulation genetics 3arefuge habitats 3aEngland 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aIberian Peninsula 3aNew Zealand 3aScotland 3aUnited States1 aPaz, Guy1 aRinkevich, Baruch0 tEcosystems.g2006 Nov., v. 9, no. 7 p.1118-1127dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-006-0141-y 7aarticle02433naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002200155245007000177300001800247500002400265520097500289650001901264650002001283650001701303650001101320650002101331650001501352650001601367650001601383650001501399650002401414650001501438650001101453650004701464650003301511650004601544650001101590650002801601700002001629700002501649700003301674700002301707700002101730700002101751773010701772852000901879856003901888655001201927IND4444427420221118062254.0101029e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444442742DNAL7 a210316302pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.32252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenkovic, Nebojsa10aRadioprotective activity of Gentiana lutea extract and mangiferin  ap. 1693-1696.  aIncludes references  aRadioprotective/sensitizing actions of Gentiana lutea aqueous‐ethanol extract and mangiferin on radiation‐induced effects on different types of cells were investigated. The study focused on the decreasing survival of normal human immunocompetent cells, the survival of the malignant cells in vitro, and the survival of ex vivo irradiated cells before and after consumption of the extract by healthy volunteers. The in vitro experiments showed that mangiferin could inhibit cytotoxic action of ionizing irradiation (doses of 6 and 8 Gy) only on normal resting human PBMC, not stimulated for proliferation. Orally consumed G. lutea extract showed the potential to reduce the cytotoxic effect of x‐ray irradiation on normal human immunocompetent cells PBMC of some healthy people, without changing the susceptibility of malignant cells to be destroyed by irradiation. Since the radioprotective effect was individually dependent, further clinical studies are needed. 3aGentiana lutea 3aclinical trials 3acytotoxicity 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3aionization 3airradiation 3alymphocytes 3avolunteers 2aGentianaxchemistry 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearxradiation effects 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aRadiation-Protective Agentsxpharmacology 2aX-Rays 2aXanthonesxpharmacology1 aJuranic, Zorica1 aStanojkovic, Tatjana1 aRaonic‐Stevanovic, Tatjana1 aŠavikin, Katarina1 aZdunić, Gordana1 aBorojevic, Nenad0 tPhytotherapy research.g2010 Nov., v. 24, no. 11 p.1693-1696dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.3225 7aarticle02926naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245015500174300001600329500002400345520162700369650003001996650001702026650001502043650001502058650001702073650002002090650001102110650001902121650001802140653001402158653002302172653000802195653003702203653004002240700001902280700001802299700001902317773010402336852000902440856005502449655001202504IND4405935220221118062244.0080523e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440593522DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1529-8817.2008.00509.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHancke, Torunn B.10aRate of o₂ production derived from pulse-amplitude-modulated fluorescence: testing three biooptical approaches against measured o₂-production rate  ap. 803-813.  aIncludes references  aLight absorption by phytoplankton is both species specific and affected by photoacclimational status. To estimate oxygenic photosynthesis from pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorescence, the amount of quanta absorbed by PSII needs to be quantified. We present here three different biooptical approaches to estimate the fraction of light absorbed by PSII: (1) the factor 0.5, which implies that absorbed light is equally distributed among PSI and PSII; (2) the fraction of chl a in PSII, determined as the ratio between the scaled red-peak fluorescence excitation and the red absorption peak; and (3) the measure of light absorbed by PSII, determined from the scaling of the fluorescence excitation spectra to the absorption spectra by the "no-overshoot" procedure. Three marine phytoplankton species were used as test organisms: Prorocentrum minimum (Pavill.) J. Schiller (Dinophyceae), Prymnesium parvum cf. patelliferum (J. C. Green, D. J. Hibberd et Pienaar) A. Larsen (Haptophyceae), and Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin (Bacillariophyceae). Photosynthesis versus irradiance (P vs. E) parameters calculated using the three approaches were compared with P versus E parameters obtained from simultaneously measured rates of oxygen production. Generally, approach 1 underestimated, while approach 2 overestimated the gross O₂-production rate calculated from PAM fluorescence. Approach 3, in principle the best approach to estimate quanta absorbed by PSII, was also superior according to observations. Hence, we recommend approach 3 for estimation of gross O₂-production rates based on PAM fluorescence measurements. 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3aProrocentrum 3aPrymnesium 3aabsorption 3afluorescence 3alight intensity 3aoxygen 3aphotosystem II 3aphytoplankton 0abiooptics 0achl a fluorescence 0aPAM 0aphotosynthetic oxygen production 0aPSII-scaled fluorescence excitation1 aHancke, Kasper1 aJohnsen, Geir1 aSakshaug, Egil0 tJournal of phycology.g2008 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.803-813dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-36467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2008.00509.x 7aarticle03654naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100002500184245010900209300001600318500002400334506007600358520187000434506003702304650001102341650001402352650001102366650001902377650001802396650001002414650001102424650001402435650001002449650000802459650001702467650001002484650001502494650001002509650001002519650002302529650000902552650001802561650001102579650002102590650001102611650001102622650000902633650001602642650003402658650001402692650001002706650001502716650001602731700001802747700002202765773013702787852000902924856008302933655001203016IND4450906820221207140158.0110319e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445090682DNAL7 a212892252pmid7 aPMC30575452pmcid7 a10.3945/ajcn.110.0093322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlatt, Alexandria D.10aHidden vegetables: an effective strategy to reduce energy intake and increase vegetable intake in adults  ap. 756-763.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The overconsumption of energy-dense foods leads to excessive energy intakes. The substitution of low-energy-dense vegetables for foods higher in energy density can help decrease energy intakes but may be difficult to implement if individuals dislike the taste of vegetables. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether incorporating puréed vegetables to decrease the energy density of entrées at multiple meals reduced daily energy intakes and increased daily vegetable intakes. DESIGN: In this crossover study, 20 men and 21 women ate ad libitum breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the laboratory once a week for 3 wk. Across conditions, entrées at meals varied in energy density from standard versions (100% condition) to reduced versions (85% and 75% conditions) by the covert incorporation of 3 or 4.5 times the amount of puréed vegetables. Entrées were accompanied by unmanipulated side dishes. Participants rated their hunger and fullness before and after meals. RESULTS: Subjects consumed a consistent weight of foods across conditions of energy density; thus, the daily energy intake significantly decreased by 202 ± 60 kcal in the 85% condition (P < 0.001) and by 357 ± 47 kcal in the 75% condition (P < 0.0001). Daily vegetable consumption significantly increased from 270 ± 17 g of vegetables in the 100% condition to 487 ± 25 g of vegetables in the 75% condition (P < 0.0001). Despite the decreased energy intake, ratings of hunger and fullness did not significantly differ across conditions. Entrées were rated as similar in palatability across conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Large amounts of puréed vegetables can be incorporated into various foods to decrease the energy density. This strategy can lead to substantial reductions in energy intakes and increases in vegetable intakes.

Energy budgets of wetlands in temperate deciduous forests are dominated by terrestrially derived leaf litter that decays under different drying conditions depending on autumn precipitation. We compared decay rates and microbial colonization of maple leaves under different inundation schedules in a field experiment, and then conducted a laboratory study on shredder preference. In the field, litter bags either remained submerged (permanent), were moved to a dried part of the basin once and then returned (semi-permanent), or were alternated between wet and dry conditions for 8 weeks (temporary). 2. There was no difference in decay rates among treatments, but leaves incubated under permanent and semi-permanent conditions had higher fungal and bacterial biomass, and lower C : N ratios than those incubated under alternating drying and wetting conditions. 3. To determine the effects of these differences in litter nutritional quality on shredder preference, we conducted a laboratory preference test with larvae of leaf-shredding caddisflies that inhabit the wetland. Caddisflies spent twice as much time foraging on permanent and semi-permanent litter than on litter incubated under temporary conditions. 4. There is considerable variation among previous studies in how basin drying affects litter breakdown in wetlands, and no previous information on shredder preference. We found that frequent drying in a shallow wetland reduces the nutritional quality of leaf litter (lower microbial biomass and nitrogen content), and therefore preference by invertebrate shredders. These results suggest that inter-annual shifts in drying regime should alter detritus processing rates, and hence the mobilization of the energy and nutrients in leaf litter to the wetland food web. 3aTrichoptera 3aautumn 3abasins 3adeciduous forests 3adrying 3aenergy 3afield experimentation 3afood webs 3aforaging 3afungi 3ainvertebrates 3alarvae 3aleaves 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial colonization 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3anutritive value 3aplant litter 3awetlands 3awoodlands 0acaddisfly 0alitter 0amicrobial processing 0ashredders1 aWissinger, Scott A.1 aBAROS, BRANDI L.0 tFreshwater biology.g2008 Mar., v. 53, no. 3 p.435-445dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01908.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080203b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03468naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245019200127300001600319520198500335650001302320650001502333650001502348650001102363650001702374650001402391650000802405650001302413650001602426650001402442650001802456650001902474650001802493650001602511650002102527650001502548650001302563650002302576650001402599650001802613650001202631650001002643650002502653650001402678650003802692700001602730700002102746773009302767852000902860930003302869945001302902946001102915655001202926IND2202023220221118062330.0991220e199906  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220202322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrayer, R.J.12aA comparison between chemical and molecular characters for the determination of phylogenetic relationships among plant families: an appreciation of Hegnauer's "Chemotaxonomie der Pflazen"  ap. 369-393.  aThe views on the natural relationships among plant families belonging to the Asteridae S.l. on the basis of chemical profiles expressed in Hegnauer's series "Chemotaxonomie der Pflanzen" (1962-present) are compared with the results of cladistic analyses of the rbcL gene DNA sequences in those families. The suggestion, based on chemistry, that the Cornaceae are not closely related to the Apiaceae and Araliaceae, is supported by molecular evidence, and so is the view that the Apiaceae and Araliaceae are closer to the Asteraceae instead. Likewise a close affinity between the Scrophulariaceae and Lamiaceae on the one hand, and between the Solanaceae and Boraginaceae on the other is confirmed, instead of close connections between the Scrophulariaceae and Solanaceae, and between the Lamiaceae and Boraginaceae, which has often been the traditional view. Two small families of water plants with reduced flowers, the Callitrichaceae and Hippuridaceae, which used to be placed in widely different orders by different systematists, show chemical profiles which indicate close relationships to the Scrophulariaceae and Lamiaceae. Again molecular data are congruent with the chemical ones. In turn, unexpected molecular results have been supported by chemical evidence, e.g. the placement of the Polemoniaceae close to the Primulaceae and Theaceae, and that of Eucommia next to Aucuba. However, the chemistry of the Menyanthaceae does not unequivocally support the repositioning of this family from the Gentianales to the affinity of the Asteraceae suggested by molecular data. On the whole, molecular trees based on rbcL DNA sequences appear to provide a very useful framework to assess the comparative merits and usefulness of secondary compound classes as chemotaxonomic characters, and molecular information also can be used as a tool to study the evolution of small chemical compounds. On the other hand, chemical characters can be used as an additional support for DNA trees. 3aApiaceae 3aAraliaceae 3aAsteraceae 3aAucuba 3aBoraginaceae 3aCornaceae 3aDNA 3aEucommia 3aGentianales 3aLamiaceae 3aMenyanthaceae 3aPlantaginaceae 3aPolemoniaceae 3aPrimulaceae 3aScrophulariaceae 3aSolanaceae 3aTheaceae 3achemical compounds 3achemistry 3achemotaxonomy 3aflowers 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase1 aChase, M.W.1 aSimmonds, M.S.J.0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g1999 June, v. 27, no. 4 p.369-393x0305-19787nnas  aDNAL  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02558naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007500128300001600203520151400219650001601733650001301749650000801762650001301770650001201783650001301795650002501808650002401833650002101857650001001878650002401888650001401912650001701926700001601943700001501959700001501974773009301989852000902082930003302091945001302124946001102137655001202148IND2201207320221118062230.0991020e199904  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220120732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoutilier, K.10aEvolution of 2S albumin seed storage protein genes in the Brassicaceae  ap. 223-234.  aThe DNA and deduced amio acid sequences of the 2S albumin seed storage protein genes from some members of the Brassicaceae, including the genera Brassica, Raphanus, Sinapis (all tribe Brassiceae) and Arabidopsis (tribe Sysimbrieae), were analysed to infer their phylogenetic relationships. Analysis of the DNA sequence of the 5' and 3' untranslated flanking regions provided evidence that a number of the 2S albumin genes were duplicated prior to the Brassiceae-Sysimbrieae split. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein coding regions suggested that many of these sequences have undergone concerted evolution. Three distinct clusters of 2S albumin genes were identified within the Brassiceae; one cluster consisted entirely of Sinapis sequences, the second cluster consisted of sequences from B. oleracea, and B. juncea and some sequences from B. napus, and the third cluster consisted of sequences from B. rapa, B. nigra, R. sativus, and the remaining B. napus sequences. Comparison of the gene tree of the coding regions with a conventional species tree suggests that the protein coding sequences in the latter two clusters were created by duplication and subsequent divergence in the common ancestor of these species, and that sequences derived from one of the clusters have been eliminated from the genome of each species. These results suggest that both gene duplication and non-reciprocal DNA exchanges have played a role in the evolution of the 2S albumin genes of the Brassicaceae. 3aArabidopsis 3aBrassica 3aDNA 3aRaphanus 3aSinapis 3aalbumins 3aamino acid sequences 3aconcerted evolution 3agene duplication 3agenes 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3aseed storage1 aHattori, J.1 aBaum, B.R.1 aMiki, B.L.0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g1999 Apr., v. 27, no. 3 p.223-234x0305-19787nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle01261naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010100127300001600228520035900244650001500603650002100618650002600639650001500665650001400680650001200694700001300706700001700719700001100736700001600747773009400763852000900857930003300866945001300899946001100912655001200923IND2204478720221118062215.0000511e199909  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220447872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStahlhut, R.14aThe occurrence of the anti-cancer diterpene taxol in Podocarpus gracilior Pilger (Podocarpaceae)  ap. 613-622.  aTaxol, a tubulin binding diterpene originally isolated from the Pacific Yew (Taxus brevifolia Nutt.), has been discovered in the African Fern Pine, Podocarpus gracilior Pilger (Podocarpaceae).

We assessed the ability of the entire ITS vs the ITS2 alone to discriminate between species in a taxonomic dataset (members of the genus Usnea) and a floristic dataset. • In the floristic dataset, 96.3% of sequenced samples could be assigned to the correct species using ITS or ITS2; a barcode gap for ITS is present in 92.1% of species. Although fewer species have a barcode gap in the taxonomic dataset (73.3% with ITS and 68.8% with ITS2), up to 94.1% of samples were assigned to the correct species using BLAST. • While discrimination between the most closely related species will remain challenging, our results demonstrate the potential to identify a high percentage of specimens to the correct species, and the remainder to the correct genus, when using DNA barcoding in a floristic context. 3aDNA barcoding 3aUsnea 3afungi 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3anuclear genome 2aDNA Barcoding, Taxonomic 2aDNA, Fungalxchemistry 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxchemistry 2aLichensxclassificationxgenetics. 2aNucleic Acid Amplification Techniques 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpecies Specificity 2aUsneaxclassificationxgenetics.1 aHollingsworth, Peter M.1 aCoppins, Brian J.1 aEllis, Christopher J.1 aHarrold, Paul1 aTosh, James1 aYahr, Rebecca0 tnew phytologist.g2011 July, v. 191, no. 1 p.288-300dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03677.x 7aarticle03290naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011000165300001600275500002400291500001500315520168600330650001902016650001302035650001202048650001202060650002302072650002902095650001702124650001402141650002702155650002002182650001802202650001602220650001202236650002402248653002302272653003502295653002002330653001602350653002102366653002802387653002702415653002002442653002502462653002602487653001102513653002602524700002002550773010902570852000902679856004802688655001202736IND4451491220221118062405.0110326e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445149122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-011-0003-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurgin, Shelley14aThe direct physical, chemical and biotic impacts on Australian coastal waters due to recreational boating  ap. 683-701.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn economically developed countries it is projected that by around 2015 over 50% of a person's lifetime will become available for leisure. Demand for leisure needs, already strong, will continue to increase. One segment of the market, outdoor nature-based recreation (including tourism), is growing strongly worldwide. A substantial proportion of these activities are water-based. The associated demand for recreational vessels has increased rapidly in recent years and is projected to continue to trend upwards. Australian trends mirror those internationally. Using Australia as a case study, we review the direct physical, chemical and biotic impacts associated with recreational boating in coastal water environments. Major physical impacts include disturbance due to movement of craft in shallow waters (e.g., turbulence) and the effects of anchoring/drag, noise/interference/collision that impacts on wildlife. The most critical chemical impacts result from pollution due to fuels and oils, defouling treatments (even those not legislated in-country), and human waste (e.g., sewage effluent). Important biotic impacts are the potential continued introduction and secondary spread of non-native species. We conclude that while greater research effort will provide more environmentally benign products, with the increasing popularity of recreation vessels, it will be beyond the resources of Australian governments to police legislation effectively. However, based on Australian's demonstrated engagement with government in terrestrial environmental management, with their deliberate engagement with the boating fraternity, the impacts of recreational boating would be lessened. 3aturbulent flow 3awildlife 3atourism 3aboating 3aintroduced species 3aenvironmental management 3acase studies 3afuel oils 3asecondary transmission 3asewage effluent 3acoastal water 3aAustralians 3amarkets 3adeveloped countries 0aoutdoor recreation 0aRecreation impacts on wildlife 0aTourist impacts 0aAnimal kill 0aSewage discharge 0aAnti-fouling treatments 0aFuel and oil pollution 0aBoating impacts 0aCommunity engagement 0aSpecies translocation 0awastes 0aHydrocarbon pollution1 aHardiman, Nigel0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2011 Apr., v. 20, no. 4 p.683-701dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-011-0003-6 7aarticle01432naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245009600174300001600270500002400286520053900310650001300849650004300862650001800905700002100923700002100944773012500965852000901090856005501099655001201154IND4391831820221118062408.0070529e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439183182DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4557.2007.00122.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGulten, Sekeroglu10aDetermination of benzo(a)pyrene in vegetable oils by high performance liquid chromatography  ap. 300-308.  aIncludes references  aAnalysis of 40 oil samples showed that 38 of them were contaminated with benzo(a)pyrene (BaP).

At the heart of the body of research on biodiversity effects on ecosystem function is the debate over whether different species tend to be functionally singular or redundant. When we consider ecosystem multi-function, the provision of multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously, we may find that seemingly redundant species may in fact play unique roles in ecosystems. 2. Over the last few decades, the significance of biological soil crusts (BSCs) as ecological boundaries and ecosystem engineers, and their multi-functional nature, has become increasingly well documented. We compiled ‘functional profiles' of the organisms in this understudied community, to determine whether functional singularity emerges when multiple ecosystem functions are considered. 3. In two data sets, one representing multiple sites around the semi-arid regions of Spain (regional scale), and another from a single site in central Spain (local scale), we examined correlations between the abundance or frequency of BSC species in a community, and multiple surrogates of ecosystem functioning. There was a wide array of apparent effects of species on specific functions. 4. Notably, in gypsiferous soils and at regional scale, we found that indicators of carbon (C) and phosphorus cycling were apparently suppressed and promoted by the lichens Diploschistes diacapsis and Squamarina lentigera, respectively. The moss Pleurochaete squarrosa appears to promote C cycling in calcareous soils at this spatial scale. At the local scale in gypsiferous soils, D. diacapsis positively correlated with carbon cycling, but negatively with nitrogen cycling, whereas numerous lichens exhibited the opposite profile. 5. We found a high degree of functional singularity, i.e. that species were highly individualistic in their effects on multiple functions. Many functional attributes were not easily predictable from existing functional grouping systems based primarily on morphology. 6. Our results suggest that maintaining species-rich BSC communities is crucial to maintain the overall functionality of ecosystems dominated by these organisms, and that dominance and the outcome of competition could be highly influential in the determination of such functionality. 3aDiploschistes 3aSquamarina 3abiodiversity 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acalcareous soils 3acarbon 3acorrelation 3aecosystems 3agypsiferous soils 3alichens 3amosses and liverworts 3aphosphorus 3asemiarid zones 3asoil crusts 3aSpain1 aMau, Rebecca L.1 aMaestre, Fernando T.1 aEscolar, Cristina1 aCastillo-Monroy, Andrea P.0 tFunctional ecology.g2011 Aug., v. 25, no. 4 p.787-795dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01835.x 7aarticle03626naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001900161245011900180300001600299500002400315500001500339520187700354650001602231650001502247650002502262650002302287650001102310650001302321650001202334650001702346650001902363650001802382650001102400650002002411650001002431650003302441650001402474650001402488650004102502650003202543650001102575650001402586650002302600650002402623650002102647650002302668653001102691700001902702700001502721700002402736700001902760700001702779700001902796700002002815773011102835852000902946856004502955655001203000IND4408297120221118062411.0080726e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440829712DNAL7 a186184792pmid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2007005102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnaup, Bastian10aModel experiments mimicking the human intestinal transit and metabolism of D-galacturonic acid and amidated pectin  ap. 840-848.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn order to study the human intestinal transit and metabolism of D-galacturonic acid and amidated pectin a number of model experiments were carried out. Both substrates were incubated under aerobic conditions at 37°C using saliva (2 min) and simulated gastric juice (4 h). Under anaerobic conditions the substrates were incubated at 37°C using human ileostomy and colostomy fluids, each obtained from three different donors, for 10 and for 24 h, respectively. D-Galacturonic acid, SCFA (acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid), as well as methanol were analyzed photometrically after carbazole reaction, GC-flame ionization detection (GC-FID), and headspace solid-phase microextraction GC/MS (HS-SPME-GC/MS), respectively. D-Galacturonic acid and amidated pectin were found to be stable during incubations with saliva and simulated gastric juice, whereas both substrates underwent degradation in the course of human ileostomy and colostomy fluid incubations. D-Galacturonic acid was practically completely decomposed within 10 h and SCFA, with acetic acid as the major representative, were formed up to 98% of the incubated substrate in colostomy effluent. The amidated pectin was only degraded in part, revealing stable amounts of 22-35% and 3-17% in ileostomy (after 10 h) and colostomy fluid (after 24 h), respectively. SCFA were generated up to 59% of the applied amidated pectin. In parallel, 19-60% and 52-67% of the available methyl ester groups were cleaved in the course of incubations with ileostomy and colostomy fluids, respectively. The results demonstrate for the first time that D-galacturonic acid and amidated pectin are stable in human saliva and simulated gastric juice. The degradation of both compounds during incubation with ileostomy effluent is highlighted, providing evidence for a considerable metabolic potential of the small intestine. 3aacetic acid 3ametabolism 3aanaerobic conditions 3aaerobic conditions 3ahumans 3amethanol 3apectins 3abutyric acid 3apropionic acid 3agastric juice 3asaliva 3asmall intestine 2aAdult 2aCarboxylic Acidsxmetabolism 2aColectomy 2aColostomy 2aGastrointestinal Transitxphysiology 2aHexuronic Acidsxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aIleostomy 2aModels, Biological 2aPectinsxmetabolism 2aReference Values 2aSalivaxmetabolism 0aesters1 aKempf, Michael1 aFuchs, Jan1 aValotis, Anagnostis1 aKahle, Kathrin1 aOehme, Anett1 aRichling, Elke1 aSchreier, Peter0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2008 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.840-848dWiley-VCH Verlagx1613-41257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200700510 7aarticle03801naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100001200174245017100186300001800357500002400375500001500399520154400414650002701958650001001985650001001995650001502005650001802020650001502038650001802053650001902071650001702090650001202107650001702119650002102136650001002157650002602167650003302193650001202226650005502238650002702293650004702320650000902367650001902376650004802395650001002443650002402453650005002477653001502527653002802542653001902570700001802589700001702607700001302624700001702637700001302654700001702667700001602684700001802700700001802718773016202736852000902898856007702907930003302984945002503017946001303042655001203055IND4438599620221118234648.0100617e20100609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443859962DNAL7 a204436242pmid7 a10.1021/jf904577f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL8101 aLiu, Yu10aTissue Depletion and Concentration Correlations between Edible Tissues and Biological Fluids of 3-Amino-2-oxazolidinone in Pigs Fed with a Furazolidone-Medicated Feed  ap. 6774-6779.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFurazolidone has been prohibited for use in food animal production worldwide for its carcinogenicity and mutagenicity, but it is still illegally used in some farms because of its effectiveness and cheap price. Because of the food safety and economical concerns, it is necessary to find an efficient and low-cost way to monitor the misuse of furazolidone in food-producing animals. For this regard, the tissue depletion and tissue-biological fluid concentration correlations of 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (AOZ), which is the marker residue of furazolidone, were studied in pigs. Pigs were dosed with 400 mg/kg of furazolidone in feed for 7 days and were sacrificed at the withdrawal time of 0.5, 7, 21, 35, 56, and 63 days. Muscle, liver, kidney, urine, and plasma were collected to detect the AOZ by a simplified indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA). Results showed that AOZ was widely distributed in pigs and eliminated slowly after the digestion of furazolidone. The half-lives of AOZ in the plasma, urine, liver, kidney, and muscle were 13.7, 14.7, 13.6, 13.6, and 15.0 days, respectively. Good correlations of the AOZ concentration were found between plasma and muscle, plasma and liver, urine and liver, and urine and kidney in the depletion period of 7-63 or 21-63 days, with correlation coefficients of more than 0.97 and p values less than 0.05. These correlations can provide a basis for a simple and economical way using plasma/urine to monitor the illegal use of furazolidone in pigs without slaughter. 3achemical concentration 3aliver 3aurine 3amonitoring 3adrug residues 3abiomarkers 3arapid methods 3amuscle tissues 3afurazolidone 3akidneys 3ablood plasma 3apharmacokinetics 3aswine 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Structuresxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aBody Fluidsxchemistry 2aDrug Residuesxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aMale 2aMeatxanalysis 2aOxazolidinonesxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aSwine 2aTissue Distribution 2aVeterinary Drugsxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 0ametabolism 0a3-amino-2-oxazolidinone 0aanimal tissues1 aHuang, Lingli1 aWang, Yulian1 aYang, Bo1 aIshan, Awais1 aFang, Ke1 aPeng, Dapeng1 aLiu, Zhenli1 aDai, Menghong1 aYuan, Zonghui0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 June 9, v. 58, no. 11 p.6774-6779dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf904577f3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/08/16  aOther US 7aarticle03461naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001900182245013500201300001800336500002400354506007600378520172300454506003702177650002302214650001902237650001002256650001302266650002402279650002402303650001302327650002302340650002602363650001602389650001602405650001402421650001402435650002802449650001302477650005002490650005902540650005102599650004902650700002302699700001602722773011502738852000902853856008102862655001202943IND4451773920221207100209.0110401e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445177392DNAL7 a213110332pmid7 aPMC30911012pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.110.1682292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasu, Paramita10aDetailed Quantitative Analysis of Architectural Traits of Basal Roots of Young Seedlings of Bean in Response to Auxin and Ethylene  ap. 2056-2065.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVertical placement of roots within the soil determines their efficiency of acquisition of heterogeneous belowground resources. This study quantifies the architectural traits of seedling basal roots of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), and shows that the distribution of root tips at different depths results from a combined effect of both basal root growth angle (BRGA) and root length. Based on emergence locations, the basal roots are classified in three zones, upper, middle, and lower, with each zone having distinct architectural traits. The genotypes characterized as shallow on BRGA alone produced basal roots with higher BRGA, greater length, and more vertically distributed roots than deep genotypes, thereby establishing root depth as a robust measure of root architecture. Although endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels were similar in all genotypes, IAA and 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid treatments showed different root growth responses to auxin because shallow and deep genotypes tended to have optimal and supraoptimal auxin levels, respectively, for root growth in controls. While IAA increased ethylene production, ethylene also increased IAA content. Although differences in acropetal IAA transport to roots of different zones can account for some of the differences in auxin responsiveness among roots of different emergence positions, this study shows that mutually dependent ethylene-auxin interplay regulates BRGA and root growth differently in different genotypes. Root length inhibition by auxin was reversed by an ethylene synthesis inhibitor. However, IAA caused smaller BRGA in deep genotypes, but not in shallow genotypes, which only responded to IAA in the presence of an ethylene inhibitor.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aacid treatment 3abeans 3aethylene 3aethylene inhibitors 3aethylene production 3agenotype 3aindole acetic acid 3aquantitative analysis 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3aroot tips 3aseedlings 2aEthylenesxbiosynthesis 2aGenotype 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPhaseolusxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aSeedlingsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology.1 aBrown, Kathleen M.1 aPal, Anupam0 tPlant physiology.g2011 Apr., v. 155, no. 4 p.2056-2065dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.110.1682293Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03408naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002600157245012400183300001800307500002400325500001500349520174000364650001002104650002202114650002602136650002002162650001802182650001402200650002002214650001102234650001902245650001302264650001902277650001202296650005702308650001002365650003302375650002202408650008002430650005202510650001302562653001502575700002002590700002302610700002102633700002202654773011502676852000902791856007802800655001202878IND4433885920221118234608.0100313e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443388592DNAL7 a202029942pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erq0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHogewoning, Sander W.13aAn artificial solar spectrum substantially alters plant development compared with usual climate room irradiance spectra  ap. 1267-1276.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPlant responses to the light spectrum under which plants are grown affect their developmental characteristics in a complicated manner. Lamps widely used to provide growth irradiance emit spectra which are very different from natural daylight spectra. Whereas specific responses of plants to a spectrum differing from natural daylight may sometimes be predictable, the overall plant response is generally difficult to predict due to the complicated interaction of the many different responses. So far studies on plant responses to spectra either use no daylight control or, if a natural daylight control is used, it will fluctuate in intensity and spectrum. An artificial solar (AS) spectrum which closely resembles a sunlight spectrum has been engineered, and growth, morphogenesis, and photosynthetic characteristics of cucumber plants grown for 13 d under this spectrum have been compared with their performance under fluorescent tubes (FTs) and a high pressure sodium lamp (HPS). The total dry weight of the AS-grown plants was 2.3 and 1.6 times greater than that of the FT and HPS plants, respectively, and the height of the AS plants was 4-5 times greater. This striking difference appeared to be related to a more efficient light interception by the AS plants, characterized by longer petioles, a greater leaf unfolding rate, and a lower investment in leaf mass relative to leaf area. Photosynthesis per leaf area was not greater for the AS plants. The extreme differences in plant response to the AS spectrum compared with the widely used protected cultivation light sources tested highlights the importance of a more natural spectrum, such as the AS spectrum, if the aim is to produce plants representative of field conditions. 3alamps 3aplant development 3aprotected cultivation 3asolar radiation 3amorphogenesis 3aleaf area 3alight intensity 3asodium 3aplant response 3apetioles 3aphotosynthesis 3aclimate 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxradiation effects 2aLight 2aPhotosynthesisxdrug effects 2aPlant Development 2aPlant Leavesxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aPlantsxanatomy & histologyxradiation effects. 2aSunlight 0ainvestment1 aDouwstra, Peter1 aTrouwborst, Govert1 avan Ieperen, Wim1 aHarbinson, Jeremy0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2010 Mar., v. 61, no. 5 p.1267-1276dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq0053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02838naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100002000174245008600194300002000280500002400300500001500324520114800339650001701487650002101504650002201525650001401547650001801561650001401579650001101593650001301604650003601617650002101653650003401674650003301708650002901741650002501770650002001795650002901815653001701844700001701861700002501878700002601903700002201929773017601951852000902127856007702136930003302213945002502246946001302271655001202284IND4438606720221118234653.0100617e20100609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443860672DNAL7 a204555602pmid7 a10.1021/jf100497c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF2001 aVichi, Stefania10aEvolution of Sesquiterpene Hydrocarbons in Virgin Olive Oil during Fruit Ripening  ap. 6972–6976.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDespite the potential of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons in olive oil authentication, their metabolism in Olea europaea is poorly understood, and little is known about their biochemical regulation in olives as a function of ripening. To ascertain some metabolic relationships between sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and olive ripening, the content of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons was assessed in virgin olive oils from two olive varieties grown in the same geographical area and produced at different harvesting periods. During the ripening, the accumulation of sesquiterpenes in the olive itself, and thus in the oil, differed according to their molecular structure: bicyclic sesquiterpenes, showed decreasing concentrations the later the harvest, while acyclic farnesene-like compounds progressively increased through the olive ripening process. This is first evidence that the accumulation of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons in olive, and hence in olive oil, is modulated during ripening. Therefore, the degree of ripening of olives should be taken into consideration when considering the sesquiterpenic profile of virgin olive oil for their authentication. 3aharvest date 3asesquiterpenoids 3aplant development 3acultivars 3aOlea europaea 3aolive oil 3aolives 3aripening 3achemical constituents of plants 3alipid metabolism 2aFruitxchemistryxphysiology. 2aOleaxchemistryxphysiology. 2aPlant Extractsxanalysis 2aPlant Oilsxanalysis 2aQuality Control 2aSesquiterpenesxanalysis 0ahydrocarbons1 aLazzez, Aida1 aGrati Kamoun, Naziha1 aLopez-Tamames, Elvira1 aBuxaderas, Susana0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 June 9, v. 58, no. 11 p.6972–6976-6972–6976dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf100497c3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100913b20101001c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/08/16  aOther US 7aarticle03237naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100002900165245010800194300002000302500002400322500001500346520130200361650001601663650001601679650001901695650002601714650001501740650000901755650002201764650002401786650001301810650001301823650002601836650000901862650001401871650002701885650001701912650001501929650001901944650001001963650001901973650001701992650003402009650002702043650003602070650003002106650002802136650002002164653001402184653001702198700001802215700002102233773017602254852000902430856007702439930003302516945002502549946001302574655001202587IND4438602720221118234804.0100617e20100609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443860272DNAL7 a204555682pmid7 a10.1021/jf10076592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ3001 aSanchez-Garcia, Maria D.10aNanobiocomposites of Carrageenan, Zein, and Mica of Interest in Food Packaging and Coating Applications  ap. 6884–6894.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe present study presents the development and characterization of biocomposites of a red-algae-derived carrageenan, mica, and their blends with zein prolamine obtained by solvent casting. The morphology of the blends was characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), optical microscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Mechanical behavior, water barrier, water uptake, and UV−vis protection of the cast films were also investigated. The results indicated that the addition of 10 wt % glycerol to the blends resulted in a better dispersion of the additive and, for that reason, a better improvement for the studied properties. The composites were seen colored but transparent and exhibited the ability to block the UV−vis radiation because of the characteristic absorbing properties of the filler. Nevertheless, the main conclusion from the work is that the nanocomposites were seen to act as a reinforcing plasticizer and also led to significantly reduced water permeability and uptake. The clay was found to be more efficient in the latter aspect than the zein prolamine as an additive. As a result, these novel carragenan-based biocomposites can have significant potential to develop packaging films and coatings for shelf-life extension of food products. 3abiopolymers 3acarrageenan 3afood packaging 3aultraviolet radiation 3aRhodophyta 3amica 3afilms (materials) 3apackaging materials 3acoatings 3aglycerol 3amechanical properties 3azein 3aadditives 3abiodegradable products 3aplasticizers 3aabsorption 3ananotechnology 3awater 3aphotostability 3apermeability 2aAluminum Silicatesxchemistry 2aCarrageenanxchemistry 2aFood Packagingxinstrumentation 2aNanocompositesxchemistry 2aPlasticizersxchemistry 2aZeinxchemistry 0aprolamins 0aRhodophycota1 aHilliou, Loic1 aLagaron, Jose M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 June 9, v. 58, no. 11 p.6884–6894-6884–6894dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf10076593Available from publisher's Web site  a20100913b20101001c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/08/16  aOther US 7aarticle03685naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100001400165245010300179300001800282500002400300520160200324650001701926650002801943650002301971650001901994650001702013650001602030650001302046650002802059650001002087650002402097650002302121650001402144650001202158650002502170650001602195650002602211650005902237650002402296650002402320650004702344650006102391650003602452653001702488653002102505653002402526700001302550700002102563700001402584700002002598700002002618700001402638700002102652700001902673773016202692852000902854856007702863930003302940945002502973946001302998655001203011IND4438601820221118234859.0100617e20100609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443860182DNAL7 a204501952pmid7 a10.1021/jf10009192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aLiu, Ming10aDesign, Synthesis, and Insecticidal Activities of Phthalamides Containing a Hydrazone Substructure  ap. 6858-6863.  aIncludes references  aFluobendiamide is the first commercialized artificial synthetic insecticide acting on the ryanodine receptor. This new molecule possesses a combination of excellent insecticidal activity and eco-friendly characteristics with a skeleton structure of phthalamide. In this study, we incorporated hydrazone, present in many pesticidal compounds reported during the last two decades, into phthalamide derivatives via Schiff-base condensation and aminolysis to obtain 21 new compounds; these compounds were characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) or elemental analysis. A preliminary bioassay against peach aphids (Myzus persicae) revealed that the title compounds exhibited good stomach toxicity at 600 mg/L. Twelve new compounds were found to display higher activity than postive control flubendiamide (LC50 = 184.099 mg/L), however, LC50 was less than 100 mg/L only for compounds 4e, 4o, 4s, 4t (59-77 mg/L). That is, combinations of a p-fluorophenyl or (methyl)thienyl group at the Ar position with an isopropyl or cyclohexyl group at the R position might improve the lethality of the designed phthalamide derivative. Preliminary results of a bioassay at 600 mg/L against diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella, Linnaeus) showed that only the title compound 4e possessed good larvicidal activity. On comparison of the bioassay results of stomach toxicity and larvicidal activity, it is noteworthy that the compound incorporating phenylpyrazolyl exhibited good larvicidal activity and poor stomach activity. 3ainsecticides 3ainsecticidal properties 3achemical reactions 3aMyzus persicae 3apest control 3aplant pests 3atoxicity 3alethal concentration 50 3amoths 3aPlutella xylostella 3achemical structure 3asynthesis 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxdrug effects 2aDrug Design 2aHydrazonesxchemistry 2aInsecticidesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aLarvaxdrug effects 2aMolecular Structure 2aMothsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPhthalic Acidsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 0aphthalamides 0astomach toxicity 0alarvicidal activity1 aWang, Yi1 aWangyang, Wei-zi1 aLiu, Feng1 aCui, Yong-liang1 aDuan, You-sheng1 aWang, Min1 aLiu, Shang-zhong1 aRui, Chang-hui0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 June 9, v. 58, no. 11 p.6858-6863dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf10009193Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/08/16  aOther US 7aarticle03219naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100002500174245005800199300001800257500002400275500001500299520121700314650001401531650001601545650001601561650000901577650001901586650001701605650002401622650002401646650001201670650001701682650002801699650002301727650002301750650002001773650002801793650001901821650002301840650002001863650002601883650001301909650002101922650002101943650002001964650004501984650001302029650002902042650001302071650001402084653002402098653002302122653001602145700001902161700002202180773016202202852000902364856007702373930003302450945002502483946001302508655001202521IND4438601020221118234455.0100617e20100609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443860102DNAL7 a204767552pmid7 a10.1021/jf10097962doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ101 0aQ5011 aDissanayake, Muditha10aGelling Properties of Microparticulated Whey Proteins  ap. 6825-6832.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSubjecting whey proteins to high-pressure shearing with or without heating, commonly termed microparticulation, results in novel ingredients with modulated functionalities. Gelling properties of microparticulated whey proteins (MWP) were specifically assessed in this study. MWP powders were produced from commercial cheese whey retentate, standardized to 10% (w/w) protein, and subjected to microfluidization (MFZ) at 140 MPa either with or without prior heat-induced denaturation, followed by spray-drying. Gels were created from aqueous MWP dispersions either by heating at 90 °C for 20 min or by allowing gels to form at ambient temperature through addition of glucano-δ-lactone and/or NaCl. MWP powders produced from unheated WP dispersions created firm gels upon heating, whereas those produced from denatured WP gave only cold-set gels. Covalent and noncovalent protein-protein interactions were involved during both heat- and cold-induced gelation. Hydrophobic interactions were more pronounced during aggregation of bovine serum albumin. In conclusion, microparticulation of WP resulted in heat- and cold-set gels with different molecular and physical characteristics from those of untreated controls. 3aparticles 3adispersions 3acheese whey 3agels 3aheat treatment 3aspray drying 3aambient temperature 3ahydrophobic bonding 3apowders 3awhey protein 3afood processing quality 3agelling properties 3aprotein aggregates 3asodium chloride 3ahigh pressure treatment 3agluconolactone 3achemical structure 3afood processing 3anonthermal processing 3agelation 2aCheesexanalysis 2aCold Temperature 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aKinetics 2aMilk Proteinsxchemistry 2aPressure 2aViscosity 0aphysical properties 0amicroparticulation 0atemperature1 aKelly, Alan L.1 aVasiljevic, Todor0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 June 9, v. 58, no. 11 p.6825-6832dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf10097963Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/08/16  aOther US 7aarticle02610naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245020700158300001400365520176400379650001602143650002602159700001602185773009602201852000902297945002502306946001302331655001202344IND4361484220221118234551.0040304e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436148422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

White bass (WB, Morone chrysops), striped bass (SB, Morone saxatilis) and sunshine hybrid bass (HSB, M. chrysops x M. saxatilis) larvae (day 24-46) were fed Artemia nauplii enriched with algal sources of varying proportions of DHA and ArA (from 0 to over 20% of total fatty acids). WB larvae fed DHA-deficient Artemia diet retarded over 50% of their potential growth, however, increasing dietary DHA/ArA ratios were associated with a significant growth improvement. The highest proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids was found in WB neural tissue (approx. 50% of total fatty acids), while HSB neural tissue contained the highest proportion of saturated fatty acids (approx. 35% of total fatty acids). Within the neural tissues of all Morone larvae, both DHA and ArA were generally the most dominant as well as the most responding fatty acids to dietary manipulations (except in WB fed DHA or ArA deficient diets). HSB neural tissue was particularly efficient in retaining a significant amount of DHA in the face of dietary deficiency. However, WB neural tissue was the most responsive to dietary increase in DHA, accumulating a significantly higher amount of DHA (P<0.05) than SB or HSB. Results demonstrate significant differences in fatty acid composition and growth responsiveness to dietary manipulations between Morone larvae species and within specific tissues. WB weight gain and neural tissue composition was affected most by dietary changes in both DHA and ArA whereas SB and HSB tissue compositions were generally less affected by dietary manipulations. 3adietary fat 3aessential fatty acids1 aPlace, A.R.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2003 May, v. 135B, no. 1 p.83-94x1096-49597nnas  aDNAL  aINDdNZMe2004/03/10  aOther US 7aarticle02098naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001500163245010600178300001400284520071400298650001601012650002701028650001201055650002501067650002501092650002801117650003801145650003101183650002501214650001601239650002401255650002201279650002101301650002401322650003501346650001701381650005201398700001701450700001801467773009601485852000901581945002501590946001301615655001201628IND4361483520221118234428.0040304e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436148352DNAL7 a127819712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Based on thin layer chromatography and mass spectral analysis, a variety of cartenoprotein cmplexes such as astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, antheraxanthin, lutein, β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin were found. Both crustaceans had astaxanthin and canthaxanthin as predominant prosthetic groups. Amino acid analysis of the complexes further revealed high levels of asparagine, glutamine and glycine in both species. Our study highlights the presence of naturally available carotenoid species in both crustaceans and their possible inter-conversion in anostracans. 3acarotenoids 3aamino acid composition 2aAnimals 2aAnostracaxchemistry 2aAsparaginexanalysis 2aCanthaxanthinxanalysis 2aCarotenoidsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aChromatography, Thin Layer 2aCladoceraxchemistry 2aFresh Water 2aGlutaminexanalysis 2aGlycinexanalysis 2aLuteinxanalysis 2aMolecular Structure 2aProteinsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aXanthophylls 2abeta Carotenexanalogs & derivativesxanalysis.1 aCzeczuga, B.1 aMunuswamy, N.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2003 May, v. 135B, no. 1 p.35-42x1096-49597nnas  aDNAL  aINDdNZMe2004/03/10  aOther US 7aarticle01654naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245005500209300001400264520058400278650001200862653001300874653001200887653001400899653001300913653002100926700002100947700002100968700001700989700002001006773011401026852000901140856008501149930003301234946001301267655001201280IND4448812120221118234458.0110204e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444881212DNAL7 a10.1007/s00232-010-9327-52doi7 aPMC30309462pmcid7 a211615162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaback, H.

Therefore, lactose/H⁺ symport via LacY very likely involves a global conformational change that allows alternating access of single sugar- and H⁺-binding sites to either side of the membrane. Here, in honor of Stephan H. White's seventieth birthday, we review in camera the various biochemical/biophysical approaches that provide experimental evidence for the alternating access mechanism. 3alactose 0aPermease 0aSymport 0aTransport 0aMembrane 0aMembrane protein1 aSmirnova, Irina 1 aKasho, Vladimir 1 aNie, Yiling 1 aZhou, Yonggang 0 tJournal of membrane biology.g2011 Jan., v. 239, no. 1-2 p.85-93dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0022-26317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00232-010-9327-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20110205b20110305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02336naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007900125300001600204500001500220520122700235650001301462650001101475650001201486650001101498650001701509650000901526650001801535650001401553650002101567650001001588650001301598650001101611650001901622653002201641653002001663653001101683700001601694773012601710852000901836930003301845945001301878946001101891655001201902IND2324957220221118234616.0020122s2001    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232495722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShyu, S.L.10aEffect of processing conditions on the quality of vacuum fried apple chips  ap. 133-142.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of pretreatment and processing conditions on the quality of vacuum fried apple chips were studied. As blanched apple slices were pretreated by immersing in fructose solution and freezing prior to vacuum frying, more uniform porosity was observed on the surface (or cross-section) of apple chips as examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). During vacuum frying, the moisture content and breaking force of apple chips decreased with increasing frying temperature and time while the oil content increased. The L values of fried apple chips decreased apparently with increasing frying temperature. However, when apple slices were fried at 100 degrees C for up to 20 min, both a and b values increased rapidly. Statistical analysis with the central composite rotatable design showed that the moisture content, oil content, color, and breaking force of apple chips were significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) correlated with concentration of immersing sugar solution, frying temperature and frying time. Based on surface responses and contour plots, optimum conditions were: vacuum frying temperature of 100-110 degrees C, vacuum frying time of 20-25 min, and immersing fructose concentration of 30-40%. 3afreezing 3aapples 3atexture 3asnacks 3afood quality 3aoils 3awater content 3ablanching 3afood composition 3acolor 3afructose 3afrying 3aultrastructure 0abreaking strength 0afood processing 0avacuum1 aHwang, L.S.0 tFood research international.g2001, v. 34, no. 2/3 p.133-142aFood research international (Ottawa, Ont.)x0963-99697nnas  aDNAL  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01735naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012400127300001400251520098600265650001301251700001601264700001301280773012201293852000901415930003301424945001301457946001101470655001201481IND2325130520221118234558.0020201s2000    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232513052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasaai, M.R.10aMaster curve for concentration dependence of semi-dilute solution viscosity of chitosan homologues: the Martin equation  ap. 63-67.  aThe concentration dependence of solution viscosity of polymers is described by Martin equation up to moderate concentrations, and the equation constant provides a measure of polymer-polymer interactions in a given solvent. A set of chitosan homologues with degree of acetylation (DA) in the range of 17-25 % and intrinsic viscosity, [eta], in the range of 10.9-6.25 dlg(-1) were prepared by hydrolysis with HCl. Another set of chitosan fragments (DA of 22-26% and [eta] of 1.21-8.37 dlg(-1)) were prepared by oxidative scission with NaNO2. For the first set of chitosan homologues, the Martin constant, was found to be 37.8 x 10(-2) in 0.25 M HAc/0.25 M NaAc, while for the second set of homologues in 0.1 M HAc/0.02 M NaCl, it was 15.0 x 10(-2). This suggests that the later was a better solvent for chitosan. A linear master curve in the dilute and semi-dilute regimes (c[eta] of 1.0 to 9.0) was obtained to describe the concentration dependence of the flow behavior of chitosan. 3apolymers1 aCharlet, G.1 aArul, J.0 tFood research international.g2000, v. 33, no. 1 p.63-67aFood research international (Ottawa, Ont.)x0963-99697nnas  aDNAL  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01918naa a2200229 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006800126300001600194500007500210520117700285650002201462773012601484852000901610930003301619945001301652946001101665655001201676IND2325130620221118234621.0020201s2000    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232513062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJordana, J.10aTraditional foods: challenges facing the European food industry  ap. 147-152.  aIn the special issue: Improved traditional foods for the next century.  aBrief analysis about the meaning of traditional food products and the delicate situation of this kind of product in a global market, where consumers are requiring a great amount of nutritional and cheap foods, is presented. These demands have contributed to the production and distribution of food stuffs by big industrial and commercial corporations that are looking for consumer satisfaction, thus homogenising what is eaten in each country, although with a great diversity of brands and displays. Traditional foods are thus restricted by the current conditions in the market but they have good perspectives for growing in the future if some challenges are accomplished. These challenges are communication (a traditional product is exotic in the other markets and then has to be advertised), legal protection of collective brands (insufficiently guaranteed in the different markets of the European Union), quality assurance (that, as in all the branded products must be a priority objective) and innovation. Most of these challenges will only be accomplished through an efficient and jointly shared organisation of the small industries that produce this kind of product. 3atraditional foods0 tFood research international.g2000, v. 33, no. 3/4 p.147-152aFood research international (Ottawa, Ont.)x0963-99697nnas  aDNAL  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03141naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100002300162245016700185300001600352500002400368520119900392650002501591650002101616650001101637650002501648650001901673650003101692650001101723650001801734650006001752650006401812650001201876650003201888650010401920650004402024650003202068650002402100650002002124650005002144650002202194650002902216650002802245650004802273700002802321700002202349700002802371773012002399852000902519856008302528655001202611IND4478198220221118234640.0140307s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447819822DNAL7 a146724502pmid7 a10.1023/A:10273642277382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiménez-Pardo, C.10aCholinesterase and Phosphatase Activities in Adults and Infective-stage Larvae of Levamisole-resistant and Levamisole-susceptible Isolates of Haemonchus contortus  ap. 611-623.  aIncludes references  aCholinesterase (ChE) and acid phosphatase (AP) activities, but not alkaline phosphatase activities, were detected in cytosolic and membrane-bound fractions of adult and infective-stage larvae of levamisole-resistant and levamisole-susceptible Haemonchus contortus. In contrast to other gastrointestinal nematodes, the ChE activity was higher in L3 than in adults and, in both cases, was mainly associated with membranes. ChE activity was inhibited by Triton X-100 and was only detected in membrane-bound fractions when the detergent was removed. Differences between resistant and susceptible L3 were observed in the response to inhibitors (cytosolic fraction) and in the enzymatic content (membrane-bound fraction). Phosphatase activity was detected at acidic pH in all fractions, being higher in the adult than in the L3 stage. In the former, most of the enzyme was localized in the membrane-bound fractions, whereas in the latter it was mainly in cytosolic fractions. This difference could be correlated with the activity in the gut. In inhibition assays, a difference between cytosolic fractions from resistant and susceptible adults was observed in their response to 1 mmol/L tartaric acid. 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aacid phosphatase 3aadults 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acholinesterase 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3alarvae 3atartaric acid 2aAcid Phosphatasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxpharmacology 2aBenzenaminium, 4,4'-(3-oxo-1,5-pentanediyl)bis(N,N-dimethyl-N-2-propenyl-), Dibromidexpharmacology 2aCholinesterase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aCholinesterasesxmetabolism 2aCytosolxenzymology 2aDrug Resistance 2aHaemonchusxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aLarvaxenzymology 2aLevamisolexpharmacology 2aOctoxynolxpharmacology 2aTetraisopropylpyrophosphamidexpharmacology1 aMartínez-Grueiro, M.M.1 aGómez-Barrio, A.1 aRodríguez-Caabeiro, F.0 tVeterinary research communications.g2003 Dec., v. 27, no. 8 p.611-623dKluwer Academic Publishersx0165-73807nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10273642277383Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01910naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012000127300001400247520110900261650001001370700001601380700001601396700001801412700001401430773012201444852000901566930003301575945001301608946001101621655001201632IND2325130320221118234743.0020201s2000    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232513032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaudonus, J.10aEffect of oligomeric or polymeric additives on glass transition, viscosity and crystallization of amorphous isomalt  ap. 41-51.  aThe main purpose of this study was to further improve the stability of the amorphous state of isomalt by the addition of high molecular weight compounds. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the glass transition temperature Tg of a series of polyol mixtures containing isomalt as a function of water content. As expected, for each mixture Tg decreased with increasing moisture. Only with the addition of more than 75% of higher molecular weight compounds to isomalt an increase of Tg could be achieved. Moisture content and time dependent phase transitions in the metastable amorphous state of the mixtures strongly affect the storage stability of isomalt hard candies. Storage tests indicated a markedly accelerated water absorption and crystallization when oligomeric or polymeric compounds were added to amorphous isomalt. Rheological experiments showed that in contrast to pure isomalt melts, the viscosity of melts containing oligomeric or polymeric additives deviated from the model curve predicted by the Williams-Landel-Ferry-kinetics (WLF) with increasing water content. 3acandy1 aBernard, J.1 aJanssen, H.1 aKowalczyk, J.1 aCarle, R.0 tFood research international.g2000, v. 33, no. 1 p.41-51aFood research international (Ottawa, Ont.)x0963-99697nnas  aDNAL  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01736naa a2200229 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006600125300001400191520106800205650001701273700001601290773012201306852000901428930003301437945001301470946001101483655001201494IND2325130120221118234621.0020201s2000    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232513012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurkus, Z.10aStabilization of emulsions and foams using barley beta-glucan  ap. 27-33.  aBarley beta-glucan (BBG) is receiving increasing attention as a food hydrocolloid. Stability of foams and emulsions was assessed using whey protein concentrate (WPC) as an emulsifier and foaming agent, and BEG gum extracted at pilot plant or laboratory scale as a stabilizer. WPC had a significant lowering effect (P less than or equal to 0.05) on surface tension of water and water-oil interfacial tension, while the effect of beta-glucan was time dependent. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that BBG formed a gelled network, responsible for stabilizing, that melts at 58-62 degrees C. Reversible gels of BBG melt around 63 degrees C. Emulsion (50% o/w) droplet size decreased several fold when prepared with BBC gum and phase separation was substantially decreased. Foam volume and 50% drainage were significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) improved upon addition of beta-glucan. Sugar significantly enhanced foam stability only when used together with beta-glucan. BBG shows potential as a stabilizer in foam- and emulsion-type food products. 3abeta-glucans1 aTemelli, F.0 tFood research international.g2000, v. 33, no. 1 p.27-33aFood research international (Ottawa, Ont.)x0963-99697nnas  aDNAL  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03491naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165100002200174245015100196300001600347500002400363520202000387650001602407650001902423650003102442650004802473650002302521650001302544650001402557650001902571650001702590650002002607650000902627650002302636650002602659700002002685700002602705773012302731852000902854856008702863930003302950945002502983946001303008655001203021IND4433874020140725000000.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443387402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2009.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ116 0aQ126 0aQ5061 aMoreno, Helena M.10aUse of microbial transglutaminase and sodium alginate in the preparation of restructured fish models using cold gelation: Effect of frozen storage  ap. 394-400.  aIncludes references  aChanges in physicochemical properties of raw-appearing restructured models made from hake (Merluccius capensis) muscle, using cold gelation technology by addition of sodium alginate and microbial transglutaminase (MTGase), were studied during frozen storage at −15°C. Among the more interesting results, addition of MTGase produced more protein aggregation in models processed by muscle homogenization and thus the protein network that formed in the gel was better than in samples with added sodium alginate. All samples presented enhanced changes in mechanical properties such as gel strength in the course of frozen storage. The protein network that formed was better organized as shown by the ultrastructure analysis and by protein aggregation data from the beginning of storage, and as a result Water Binding Capacity was greater in restructured models processed by muscle homogenization. Some of the models studied presented lipid oxidation during frozen storage, slightly more in the ones with MTGase added. Industrial Relevance: The industrial relevance of the present work is to establish bases for using fish fillet trimmings and minced muscle to prepare restructured products that can be commercialized in a raw state and that could also support frozen storage in order to prolong the self-life in the market. The models studied here are not final products but the base with which to prepare them. One possibility of them is to process this kind of products with technologies normally used in whole fish muscle such as smoked fish fillets, carpaccios or marinated products. In addition, these raw restructured products can be commercialized to be cooked as a normal fresh fish fillet or pieces of fillet in a variety of preparations, and also products that contain a high amount of salt. Samples elaborated by binding larger muscle fragments imitate well the original fibrousness of the muscle so that it could be used to elaborate products similar to hamburgers or others that will be fried in batter. 3afrozen fish 3amuscle tissues 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3amodel food systems 3agelation 3aalginates 3afrozen storage 3afood storage 3astorage quality 3ahake 3aprotein aggregates 3amechanical properties1 aCarballo, José1 aBorderías, A.

Dexamethasone also caused an increase in the number of B lymphocytes. 3aB-lymphocytes 3abacteria 3acats 3adexamethasone 3amonocytes 3aneutrophils 2aAnimals 2aCatsximmunology 2aDexamethasonexpharmacology 2aErythrocyte Countxveterinary 2aFemale 2aFlow Cytometryxveterinary 2aGlucocorticoidsximmunology 2aHematocritxveterinary 2aHemoglobinsxmetabolism 2aLeukocyte Countxveterinary 2aLymphocyte Subsetsximmunology 2aMale 2aMonocytesxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aNeutrophilsxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aPhagocytosisxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aRespiratory Burstxdrug effectsximmunology.1 aWinnicka,A.1 aJagielski, D.1 aLechowski, R.0 tVeterinary research communications.g2003 Dec., v. 27, no. 8 p.643-652dKluwer Academic Publishersx0165-73807nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10273765304633Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04184naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165072000900174100002400183245018300207300001600390500002400406500001500430520230600445650002502751650002302776650001902799650002102818650002402839650002302863650002702886650001502913650002102928650001502949650003602964650002503000650002603025651001003051653002503061700002103086700002003107700002703127700002203154700002203176700002203198700002203220700002703242700002303269773012303292852000903415856008703424930003303511945002503544946001303569655001203582IND4433874220140725000000.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443387422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2009.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ205 0aQ505 0aT300 0aX3801 aDambolena, José S.10aEssential oils composition of Ocimum basilicum L. and Ocimum gratissimum L. from Kenya and their inhibitory effects on growth and fumonisin production by Fusarium verticillioides  ap. 410-414.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis work investigated the constituents and the efficacy against Fusarium verticillioides infection and fumonisin production of essential oils of Ocimum basilicum L. and Ocimum gratissimum L. from different locations in Kenya. The oil of leaves and flowering tops of O. basilicum from Sagana contained mainly linalool (95%). The flowering tops and leaves from Yatta contained mainly camphor (32.6 and 31.0%, respectively) and linalool (28.2 and 29.3, respectively). Eugenol was the main constituent in the oil of O. gratissimum leaves from both Sagana (95.5%) and Yatta (70.1%). The oil of the flowering tops had significantly less eugenol. The main component of the oil of flowering tops from Yatta was Z-β-ocimene (34.1%). Oil from both species had some antifungal activity. The oils of O. basilicum and O. gratissimum from different locations showed chemical variation, antifungal activity, free radical scavenging capacity and antimycotoxicogenic property. These properties are attributed to the phenolic compound eugenol. Industrial relevance: This manuscript gives the chemical composition and some biological effects of essential oil of two Ocimum species in Kenya namely Ocimum basilicum L. and Ocimum gratissimum L. The work reveals that there are chemovarieties of these plants in different locations in the country. Of significance is the presence of very high amounts of linalool in one chemovariety of O. basilicum while geranial and neral are major in another. The third variety contains almost equal amounts of camphor and linalool. The first two containing high quantities of linalool, geranial and neral could be cultivated after agronomic studies to provide essential oils useful in perfumery, soap or food industry while that containing camphor and linalool may find use in medicine. Proper seed selection and good agricultural practice for O. gratissimum containing high amount of eugenol could serve as good substitute for cloves which grows best only in a few islands in East Africa. Clove oil due to its high eugenol content has many biological activities including those demonstrated in the present work, and many applications in medicine and commercial world. There is need for more research on these plants especially on cultivation and commercial exploitation of the herbs. 3achemical composition 3aOcimum gratissimum 3aessential oils 3aOcimum basilicum 3atissue distribution 3aFusarium fujikuroi 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afumonisins 3amicrobial growth 3aprovenance 3achemical constituents of plants 3aantioxidant activity 3aantifungal properties 3aKenya 0aGibberella fujikuroi1 aZunino, Maria P.1 aLópez, Abel G.1 aRubinstein, Héctor R.1 aZygadlo, Julio A.1 aMwangi, Julius W.1 aThoithi, Grace N.1 aKibwage, Isaac O.1 aMwalukumbi, Josphat M.1 aKariuki, Samuel T.0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2010 Apr., v. 11, no. 2 p.410-414dElsevier Sciencex1466-85647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2009.08.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20110615b20110701c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/03  aOther US 7aarticle03524naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156100001400165245005700179300001600236500002400252500001500276520218700291650002802478650001802506650001602524650002002540650001602560650001002576650002602586650002202612650002402634650000902658653001602667653001602683653001902699700001802718700002802736773012302764852000902887856008702896930003302983945002503016946001303041655001203054IND4433873320221118235005.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443387332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2010.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ5051 aIgual, M.10aNon-conventional techniques to obtain grapefruit jam  ap. 335-341.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDifferent grapefruit jams obtained by conventional, osmotic dehydration (OD) without thermal treatment and microwave (MW) techniques were compared. A kinetic study was previously carried out to characterize the fruit OD process in order to manufacture OD jams. Fibres from bamboo, apple and orange were incorporated into OD jams. Soluble solids, moisture, water activity, pH, consistency, flow properties and colour were evaluated for all jams. The jams obtained by the OD process had a colour more similar to the fresh fruit than the heated ones, but the addition of fibre was necessary to improve the consistency. However, the MW procedure affects colour in a similar way to conventional heating but increases the consistency of the samples. Industrial relevance: The consumption of grapefruit may be as fresh fruit, juice or jam. The application of prolonged heat treatments to the fruit, such as in the case of jams and juices, can lead to important losses of the beneficial properties of this citrus fruit. Osmotic dehydration at mild temperature is a technique that could be used to obtain jam without being so aggressive to the fruit. On the other hand, the use of microwave energy has been proposed as an alternative to traditional heat pasteurisation in order to better preserve the natural organoleptic characteristics and essential thermolabile nutrients of grapefruit juice, due to the shorter processing time required. In this work the quality of different grapefruit jams obtained by applying alternative procedures to the conventional one has been compared. Osmotic dehydration and microwave energy were applied as alternatives to conventional heating and bamboo, apple and orange fibres were added and compared with conventional pectin. The osmotic dehydration procedure used produces jams with lower sugar content but with a colour very similar to that of the fresh fruit. Nevertheless, fibre should be added to improve the consistency of the samples, bamboo exhibiting the flow properties most similar to conventional jam. On the other hand, microwaves affect the colour of the product in a similar way to conventional heating but increase the consistency of jams. 3afood processing quality 3afood analysis 3amethodology 3afood processing 3agrapefruits 3acolor 3anonthermal processing 3afruit composition 3amicrowave treatment 3ajams 0aconsistency 0anew methods 0afruit products1 aContreras, C.1 aMartínez-Navarrete, N.0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2010 Apr., v. 11, no. 2 p.335-341dElsevier Sciencex1466-85647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2010.01.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/03  aOther US 7aarticle02713naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156100002400165245006200189300001600251500002400267500001500291520141800306650002801724650001801752650001701770650000901787650001701796650001601813650002001829650002401849650001001873650002201883650002301905653001601928700003301944773012301977852000902100856008702109930003302196945002502229946001302254655001202267IND4433873420221118234836.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443387342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2009.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ5051 aGoula, Athanasia M.12aA new technique for spray drying orange juice concentrate  ap. 342-351.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA new technique for spray drying concentrated orange juice using dehumidified air as drying medium and maltodextrin as drying agent was developed. A pilot-scale spray dryer was employed for the spray drying process. The modification made to the original design consisted in connecting the dryer inlet air intake to an absorption air dryer. 21 DE, 12 DE, and 6 DE maltodextrins were used as drying agents. Concentrated orange juice was spray dried at inlet air temperatures of 110, 120, 130, and 140°C and (concentrated orange juice solids)/(maltodextrin solids) ratios of 4, 2, 1, and 0.25. Data for the residue remaining on the walls were gathered and the powders were analyzed for moisture content, bulk density, rehydration, hygroscopicity, and degree of caking. The combination of maltodextrin addition and use of dehumidified air was proved to be an effective way of reducing residue formation. Industrial relevance: Orange juice powder has many benefits and economic potentials over its liquid counterparts and provides a stable, natural, easily dosable ingredient, which generally finds usage in many foods and pharmaceutical products such as flavoring and coloring agents. However, the dehydration of orange juice is not a simple task. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop a new technique for spray drying orange juice using dehumidified air as drying medium and maltodextrin as drying agent. 3afood processing quality 3afood analysis 3aspray drying 3aflow 3aorange juice 3amethodology 3afood processing 3areconstituted foods 3acolor 3afruit composition 3ajuice concentrates 0anew methods1 aAdamopoulos, Konstantinos G.0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2010 Apr., v. 11, no. 2 p.342-351dElsevier Sciencex1466-85647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2009.12.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/03  aOther US 7aarticle01959naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245006300130300001600193520098600209650002201195650001001217650002101227650002501248650003301273650002701306650001501333653001901348653001801367653001801385700001601403773012401419852000901543930003301552945001301585946001101598655001201609IND2205645820221118235022.0000710s1999    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220564582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreitas, A.M.C.10aCoffee geographic origin--an aid to coffee differentiation  ap. 565-573.  aPrincipal component analysis and hierarchical clustering methods were used to differentiate coffees from 8 different origins produced by the same manufacturer.

The aroma fraction can successfully be employed to characterise roasted coffees of different origins. The effect of roasting is emphasised when the same method is applied to green coffees of the same origins and the same manufacturer. This paper reports the possibility of characterising roasted coffee by PCA of some of the aroma compounds through the use of a purge and trap sampling device and GC-FID analysis. The aroma fraction was obtained after milling the beans over controlled conditions and using the purge and trap sampling technique as sample introducing system for GC analysis.

Citrus is among the top three fruits in the region. With a population of 1597 million, the per capita /annum citrus fruit availability is 7.67 kg. Mandarin and sweet orange are the major citrus fruits constituting 84%, followed by acid lime, lemon and other citrus (16%). Postharvest management is mostly on conventional lines. In north-west India and Pakistan, Kinnow (King Ã Willowleaf hybrid) is sorted, washed, waxed and packed in modern packing houses. Harvesting is done by clippers for Kinnow, by snapping for âNagpurâ mandarin (Citrus reticulate Blanco) and by bamboo harvesters for âKhasiâ mandarin (Citrus reticulate Blanco). Total losses from farm to retail level in the region are 25-35% and vary with season and commodity. Acid lime losses increase with the onset of monsoon. Wooden boxes are used for mandarins. Oranges and acid limes are packed in jute bags. Bamboo containers âdokoâ are used in Nepal, Bhutan and North-East Hill (NEH) region of India for âKhasiâ mandarin. Transportation of loose fruit in trucks is common. Refrigerated storage warehouses and modern packinghouses are being established. Citrus fruits are sold in supermarkets. Modified atmosphere packaging increased shelf life of mandarins up to 3 weeks. The use of evaporative cool chambers (1.5-8 tonnes capacity and very low energy consumption) extended the storage life of Nagpur mandarin, Mosambi orange (Citrus sinensis Osbeck), acid lime (Citrus aurantifolia Swingle), Kinnow and grapefruit (Citrus paradise Macf.) up to 21, 40, 30, 60 and 77 days in respect to 10,14, 5, 14, and 27 days at ambient condition, respectively. Cellar stores are used in Nepal and Bhutan. The export of Kinnow from Pakistan is increasing. India exported nearly 55260 tonnes of citrus fruits in 2010. The value chain and postharvest overview in south Asia including postharvest research, conventional and innovative handling, storage structures, modern infrastructure and future challenges and prospects are discussed in this review paper. 3aCitrus aurantiifolia 3aCitrus reticulata 3aCitrus sinensis 3abags 3abamboos 3acold storage 3aenergy 3aexports 3afarms 3afruits 3agrapefruits 3aharvesters 3aharvesting 3ahybrids 3ainfrastructure 3ajute 3alemons 3alimes 3amandarins 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3amonsoon season 3aoranges 3apacking houses 3apostharvest technology 3ashelf life 3asupermarkets 3asupply chain 3atransportation 3atrucks 3awarehouses 3aBangladesh 3aBhutan 3aIndia 3aNepal 3aPakistan 3aSri Lanka0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Jan. 20, , no. 1065 p.1669-1676dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1065/1065_214.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle04102naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245015600161500015700317500001500474520256200489650001903051650001903070650002203089650002003111650002403131650003203155650002403187651001003211653003003221653002303251653006003274653002903334653002503363700001603388700001803404773006603422852000903488856008803497930003303585945002503618946001303643655001203656IND4368937820221118235006.0050412e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436893782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The hydraulic performance of surface barriers and their long-term effectiveness have been modeled based on soil physical and chemical characteristics, neglecting the potential contribution of soil microorganisms. We hypothesized that soil microorganisms may affect the long-term performance of surface barriers by altering soil structure, soil wettability, or soil pore water surface tensions. Two field-scale barrier prototypes were studied: the "thick soil" design and "capillary barrier" design. Two conceptual models for microbial distribution in the barriers were postulated: (i) due to excavation, mixing, and emplacement, soil microbial numbers and activity would be uniformly distributed throughout the barrier profile; and (ii) in capillary barriers, the presence of the coarse-fine interface would locally enhance microbial growth and create local effects on barrier properties. Our initial studies involved field sampling of thick and capillary barrier prototypes at two different locations, examination of the distributions of microorganisms and their activities in vertical transects through the barriers, and correlation of the biological measures with barrier hydraulic properties. We found relatively uniform distributions of microorganisms and activities across the barriers (both designs), consistent with the first conceptual model. The presence of a capillary barrier layer was not associated with a clear increase in microbial activities; however, finer resolution sampling may be required to evaluate the second conceptual model. Our observations of uniform (or increasing) microbial activities with depth in the barriers contrast with commonly observed decreases in soil microbial numbers and activities with depth at undisturbed sites. The indigenous soil microorganisms did not affect soil wettability or soil pore water interfacial tensions in these prototype barriers of <10 yr of age. However, on the time scales for which barriers are expected to be effective (100s to 1000s of years), microbially produced surface-active substances may alter barrier hydraulic performance. We propose laboratory studies to evaluate long-term consequences of microbially produced surface-active substance on barrier integrity and indicate how these effects can be incorporated into models predicting long-term barrier performance. 3awaste disposal 3asoil pollution 3apollution control 3ahazardous waste 3asoil microorganisms 3abiological activity in soil 3asoil water movement 3aIdaho 0asoil hydraulic properties 0acapillary barriers 0aIdaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory 0asoil transport processes 0awaste disposal sites1 aBaker, K.E.1 aMattson, E.D.0 tVadose zone journal.g2004 Feb., v. 3, no. 1x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/3/1/1343Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/22  aOther US 7aarticle02958naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245010400162500015700266500001500423520163000438650001302068650002202081650001402103650001402117650001702131650002102148650001402169650001602183650002402199653002402223653002002247700002002267700001502287773006602302852000902368856008802377930003302465945002502498946001302523655001202536IND4368937120221118234844.0050412e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436893712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Uncertainty in modeling flow processes  aIn the special section: Understanding subsurface flow and transport processes at the Idaho National Engineering & Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) Site.  a2019-12-05  aSimulations of flow and transport in variably saturated fractured rock generally assume equilibrium conditions between the fractures and the porous matrix, leading to predictions that are dominated by a diffusive process. Contrary to these predictions, an increasing body of evidence suggests that fracture-dominated flow, under nonequilibrium conditions between the fractures and porous matrix, occurs frequently in field and laboratory settings. Flow processes, such as fluid cascades and flow path switching, are often observed in laboratory experiments, but are generally not captured by diffusion-based conceptual and numerical models. Many of these processes are assumed to be averaged out at some representative elemental volume scale; however, anecdotal evidence from field experiments conducted at various scales of investigation suggest that this may not be the case. Comparison of experimental observations with numerical simulations illustrates at least two potential problems with standard equivalent continuum and discrete fracture conceptual models of unsaturated fractured and porous media flow. First, such models tend to overestimate the strength of interaction between the fracture and matrix domains. Second, model calibration may allow diffusion-based models to accurately reproduce experimental observations without providing a complete description of the physics governing the system. Failure to incorporate convective transport, reduced fracture-matrix interaction, and other sub-grid-scale processes in models of flow in fractured porous media may result in erroneous descriptions of system behavior. 3adolomite 3asimulation models 3aequations 3alimestone 3aporous media 3aunsaturated flow 3adiffusion 3avadose zone 3asoil water movement 0amathematical models 0afractured rocks1 aPodgorney, R.K.1 aWood, T.R.0 tVadose zone journal.g2004 Feb., v. 3, no. 1x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/3/1/1013Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/22  aOther US 7aarticle01658naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245002000129300001400149520087000163650002301033650002901056650001901085650001901104650002801123651001901151773013201170852000901302930003301311945001301344946001101357655001201368IND2333680220221118234820.0030717e200208  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233368022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichmond, J.D.14aThe BIG picture  ap. 71-73.  aThe Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 makes provision for the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes.

The present study investigated whether Forsythia suspensa extract could attenuate purified soybean β-conglycinin-induced anaphylactic reactions in weaned piglets. Materials and methods: Eighteen 14-day-old piglets were sensitized and boosted by oral administration of purified β-conglycinin. Forsythia suspensa extract was supplemented in the diet after the initial sensitization and continued for the remainder of the experiment. Piglets were challenged on day 28, and anaphylactic symptoms, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, plasma histamine and intestinal microbial flora were analyzed. T-cell proliferative responses and cytokine production were also determined. Results: Forsythia suspensa extract alleviated β-conglycinin-induced anaphylactic symptoms by markedly reducing anaphylactic antibodies, mast cell degranulation, and histamine release while improving intestinal microbial flora. Furthermore, Forsythia suspensa extract significantly suppressed β-conglycinin-induced T lymphocyte proliferation and IL-4 synthesis. Conclusion: Forsythia suspensa extract protected β-conglycinin-sensitized piglets from anaphylactic reactions. Forsythia suspensa extract may provide a novel effective therapy for soybean allergy. 3apiglet feeding 3aT-lymphocytes 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aoral administration 3aweanlings 3aantibodies 3amedicinal properties 3afeed supplements 3aanaphylaxis 3abeta-conglycinin 3acell proliferation 3afood allergies 3ahistamine 3asoybeans 3aallergens 3aForsythia suspensa 3aanimal models 3amast cells 3ainterleukin-4 3apiglets 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 0acytokines 0ahypersensitivity1 aLi, Defa1 aPiao, Xianglan1 aPiao, Xiangshu0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2010 Mar. 24, v. 128, no. 2 p.412-418dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2010.01.0353Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02522naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245011900130300001800249500014500267520110700412650002601519650001901545650002101564650001901585650002001604650002301624650001801647650001501665650001101680650001301691650002001704650001801724650001001742650002101752651001001773651001101783700002401794700001601818700001501834700001901849773014701868856005202015852000902067655001202076IND4511316520221118234738.0150505e20150120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451131652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConsoli, Simona10aEvapotranspiration over an irrigated orange orchard using micrometeorological techniques and sap flow measurements  ap. 1725-1730.  aPaper presented at the XII International Citrus Congress - International Society of Citriculture, held November 18-23, 2012, Valencia, Spain  aDuring recent years, a substantial progress in understanding the evolution of evapotranspiration processes in cropping systems has produced detailed models and innovative measurement techniques for describing the mass (water, CO2) and energy (solar radiation) exchanges in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Within this context, the aim of the study was to investigate, develop and validate integrated approaches to better understand and quantify mass and energy exchange processes in an orange orchard in the Mediterranean environment. Different micrometeorological techniques (i.e. surface renewal analysis of sensible heat flux, surface energy balance) were used to estimate the evapotranspiration fluxes of the irrigated orange grove in eastern Sicily (Italy). Transpiration was determined by the sap flow method. The results showed satisfactory comparisons between the investigated methods. The findings of this study will allow for the definition of suitable techniques and methodology for the rational management of water resources in the tree crop environment under water scarcity conditions. 3aMediterranean climate 3acarbon dioxide 3acropping systems 3aenergy balance 3aenergy transfer 3aevapotranspiration 3aheat transfer 3airrigation 3amodels 3asap flow 3asolar radiation 3atranspiration 3atrees 3awater management 3aItaly 3aSicily1 aContinella, Alberto1 aMotisi, A.,1 aPapa, Rita1 aPasotti, Luigi0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Jan. 20, , no. 1065 p.1725-1730dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1065/1065_221.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245009900161300001600260500002400276520170700300650001602007650001502023650001102038650001802049650001502067650002502082650001202107650003002119650001602149650001702165650001002182650002302192650001402215650001802229650001102247650001702258653002602275653003802301653002202339653001802361653002102379700002502400700002202425700002302447773008002470852000902550856004802559655001202607IND4397145820221118234856.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439714582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-007-0162-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Prem10aRoot anatomy of Pinus taeda L.: seasonal and environmental effects on development in seedlings  ap. 693-706.  aIncludes references  aThe environmental and seasonal effects on anatomical traits of Pinus taeda L. seedling roots were studied in the laboratory in three contrasting root growth media and also in typical outdoor nursery culture. Growth media with lower water regimen and high penetration resistance caused a reduction in lengths of the white and condensed tannin (CT) zones and acceleration of development of suberin lamellae in the endodermis. As a possible counter to this reduction in zone lengths, second-order laterals were produced closer to the tips of first-order laterals. This suggested there may be an advantage to producing more shorter roots under stressful conditions. Under outdoor nursery conditions (June to mid-December) the white zone was always a rather small part of the root system surface area (4.5% in December), but it dominated as a provider of cortical plasmalemma surface area (CPSA) in contact with modified soil solution (65% in December) because of its live cortex and capacity to increase nearly three fold the amount of CPSA per unit root length. The CT zone always provided most of the total root surface area (80% in December). Although it had no live cortex, a few cells of the CT zone endodermis remained non-suberized passage cells, perhaps giving this major part of the root system some capacity for ion and water absorption. A late summer increase in CPSA was due largely to the rapid production of mycorrhizae. Root systems were capable of very rapid replacement of roots lost due to undercutting and lateral root pruning. The great variation in CPSA per unit root length contained in the white, mycorrhizal and CT zones suggested a capacity to adapt rapidly to changing conditions. 3aPinus taeda 3aabsorption 3acortex 3aculture media 3aendodermis 3aenvironmental impact 3apruning 3aresistance to penetration 3aroot growth 3aroot systems 3aroots 3aseasonal variation 3aseedlings 3asoil solution 3asummer 3asurface area 0aCondensed tannin zone 0aCortical plasmalemma surface area 0aMycorrhizal roots 0aPassage cells 0aSuberin lamellae1 aHallgren, Stephen W.1 aEnstone, Daryl E.1 aPeterson, Carol A.0 tTrees.g2007 Nov., v. 21, no. 6 p.693-706dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-007-0162-y 7aarticle02690naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245012600163500035100289520110000640650002201740650002001762650002901782650001601811650002101827650002201848650001801870650001801888651001201906653001401918653001601932700001801948700001901966700001701985700002002002773006602022852000902088856008802097930003302185945002502218946001302243655001202256IND4368923720221118234754.0050412e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436892372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Ferre and G.J. Kluitenberg.  Paper presented at a symposium "Physical Measurements in the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere System: I. Advances in Measurements at and Below the Ground Surface--a Tribute to Clarke Topp" held November 10-14, 2002, Indianapolis, Indiana.  aA constant flux infiltration experiment was conducted to determine the feasibility of using downhole temperature measurements to estimate infiltration flux. Temperatures measured using a downhole thermistor within a 15.4-m-deep borehole compare well with temperatures measured with buried thermocouples in an adjacent borehole to 5 m depth. Numerical forward model simulations were conducted using VS2DI. A numerical sensitivity analysis showed that the temperature profile was most sensitive to the average temperature of the infiltrating water, the infiltration flux, and the specific heat capacity of dry soil. The high sensitivity of these variables allows for a simple sequential optimization to be used to estimate the average temperature of the infiltrating water, the water flux, and the specific heat capacity of dry soil from numerical inversion of temperature measurements. Downhole temperature measurements could be a useful complement to shallow streambed temperature methods, allowing for better quantification of the contribution of streambed infiltration to basin-scale recharge. 3aephemeral streams 3astream channels 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3astream flow 3asoil temperature 3awater temperature 3asoil profiles 3athermocouples 3aArizona 0aboreholes 0athermistors1 aFerre, T.P.A.1 aHoffmann, J.P.1 aRucker, D.F.1 aCallegary, J.B.0 tVadose zone journal.g2003 Nov., v. 2, no. 4x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/2/4/5953Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/22  aOther US 7aarticle03606naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245020300147300001800350500002400368500001500392520177200407650002402179650001302203650001602216650002602232650001802258650001902276650001502295650002002310650000902330650001502339650002402354650001402378650002302392650001202415650002702427650002202454650001202476650001502488650001502503650004202518650002102560650001102581650006502592650001102657650001102668650000902679653001302688700001802701700002302719700001702742700001502759700001802774700001802792773017302810852000902983655001202992IND4365714920221118234739.0041119e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436571492DNAL7 a155316982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTondeur, M.C.10aDetermination of iron absorption from intrinsically labeled microencapsulated ferrous fumarate (sprinkles) in infants with different iron and hematologic status by using a dual-stable-isotope method  ap. 1436-1444.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBackground: The use of microencapsulated ferrous fumarate sprinkles is a new approach for home fortification. Iron and hematologic status may affect the absorption of iron from sprinkles. Objective: The objective was to measure the absorption (corrected erythrocyte incorporation of 57Fe) of 2 different doses of iron from sprinkles added to a maize-based complementary food provided to infants with different iron and hematologic status. Design: Infants aged 6-18 mo were randomly assigned to receive either 30 (n = 45) or 45 (n = 45) mg elemental Fe as 57Fe-labeled sprinkles added to a maize-based porridge on 3 consecutive days. A 58Fe tracer (0.2 mg as ferrous citrate) was also infused intravenously (n = 46). Blood was drawn at baseline and 14 d later to determine erythrocyte incorporation of 57Fe and 58Fe by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. On the basis of hemoglobin and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations, subjects were classified as having iron deficiency anemia (IDA), iron deficiency (ID), or sufficient iron status. Results: There was no significant effect of dose on iron absorption (P > 0.05). Geometric mean iron absorption was 8.25% (range: 2.9-17.8%) in infants with IDA (n = 32), 4.48% (range: 1.1-10.6%) in infants with ID (n = 20), and 4.65% (range: 1.5-12.3%) in iron-sufficient infants (n = 20). Geometric mean iron absorption was significantly higher in infants with IDA than in infants with ID or iron-sufficient infants (P = 0.0004); however, there were no significant differences between infants with ID and iron-sufficient infants. Conclusion: During infancy, iron absorption from sprinkles in a maize-based porridge meets and surpasses requirements for absorbed iron and is up-regulated in infants with IDA. 3alabeling techniques 3acitrates 3atransferrin 3aintravenous injection 3aabsorbed dose 3ablood sampling 3aabsorption 3airon absorption 3airon 3ahemoglobin 3acomplementary foods 3areceptors 3amicroencapsulation 3ainfancy 3airon deficiency anemia 3amass spectrometry 3ainfants 2aAbsorption 2aAlgorithms 2aAnemia, Iron-Deficiencyxdrug therapy 2aDrug Compounding 2aFemale 2aFerrous Compoundsxbloodxpharmacokineticsxtherapeutic use. 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 0alabeling1 aSchauer, C.S.1 aChristofides, A.L.1 aAsante, K.P.1 aNewton, S.1 aSerfass, R.E.1 aZlotkin, S.H.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2004 Nov., v. 80, no. 5 p.1436-1444dThe American Society for Nutrition, with the assistance of Highwire Pressx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03575naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245019200204300001800396500002400414506007600438520192200514506003702436650002702473650001402500650002002514650003502534650002602569650001202595650002402607650002102631650002002652650001402672650001902686650001302705650001102718650001202729700002102741700003402762700002402796773013602820852000902956856008002965856004803045655001203093IND4391813620221207112436.0070529e20070601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439181362DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01056-062doi7 aPMC19326982pmcid7 a174166902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOestergaard, Jesko10aBinding of Cyt1Aa and Cry11Aa Toxins of Bacillus thuringiensis Serovar israelensis to Brush Border Membrane Vesicles of Tipula paludosa (Diptera: Nematocera) and Subsequent Pore Formation  ap. 3623-3629.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBacillus thuringiensis serovar israelensis (B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis) produces four insecticidal crystal proteins (ICPs) (Cry4A, Cry4B, Cry11A, and Cyt1A). Toxicity of recombinant B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis strains expressing only one of the toxins was determined with first instars of Tipula paludosa (Diptera: Nematocera). Cyt1A was the most toxic protein, whereas Cry4A, Cry4B, and Cry11A were virtually nontoxic. Synergistic effects were recorded when Cry4A and/or Cry4B was combined with Cyt1A but not with Cry11A. The binding and pore formation are key steps in the mode of action of B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis ICPs. Binding and pore-forming activity of Cry11Aa, which is the most toxic protein against mosquitoes, and Cyt1Aa to brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) of T. paludosa were analyzed. Solubilization of Cry11Aa resulted in two fragments, with apparent molecular masses of 32 and 36 kDa. No binding of the 36-kDa fragment to T. paludosa BBMVs was detected, whereas the 32-kDa fragment bound to T. paludosa BBMVs. Only a partial reduction of binding of this fragment was observed in competition experiments, indicating a low specificity of the binding. In contrast to results for mosquitoes, the Cyt1Aa protein bound specifically to the BBMVs of T. paludosa, suggesting an insecticidal mechanism based on a receptor-mediated action, as described for Cry proteins. Cry11Aa and Cyt1Aa toxins were both able to produce pores in T. paludosa BBMVs. Protease treatment with trypsin and proteinase K, previously reported to activate Cry11Aa and Cyt1Aa toxins, respectively, had the opposite effect. A higher efficiency in pore formation was observed when Cyt1A was proteinase K treated, while the activity of trypsin-treated Cry11Aa was reduced. Results on binding and pore formation are consistent with results on ICP toxicity and synergistic effect with Cyt1Aa in T. paludosa.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aCulicidae 3aTipula paludosa 3abrush border membrane vesicles 3ainsecticidal proteins 3ainstars 3amechanism of action 3amolecular weight 3aprotein binding 3aserotypes 3asolubilization 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3atrypsin1 aEhlers, Ralf-Udo1 aMartínez-Ramírez, Amparo C.1 aReal, Maria Dolores0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2007 June 1, v. 73, no. 11 p.3623-3629dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01056-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle03088naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245010800171300001600279500002400295520197900319650001002298650001302308650001102321650001302332650001002345650002202355651001902377651002202396651001902418700001702437700001702454700001602471700001702487700002002504773011402524852000902638856005502647655001202702IND4393355020070802032533.0070722e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439335502DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0426.2007.00891.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKillgore, K.J.10aDistribution, relative abundance and movements of pallid sturgeon in the free-flowing Mississippi River  ap. 476-483.  aIncludes references  aA multiyear study of pallid sturgeon distribution and relative abundance was conducted in the lower and middle Mississippi river (LMR and MMR, respectively). The LMR and MMR comprise the free-flowing Mississippi River extending 1857 river kilometers (rkm) from its mouth at the Gulf of Mexico upstream to the mouth of the Missouri River. A total of 219 pallid sturgeon and 6018 shovelnose sturgeon was collected during the periods 1996-1997 and 2000-2006. Trotlines baited with worms were the primary collecting gear. The smallest pallid sturgeon captured on trotlines was 405 mm FL and the largest was 995 mm FL. Mean size of pallid sturgeon was statistically smaller in the Mississippi River below the Atchafalaya River near Baton Rouge, LA (621 mm FL). Mean abundance (catch per trotline night) of pallid sturgeon was highest at water temperatures around 10°C. There was a latitudinal trend in mean abundance of pallid and shovelnose sturgeon, but the pattern differed between species. Pallid sturgeon abundance was statistically (P < 0.05) higher (0.3 fish per trotline night) in the lower reach between the Atchafalaya River and New Orleans (rkm 154-507), and at the Chain of Rocks (COR), a low water dam near the mouth of the Missouri River. Pallid sturgeon abundance between these two locations was statistically the same (0.12-0.23). Shovelnose sturgeon abundance increased going upstream, but was disproportionally higher at the COR (22 fish per line compared with <6 fish per line in other reaches). Overall, the ratio between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon varied from a high of 1 : 6 at the lower reach, and gradually decreased upstream to a low of 1 : 77 at the COR. Based on differences in sturgeon abundance, size and habitat characteristics, the free-flowing Mississippi River can be divided into two reaches in the MMR (i.e. COR is a separate location), and four reaches (i.e., including the Atchafalaya River) in the LMR where management goals may differ. 3agears 3ahabitats 3arivers 3asturgeon 3awater 3awater temperature 3aGulf of Mexico 3aMississippi River 3aMissouri River1 aHoover, J.J.1 aGeorge, S.G.1 aLewis, B.R.1 aMurphy, C.E.1 aLancaster, W.E.0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2007 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.476-483dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0175-86597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2007.00891.x 7aarticle03594naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001900182245012200201300001800323500002400341506007600365520166700441506003702108650001402145650001702159650002002176650002302196650001402219650002202233650001802255650001902273650002102292650003802313650000902351650002202360650001702382650002802399650002202427650001302449650002802462650004302490650001902533650003102552650003302583650005002616650001502666650002402681700002102705700001702726700002202743700002202765773011502787852000902902856008102911655001202992IND4459544120221207104132.0110701e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445954412DNAL7 a215623352pmid7 aPMC31359412pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.111.1770302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshikawa, Chie10aFunctional Incorporation of Sorghum Small Subunit Increases the Catalytic Turnover Rate of Rubisco in Transgenic Rice  ap. 1603-1611.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRubisco limits photosynthetic CO₂ fixation because of its low catalytic turnover rate (kcat) and competing oxygenase reaction. Previous attempts to improve the catalytic efficiency of Rubisco by genetic engineering have gained little progress. Here we demonstrate that the introduction of the small subunit (RbcS) of high kcat Rubisco from the C₄ plant sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) significantly enhances kcat of Rubisco in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa). Three independent transgenic lines expressed sorghum RbcS at a high level, accounting for 30%, 44%, and 79% of the total RbcS. Rubisco was likely present as a chimera of sorghum and rice RbcS, and showed 1.32- to 1.50-fold higher kcat than in nontransgenic rice. Rubisco from transgenic lines showed a higher Km for CO₂ and slightly lower specificity for CO₂ than nontransgenic controls. These results suggest that Rubisco in rice transformed with sorghum RbcS partially acquires the catalytic properties of sorghum Rubisco. Rubisco content in transgenic lines was significantly increased over wild-type levels but Rubisco activation was slightly decreased. The expression of sorghum RbcS did not affect CO₂ assimilation rates under a range of CO₂ partial pressures. The Jmax/Vcmax ratio was significantly lower in transgenic line compared to the nontransgenic plants. These observations suggest that the capacity of electron transport is not sufficient to support the increased Rubisco capacity in transgenic rice. Although the photosynthetic rate was not enhanced, the strategy presented here opens the way to engineering Rubisco for improvement of photosynthesis and productivity in the future.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aC4 plants 3aOryza sativa 3aSorghum bicolor 3acatalytic activity 3achimerism 3aelectron transfer 3agrain sorghum 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein subunits 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3arice 3atransgenic plants 2aBiocatalysis 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aEnzyme Activation 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexmetabolism 2aSolubility 2aSorghumxenzymology1 aHatanaka, Tomoko1 aMisoo, Shuji1 aMiyake, Chikahiro1 aFukayama, Hiroshi0 tPlant physiology.g2011 July, v. 156, no. 3 p.1603-1611dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.111.1770303Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02862naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100002600146245011700172300002000289500002400309500001500333520116600348650002401514650001901538650002801557650001101585650003701596650001901633650002501652653003201677653003201709653001901741653003101760653003101791653001701822653002301839700001901862700002101881700001901902700002101921700001701942700001901959700002101978773017601999852000902175856007702184930003302261945002502294946001302319655001202332IND4438607120221118234544.0100617e20100609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443860712DNAL7 a10.1021/jf100569j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5001 aReis, Bruno de Souza.10aStructure−Property−Activity Relationship of Phenolic Acids and Derivatives.

Herein, structure−property studies on the antiradical activity of a series of protocatechuic acid alkyl esters have been accomplished. The increase of the lipophilicity was shown to significantly improve the antioxidant activity of protocatechuic esters. Their efficiency as radical scavengers was evaluated using distinctive analytical methods, namely, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) UV/visible method, electrochemistry, and differential scanning calorimetry. All the new alkyl protocatechuate antioxidants studied possessed better radical-scavenging capacity than the natural antioxidant protocatechuic acid. This work has shown that the alkyl ester side chain markedly influences the lipophilicity of this type of phenolic system without disturbing the core of the molecule responsible for antioxidant activity. The data on the antioxidant activity obtained using the different analytical methods correlated well with each other and have revealed the interesting antioxidant potential of alkyl esters of protocatechuic acid. 3aprotocatechuic acid 3aphytochemicals 3afree radical scavengers 3aesters 3astructure-activity relationships 3ahydrophobicity 3aantioxidant activity 0aprotocatechuic propyl ester 0aprotocatechuic methyl ester 0aphenolic acids 0aphysicochemical properties 0aprotocatechuic ethyl ester 0aantioxidants 0achemical structure1 aMartins, Marta1 aBarreto, Barbara1 aMilhazes, Nuno1 aGarrido, Manuela1 aSilva, Paulo1 aGarrido, Jorge1 aBorges, Fernanda0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 June 9, v. 58, no. 11 p.6986–6993-6986–6993dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf100569j3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100913b20101001c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/08/16  aOther US 7aarticle01809naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005300128300001600181520100400197650001101201650001301212650002401225653002801249653001701277700001401294700001501308700001501323773009101338852000901429930003301438945001301471946001101484655001201495IND2047838120221118234502.0950920e19950807enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204783812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThuijsman, F.10aAutomata, matching and foraging behavior of bees  ap. 305-316.  aUsing the approach of bounded rationality and myopic learning, we attempt to explain why bees (as examples of a forager animal) do the right (optimal) thing in an environment of many foragers, namely to adopt the Ideal Free Distribution, but do the wrong thing when they are alone, namely stick to the Matching Law. We discuss two types of simple foraging strategies for bees. Each of these explicit strategies explains that in a multi-bee community the bees will distribute themselves over the nectar sources according to the Ideal Free Distribution. At the same time, these strategies explain that in single-bee experimental settings a bee will match, by its number of visits, the nectar supply from the available sources (the Matching Law). Moreover, both strategies explain that in certain situations the bees may behave as if they are risk averse. These results indicate that a competitive market in a multi-bee community permits individuals to be boundedly rational and still forage optimally. 3aApidae 3aforaging 3amathematical models 0aideal free distribution 0amatching law1 aPeleg, B.1 aAmitai, M.1 aShmida, A.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g1995 Aug. 7, v. 175, no. 3 p.305-316x0022-51937nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02890naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002100127245008500148500008600233500001500319520164400334650001901978650001701997650002302014650002702037650001302064650001102077650001602088650002402104651001002128653001602138653002902154700001602183700001802199700001802217773006502235852000902300856008802309930003302397945002502430946001302455655001202468IND4368949120221118234454.0050413e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436894912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHelm-Clark, C.M.10aNeutron log measurement of moisture in unsaturated basalt: progress and problems  aIn the special section: Uncertainty in vadoze zone flow and transport properties.  a2019-12-05  aThe research described here examines whether neutron logs can be used in unsaturated basalt to quantitatively estimate moisture content, and, in tandem with other wireline logs, to determine the relative contribution to neutron log response by minerals containing chemically bound H. Our results show that it should be possible to quantitatively correlate neutron log response to the amount of both bound and unbound H regardless of saturated or unsaturated conditions. Such a correlation is possible only if bulk density, saturated porosity and neutron log response are already known in saturated conditions. It is not yet known, however, what the exact form of this correlation should be. To evaluate the candidate correlation equations, we compare measured permeability in unsaturated basalts with the calculated H content derived from these correlations. As the result of this evaluation, we identify intervals of clay-free impermeable, unsaturated basalt with apparently high H content. The neutron log response in these intervals may be caused by localized variations of the neutron slowing-down length, L(s), due to low concentration of H in the formation and borehole environment. When L(s) is greater than the source-detector spacing of a neutron logging tool, the neutron log response can invert, resulting in potentially faulty interpretation of neutron logs. These measurement uncertainties in unsaturated basalts might be overcome by using a neutron logging tool with both a higher-flux neutron source and increased source-detector spacing, or a neutron tool with several detectors placed at different spacing from the source. 3aneutron probes 3apermeability 3asoil water content 3aunsaturated conditions 3ahydrogen 3abasalt 3avadose zone 3asoil water movement 3aIdaho 0aneutron log 0asoil transport processes1 aSmith, R.P.1 aRodgers, D.W.1 aKnutson, C.F.0 tVadose zone journal.g2004 May, v. 3, no. 2x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/3/2/4853Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/25  aOther US 7aarticle03019naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245012800130300001600258520200300274650001302277650002202290650004502312650002002357650001002377650002102387650001102408650001902419650002002438653001502458700001402473700001602487700001602503773006002519852000902579930003302588945001302621946001102634655001202645IND2033836920221118234542.0931008s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203383692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScagliarini, S.10aLight activation and molecular-mass changes of NADP(P)-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase of spinach and maize leaves  ap. 313-319.  aLight modulation of chloroplast glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD(P)-GAPDH; EC 1.2.1.13) has been investigated. Complete activation of NADPH-dependent activity is achieved at 25 W.m-2 photosynthetically active radiation in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) and 100 W.m-2 in maize (Zea mays L.) leaves. Light activation is stronger in spinach (fivefold on average) than in maize (twofold), which shows higher "dark" activity. The NADH dependent activity does not change appreciably. Several substrate activators can simulate in vitro the light effect with recovery of latent NADPH-dependent activity of spinach enzyme, but they are almost inactive with maize enzyme. A mixture of activators has been devised to fully activate the spinach enzyme under most conditions. The NAD(P)-GAPDH protein can be resolved by rapid gel filtration (fast protein liquid chromatography) into three conformers which have different molecular masses according to the light conditions. Enzyme from darkened leaves or chloroplasts, or dichlorophenyl-1,1-dimethylurea-treated chloroplasts is mainly a 600-kDa regulatory form with low NADPH-dependent activity relative to NADH-activity. Enzyme from spinach leaves or chloroplasts during photosynthesis is mainly a 300-kDa oligomer, which along with the 600-kDa form also occurs in leaves of darkened maize. The conformer of illuminated maize leaves is mainly a 160-kDa species. Results are consistent with a model of NAD(P)-GAPDH freely interconvertible between promoters of the 160-kDa (or 300-kDa intermediate) form with high NADPH-activity, produced in the light by the action of thioredoxin and activating metabolites (spinach only), and a regulatory 600-kDa conformer with lower NADPH-activity produced in darkness or when photosynthesis is inhibited. This behavior is reminiscent of the in-vitro properties of purified enzyme; therefore, it seems unlikely that NAD(P)-GAPDH in the chloroplast is part of a stable multienzyme complex or is bound to membranes. 3aZea mays 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aenzyme activity 3alight 3amolecular weight 3aleaves 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 0aregulation1 aTrost, P.1 aPupillo, P.1 aValenti, V.0 tPlanta.g1993, v. 190, no. 3 p.313-319x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02840naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001300181245010900194300001400303500002400317520148100341650001101822650002101833650003601854650001901890650002501909650001401934650000901948650002001957653001901977700001601996700002102012700002102033700001702054700002102071700002002092773009902112852000902211856006902220930003302289945002502322946001102347655001202358IND4386725720140723000000.0070111e20060615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438672572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2005.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL8401 aMora, S.14aThe hydroalcoholic extract of Salvia elegans induces anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects in rats  ap. 76-81.  aIncludes references  aBehavioral effects of a hydroalcoholic (60% ethanol) extract from the leaves of Salvia elegans Vahl (Lamiaceae) were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The extract was administered intraperitoneally and its effects on spontaneous motor activity (total motility, locomotion, rearing and grooming behavior) were monitored. Putative anxiolytic and antidepressant properties of Salvia elegans were studied in the elevated plus-maze test (EPM) and in the forced swimming test (FST), respectively. Deleterious effects of Salvia elegans on learning and memory were also studied by using active and passive avoidance paradigms. The results revealed that all doses (3.12, 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg) of the extract caused a significant decrease in total motility, locomotion, rearing and grooming behavior. Only the dose of 12.5 mg/kg increased the exploration of the EPM open arms in a similar way to that of diazepam (1 mg/kg). In the FST, all doses of the extract induced a reduction of immobility, in a similar way to that of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) and imipramine (12.5 mg/kg), along with a significant increase in the time spent in swimming behavior. Acquisition of active avoidance responses was disrupted by pre-treatment with the extract, but retention of a passive avoidance response was not significantly modified. These results suggest that some of the components of the hydroalcoholic extract of Salvia elegans have psychotropic properties, which deserve further investigation. 3aSalvia 3amedicinal plants 3achemical constituents of plants 3aplant extracts 3amedicinal properties 3abioassays 3arats 3aantidepressants 0aSalvia elegans1 aMillán, R.1 aLungenstrass, H.1 aDíaz-Véliz, G.1 aMorán, J.A.1 aHerrera-Ruiz, M.1 aTortoriello, J.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2006 June 15, v. 106, no. 1 p.76-81dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2005.12.0043electronic resource  a20070321b20070402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/03/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02846naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001300127245007300140520185500213650002102068650002702089650002902116650001702145650001602162650001602178650002202194700001702216700001502233700001502248773006502263852000902328856008802337930003302425945002502458946001302483655001202496IND4368953920221118234855.0050413e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436895392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSu, G.W.10aSmall-scale features of gravity-driven flow in unsaturated fractures  aLiquid flow through unsaturated fractures often proceeds as fingers or preferential flow paths. During the invasion of liquid fingers into an initially dry, nonhorizontal fracture, fingers may drain, forming a narrow thread of liquid called a rivulet that connects to a wider portion of liquid at the advancing front, defined as a blob. Experimental studies using idealized fractures were performed to investigate the effects of wettability, surface roughness, and aperture size on several important features of gravity-driven flow in fractures: liquid drainage, blob migration, and rivulet flow. The experiments demonstrate that the critical length of the blob before drainage occurred was significantly longer on surfaces with intermediate wettability and on surfaces with roughness on the order of 100 micrometers than on a smooth, flat water-wetting surface. However, drainage did not occur on surfaces with smaller-scale roughness on the order of 10 micrometers. Blob velocities were also measured and were always less than the saturated gravity-driven flow velocity, even when a liquid with a static contact angle of zero was used. This reduction in velocity was attributed to contact angle hysteresis. Rivulet widths measured as a function of flow rate between glass and acrylic parallel plates were generally larger on the acrylic plates than the glass plates for a particular flow rate, demonstrating the sensitivity of rivulet flow to wettability. In addition, the cubic law overpredicted the measured rivulet widths, except for the widths measured between the acrylic plates at 20°. The effect of aperture variability on rivulet flow was also examined. At a critical aperture ranging between 0.25 and 0.37 mm, the liquid in the rivulet did not completely span the aperture, forming two streamlets of liquid on either side of the fracture. 3aunsaturated flow 3aunsaturated conditions 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3aporous media 3avadose zone 3awettability 3asurface roughness1 aGeller, J.T.1 aHunt, J.R.1 aPruess, K.0 tVadose zone journal.g2004 May, v. 3, no. 2x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/3/2/5923Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/25  aOther US 7aarticle02590naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002100135245008300156300001600239500002400255520178600279650002402065650001302089650001202102651001602114700001702130700001802147773008802165852000902253856003802262655001202300IND4410967720221118234427.0081003s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441096772DNAL7 a10.1071/WR070542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoquenot, David10aEvaluating helicopter-based surveys for estimating densities of Himalayan thar  ap. 358-364.  aIncludes references  aHimalayan thar (Hemitragus jemlahicus Smith) inhabit a large area of New Zealand's southern alps. Since 1993, a control plan for thar has required estimation of thar density within management units (MUs), and across their range. We evaluated helicopter-based survey as an alternative to current ground-based surveys to provide these estimates. Both survey methods sample thar density within predetermined survey-catchments located in MUs. Helicopter- and ground-based surveys undertaken in four survey-catchments (three located in MU4, one located in MU3) contrasted the performance of the two methods. Helicopter-based surveys used a double-count method to estimate the sightability of thar groups. Sightability varied from 0.53 for single thar, to 1.0 for groups of three or more. Correction factors accounting for sightability were applied to helicopter-based counts to estimate thar density within survey-catchments, which were contrasted with estimates from ground-based surveys. Density estimates for three of the survey-catchments were within 25%, and displayed no systematic bias, indicating reasonable convergence of the two methods. The effect of sampling rate on precision of density estimates was explored using helicopter-based survey results for survey-catchments sampled within MU4. Confidence intervals for the density estimate stabilised when 10-15 survey-catchments were sampled, equivalent to a sampling rate of 13-20% of the MU. Compared with ground-based surveys, helicopter-based surveys were 30% cheaper, less logistically constrained, and could be applied randomly across MUs. This suggests that they may be a better option to meet the information requirements for implementation of the thar control plan, at least in MUs where habitat is sufficiently open. 3aconfidence interval 3ahabitats 3asurveys 3aNew Zealand1 aBolton, Neil1 aWoods, Darrin0 tWildlife research.g2008, v. 35, no. 4 p.358-364dCSIRO Publishingx1035-37127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR07054 7aarticle03244naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245012900170300001600299500002400315500001500339520185600354650002702210650001602237650001902253650002702272650003702299650001802336650001102354650000902365650002302374650001902397650002202416650002702438650002402465650001602489650002702505653001102532700002502543700002802568700002002596773011302616852000902729856004802738655001202786IND4446767820221118234432.0101224e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444676782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-010-0417-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSułowicz, Sławomir10aSignificance of Silver Birch and Bushgrass for Establishment of Microbial Heterotrophic Community in a Metal-Mine Spoil Heap  ap. 205-218.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDifferences in the culturable fractions of total and metal-tolerant bacteria inhabiting bulk soil of a metal-mine spoil heap and the rhizosphere of silver birch (Betula pendula) or bushgrass (Calamagrostis epigejos), completed with changes in total microbial community structure in the soil, were assessed by MIDI-FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) profiling of whole-cell fatty acids. In addition, the abundance of metal-tolerant populations among the culturable bacterial communities and their identity and the metal-tolerance patterns were determined. The high proportions of Cu- and Zn-tolerant bacteria that ranged from 60.6% to 94.8% were ascertained in the heap sites. Within 31 bacterial isolates obtained, 24 strains were Gram-positive and Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Rathayibacter, Brochothrix, and Staphylococcus represented those identified. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data indicated that several strains developed multi-metal tolerance, and the highest tolerance to Cu (10 mM) and Zn (12 mM) was found for Pseudomonas putida TP3 and three isolated strains (BS3, TP12, and SL16), respectively. The analysis of FAME profiles obtained from the culturable bacterial communities showed that Gram-positive bacteria predominated in bulk soil of all heap sites. In contrast, the rhizosphere communities showed a lower proportion of the Gram-positive group, especially for silver birch. For the total microbial community, mostly Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas) inhabited the heap sites. The results suggest that the quantitative and qualitative development of heterotrophic microbiota in the soil of the metal-mine spoil heap seems to be site-dependent (i.e., rhizosphere vs. bulk soil), according to differences in the site characteristics (e.g., enrichment of nutrients and total metal concentrations) and impact of plant species. 3aGram-negative bacteria 3arhizosphere 3aStaphylococcus 3afatty acid composition 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aRathayibacter 3asilver 3asoil 3aPseudomonas putida 3aBetula pendula 3afatty acid esters 3aCalamagrostis epigejos 3asoil microorganisms 3aBrochothrix 3aGram-positive bacteria 0aplants1 aPłociniczak, Tomasz1 aPiotrowska-Seget, Zofia1 aKozdrój, Jacek0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2011 Jan., v. 214, no. 1-4 p.205-218dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-010-0417-x 7aarticle02634naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001700181245010000198300001600298500002400314520129400338650001601632650002501648650002101673650001801694650002301712650002101735650001901756650002501775650001801800650001401818651001001832700001801842700001501860700001601875700001301891773010101904852000902005856006902014930003302083945002502116946001102141655001202152IND4386728820221118234519.0070111e20060630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438672882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2005.11.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF000 0aS200 0aX380 0aL8401 aSaikia, A.P.10aEthnobotany of medicinal plants used by Assamese people for various skin ailments and cosmetics  ap. 149-157.  aIncludes references  aThe present paper deals with the medicinal plants used by the people of Assam for curing different skin ailments and for cosmetics. A total of 85 plants belonging to 49 families have been documented for their therapeutic use against skin diseases and as herbal care. The herbal medicines were prepared from various plant parts of single plant, or multiple plants. The majority of the preparation was made using water as the medium. The mode of application was topical, but in many cases it was also administered orally. In several cases the pure herbal preparations was administered along with milk, ghee, honey, coconut oil, curd, etc. Remedies for 18 skin ailments were documented through this study. About 14 plants are known for their use to cure multiple skin diseases. Among these Curcuma longa and Melia azaderach constitute the major plants. The herbal cosmetic products used by the people of Assam ranges from the enhancement of skin colour, hair care, removal of ugly spots, colouring of nails, palms, and teeth. However, many of the plant preparations used for enhancing beauty were also applied for therapeutic use. Herbal remedies were also available for skin burns, prickly heat and pimples. Information on nine plants used for managing dry skin also emerged from this study. 3aethnobotany 3atraditional medicine 3aherbal medicines 3aCurcuma longa 3aAzadirachta indica 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3amedicinal properties 3askin diseases 3acosmetics 3aIndia1 aRyakala, V.K.1 aSharma, P.1 aGoswami, P.1 aBora, U.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2006 June 30, v. 106, no. 2 p.149-157dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2005.11.0333electronic resource  a20070323b20070402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/03/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02527naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245003200143520157900175650001401754650002801768650000901796650001201805650001601817650001501833650001901848651001201867700002001879700001501899700001801914773006501932852000901997856008802006930003302094945002502127946001302152655001202165IND4368955220221118234546.0050413e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436895522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMcVay, K.A.10aAnion exchange in saprolite  aMany studies have shown that subsoils in the Piedmont region of the southeastern USA have anion exchange capacity (AEC) and can adsorb anions such as nitrate . Groundwater discharging to wells and streams often passes through thick layers of saprolite beneath Piedmont soils, but little is known about the AEC of saprolite. Our objective was to determine the AEC on saprolite samples collected with a split-spoon sampler during the installation of seven groundwater monitoring wells in north Georgia. Forty four samples were collected from depths ranging from approximately one to 15 m below the surface and analyzed for AEC, extractable iron, and pH. The saprolite thickness was at least 15 m at all seven sites as verified by drilling an adjacent 7.6-cm hole to bedrock. The average AEC for 37 saprolite samples was 0.80 cmol(c) kg-1. This was slightly less than half of the AEC observed in typical subsoil horizons of Piedmont soils. There was a significant positive correlation (r = 0.64) between saprolite AEC and iron oxide content. Taking into account the differences in thickness of the soil and saprolite, saprolite had about six times the AEC of subsoil. The expected adsorption coefficient (K(d)) for NO-3 in saprolite was approximately 0.81 cm3 g-1, based on the relationship between AEC and K(d). Using an estimated bulk density and saturated water content based on texture, this corresponds to a retardation coefficient (R) of 4.4. Models and remediation efforts involving NO-3 in shallow Piedmont groundwater need to account for anion adsorption in saprolite. 3asaprolite 3aanion exchange capacity 3airon 3asoil pH 3airon oxides 3aadsorption 3apiedmont soils 3aGeorgia1 aRadcliffe, D.E.1 aWest, L.T.1 aCabrera, M.L.0 tVadose zone journal.g2004 May, v. 3, no. 2x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/3/2/6683Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/25  aOther US 7aarticle01907naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245009100144520096100235650001001196650001501206650002301221650001801244650001201262650001601274650002701290653003101317773006501348852000901413856008801422930003301510945002501543946001301568655001201581IND4368955320221118234537.0050413e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436895532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGoldberg, S.10aModeling boron adsorption isotherms and envelopes using the constant capacitance model  aBoron adsorption on 23 soil samples belonging to six different soil orders was investigated both as a function of solution B concentration (0-23.1 mmol L-1) and as a function of solution pH (4-11). Boron adsorption exhibited maxima at high solution B concentration. Boron adsorption increased with increasing solution pH, reached a maximum around pH 9, and decreased with further increases in solution pH. The constant capacitance model was able to describe B adsorption on the soil samples as a function of both solution B concentration and solution pH simultaneously by optimizing three surface complexation constants. The ability to describe B adsorption as a function of pH represents an advancement over the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm approaches. Incorporation of these constants into chemical speciation transport models will allow simulation of soil solution B concentrations under diverse environmental and agricultural conditions. 3aboron 3aadsorption 3asorption isotherms 3asoil solution 3asoil pH 3acapacitance 3achemical concentration 0aconstant capacitance model0 tVadose zone journal.g2004 May, v. 3, no. 2x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/3/2/6763Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/25  aOther US 7aarticle02490naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001600190245010200206300001600308500002400324500001500348520097000363650002101333650002001354650002501374650001701399650002101416650002501437650002101462650001901483650001401502650002801516650002001544650003601564650001601600650002901616653001501645700001301660700001101673700001601684773010101700852000901801856006901810930003301879945002501912946001101937655001201948IND4386730620221118234546.0070111e20060630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438673062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2005.12.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL833 0aL8321 aOoi, L.S.M.10aAntiviral activities of purified compounds from Youngia japonica (L.)

Three anti-microbial agents, namely 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, and luteolin-7-O-glucoside were subsequently purified and chemically characterized from the ethanol extract of Youngia japonica. The two dicaffeoylquinic acids exhibited prominent anti-RSV with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.5 μg/ml in vitro. Luteolin-7-O-glucoside together with the two dicaffeoylquinic acids were also manifested to have some antibacterial activity towards the causal agents of food-borne disease, namely Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus at the concentration of 2 mg/ml. Bacillus cereus was sensitive to 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid only, but not to luteolin-7-O-glucoside. 3ahuman cell lines 3aVibrio cholerae 3aantiviral properties 3acaffeic acid 3aYoungia japonica 3amedicinal properties 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3abioassays 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aBacillus cereus 3achemical constituents of plants 3aquinic acid 3aantibacterial properties 0aAsteraceae1 aWang, H.1 aHe, Z.1 aOoi, V.E.C.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2006 June 30, v. 106, no. 2 p.187-191dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2005.12.0283electronic resource  a20070323b20070402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/03/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02532naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001800127245009700145500015700242520118400399650001301583650001601596650002201612650002501634650001001659650001601669651001001685653006001695653003801755653002401793653001901817700001701836700001801853700001701871773006601888852000901954856008801963930003302051945002502084946001302109655001202122IND4368939920221118234636.0050412e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436893992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHubbell, J.M.10aWell design to reduce barometric pressure effects on water level data in unconfined aquifers  aIn the special section: Understanding subsurface flow and transport processes at the Idaho National Engineering & Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) Site.  aBarometric pressure fluctuations may influence measured water levels in wells where thick vadose zones or low permeability materials overlie unconfined aquifers. Here, we present a well completion method designed to reduce the effects of barometric pressure fluctuations on measured water levels. This well configuration, called the isobaric well, seals the interior of the well from atmospheric pressure, and vents the reference side of the water level pressure transducer to the gas phase pressure above the water table. We tested the isobaric design on a well completed about 180 m below land surface in the Eastern Snake River Plain aquifer at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. Water level data collected during 14 mo show more than an order of magnitude decrease in diurnal fluctuations when the well was operated in the isobaric mode. Decreasing the noise level allowed clear definition of water level trends that would otherwise have been at least partially obscured by barometric fluctuations. This well configuration allows direct monitoring of water level changes, without the need to rely on postprocessing to mitigate barometric influences. 3aaquifers 3awater table 3adiurnal variation 3aatmospheric pressure 3awells 3agroundwater 3aIdaho 0aIdaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory 0aEastern Snake River Plain aquifer 0aunconfined aquifers 0aisobaric wells1 aSisson, J.B.1 aNicholl, M.J.1 aTaylor, R.G.0 tVadose zone journal.g2004 Feb., v. 3, no. 1x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/3/1/1833Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/22  aOther US 7aarticle04427naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002200182245007300204300001600277500002400293500001500317520193600332650001002268650002302278650002102301650001902322650001502341650001802356650002402374650002102398650002202419650002002441650001302461650002502474650001202499650002002511650000902531650002502540650001902565650001202584650001102596650002802607650001802635650001902653650001202672650002902684650002702713650003902740650004702779650003002826650002802856650002302884650003402907650002202941650005202963650000903015650002503024650003503049650000903084650003703093650005603130650003303186653002303219653001603242653001703258700002603275700002103301773010003322852000903422856008503431930003303516945002503549946001103574655001203585IND4433867920221118234505.0100313e20100324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443386792DNAL7 a200963422pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2010.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 aAli Khan, Rahmat.10aEvaluation of Launaea procumbens use in renal disorders: A rat model  ap. 452-461.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIntroduction: Carbon tetrachloride exerts its toxicity in rat kidneys through oxidative stress. Launaea procumbens is used ethnopharmacologically in renal disorders. Its methanolic, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and n-hexane fractions were evaluated against CCl₄-induced nephrotoxicity in rat. Materials and Methods: Among 16 groups, one was given CCl₄ of 3ml/kg body weight (30% in olive oil i.p.) twice a week for 4 weeks. Others were orally fed with extracts (100, 200mg/kg b.w.) or rutin (50mg/kg b.w.) after 48h of CCl₄ or 200mg/kg b.w. of extracts without CCl₄-treatment twice a week for 4 weeks. Results: CCl₄ exposure led to a significant oxidative stress in kidneys which was remarkably attenuated with co-administration of various fractions and rutin thereby increased the level of CAT, POD, SOD, GSH, GSR, GST, GSH-Px, quinone reductase, while reduced the xanthine oxidase, γ-GT, TBARS, H₂O₂, nitrite, tissue proteins and DNA fragmentation%. Ameliorated effects of fractions and rutin were also recorded for the function of kidneys and the level of urobilinogen, urea, albumin, creatinine, RBC and WBC in urine were decreased. Serum level of creatinine, urobilinogen, BUN, direct bilirubin, total bilirubin and globulin were decreased while total proteins, albumin and creatinine clearance were increased with fractions and rutin. Protective effects of rutin and fractions were also evident on histopathology by reducing glomerular atrophy, tubular degeneration, congestion of blood capillaries, necrosis of epithelium and edema. Similarly body weight was increased while kidney and relative kidney weight was decreased with co-administration of fractions and rutin. Conclusion: It is suggested that Launaea procumbens effectively protect kidneys against the CCl₄-induced oxidative damage in rats, through antioxidant and free radical scavenging effects of flavonoids and saponins present in the fractions. 3aurine 3alipid peroxidation 3amedicinal plants 3arenal function 3aflavonoids 3atissue weight 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3ablood chemistry 3asaponins 3amedicinal properties 3akidneys 3akidney diseases 3arats 3aantioxidant activity 3ahistopathology 3aLaunaea 3adosage 3afree radical scavengers 3aanimal models 3anephrotoxicity 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aAsteraceaexmetabolism 2aCarbon Tetrachloridexpharmacology 2aCarbon Tetrachloride Poisoningxmetabolism 2aCreatininexbloodxurine. 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aHexanesxchemistry 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aKidneyxpathology 2aKidney Diseasesxchemically inducedxpathology. 2aMale 2aNitritesxmetabolism 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aRats 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aThiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substancesxmetabolism 2aXanthine Oxidasexmetabolism 0aLaunaea procumbens 0abody weight 0aantioxidants1 aKhan, Muhammad Rashid1 aSahreen, Sumaira0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2010 Mar. 24, v. 128, no. 2 p.452-461dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2010.01.0263Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02526naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100002000190245006800210300001300278500002400291520119100315650002101506650003601527650001901563650002501582650002201607650002401629650002501653650002101678650001601699651001001715653002301725700001401748700001801762700001901780773009801799852000901897856006901906930003301975945002502008946001102033655001202044IND4386724520221118234909.0070111e20060615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438672452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2006.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL840 0aF0001 aMukherjee, P.K.10aLeads from Indian medicinal plants with hypoglycemic potentials  ap. 1-28.  aIncludes references  aDiabetes mellitus is caused due to deficiency in production of insulin by the pancreas, or by the ineffectiveness of the insulin produced. It is a global problem and number of those affected is increasing day by day. The plants provide a potential source of hypoglycemic drugs because many plants and plant derived compounds have been used in the treatment of diabetes. Several medicinal plants have found potential use as hypoglycemic in the Indian system of medicines, including ayurveda. Many Indian plants have been investigated for their beneficial use in different types of diabetes and reports occur in numerous scientific journals. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review on various plant species from Indian biosphere and their constituents, which have been shown to display potent hypoglycemic activity. The use of herbs as hypoglycemic is a major avenue in Indian perspectives particularly for treating diabetes, which require to be explored more effectively as there are so many literatures available on these aspects. This paper describes the chemistry, activity and usage of the constituents isolated from these plants from India for the treatment of diabetes. 3amedicinal plants 3achemical constituents of plants 3aplant extracts 3amedicinal properties 3adiabetes mellitus 3ahypoglycemic agents 3atraditional medicine 3aherbal medicines 3aethnobotany 3aIndia 0aliterature reviews1 aMaiti, K.1 aMukherjee, K.1 aHoughton, P.J.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2006 June 15, v. 106, no. 1 p.1-28dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2006.03.0213electronic resource  a20070321b20070402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/03/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02626naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245011700160520142400277650003001701650001301731650002301744650001301767650002501780650002201805650002701827650002201854650001601876650001601892650002401908651001501932700001601947700001901963773006601982852000902048856008802057930003302145945002502178946001302203655001202216IND4368926320221118234646.0050412e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436892632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNolan, B.T.10aSpatial variability of groundwater recharge and its effect on shallow groundwater quality in southern New Jersey  aPoint estimates of groundwater recharge at 48 sediment-coring locations vary substantially (-18.5-1840 cm yr-1) in a 930-km2 area of southern New Jersey. Darcian estimates of steady, long-term recharge made at depth in the unsaturated zone were estimated using pedotransfer functions of soil texture and interpolated (mapped) with nonparametric methods to assess aquifer vulnerability in the area. The probability of exceeding the median recharge (29.1 cm yr-1) is low in the southwestern and northeastern portions of the study area and high in the eastern and southeastern portions. Estimated recharge is inversely related to measured percentage clay and positively related to the percentage of well-drained soils near wells. Spatial patterns of recharge estimates, exceedance probabilities, and clay content indicate that sediment texture controls recharge in the study area. Relations with land elevation and a topographic wetness index were statistically insignificant. Nitrate concentration and atrazine (6-chloro-N2-ethyl-N4-isopropyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine) percentage detection in samples of shallow groundwater (typically <10 m) are higher for low recharge sites ((<or=)29.1 cm yr-1) than for high recharge sites (>29.1 cm yr-1) in agricultural and urban areas. Differences between high and low recharge sites in these areas are highly significant for NO3 concentration, but not for atrazine concentration. 3agroundwater contamination 3aatrazine 3aherbicide residues 3anitrates 3agroundwater recharge 3aspatial variation 3aunsaturated conditions 3aagricultural land 3arural areas 3aurban areas 3acoastal plain soils 3aNew Jersey1 aBaehr, A.L.1 aKauffman, L.J.0 tVadose zone journal.g2003 Nov., v. 2, no. 4x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/2/4/6773Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/22  aOther US 7aarticle02675naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002000144245007200164520154500236650001301781650001901794650001601813650002701829650002901856650002101885650001401906650002301920650002801943653001701971700001701988700001802005700002002023773006602043852000902109856008802118930003302206945002502239946001302264655001202277IND4368934720221118234609.0050412e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436893472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHutchison, J.M.10aChromate transport and retention in variably saturated soil columns  aMost subsurface contamination passes through the unsaturated zone before reaching an aquifer; however, transport studies are often conducted under saturated conditions because of the difficulty in maintaining steady-state flow. Chromate migration was measured in coarse-textured, oxide-rich sediment under different water contents using vacuum and centrifuge techniques to obtain a steady-state unsaturated flow regime. Leaching solutions contained 0.5 or 1.0 mM Cr(VI) and tritium in artificial groundwater. Breakthrough curves (BTCs) were modeled using CXTFIT assuming equilibrium conditions, since evaluation of data using a "two-region" physical nonequilibrium model indicated that mobile water was >90% regardless of saturation level. Dispersivity increased nonlinearly with decreasing water content. Retardation (R) increased with decreasing water content, but water content had little effect on the distribution coefficient calculated from R, K(d-app). The average K(d-app) of all Cr(VI) experiments (water content range: 0.07-0.43 cm3 cm-3) was 0.633 mL g-1, very similar to the distribution coefficient derived from batch equilibration, K(d) (0.684 mL g-1). Though results in both transport systems were similar, average solute residence times in the vacuum system were 4 to 23 times longer than in the centrifuge system at comparable water contents. The centrifuge system column experiments could also be run over a greater range in volumetric water content (0.07-0.42 cm3 cm-3) than the vacuum column system (0.23-0.43 cm3 cm-3). 3achromium 3asoil pollution 3avadose zone 3aunsaturated conditions 3asoil transport processes 3aunsaturated flow 3asediments 3asoil water content 3ahydrodynamic dispersion 0adispersivity1 aSeaman, J.C.1 aAburime, S.A.1 aRadcliffe, D.E.0 tVadose zone journal.g2003 Nov., v. 2, no. 4x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/2/4/7023Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/22  aOther US 7aarticle03273naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245013500162500015700297500001500454520178700469650001902256650001502275650003002290650002902320650001502349650001102364650001602375650002402391651001002415653002702425653006002452653001702512653002902529700001902558700001702577773006602594852000902660856008702669930003302756945002502789946001302814655001202827IND4368936020221118234645.0050412e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436893602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMattson, E.D.10aInterpreting INEEL vadose zone water movement on the basis of large-scale field tests and long-term vadose zone monitoring results  aIn the special section: Understanding subsurface flow and transport processes at the Idaho National Engineering & Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) Site.  a2019-12-05  aA review of the results from two large-scale field tests and vadose zone monitoring data at two facilities at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) has provided information to support development of a conceptual model of water movement in the highly heterogeneous vadose zone beneath two INEEL facilities. Both of the large-scale field tests were ponded water infiltration tests that approached the size of the two facilities. An assembly of perched water wells, neutron access tubes, and tensiometers have been used to monitor water movement beneath these sites. Once water has percolated through the surficial sediment at these facilities, the presence of the surficial sediment-basalt interface results in some perching of the percolated water with limited lateral movement. Water movement in basalt formations is mainly gravity-dominated in preferential fracture pathways and rubble zones and results in rapid vertical flow especially frequently under conditions of positive hydrostatic head. Detection of wetting front advance is typically not sequential with depth and has been shown to vary between episodic infiltration events. At the basalt-sediment interface of the interbeds, perched water is often detected and has resulted in more lateral spreading of recharge than at the surficial sediment-basalt interface. Gaps in the sedimentary interbeds will allow some of the recharge water to bypass the interbeds and rapidly continue toward the aquifer. This complex water movement in the vadose zone beneath the INEEL supports the need to control surface infiltration, identify gaps and the lateral continuity of the interbeds, and investigate the influence of nearby surface water sources on perched water movement beneath these two facilities. 3asoil pollution 3amonitoring 3agroundwater contamination 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3apollutants 3abasalt 3avadose zone 3asoil water movement 3aIdaho 0aperched water movement 0aIdaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory 0ahydrogeology 0asoil transport processes1 aMagnuson, S.O.1 aAnsley, S.L.0 tVadose zone journal.g2004 Feb., v. 3, no. 1x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/3/1/353Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/22  aOther US 7aarticle04599naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100003300182245010000215300001600315500002400331500001500355520197100370650002502341650002002366650002302386650003102409650001802440650002702458650001602485650002102501650001902522650001102541650000902552650001702561650001802578650001502596650001502611650002502626650002102651650003002672650003002702650001202732650004602744650002402790650003202814650003102846650000902877650002302886650003502909650002602944651001102970651001102981653002602992653002503018700003103043700003703074700003203111700003703143700003003180700004103210700003203251700003903283700002703322700003103349700003703380700004103417700003603458773010003494852000903594856008503603930003303688945002503721946001103746655001203757IND4433866820221118234727.0100313e20100324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443386682DNAL7 a200972812pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2010.01.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 ade Queiroz, Aline Cavalcanti14aThe antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of Piptadenia stipulacea Benth.

Materials and methods: Aerial parts of Piptadenia stipulacea were used and after fractionation, the flavonoid FGAL was obtained. Experiments were conducted on Swiss mice using the acetic acid-induced writhing test, the hot plate test, the formalin-induced pain test and zymosan A-induced peritonitis test. Results: The aqueous and ethyl acetate phases (p.o., 100mg/kg); and the flavonoid FGAL (p.o. and i.p. at 100μmol/kg), reduced the nociception produced by acetic acid, by 49.92%, 54.62%, 38.97% and 64.79%, respectively. In vivo inhibition of nociception by the ethyl acetate phase (100mg/kg, p.o.) in the hot plate test was favorable, indicating that this fraction exhibited central activity. The ethyl acetate phase (100mg/kg, p.o.) reduced the formalin effects in both phases by 28.51% and 55.72%, respectively. Treatment with the aqueous phase (100mg/kg, p.o.) and FGAL (100μmol/kg, i.p.) only protected the second phase by 69.76% and 68.78%, respectively. In addition, it was observed in the zymosan A-induced peritonitis test that the aqueous phase, the ethyl acetate phase and the FGAL exhibited anti-inflammatory activity, reducing significantly the number of recruit cells by 35.84%, 37.70% and FGAL (1), respectively. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that the FGAL elicits pronounced antinociceptive activity against several pain models. The actions of this flavonoid probably are due to antioxidative properties. However, pharmacological and chemical studies are continuing in order to characterize the mechanism(s) responsible for this antinociceptive action and also to identify other active substances present in Piptadenia stipulacea. 3atraditional medicine 3ain vivo studies 3atemporal variation 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3afractionation 3acentral nervous system 3aperitonitis 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3adosage 3amice 3aaerial parts 3aanimal models 3aflavonoids 3aPiptadenia 3aantioxidant activity 3aanalgesic effect 2aAcetatesxtherapeutic use 2aAcetic Acidxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aFabaceaexchemistry 2aFlavonoidsxtherapeutic use 2aFormaldehydexpharmacology 2aMice 2aPainxdrug therapy 2aPain Measurementxdrug effects 2aZymosanxpharmacology 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0aPiptadenia stipulacea 0amedicinal properties1 ade Lira, Daysianne Pereira1 aDias, Thays de Lima Matos Freire1 ade Souza, Éverton Tenório1 ada Matta, Carolina Barbosa Brito1 ade Aquino, Anansa Bezerra1 aSilva, Luiz Henrique Agra Cavalcante1 ada Silva, Diogo José Costa1 aMella, Eliane Aparecida Campessato1 aAgra, Maria de Fátima1 aFilho, José Maria Barbosa1 ade Araújo-Júnior, João Xavier1 aSantos, Bárbara Viviana de Oliveira1 aAlexandre-Moreira, Magna Suzana0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2010 Mar. 24, v. 128, no. 2 p.377-383dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2010.01.0413Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02500naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245009900159500001500258520139500273650002401668650002301692650002901715650001701744650002501761650003001786650002701816651001501843653002001858700001401878773006601892852000901958856008801967930003302055945002502088946001302113655001202126IND4368935620221118234624.0050412e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436893562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHunt, A.G.10aWet-end deviations from scaling of the water retention characteristics of fractal porous media  a2019-12-05  aA previous work investigated the dry-end deviation from fractal scaling of water retention characteristics of a suite of 43 U.S. Department of Energy (USDOE) Hanford site soils in relationship with the vanishing of solute diffusion at a moisture content theta(t). It was found that the deviation from fractal scaling of the water retention set on at a moisture content typically about 0.06 higher than the moisture content at which solute diffusion vanishes. Assuming that the vanishing of solute diffusion resulted from a lack of continuity of the water phase, we interpreted the deviation from fractal scaling in terms of a lack of water-phase continuity rather than as a breakdown of the fractal model. Now the wet-end deviations from fractal scaling of the same suite of soils are investigated. It is shown that the wet-end moisture contents at which the deviation occurs are correlated with the critical volume fraction for percolation and with the dry-end deviations. However, wet-end deviations occur at moisture contents closer to full saturation than do dry-end deviations from zero saturation. This contrast between the wet and dry ends of the water retention curve, h(theta), is suggested to be a result of the role of equilibration in the experimental determination of h(theta), and thus to be traceable to the much lower values of the hydraulic conductivity, K, at the dry end. 3amathematical models 3asoil water content 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3aporous media 3asoil water retention 3asoil water characteristic 3ahydraulic conductivity 0aWashington 0afractal scaling1 aGee, G.W.0 tVadose zone journal.g2003 Nov., v. 2, no. 4x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/2/4/7593Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/22  aOther US 7aarticle01523naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245005200132300001600184520075500200650002400955650002300979650002101002650002101023653002501044773008801069852001301157939003301170945000801203946001301211852000901224655001201233991561912610742620221118234942.0870219e198604  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870003022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlford, M.M.12aA guide for nutrition educators at the worksite  ap.

In this review, we will discuss the mode of action of both chemical and biological (nature-derived) preservatives and the stress response mechanisms induced by these compounds in microorganisms of concern to the food industry. We will discuss the challenges that food manufacturers face with respect to the assurance of food safety and the prevention of spoilage. Following this, chemical preservatives will be discussed, in particular, weak organic acids such as sorbic and benzoic acid which are widely used in preservation. Furthermore, the mechanisms of microbial inactivation with hydrogen peroxide mediated systems and chelators such as citric acid and EDTA and their potential use in preservation will be covered. We will then address the potential of naturally occurring "preservatives". Of the antimicrobial compounds present in nature, first to be discussed will be the nonproteinaceous compounds often present in herbs and spices and we will speculate on the stress response(s) that microorganisms may elicit to these natural compounds. Next to be addressed will be compounds that attack cell walls and membranes, for example, peptides, proteins and lytic enzymes. In discussing the resistance mechanisms against membrane and wall perturbation, the extensive knowledge of stress responses against osmotic stress and temperature stress will be refered to. Finally, in the concluding paragraphs, options for combination preservation systems are evaluated. 3afood preservatives 3aspices 3aantibacterial properties 3aantifungal properties 3abacteria 3afungi 3amechanism of action 0aliterature reviews 0aresistance 0aculinary herbs 0anatural food preservatives1 aCoote, P.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g1999 Sept. 15, v. 50, no. 1/2 p.1-17x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02300naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245006600123300001600189520146400205650001601669650002001685650002301705650001901728653002501747653002301772653001801795700001501813773009201828852000901920930003301929945001301962946001101975655001201986IND2045181720221118234718.0950321e19941221enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204518172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWall, R.10aAutosterilization for control of the housefly Musca domestica  ap. 431-437.  aA deterministic simulation model is developed and used to explore the behaviour of autosterilization systems for control of the housefly Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae). Autosterilizing systems integrate a chemical sterilant and an attractant into a single control device. The simulations show that, at 25 degrees C, 43% of females would need to be killed or sterilized per day to bring about a decline in the model housefly population. However, if both sexes could be sterilized, only 25% of the population would need to be affected per day. The proportion of a population that would need to be sterilized to bring about effective control, however, is dependent on ambient temperature. In addition, the relative advantage of sterilization of both sexes over killing or sterilizing females alone is positively related to the percentage of the population that can be attracted. The intensity of density dependence affecting the population does not affect the proportion that needs to be sterilized per day for control. However, at the lower equilibrium population densities, which result from increasing density dependence, lower absolute numbers of individuals need to be attracted and sterilized per day. The results show that the development of effective autosterilizing systems is highly dependent on the identification of potent attractants and the development of powerful, insect-specific sterilants, both of which should affect males and females. 3asterilizing 3aMusca domestica 3ainsect attractants 3ainsect control 0adeterministic models 0aintegrated control 0asterilization1 aHoward, J.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g1994 Dec. 21, v. 171, no. 4 p.431-437x0022-51937nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02618naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002200158245020300180300001600383500002400399500001500423520126400438650002701702650001001729650001701739650001401756650002001770650001301790650002601803650002201829650002101851650002001872650002701892651001501919653001501934700002301949700002201972773011401994852000902108856007902117655001202196IND4434582520221118234800.0100326e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443458252DNAL7 a216224272pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.09000992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEckert, Andrew J.10aEffects of historical demography and ecological context on spatial patterns of genetic diversity within foxtail pine (Pinus balfouriana; Pinaceae) stands located in the Klamath Mountains, California  ap. 650-659.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe density and dispersion of individuals, nonequilibrium demographics, and habitat fragmentation all affect the magnitude and extent of spatial genetic structure within forest tree populations. Here, we investigate the link between historical demography and spatial genetic structure within ecologically contrasting stands of foxtail pine (Pinus balfouriana) in the Klamath Mountains of northern California. We defined two stand types a priori, based largely on differences in foxtail pine density and basal area, and for each type we sampled two stands. Population expansions, likely from Pleistocene bottlenecks, were detected in three of the four stands. The magnitude and extent of spatial autocorrelation among genotypes at five nuclear microsatellites differed dramatically among stands, with those having lower foxtail pine density exhibiting strong patterns of isolation by distance. Moran's I statistics were 7-fold higher for the first distance class (<25 m) in these stands relative to those observed in stands with higher foxtail pine density (I₂₅ = 0.14 vs. 0.02). We conclude that differences in spatial genetic structure between stand types are due to differences in ecological attributes that affected expansion from inferred bottlenecks. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aPinus 3aforest trees 3amountains 3aautocorrelation 3agenotype 3ahabitat fragmentation 3agenetic variation 3astand basal area 3astand structure 3ademographic statistics 3aCalifornia 0abasal area1 aEckert, Melissa L.1 aHall, Benjamin D.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2010 Apr., v. 97, no. 4 p.650-659dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.09000993Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01745naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245006400142300001600206520068500222650001500907650002300922650002800945650000900973650001400982650001200996650001201008650001301020650002801033650004101061651001201102651001201114700001301126700001401139700001301153773010301166852000901269930003301278945001301311946001101324655001201335IND2203869920221118234909.0000417e19990815ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220386992DNAL7 a104902272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTelo, A.10aOccurrence of Salmonella spp. in imported eggs into Albania  ap. 169-171.  aSeventy-nine shell egg lots imported into Albania during the 2-years period 1996-1997 (69 lots during 1996 and 10 lots during 1997) were investigated for the presence of the Salmonella spp. Salmonella was detected in 1 out of 79 analysed pooled samples (1.26%).

Paper presented at the TOUGH Symposium 2003 held May 12-14, 2003, Berkeley, California.  a2019-12-05  aThe hydrogeology of the unsaturated zone plays a critical role in determining the suitability of a site for artificial recharge. Optimally, a suitable site has highly permeable soils, a capacity for horizontal flow at the aquifer boundary, a lack of impeding layers, and a thick unsaturated zone. The suitability of a site is often determined by field and laboratory measurements of soil properties, field experiments, and numerical modeling. An artificial recharge site in the San Gorgonio Pass area in southern California, USA was studied to better understand the role of the unsaturated zone in artificial recharge by surface spreading. Field measurements and observations were used to characterize the site and to develop a conceptual model of the unsaturated zone. A numerical model was developed based on the conceptual model and calibrated using data from a 50-d artificial recharge experiment conducted in 1991 and borehole data collected between 1997 and 2002. Results indicate that an impeding layer exists 70 m below land surface that will cause lateral diversion of artificially recharged water, which would spread out and delay recharge to the water table 185 m below land surface. 3asimulation models 3asoil hydraulic properties 3agroundwater recharge 3aunsaturated conditions 3acomputer software 3avadose zone 3ahydrologic models 3aCalifornia 0amathematical models 0aartificial recharge 0aTOUGH2 code 0ahydrogeology1 aEllett, K.M.0 tVadose zone journal.g2004 Aug., v. 3, no. 3x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/3/3/7633Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/25  aOther US 7aarticle02784naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245004800143500001500191520172700206650002301933650001601956650002001972650001201992650001502004650002502019650001602044650002702060653003002087700001502117700001702132700001602149773006502165852000902230856008802239930003302327945002502360946001302385655001202398IND4368956120221118234053.0050413e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436895612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGarnier, P.10aHydraulic properties of soil-straw mixtures  a2019-12-05  aCrop residue management at the soil surface controls C sequestration and soil erosion. The size and distribution of crop residues incorporated into the topsoil affect soil physical properties. The objective of this work was to analyze the immediate effect of straw incorporation on the hydraulic properties of soil. Laboratory experiments were performed to determine the retention and the hydraulic conductivity curves of soil and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw mixtures. The samples consisted of 1-cm straw pieces mixed with loamy soil aggregates of 2 to 3 mm in diameter. Volumetric straw contents were 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 cm3 cm-3. Suction table and pressure extractor methods were used to measure the water retention curve. Hydraulic conductivity curves were obtained using Wind's evaporation method. At a constant water pressure head, gravimetric water content increased with increasing straw content. The relationship between water pressure and volumetric water content did not differ significantly between the treatments. An additive model based on the sum of the water retention of straw and soil measured separately gave a good estimation of the water retention measured in the mixture. Hydraulic conductivity decreased with increasing straw content for the same water pressure head. Tomographic images showed that mixing straw into the soil created new pores in the samples. Results from simulations of straw decomposition indicated that (i) the uptake of water by straw has to be taken into account when calculating how much water should be added gravimetrically in an incubation experiment and (ii) changes in hydraulic conductivity due to the presence of straw can have an impact on water and C dynamics. 3aagricultural soils 3awheat straw 3asoil amendments 3atopsoil 3aloam soils 3asoil water retention 3adegradation 3ahydraulic conductivity 0asoil hydraulic properties1 aEzzine, N.1 aGryze, S. de1 aRichard, G.0 tVadose zone journal.g2004 May, v. 3, no. 2x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/3/2/7143Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/25  aOther US 7aarticle02801naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001800181245011300199300001600312500002400328500001500352520138200367650002301749650002101772650001901793650001401812650001701826650001801843650003601861650002101897653002701918653002701945653002501972700001101997700001502008700002102023700001502044773010102059852000902160856006902169930003302238945002502271946001102296655001202307IND4386732120221118234030.0070111e20060630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438673212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2005.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aX380 0aL8401 aWebster, D.E.10aActivation of the μ-opiate receptor by Vitex agnus-castus methanol extracts: Implication for its use in PMS  ap. 216-221.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe dried ripe fruit of Vitex agnus-castus L. (VAC) is widely used for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). A previous study reported that extracts of VAC showed affinity to opiate receptors; however, functional activity was not determined. We tested two different VAC extracts in receptor binding and functional assays. Our objectives were: (1) to confirm the opiate affinity; (2) to rule out interference by free fatty acids (FFA); (3) to determine the mode of action of VAC at the μ-opiate receptor. Methanol extracts of VAC were prepared either before (VAC-M1) or after (VAC-M2) extraction with petroleum ether to remove fatty acids. Both extracts showed significant affinities to the μ-opiate receptor, as indicated by the concentration-dependent displacement of [3H]DAMGO binding in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-human μ-opiate receptor (hMOR) cells. The IC50 values were estimated to be 159.8 μg/ml (VAC-M1) and 69.5 μg/ml (VAC-M2). Since the defatted extract not only retained, but exhibited a higher affinity (p < 0.001), it argued against significant interference by fatty acids. In an assay to determine receptor activation, VAC-M1 and VAC-M2 stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding by 41 and 61% (p < 0.001), respectively. These results suggested for the first time that VAC acted as an agonist at the μ-opiate receptor, supporting its beneficial action in PMS. 3aVitex agnus-castus 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3areceptors 3amenstruation 3abinding sites 3achemical constituents of plants 3aanalgesic effect 0apre-menstrual syndrome 0afruits (plant anatomy) 0amedicinal properties1 aLu, J.1 aChen, S.N.1 aFarnsworth, N.R.1 aWang, Z.J.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2006 June 30, v. 106, no. 2 p.216-221dElsevier.x0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2005.12.0253electronic resource  a20070323b20070402c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/03/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03192naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010200128300001600230520202600246650002802272650002302300650001702323650002802340650001502368650002602383650002102409650003702430650002102467650002502488650002202513650001602535650001102551700002002562700001802582700001802600773009802618852000902716930003302725945001302758946001102771655001202782IND2326891920221118234042.0020503e200112  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232689192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharvalos, E.10aControlled release of water-soluble polymeric complexes of sorbic acid with antifungal activities  ap. 770-775.  aWe synthesized six water-soluble polymeric complexes of sorbic acid with polyvinylpyrrolidone of different molecular weight (mol wt). As shown by infrared absorption spectrum analysis, the complexes were formed by hydrogen bonding. The complexes (SC1, with mol wt=10 kDa, SC2 with mol wt=25 kDa, SC3 with mol wt=30 kDa, SC4 with mol wt=40 kDa, SC5 with mol wt=90 kDa, and SC6 with mol wt=360 kDa) were characterized as low mol wt (SC1, SC2, and SC3) and high mol wt (SC4, SC5, and SC6). The antifungal potencies of the complexes were tested by the macrodilution susceptibility method against environmental and clinically important fungi. Sorbic acid as well as the complexes exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) lower than potassium sorbate against all the strains tested. MICs of SC1, SC2, and SC3 were shown to be 2- to 4-fold lower for yeast and 1.5- to 3-fold lower than those of sorbic acid for moulds, respectively. The MICs of SC4 and SC5 against both of the Candida species tested ranged from 500 to 800 microgram/ml, whereas for SC6 and sorbic acid they were about 1 mg/ml. The potencies of the high mol wt complexes against moulds were decreased by increasing the mol wt. For both of the moulds tested, the MICs of SC4 were slightly lower than those of sorbate. The MICs of sorbic acid and SC5 were equal to 300 microgram/ml and 500 microgram/ml respectively for Aspergillus parasiticus and for Penicillium viridicatum. The susceptibility to SC6 of all of the hyphomycetes tested was higher than that to sorbic acid. The low mol wt complexes and the sorbic acid exhibited minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) 2 and 3 times higher respectively than the MICs. Sorbic acid and SC3 at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in an in vitro time kill curve study of Candida tropicalis were shown to be fungistatic, whereas SC1 and SC2 were fungicidal at the same concentrations. For Aspergillus parasiticus sorbic acid at 2.5 mg/ml was fungistatic for a 24-h period, whereas SC1, SC2, and SC3 were fungicidal. 3aAspergillus parasiticus 3aCandida tropicalis 3aHyphomycetes 3aPenicillium viridicatum 3aabsorption 3aantifungal properties 3ahydrogen bonding 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amolecular weight 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3apotassium sorbate 3asorbic acid 3ayeasts1 aTzatzarakis, M.1 aTsatsakis, A.1 aPetrikkos, G.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2001 Dec., v. 57, no. 5/6 p.770-775x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02462naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013000126300001600256520132500272650001201597650002301609650002301632650002501655650002501680650001101705650001701716650002001733650001701753650002601770650002301796650002201819650002501841700001401866700001401880773010401894852000901998930003302007945001302040946001102053655001202064IND2204316620221118234325.0000504e19990925ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220431662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeixido, N.10aEfficacy of preharvest and postharvest Candida sake biocontrol treatments to prevent blue mould on apples during cold storage  ap. 203-210.  aThis study compared the biocontrol efficiency preharvest and postharvest applied yeast cells of Candida sake to apples (cv. Golden Delicious) wounded before and after harvest and inoculated with Penicillium expansum prior to cold storage conditions in two seasons, 1994/95 and 1995/96. The establishment of populations of C. sake during this period also was determined. In both years, postharvest treatment with the antagonist resulted in significant (P < 0.05) and effective control of Penicillium rot whether pre- or postharvest wounds were made. Maximum disease control achieved, in terms of incidence and severity, was greater than 80% reduction in lesion diameter and 50% reduction in the incidence of lesions. However, preharvest application of the antagonistic yeast at a concentration of 3(.)10(6) CFU/ml was less effective against Penicillium rot than postharvest treatment. No advantages in biocontrol were observed when apples were treated with the yeast antagonist both pre- and postharvest. Candida sake population levels during cold storage of apples receiving only preharvest application of the antagonist decreased prior and more rapidly than levels in apples receiving a postharvest application. High populations of C. sake were present in postharvest-treated apples, even after 90 days in cold storage. 3aCandida 3afungal antagonists 3abiological control 3aPenicillium expansum 3apostharvest diseases 3aapples 3acold storage 3astored products 3apretreatment 3apostharvest treatment 3apopulation density 3amechanical damage 3apreharvest treatment1 aUsall, J.1 aVinas, I.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g1999 Sept. 25, v. 50, no. 3 p.203-210x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02229naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245004200123300001600165500001500181520137400196650001301570650001901583650001601602650001801618650001901636650001501655650001601670653001101686653001001697700001601707773009001723852000901813930003301822945001301855946001101868655001201879IND2046428420221118234349.0950614e19950507enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204642842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Y.10aKinematics of axial plant root growth  ap. 109-117.  a2019-12-05  aAxial growth of plant roots can be modeled as the deformation of a one-dimensional continuum. In this study we present a theory of root elongation that incorporates different roles of cell division in the meristem and axial growth in the elongation region in overall root extension. The meristem is idealized as being located at the root tip, from which material points are produced continuously by cell division. Elongation takes place after material points leave the meristem. Each material point along the root axis is associated with a unique time at which it was produced. The total rate of root growth is the sum of the rate of elongation of all cells present plus the contribution from the meristem. Under steady-state conditions, the rate of elongation of a particular segment of the root is a function of its age only. The theory enables us to compare spatial patterns of steady-state root elongation with distribution of cell sizes along the root axis. The theory is also used to characterize the effects of soil water stress and temperature on root growth. Soil water stress reduces both the rate of meristem production and the subsequent cell elongation, resulting in a shorter elongation region. The effect of temperature is characterized by a temperature-time equivalence effect, leading to an elongation region with its length independent of temperature. 3aZea mays 3adynamic models 3acell growth 3acell division 3aroot meristems 3akinematics 3aroot growth 0agrowth 0aroots1 aBoersma, L.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g1995 May 7, v. 174, no. 1 p.109-117x0022-51937nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02905naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002500154242010000179245009800279300001600377500002400393520148000417650002801897650002901925650002301954650002401977650001502001650001402016650000902030650001202039650001602051650001402067650001702081650001402098650001602112650001202128650001002140650002002150650001102170650001602181651001602197700001602213773014002229852000902369856005702378655001202435IND4456023520221118234123.0110408e196212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445602352DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1962.tb00594.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBravenboer, Lubertus10aPhytoseiulus riegeli dosse als prädator einiger schadmilben aus der tetranychus urticae-gruppe10aPhytoseiulus riegeli dosse as a predator of red spider mites of the tetranychus urticae group  ap. 291-304.  aIncludes references  aExperiments done in Stuttgart‐Hohenheim and Naaldwijk showed that development and egg laying of the predatory mite Phytoseiulus riegeli Dosse (= persimilis Athias‐Henriot) is strongly affected by temperature and nutrition. The optimum temperature lies between 25° and 30°; here the female lays an average of four eggs daily and consumes 30 eggs or 24 immature stages of Tetranychus cinnabarinus Boisduval or T. dianthica Dosse. Both mites are eaten equally readily. The egg number is determined by the amount of food taken rather than by the species consumed, but excess food does not increase egg deposition. The total developmental period of the predator is between 3 and 5 days under favourable conditions. This is less than the time taken by the pest. Experiments lasting over 2 years in the Netherlands on the effect of Ph. persimilis on T. cinnabarinus on peach in the greenhouse, showed that the predator, because of its rapid development, can soon get rid of the pest and prevent economic injury to the crop. After the predator has finished with the pest, he himself dies presently because of lack of food. If the pest starts again, Ph. persimilis should be introduced anew. The best results were obtained at rather low populations of T. cinnabarinus. On cucumbers grown in the greenhouse in early spring Ph. persimilis was likewise successful against T. urticae Koch and gave results comparable to from three to five applications of insecticides or acaricides. 3aPhytoseiulus persimilis 3aTetranychus cinnabarinus 3aTetranychus evansi 3aTetranychus urticae 3aacaricides 3acucumbers 3aeggs 3afemales 3agreenhouses 3aimmatures 3ainsecticides 3anutrition 3aoviposition 3apeaches 3apests 3apredatory mites 3aspring 3atemperature 3aNetherlands1 aDosse, Gudo0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1962 Dec., v. 5, no. 4 p.291-304dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1962.tb00594.x 7aarticle03104naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002000161245006800181500024600249500001500495520145500510650001901965650002201984650002202006650002002028650001202048650001602060650001402076650001602090651001102106653002402117653001702141653003902158653001602197653001802213653002902231653002502260700001702285700001802302700001502320700001702335773006602352852000902418856008802427930003302515945002502548946001302573655001202586IND4369008820221118234222.0050415e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436900882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Finsterle and C.M. Oldenburg.  Paper presented at the TOUGH Symposium 2003 held May 12-14, 2003, Berkeley, California.  a2019-12-05  aCavities excavated in unsaturated geological formations are important to activities such as nuclear waste disposal and mining. Such cavities provide a unique setting for simultaneous occurrence of seepage and evaporation. Previously, inverse numerical modeling of field liquid-release tests and associated seepage into cavities were used to provide seepage-related large-scale formation properties, ignoring the impact of evaporation. The applicability of such models was limited to the narrow range of ventilation conditions under which the models were calibrated. The objective of this study was to alleviate this limitation by incorporating evaporation into the seepage models. We modeled evaporation as an isothermal vapor diffusion process. The semiphysical model accounts for the relative humidity (RH), temperature, and ventilation conditions of the cavities. The evaporation boundary layer thickness (BLT) over which diffusion occurs was estimated by calibration against free-water evaporation data collected inside the experimental cavities. The estimated values of BLT were 5 to 7 mm for the open underground drifts and 20 mm for niches closed off by bulkheads. Compared with previous models that neglected the effect of evaporation, this new approach showed significant improvement in capturing seepage fluctuations into open cavities of low RH. At high relative-humidity values (>85%), the effect of evaporation on seepage was very small. 3awaste disposal 3asimulation models 3arelative humidity 3ahazardous waste 3aseepage 3aevaporation 3adiffusion 3atemperature 3aNevada 0amathematical models 0aiTOUGH2 code 0aventilated waste disposal cavities 0aTOUGH2 code 0aliquid wastes 0aboundary layer thickness 0awaste disposal sites1 aTrautz, R.C.1 aFinsterle, S.1 aCook, P.J.1 aAhlers, C.F.0 tVadose zone journal.g2004 Aug., v. 3, no. 3x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/3/3/8063Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/25  aOther US 7aarticle03000naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110040001800130100001600148245010000164300001600264300002100280520097600301650001901277650001501296650002501311650002001336650002001356650002901376650001901405650002001424650001201444650004301456650002001499650002001519650003701539650002701576650007801603650003701681650002501718650003501743650001701778650007301795650002101868650007801889650006901967650004402036650007202080650004002152653001702192700001802209773014002227852000902367930003302376946001302409655001202422IND9302215020221118234412.0930413e19930115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930221502DNAL7 a76784642pmid7 aPMC457422pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, R.E.10aAcidic C terminus of vaccinia virus DNA-binding protein interacts with ribonucleotide reductase  ap. 745-749.  ap. 745-749. ill.  aEvidence from prokaryotic systems suggests that enzymes of dNTP synthesis are organized near the DNA replication apparatus, allowing direct utilization of dNTPs at their sites of synthesis. To investigate whether similar interactions exist within a eukaryotic environment, we have prepared anti-idiotypic antibodies to the small subunit of vaccinia virus ribonucleotide reductase, and we used these antibodies to search for proteins that interact with this enzyme. This approach identified a 34-kDa viral phosphoprotein, which, like ribonucleotide reductase itself, is localized within infected cells at DNA replication sites. After expression of its structural gene in Escherichia coli, the recombinant protein was purified and found (i) to bind tightly to single-stranded DNA and (ii) to stimulate enzymatic activity of vaccinia ribonucleotide reductase. These observations suggest a physical association between dNTP synthesis and DNA replication in this viral system. 3aVaccinia virus 3aantibodies 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aDNA replication 3agene expression 3aribonucleotide reductase 3aviral proteins 3aphosphoproteins 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Anti-Idiotypicxmetabolism 2aCells, Cultured 2aDNA Replication 2aDNA, Single-Strandedxmetabolism 2aDNA, Viralxmetabolism 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEpitopesximmunology 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aGenes, Viral 2aPhosphoproteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPrecipitin Tests 2aRecombinant Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aRibonucleotide Reductasesxdrug effectsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aVaccinia virusxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aViral Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aViral Structural Proteinsxgenetics 0ainteractions1 aMathews, C.K.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1993 Jan. 15, v. 90, no. 2 p.745-749x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01945naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001600159245007100175300001800246500002400264500001500288520083700303650002801140650002101168650002001189650002001209650001901229653002401248700001601272700001601288773009801304852000901402856009101411930003301502945002501535946001101560655001201571IND4386733720221118234432.0070111s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438673372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.11.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5061 aMarsham, S.10aComparison of nutritive chemistry of a range of temperate seaweeds  ap. 1331-1336.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEleven species of macroalgae (including four species from commercially important genera) were analysed for moisture, ash, fat, protein, neutral detergent fibre, crude fibre, calorific value, and calcium content.

Finsterle and C.M. Oldenburg.  Paper presented at the TOUGH Symposium 2003 held May 12-14, 2003, Berkeley, California.  a2019-12-05  aA complex pattern of coupling between fluid flow and mass transport develops when heterogeneous reactions occur. For instance, dissolution and precipitation reactions can change a porous medium's physical properties, such as pore geometry and thus permeability. These changes influence fluid flow, which in turn impacts the composition of dissolved constituents and the solid phases, and the rate and direction of advective transport. Two-dimensional modeling studies using TOUGHREACT were conducted to investigate the coupling between flow and transport developed as a consequence of differences in density, dissolution¡precipitation, and medium heterogeneity. The model includes equilibrium reactions for aqueous species, kinetic reactions between the solid phases and aqueous constituents, and full coupling of porosity and permeability changes resulting from precipitation and dissolution reactions in porous media. In addition, a new permeability relationship is implemented in TOUGHREACT to examine the effects of geochemical reactions and density difference on plume migration in porous media. Generally, the evolutions in the concentrations of the aqueous phase are intimately related to the reaction-front dynamics. Plugging of the medium contributed to significant transients in patterns of flow and mass transport. 3awaste disposal 3asimulation models 3asoil pollution 3ageochemistry 3achemical precipitation 3apollutants 3aporous media 3asoil water movement 3avadose zone 3apermeability 0aTOUGHREACT model 0achemical plume migration 0amathematical models 0acontaminants 0aTOUGHREACT code 0areactive barriers 0asoil transport processes 0awaste disposal sites1 aSchwartz, F.W.1 aXu, T.1 aChoi, H.1 aKim, I.S.0 tVadose zone journal.g2004 Aug., v. 3, no. 3x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://vzj.scijournals.org/cgi/reprint/3/3/8673Available from publisher's Web site  a20110819b20110902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/25  aOther US 7aarticle03013naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013600128300001600264500001500280520179700295650001702092650002502109650001702134650000902151650001402160650001402174650001702188650001102205650001302216650001702229650001202246650002402258653001802282653002102300700001402321700001802335700001802353700001702371700001502388773008402403852000902487930003302496945001302529946001302542655001202555IND2327945420221118234200.0020709e200201  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232794542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamoshita, A.10aEffects of phenotyping environment on identification of quantitative trait loci for rice root morphology under anaerobic conditions  ap. 255-265.  a2019-12-04  aIn the rainfed lowlands, rice (Oryza sativa L.) develops roots under anaerobic soil conditions with ponded water, prior to exposure to aerobic soil conditions and water stress. Constitutive root system development in anaerobic soil conditions has been reported to have a positive effect on subsequent expression of adaptive root traits and water extraction during water stress. We examined effects of phenotyping environment on identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for constitutive root morphology traits using 220 doubled-haploid lines (DHLs) from the cross of 'CT9993-5-10-1-M' (CT9993; japonica, upland adapted) x 'IR62266-42-6-2' (IR62266; indica, lowland adapted) in four greenhouse experiments. Broad sense heritability (h2) was 75, 60, and 64% on average for shoot biomass, deep root morphology, and root thickness traits, respectively. Quantitative trait loci analysis identified 18 genomic regions associated with deep root morphology traits, but only three were identified consistently across experiments. Three out of a total of eight QTLs for root thickness traits were found in more than one experiment. The maximum genetic effects caused by a single QTL were increments of 0.05 g of deep root mass below a 30-cm soil depth, 0.9% of deep root ratio, 1.6 cm of rooting depth, and 0.09 cm of root thickness, with phenotypic variation explained by a single QTL ranging from 6.8 to 51.8%. The results demonstrate the importance of phenotyping environment and suggest prospects for selection of QTLs for deep root morphology, root thickness, and vigorous seedling growth under anaerobic conditions to improve the constitutive root system of rainfed lowland rice. There was some consistency in QTL regions identified, despite the presence of QTL x environment interactions. 3awater uptake 3aanaerobic conditions 3aroot systems 3aloci 3aphenotype 3athickness 3aOryza sativa 3ashoots 3asoil air 3aheritability 3abiomass 3aquantitative traits 0aplant anatomy 0aplant morphology1 aZhang, J.1 aSiopongco, J.1 aSarkarung, S.1 aNguyen, H.T.1 aWade, L.J.0 tCrop science.g2002 , v. 42, no. 1 p.255-265wJournal:jnl44570x1435-06537nnas  aDNAL  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02088naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100002300159245014000182300001800322500002400340500001500364520071800379650001901097650002801116650001401144650002001158650002501178650001901203650002301222651001301245653000901258653001101267653002001278653001401298700001701312700001901329700001501348773009801363852000901461856009101470930003301561945002501594946001101619655001201630IND4386737520221118234249.0070111s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438673752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.11.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aFerreira, I.C.F.R.10aFree-radical scavenging capacity and reducing power of wild edible mushrooms from northeast Portugal: Individual cap and stipe activity  ap. 1511-1516.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe antioxidant properties of two wild edible mushroom species from the northeast of Portugal, Lactarius deliciosus (L.)

Marigold (Tagetes erecta L. ‘Marvel') was used to understand the role and relationship of NO and H₂O₂ in adventitious root development of plants. The results showed that the effects of H₂O₂ or NO on adventitious root organogenesis of explants were dose dependent, with maximal biological responses at 200 μM H₂O₂ or 50 μM NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP). The results also indicated the importance of both putative NO synthase (NOS)-like and nitrate reductase (NR) enzymes, which might be responsible for the production of NO in explants during rooting. Additionally, guanosine 3′, 5′ -cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) was involved in NO- induced root formation of marigold, but it was not involved in H₂O₂- mediated rooting process. The root number and length of explants treated with NO and H₂O₂ simultaneously were significantly higher than those of explants treated with H₂O₂ or NO alone. Moreover, NO treatments enhanced endogenous H₂O₂ levels in hypocotyls.

Moench] races. Our intent was to identify one approach using agronomic descriptors that would most closely approximate the groupings produced by RAPD markers. Ninety-four accessions of sorghum were grouped into four of the five major races. Differences among accessions determined by various clustering procedures based on agronomic characteristics were compared with clusters developed by means of RAPD markers. Each race varied in the degree of similarity between the four clustering approaches taken and the information provided by RAPD fingerprinting. Test 2, standardization of data by Z-scores and cluster analysis using the complete set of data, provided the highest similarity score for the race bicolor, while Test 3, standardization of data by Z-scores and cluster analysis based on a reduced set of variables selected from principle component analysis, provided the highest similarity scores for the races guinea. Test 1, random selection, was highest for the races caudatum and durra. When averaged over all the races, Test 2 provided the highest similarity score. The results of this study indicate that no one approach to develop clusters by means of agronomic descriptors closely approximate the groupings produced by RAPD markers. These results underscore the need for further research in the evaluation of techniques used to develop core collections and their validity. 3aSorghum bicolor 3agermplasm 3aseeds 3aplant morphology 3ameasurement 3agene banks 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aagronomic traits 3agenetic variation 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aPuerto Rico1 aZhang, X.1 aHart, G.E.1 aMullet, J.E.0 tCrop science.g2002 , v. 42, no. 1 p.291-296x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02204naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245004700129300001600176500001500192520132900207650002401536650002001560650001101580650001901591650002701610650001201637653001101649653001101660653001001671700001601681773009101697852000901788930003301797945001301830946001101843655001201854IND2042024320221118234416.0940915e19940607enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204202432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeissing, F.J.10aGrowth and competition in a light gradient  ap. 323-336.  a2019-12-05  aIn this paper a general model for growth and competition in a light gradient is developed. The model is based on a few qualitative assumptions: (i) biomass is continuously distributed over depth; (ii) the light gradient is one-dimensional and uni-directional; (iii) photosynthesis is positively related to the local light intensity; and (iv) biomass growth is governed by the carbon balance. By introducing the concept of "quantum return", it is shown that growth can be quantified directly in terms of the light gradient. In monoculture, growth leads to a globally stable equilibrium, at which the light intensity at the bottom of the light gradient is reduced to a "critical light intensity". Critical light intensity is not affected by the background turbidity but negatively related to the light supply. When all species are similarly distributed over the light gradient, the outcome of competition can be inferred from this monoculture characteristic: the species with lowest critical light intensity will competitively exclude all other species. In contrast, spatial differentiation of the competitors may lead to a completely different situation: several species may co-exist, and the species with lowest critical light intensity may be competitively displaced by species with a better position in the light gradient. 3amathematical models 3alight intensity 3acarbon 3aphotosynthesis 3aecological competition 3abiomass 0agrowth 0aplants 0alight1 aHuisman, J.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g1994 June 7, v. 168, no. 3 p.323-336x0022-51937nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02350naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100002300159245004600182300001800228500002400246520118100270650001901451650002301470650001601493650001901509650001701528650001001545650001601555650001101571651001001582700001601592700001701608700001801625700001801643773009801661852000901759856009101768930003301859945002501892946001101917655001201928IND4386736920221118234057.0070111s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438673692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.11.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aGomez-Miguez, M.J.10aVolatile components of Zalema white wines  ap. 1464-1473.  aIncludes references  aThe volatile composition of young white wines from Vitis vinifera cv. Zalema, an autochthonous grape variety in Huelva (southern Spain), has been studied by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) and techniques of quantitative analysis. This is the first time that an olfactometric analysis has been reported in wines made from this grape variety. The quantitative chemical study has shown 71 volatile compounds, of which 23 were in concentrations above their thresholds. On the basis of the odour activity values (OAVs), the most potent odorants were fermentative compounds, mainly fatty acids and their ethyl esters. Two norisoprenoids, β-damascenone and β-ionone, two alcohols (isoamyl alcohol and β-phenylethanol), three volatile thiols, 4-mercapto-4-methyl-2-pentanone, 3-mercaptohexyl acetate and 3-mercapto-1-hexanol, and two carbonyl compounds (acetaldehyde and phenylacetaldehyde) also exhibited OAVs > 1. The GC-O study corroborated these results, showing that five esters (isoamyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl isovalerate and ethyl octanoate), isoamyl alcohol and β-damascenone can be considered as the most powerful odorants of Zalema wines. 3afood chemistry 3avolatile compounds 3awhite wines 3aVitis vinifera 3aolfactometry 3aodors 3afatty acids 3aesters 3aSpain1 aCacho, J.F.1 aFerreira, V.1 aVicario, I.M.1 aHeredia, F.J.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 100, no. 4 p.1464-1473dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.11.0453Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070502b20070602c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/04/17  aNon-US 7aarticle01086naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004400099040001800143100002000161245011500181300001400296520021600310650002100526650001000547700002000557773011300577852000900690856005700699930003300756945000800789946001100797655001200808991561901200742620221118234205.0751101e197503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7590956552DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1975.tb00734.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParkinson, J.D.12aA study of two physiological races of the heather psyllid, Strophingia ericae (Curtis) (Homoptera: Psylloidea)  ap. 73-81.  aEvidence is presented that Strophingia ericae, a small homopteran feeding on Calluna has two physiological races.

Fatty acid mobilization was calculated as the percentage of the mass of a given fatty acid lost during the fast. The average mobilization for all fatty acids was 43.2%. The mobilization of individual fatty acids, varied from 30% for 20:1, the least mobilized fatty acid to 78.5% for EPA (20:5 n3) the most mobilized fatty acid. The polyunsaturated fatty acids were mobilized to a significantly greater extent than the monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids.

One day-old 120 male broilers were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups, 3 replicates of 10 birds each. The birds were fed either a basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with either 400 mg of Cr/kg of diet, 250 mg of L-ascorbic acid/kg of diet, or 400 mg of Cr plus 250 mg of L-ascorbic acid/kg of diet. Separately or as a combination, supplemental chromium and vitamin C increased body weight gain (P < 0.01) and feed intake (P < 0.01), and improved feed efficiency (P < 0.05). The supplements also increased hot and chilled carcass weights and yields (P < 0.05) as well as liver, heart, spleen, and gizzard weights (P < 0.05). However, abdominal fat decreased (P < 0.05) upon dietary chromium and vitamin C supplementation. Separately or as a combination, supplemental chromium and vitamin C resulted in an increase in serum insulin, T3, T4, but a decrease in corticosterone (P < 0.05), glucose and cholesterol (P < 0.05) concentrations. Supplemental chromium and vitamin C also increased serum concentrations of vitamin C and vitamin E (P < 0.05) but, decreased MDA concentrations (P < 0.01). The results of the study show that, separately or as a combination, vitamin C and chromium supplementation resulted in an improved live weight gain, feed efficiency, and carcass traits, as well as a decrease in serum corticosterone and MDA concentrations. The results of the present study also suggest that vitamin C and chromium have similar effects and that a combination of vitamin C (250 mg/kg of diet) and chromium (400 mg Cr/kg of diet) may offer a potential protective management practice in preventing heat stress-related depression in performance of broiler chickens. 3aabdominal fat 3aambient temperature 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3abroiler chickens 3acarcass weight 3acholesterol 3achromium 3acorticosterone 3adiet 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agizzard 3aglucose 3aheart 3aheat 3aheat stress 3ainsulin 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3aliveweight gain 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolites 3arearing 3aspleen 3atriiodothyronine 3avitamin E1 aSahin, N.1 aKucuk, O.0 tNutrition research.g2003 Feb., v. 23, no. 2 p.225-238x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nrjournal.com/issues?issue_key=S0271-5317(00)X0094-23Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140407  aOther US 7aarticle03539naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110040001800130100001100148245016300159300001800322300002300340520187200363650001402235650002302249650002002272650001702292650002002309650002902329650002102358650001202379650003602391650001802427650003102445650001302476650002102489650002502510650004302535650003802578650001502616650002802631650001302659650003002672650002002702650003602722653001102758700001302769700001702782773014302799852000902942939003302951946001302984655001202997IND9206016020221118234122.0920929e19920715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920601602DNAL7 a13214382pmid7 aPMC495072pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Y.10aUnmutated proto-src coding region is tumorigenic if expressed from the promoter of Rous sarcoma virus: implications for the gene-mutation hypothesis of cancer  ap. 6393-6397.  ap. 6393-6397. ill.  aThe transforming (onc) genes of oncogenic retroviruses share most or all of their coding sequences with normal cellular genes termed proto-onc genes. The viral genes differ from proto-onc genes in virus-specific promoters and in various point mutations and substitutions of cell-derived coding regions. In view of the structural similarities between viral oncogenes and cellular proto-onc genes, the hypothesis has been advanced that proto-onc genes become cellular cancer genes if they have suffered mutations. Indeed, point mutations and substitutions have been observed in the proto-onc genes of some cancers. However, the hypothesis has been difficult to prove because mutated proto-onc genes from tumors do not transform diploid cells. Moreover, owing to the popularity of this hypothesis, even viral oncogenes are thought to derive transforming function from mutations of this cell-derived coding region. A competing hypothesis proposes that enhanced expression from retroviral promoters is necessary and sufficient for oncogenic function of proto-onc genes. To distinguish between these hypotheses we have tested tumorigenicity of RpSV, a synthetic retrovirus with the normal proto-src coding region in a vector derived from Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). In addition, we have tested the role of RSV-specific src point mutations on the tumorigenicity of RpSV. It was found that RpSV with an unmutated proto-src coding region is tumorigenic in chickens and that tumorigenicity is enhanced by RSV-specific src point mutations. It is concluded that retroviral promoters are essential for the transforming function of viral oncogenes and that certain point mutations merely supplement their transforming function. Thus retroviral onc genes are not models for the hypothesis that mutated, but transcriptionally normal, proto-onc genes of certain tumors are cancer genes. 3aneoplasms 3aRous sarcoma virus 3agene expression 3agenetic code 3acarcinogenicity 3atranscription (genetics) 3asomatic mutation 2aAnimals 2aAvian Sarcoma Virusesxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Transformation, Viral 2aChickens 2aDNA, Recombinant 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Viral 2aGenes, src 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aProto-Oncogenes 2aSarcoma, Experimentalxgenetics 0atheory1 aZhou, H.1 aDuesberg, P.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1992 July 15, v. 89, no. 14 p.6393-6397x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02235naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245015000129300001600279520103400295650001301329650001101342650001201353650001301365650001101378650003401389650001601423650000901439650002101448650002001469650001401489650001901503650000901522651001701531700002401548700001701572773007601589852000901665856010501674939003301779946001301812655001201825IND4479454520221118234200.0140407e200302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447945452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacKeown, J.M.10aNutrient intake among a longitudinal group of urban black South African children at four interceptions between 1995 and 2000 (Birth-to-Ten Study)  ap. 185-197.  aThe manuscript reports on the energy, macro- and micronutrient intake of a true longitudinal group of urban black South African children [n = 163] from the Birth-to-Ten (BTT) Study seen at four interventions; 1995, 1997, 1999 and 2000 when they were 5, 7, 9 and 10-years, respectively. Dietary intake was assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The coded data was analysed using SAS. Calcium, iron, zinc and biotin were the most common nutrients found to fall below the RDA at most of the interceptions, with also the largest percentage of children falling below the recommended intakes for these nutrients. The nutrient intake of the children appeared to deteriorate from 1995 to 2000, with the lowest intakes for most nutrients recorded in 2000. Most nutrients showed a negative change in mean intake from 1999 to 2000, but a positive change from 1997 to 1999. The deterioration in nutrient density of the diet after 1995 reflects the difficult socio-economic circumstances encountered in South Africa. 3aAfricans 3abiotin 3acalcium 3achildren 3aenergy 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3airon 3anutrient density 3anutrient intake 3anutrients 3asocioeconomics 3azinc 3aSouth Africa1 aCleaton-Jones, P.E.1 aNorris, S.A.0 tNutrition research.g2003 Feb., v. 23, no. 2 p.185-197x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nrjournal.com/issues?issue_key=S0271-5317(00)X0094-23Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140407  aOther US 7aarticle01818naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001700172245007500189300001400264500002400278520070600302650001601008650002501024650002101049650002101070650002501091650001701116651002301133651003101156773009801187852000901285856006901294930003301363945002501396946001101421655001201432IND4386740320221118234146.0070111e20061103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438674032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2006.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF000 0aS200 0aX3801 aCavender, A.10aFolk medical uses of plant foods in southern Appalachia, United States  ap. 74-84.  aIncludes references  aAn analysis of information obtained from interviews with 660 older native inhabitants of the southern Appalachian region in the United States indicates that plant foods, especially cultivars and materials processed from them, and some wildcrafted plant foods as well, constituted the bulk of the folk materia medica in the 1920s and 1930s.

Much research has focused on the relationship between plant traits and C sequestration, but no studies to date have quantitatively considered traits of their mycorrhizal symbionts. Here, we use a modelling approach to assess the contribution of an important mycorrhizal fungal trait, organic nutrient uptake, to soil C accumulation. We show that organic nutrient uptake can significantly increase soil C storage, and that it has a greater effect under nutrient-limited conditions. The main mechanism behind this was an increase in plant C fixation and subsequent increased C inputs to soil through mycorrhizal fungi. Reduced decomposition due to increased nutrient limitation of saprotrophs also played a role. Our results indicate that direct uptake of nutrients from organic pools by mycorrhizal fungi could have a significant effect on ecosystem C cycling and storage. 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3adetritivores 3aecosystems 3amodels 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3asoil 3asymbionts 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aClimate Change 2aEcosystem 2aModels, Biological 2aMycorrhizaexmetabolism 2aSoilxchemistry1 aKirschbaum, Miko U.F.1 aSt John, Mark G.1 aDickie, Ian A.0 tEcology letters.g2011 May, v. 14, no. 5 p.493-502dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01611.x 7aarticle02554naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245015500172300001600327500002400343520147900367650001601846650001401862650001601876650001201892650001401904650001401918650002601932650001301958651001101971700003201982700002502014773010802039852000902147856004802156655001202204IND4458196120221118234108.0110520e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445819612DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-011-0437-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Melo, Marcos Cabral10aReproductive biology and isolation mechanisms in rupicolous species of the Acianthera prolifera complex (Orchidaceae) occurring in southeastern Brazil  ap. 161-176.  aIncludes references  aWe studied the floral biology and performed experimental intra- and interspecific pollinations in populations of a complex of four Acianthera (Orchidaceae) species occurring in Brazilian campo rupestre vegetation (A. hamosa, A. limae, A. modestissima, and A. prolifera). All four species flower synchronously, are partially intercompatible, and exhibited some degree of self-sterility. Floral morphology is similar in all the species, with their principal differences associated with size of the floral structures. The four species were visited only by Diptera species of the families Phoridae (Megaselia spp.) and Chloropidae, but visits are rare and fruit set is very low. Sympatric species were not pollinated by the same Diptera species. Acianthera hamosa and A. modestissima have the smallest flowers, and no marked morphological differences between them were observed; they were both pollinated by very similar Megaselia species. Both prepollination barriers and postpollination events are important to maintaining the isolation of the species, functioning as overlapping filters that diminish the possibility of gene flow between them. However, putative hybrids between A. prolifera and A. limae have been found. Conversely, A. hamosa and A. modestissima, which are recognized only by vegetative characters that show high phenotypic plasticity, seem only to be isolated by geographical barriers, and they may actually constitute a single species or be sister species. 3aChloropidae 3aMegaselia 3aOrchidaceae 3aflowers 3afruit set 3agene flow 3aphenotypic plasticity 3asympatry 3aBrazil1 aTaucce, Pedro Paulo Goulart1 aBorba, Eduardo Leite0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2011 May, v. 293, no. 1-4 p.161-176dSpringer Viennax0378-26977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-011-0437-z 7aarticle02693naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245008400145300001600229500001500245520098900260650002801249650001201277650002801289650002001317650001201337650001301349650002501362650001501387650001401402650001001416650001501426650002801441650002001469650002601489650002501515650004201540650001601582650002201598650003101620650004401651650005301695650004101748650002101789650002301810653002501833653001801858653001601876700001701892700002501909773010301934852000902037930003302046945001302079946001102092655001202103IND2205774820221118234127.0000714e19991115ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220577482DNAL7 a107332462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArena, M.E.10aArginine, citrulline and ornithine metabolism by lactic acid bacteria from wine  ap. 155-161.  a2019-12-05  aThe catabolism of arginine, an amino acid found in grape juice and wine, citrulline and ornithine was investigated in four lactic acid bacteria. Only Lactobacillus hilgardii X1B catabolized arginine and excreted citrulline into the medium. The recovery of arginine as ornithine was lower than the expected theoretical value. The arginase-urease pathway was not detected indicating that the amino acid degradation was carried out only by the arginine dihydrolase pathway. Oenococcus oeni m, a strain not able to utilize arginine, degraded citrulline that was completely recovered as ornithine, ammonia and CO2. Lactobacillus hilgardii X1B catabolized citrulline but it was only 44% recovered as ornithine. The citrulline utilization by Oenococcus oeni m may be important for two reasons: it can gain extra energy for growth from citrulline metabolism, and the amino-acid diminution could avoid the possibility of ethyl carbamate formation from the citrulline naturally present in wine. 3aPediococcus pentosaceus 3aammonia 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aOenococcus oeni 3aglucose 3aarginine 3alactic acid bacteria 3acitrulline 3aornithine 3awines 3ahydrolases 3aLactobacillus hilgardii 3aenzyme activity 3aamino acid metabolism 2aArgininexmetabolism 2aCitrullinexbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aColorimetry 2aGlucosexanalysis 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactobacillaceaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLactobacillusxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aOrnithinexbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aUreasexanalysis 2aWinexmicrobiology 0aarginine dihydrolase 0aLactobacillus 0agrowth rate1 aSaguir, F.M.1 aManca de Nadra, M.C.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g1999 Nov. 15, v. 52, no. 3 p.155-161x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle04556naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002300179245013300202300001600335500002400351506007600375520245500451506003702906650002302943650001302966650001402979650001502993650001403008650001603022650002503038650001903063650001403082650001403096650001503110650001603125650001103141650002103152650001403173650001203187650001303199650001403212650001903226650001203245650001103257650001103268650002403279650001403303650001903317650001303336650002603349650005303375650005103428650003103479650003903510650005003549700003103599700002203630773009903652852000903751856007803760856003203838655001203870IND4389760620221207083312.0070325e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438976062DNAL7 a172989882pmid7 aPMC28029362pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcm0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaffal, Karl Peter10aUltrastructural Evidence for a Dual Function of the Phloem and Programmed Cell Death in the Floral Nectary of Digitalis purpurea  ap. 593-607.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: The floral nectary of Digitalis purpurea is a transitory organ with stomatal exudation of nectar. In this type of nectary, the nectar is thought to be transported to the exterior via intercellular ducts that traverse the nectariferous tissue. The latter is also traversed by a ramified system of phloem strands from which prenectar sugar is most probably unloaded. The aims of this study were to provide some of the basic information needed to evaluate the possible mechanism involved in nectar secretion and to discover the fate of the nectary. METHODS: The ultrastructure of the nectary was investigated at different stages of development by analysis of a series of ultrathin (7 x 10⁻⁸ m) sections 7 x 10⁻⁷ m apart from one another. Proportions of the cells typical of the nectary were documented by 3D-reconstruction and morphometry. KEY RESULTS: The phloem consisted of variably shaped sieve elements and companion cells which, as a rule, were more voluminous than the sieve elements. Direct contact between the phloem strands and intercellular ducts was observed. In contrast to the phloem, which remained structurally intact beyond the secretory phase, the nectariferous tissue exhibited degenerative changes reminiscent of programmed cell death (PCD), which started as early as the onset of secretion and progressed in a cascade-like fashion until final cell death occurred in the exhausted nectary. Hallmarks of PCD were: increased vacuolation; increase in electron opacity of individual cells; progressive incorporation of plasmatic components into the vacuole reminiscent of autophagy; degradation of plastids starting with hydrolysis of starch; deformation of the nucleus and gradual disappearance of chromatin; loss of tonoplast integrity and subsequent autolysis of the rest of cellular debris. Degeneration of the cells occurred against a background of increasing cell size. CONCLUSIONS: The cytological and anatomical evidence presented here, and calculations of the solute fluxes necessary for accumulation of starch and for the production of nectar support the view that: (a) in the foxgloves' nectary, apoplastic phloem unloading dominates, at least during exudation of nectar; (b) the obsolete nectary may be dismantled by PCD; and (c) at least the products of late nectary degradation are loaded via the apoplast into the unchanged phloem and exported to sinks elsewhere in the plant for reallocation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDigitalis purpurea 3aapoplast 3aautolysis 3acell death 3achromatin 3adeformation 3adevelopmental stages 3adirect contact 3aelectrons 3aexudation 3ahydrolysis 3amorphometry 3anectar 3anectar secretion 3anectaries 3aopacity 3aplastids 3asecretion 3asieve elements 3asolutes 3astarch 3asugars 3atissue degeneration 3atonoplast 3aultrastructure 3avacuoles 2aApoptosisxphysiology 2aDigitalisxcytologyxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aFlowersxcytologyxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aImaging, Three-Dimensional 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aPhloemxcytologyxphysiologyxultrastructure.1 aFriedrichs, Gudrun Johanna1 aEl-Gammal, Stefan0 tAnnals of botany.g2007 Apr., v. 99, no. 4 p.593-607dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcm0023Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/ 7aarticle03232naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245016400126300001500290500001500305520169900320650000902019650001202028650002402040650002702064650003602091650001702127650001702144650000902161650001402170650001702184650001902201650001602220650001602236650000702252650001402259650001902273650002102292650001602313650002602329653001902355653002302374653002702397653002302424653001202447700001402459700001702473700001802490773010402508852000902612930003302621945001302654946001102667655001202678IND2205332520221118234145.0000620e19991015ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220533252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, F.M.10aThermal inactivation of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris spores under different temperature, soluble solids and pH conditions for the design of fruit processes  ap. 95-103.  a2019-12-05  aAlicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, a thermoacidophilic, non-pathogenic and spore-forming bacterium has been detected in several spoiled commercial pasteurised fruit juices. A. acidoterrestris spores, besides being resistant to the pasteurisation treatment conditions normally applied to acidic fruit products, can germinate and grow causing spoilage. Therefore, this microorganism was suggested as the target to be used in the design of adequate pasteurisation processes. The objectives of this work were to investigate the influence of temperature (T: 85-97 degrees C), total soluble solids (SS: 5-60 degrees Brix or % by weight) and pH (2.5-6.0) on D-values (decimal reduction time) of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris (type strain, NCIMB 13137) spores, and to fit a model using response surface methodology. A central composite face-centred experimental design was used, and the response, D-value determined in malt extract broth, ranged between 0.498 +/- 0.045 and 94.9 +/- 6.7 min. Within the factor ranges studied, temperature was the parameter that most affected the D-value. Following this was the SS and, lastly, the pH value. A linear decrease in D-value was observed with decreasing SS and pH, and a non-linear decrease in D-value was noticed with increasing temperature. A second order polynomial was successfully fitted to the data (R(2) = 0.98). In general, D-values measured in real fruit systems, such as orange, apple and grape juices, blackcurrant concentrates, cupuacu (exotic fruit) extract and orange juice drink, were higher than those predicted by the malt extract broth model. This result emphasises the importance of experimental validation of any model-derived process. 3abrix 3aacidity 3amathematical models 3aspore-forming bacteria 3atropical and subtropical fruits 3afruit drinks 3ainactivation 3aheat 3aequations 3aorange juice 3apasteurization 3aapple juice 3agrape juice 3apH 3aTheobroma 3ablack currants 3abacterial spores 3atemperature 3athermophilic bacteria 0afruit products 0aorange juice drink 0atheobroma grandiflorum 0amodel fruit juices 0acupuacu1 aGibbs, P.1 aVieira, M.C.1 aSilva, C.L.M.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g1999 Oct. 15, v. 51, no. 2/3 p.95-103x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02101naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001400168245007900182300001800261500002400279520088500303650001501188650002501203650001701228650002201245650001901267650001801286650002301304650001801327650001901345650001501364653001101379700002201390773009801412852000901510856009101519930003301610945002501643946001101668655001201679IND4386734920221118234012.0070111s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438673492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ505 0aQ5041 aKumar, A.10aDNA damage protecting activity and antioxidant potential of pudina extract  ap. 1377-1384.  aIncludes references  aPudina extract (Mentha spicata Linn.) used as flavoring in culinary preparation throughout the plains of India was examined for its DNA damage protecting activity and antioxidant potential. n-Butanol soluble fraction (PE) derived from methanol extract of Mentha spicata Linn. at 10 μg/ml exhibited significant protecting activity against DNA strand scission by OH on pBluescript II SK(-) DNA.

The large-scale processes of production and isolation of these proteins susceptible to aggregation and attachment to interfacial surfaces still needs to be studied. We report for the first time on a method for a gram-scale production and purification of a hydrophobin, HFBI of Trichoderma reesei. A high production level of the class II hydrophobin (0.6 g l(-1)) was obtained by constructing a T. reesei HFBI-overproducing strain containing three copies of the hfb1 gene. The strain was cultivated on glucose-containing medium, which induces expression of hfb1. HFBI hydrophobin was purified from the cell walls of the fungus because most of the HFBI was cell-bound (80%). Purification was carried out with a simple three-step method involving extraction of the mycelium with 1% SDS at pH 9.0, followed by KCl precipitation to remove SDS, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The yield was 1.8 g HFBI from mycelium (419 g dw), derived from 15 l of culture. HFBI was shown to be rather unstable to N-terminal asparagine deamidation and also, to some extent, to non-specific proteases although its thermostability was excellent. 3aTrichoderma reesei 3aasparagine 3acell walls 3adeamidation 3afungi 3agenes 3ahydrophobic interaction chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3ahydrophobins 3amycelium 3apH 3apotassium chloride 3aproteinases 3athermal stability1 aNakari-Setala, T.1 aTenkanen, M.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2001 Oct., v. 57, no. 1/2 p.124-130x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02298naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001400168245007400182300001800256500002400274520120600298650001901504650001601523650001501539650001601554650001601570650001301586700001301599700001301612700002001625773009801645852000901743856009101752930003301843945002501876946001101901655001201912IND4386734720221118234344.0070111s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438673472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ504 0aQ4041 aZhong, F.14aThe evaluation of proteases as coagulants for soy protein dispersions  ap. 1371-1376.  aIncludes references  aThe ability of different proteases to induce the gelation of soy protein isolate dispersions (5.33% w/w) was studied. The coagulation time and gel firmness were determined using dynamic viscoelastic measurements. Among the six protease tested, papain was the most effective coagulant in terms of gel strength and coagulation speed; the second was alcalase. Degree of hydrolysis (DH), pH and viscosity profiles of soy proteins were tested during the coagulation with different proteases. The result suggested that strong interactions, other than electrostatic interaction, existed between peptides in papain and alcalase induced coagulation. Thermal and pH stability tests indicated that papain was more stable than alcalase in the temperature (60-90 °C) and pH (5.8-7.0) ranges studied. Higher papain dosages within the range of 5-13.3 U/ml resulted in firmer soy protein gels, but concentrations higher than 13.3 U/ml produced weaker gels. With the addition of 0.625 mM cysteine, the soy protein coagulation ability of papain was improved. A soy protein gel formed with 0.025% papain in the presence of 0.625 mM cysteine had about the same strength as that induced by 0.133% papain without cysteine. 3afood chemistry 3aproteinases 3acoagulants 3asoy protein 3adispersions 3agelation1 aWang, Z.1 aXu, S.Y.1 aShoemaker, C.F.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 100, no. 4 p.1371-1376dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.12.0143Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070502b20070602c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/04/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02508naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245008600135300001600221520129300237650001101530650001701541650002801558650002101586650001601607650001601623650001701639650001801656650001601674650002001690650001301710650000701723650002801730650001201758650001301770653001001783653001601793653002201809700002201831700002601853773010501879852000901984930003301993945001302026946001102039655001202050IND2205332920221118234401.0000620e19991015ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220533292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuran Quintana, M.C.10aEstablishment of conditions for green table olive fermentation at low temperature  ap. 133-143.  aFour Lactobacillus plantarum strains were isolated from table olive cold fermentation brines. Their specific growth rate and acidification in MRS broth and in green table olive brines were studied by means of a mixed 2 pH (4.5 and 5.0) x 3 salt (3, 4 and 5%, w/v, NaCl) x 3 incubation temperature (9, 12 and 15 degrees C) levels factorial design. In MRS broth, the greatest effect (linear) on acidification was due to temperature. In brine, the effects were considerably less, pH (linear) being the most important for specific growth rate, and temperature (linear) for acidification. In both media, an initial pH of 5.0 led to good acidification at 12-15 degrees C. The effectiveness of the conditions found (initial pH of 5.0; 3%,w/v, NaCl; and incubation at 12 degrees C) was confirmed in simulated green olive fermentations with three of the strains, which proved especially robust. Behaviour in terms of growth and acidification rates was similar for these strains, and comparable to that observed in traditional processes, although mannitol and sucrose were not metabolised and fructose was only partially used. This leads to the possibility of obtaining normal fermentation processes of table olives in cold regions when appropriate initial conditions and starter cultures are used. 3aolives 3afermentation 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3astarter cultures 3alactic acid 3aacetic acid 3abiosynthesis 3aacidification 3atemperature 3asodium chloride 3asalinity 3apH 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aglucose 3afructose 0abrine 0agrowth rate 0acold fermentation1 aGarcia Garcia, P.1 aGarrido Fernandez, A.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g1999 Oct. 15, v. 51, no. 2/3 p.133-143x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01573naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245008500132300001600217520068400233650002400917650001900941650002300960650002100983653002601004700001901030700001501049700001901064773008801083852001301171939003301184945000801217946001301225852000901238655001201247991561894550742620221118234430.0870220e198604  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870003152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSumner, S.K.12aA weight control and nutrition education program for insurance company employees  ap.

The morphology of this bacterium changes from coccobacilli and short rods to chains during growth, which may give a false estimation in numbers using some enumeration techniques. Methods for the quantification of this bacterium have been compared. Turbidimetric readings showed good agreement with cell dry weight indicating that the former provides a good measure of the change in cell mass during growth. The turbidimetric method also correlated well with bacterial numbers determined by plate counts, flow cytometry and manual counts (by microscope) over a limited range of 10(7)-10(9) cells/ml. Flow cytometry and manual counts gave a linear relationship over a wider range of 10(5)-10(9) cells/ml. The sensitivity of analysis, growth rates and lag time attained using these methods were also compared. As a consequence of changes in bacterial cell size during growth, turbidimetry over-estimated the growth rate. The plate count method proved unable to detect the difference between bacteria existing as chains or single cells. The sensitivity of analysis and the calculated growth related parameters were similar for flow cytometry and manual counts. This suggests that flow cytometry is capable of counting individual cells in a chain. Further investigation showed that passage of B. thermosphacta cells through the flow cytometer resulted in the breakage of chains into single cells. The reliability, low error and rapidity of this technique make it attractive for bacterial enumeration, something which has been demonstrated using B. thermosphacta, a bacterium which exhibits complex morphologies. 3aanatomy and morphology 3aplate count 3aflow cytometry 0aturbidimetry 0abacterial counting 0agrowth rate 0acoryneform group of bacteria 0amanual count1 aBellara, S.R.1 aHarding, C.L.1 aFryer, P.J.1 aThomas, C.R.1 aAl-Rubeai, M.1 aMcFarlane, C.M.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g1999 Oct. 15, v. 51, no. 2/3 p.145-158x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02507naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011900128300001600247520162200263650003001885650001301915650002101928650001101949650002501960650002201985653001302007700001602020773009102036852000902127930003302136945001302169946001102182655001202193IND2042027020221118234004.0940915e19940207enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204202702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaefner, J.W.10aSpatial model of movement and foraging in harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex) (I): the roles of memory and communication  ap. 299-313.  aTo evaluate the relative importance of memory and pheromone trails to seed foraging, we constructed an individual-based model of ant foraging for a colony of the western harvester ant Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, a central-place forager. The model simulates the dynamic spatial positions of all individuals of three classes: ants without seeds, ants with seeds, and seeds. Each ant foraging above-ground is moved in a non-stationary correlated random walk according to a set of rules that determine the direction and distance of each successive step. We used movement rules that hypothesized behavioral mechanisms in five general areas: (i) space perception, (ii) memory, (iii) chemical communication, (iv) physiological competence of sensory systems, and (v) stimulation of nestmates. Field experiments that manipulated seed densities were simulated by depositing model seeds in patches at different times and places during the simulation. We simulated experimental presentations of renewing seed patches using several different movement rules and mechanisms of chemical communication. When pheromones were laid on a trail to the nest the best models had rules in which (i) ants used memory, (ii) foragers were stimulated at the nest by successful ants, and (iii) the interval between pheromone deposits was small. Models without any one of these three components failed to predict correctly. Sensitivity analyses indicated that ant foraging abilities were not strongly affected by chemical properties of the pheromone, but were influenced by the frequency of pheromone deposition and the geometry of the nest opening. 3aPogonomyrmex occidentalis 3aforaging 3atrail pheromones 3amemory 3aanimal communication 3asimulation models 0amovement1 aCrist, T.O.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g1994 Feb. 7, v. 166, no. 3 p.299-313x0022-51937nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02422naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002000169245015900189300001800348500002400366520098200390650002401372650002401396650002101420650001101441650002601452650002801478650001301506650002101519650001401540650002001554650002001574650002201594650001201616650001901628650001701647650002601664650003101690650001501721650002001736650000901756700001701765773009601782852000901878856005301887655001201940IND4403000820221118234107.0080319e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440300082DNAL7 a176278182pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2007.05.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKavdir, Yasemin10aInfluence of olive oil solid waste applications on soil pH, electrical conductivity, soil nitrogen transformations, carbon content and aggregate stability  ap. 2326-2332.  aIncludes references  aSome of the agricultural wastes have important economic potentials to be used as a plant nutrition and/or soil conditioner. Olive oil solid waste (OSW) is one of them. The aim of this study was to determine effects of OSW on soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), improving soil nitrogen (N) status, soil aggregate stability and soil carbon contents. Different rates of OSW (control, 2%, 4% and 8%, w/w) were applied to coarse soils and incubated for 2 months. OSW applications decreased soil pH values. The mean EC value of soil measured 2 months after the incubation was greater than that of the first month. Application of OSW at the rate of 8% has significantly increased soil total organic nitrogen contents. OSW applications at the rate of 8% (w/w) significantly increased both mean SOC content (3.5%) and aggregate stability (88%) after 2 months of incubation (p <0.01). Therefore, OSW has great potential to improve soil structure of coarse textured soil in short term. 3aaggregate stability 3aagricultural wastes 3aapplication rate 3acarbon 3acoarse-textured soils 3aelectrical conductivity 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aolive oil 3aplant nutrition 3asoil aggregates 3asoil conditioners 3asoil pH 3asoil treatment 3asolid wastes 2aElectric Conductivity 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aPlant Oils 2aRefuse Disposal 2aSoil1 aKilli, Dilek0 tBioresource technology.g2008 May, v. 99, no. 7 p.2326-2332dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2007.05.034 7aarticle02231naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002500110245012700135300001800262520104900280650001301329650001501342650002001357650002401377650000901401650001201410650001401422650001801436650001201454650001601466650001901482650001501501650000901516650001801525650001401543700002501557773007901582852000901661856010501670939003301775946001301808655001201821IND4479471120221118234518.0140414e200209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447947112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuccia, Barbara H.D.10aPsyllium reduces relative calcium bioavailability and induces negative changes in bone composition in weanling Wistar rats  ap. 1027-1040.  aCertain dietary fibers may decrease calcium bioavailability. The objective of this study was to determine the bioavailability of calcium from different amounts and sources of psyllium. Psyllium fiber sources were purified powdered psyllium seed husk, Metamucil® brand fiber supplement, and All-Bran® Bran Buds® cereal. Sixty-six female weanling rats were fed diets containing 5% or 10% purified psyllium, 5% or 10% Metamucil®, 5% or 10% All-Bran® Bran Buds®, or a control diet containing 5% cellulose for 4 weeks. Treatment diets resulted in lower body weight gain, increased fecal weight, and decreased apparent calcium absorption. Relative calcium bioavailability was reduced to less than 90% by diets containing 10% fiber from psyllium and 10% fiber from Metamucil®. Treatment diets induced significant negative changes in calcium, hydroxyproline, and hexosamine content of hind limb bones and mandibles. These results suggest that calcium bioavailability is reduced with an increased intake of soluble fiber from sources of psyllium. 3aPlantago 3aabsorption 3abioavailability 3abody weight changes 3abran 3acalcium 3acellulose 3adietary fiber 3afemales 3ahexosamines 3ahydroxyproline 3alimb bones 3arats 3asoluble fiber 3aweanlings1 aKunkel, M.

However, poor stand establishment, often due to seed dormancy, limits its widespread use. Seed dormancy is often caused by structures surrounding the embryo, the physiological state of the embryo itself, or a combination of these factors. The eastern gamagrass dispersal unit is a floret within a thick, hard cupule. The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of cupule (including lemma and palea) removal and caryopsis scarification on germination of eastern gamagrass by means of different commercial seed lots produced in different locations and years. Germination tests were conducted at 20/30 degrees C alternating temperature with light during 30 degrees C for 8 h daily. Germination counts were made every 7 d. After 28 d, the germination of decupulated caryopses from different seed lots germinated from 16 to 49% across seed lots, compared with 5 to 18% germination for caryopses with cupule intact. Scarifying the pericarp over the embryo, however, resulted in germination of all dormant seeds. We conclude that while the cupule (including the lemma and palea) contributes to the dormancy of eastern gamagrass, the pericarp and/or testa are the main factors restricting germination of this species. In addition, caryopsis scarification increased the germination rate and the germination test could be shortened to 21 or even 14 d depending on the seed lot. 3aseed germination 3aseed dormancy 3atesta 3apericarp 3aembryo (plant) 3apalatability 3aTripsacum dactyloides 0aseeds 0ascarification1 aKnapp, A.D.1 aMoore, K.J.1 aBrummer, E.C.1 aBailey, T.B.0 tCrop science.g2002 , v. 42, no. 1 p.185-189x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle01866naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245015100129300001800280500001500298520078900313650001401102650002001116650001001136650001801146650001601164650000901180650000901189650001601198650001601214650001801230653001701248773007901265852000901344856010501353939003301458946001301491655001201504IND4479461420221118234435.0140411e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447946142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Sung Jae10aRelation between oxidative damage and dietary protein: marginal protein level which modulates oxidative damage in mice with total body irradiation  ap. 1487-1495.  a2019-12-05  aMice were fed different levels of dietary protein (8%, 11%, 14%, 17% or 20%) and then gave total body irradiation (TBI) with X-rays.

In vitro, this condition can be induced by different stressor agents, including beta-lactam antibiotics, as penicillin.The aim of this study was to get new insights into the interactions between Chlamydia trachomatis (serovars D and L2) and the epithelial host cells (HeLa) during persistence condition.In particular, we evaluated the following aspects, by comparing the normal chlamydial development cycle with penicillin-induced persistence: (i) cell survival/death, (ii) externalization of phosphatidylserine, (iii) caspase 1 and caspase 3/7 activation, and (iv) reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the infected cells.At 72 h post-infection, the cytotoxic effect displayed by CT was completely abolished for both serovars and for all levels of multiplicity of infection only in the cells with aberrant CT inclusions. At the same time, CT was able to switch off the exposure of the lipid phosphatidylserine on the surface of epithelial cells and to strongly inhibit the activation of caspase 1 and caspase 3/7 only in penicillin-treated cells.Forty-eight hours post-infection, CT elicited a significant ROS expression both in case of a normal cycle and in case of persistence. However, serovar L and penicillin-free infection activated a higher ROS production compared to serovar D and to penicillin-induced persistence, respectively.In conclusion, we added knowledge to the cellular dynamics taking place during chlamydial persistence, demonstrating that CT creates a suitable niche to survive, switching off signals able to activate phagocytes/leukocytes recruitment. Nevertheless, persistent CT elicits ROS production by the infected cells, potentially contributing to the onset of chronic inflammation and tissue damages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydia trachomatis 3abeta-lactam antibiotics 3acaspase-1 3acaspase-3 3acell death 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3adevelopmental stages 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3ainflammation 3aleukocytes 3aphagocytes 3aphosphatidylserines 3areactive oxygen species 3aserotypes 0aChlamydia trachomatis 0aPersistence 0aPenicillin 0aBeta-lactams 0aROS 0aCaspases1 aBortolotti, Massimo1 aPolito, Letizia1 aMarangoni, Antonella1 aZalambani, Chiara1 aLiparulo, Irene1 aFato, Romana1 aBolognesi, Andrea0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2020 May, v. 142 p.104035-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1040353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04769naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016800165520243700333592002802770650002302798650001902821650002002840650001702860650001402877650002402891650001102915650001402926650001602940650001602956650001302972650001402985650000902999650003803008650001203046650002103058650002003079650001503099650001903114650002103133650002103154650001903175650001803194650002603212650002303238650000903261650001703270650002703287650001103314650001903325650002203344650001403366650002503380650003103405653001703436653002003453653000803473653000703481653000703488653000703495653002603502653002103528653001903549653002903568700001903597700002003616700001903636700001803655700001703673700006603690773011603756856008203872852000903954655001203963IND60744563920221120162213.0210918e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074456392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2021.1144052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAphale, Shama10aPanchvalkala, a traditional Ayurvedic formulation, exhibits antineoplastic and immunomodulatory activity in cervical cancer cells and C57BL/6 mouse papilloma model  aPanchvalkala, an Ayurvedic traditional formulation has references in Charak Samhita and Bhavaprakasha Nighantu for the treatment of women with endometriosis-related problems, leucorrhea and vaginal ailments. The formulation comprises of equal ratios of the barks from Ficus glomerata, Ficus virens, Ficus religiosa, Ficus benghalensis, and Thespesia populnea.The present study aimed to evaluate the anticancer and immunomodulatory activity of aqueous extract of Panchvalkala (PVaq) against cervical cancer in vitro and in vivo.The effect of PVaq on disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential in cervical cancer cell lines, SiHa and HeLa, was studied by using JC1 dye. The expression of generic caspases in the cells after treatment with PVaq was evaluated by ELISA kit. The expression of pRb, p53, E6 and E7 proteins were evaluated by western blotting. Acute oral toxicity and DRF studies were performed in Swiss albino mice by following OECD guidelines 423 and 407, respectively. Tumor retardation study was done in C57BL/6 mouse papilloma model. The mice were divided into six groups: No tumor control (NTC), Tumor control (TC), Cisplatin (Cis) (4 mg/kg b.w.), PVaq 100, 200 mg/kg b.w and combination of PVaq (200 mg/kg b.w.) and Cisplatin (4 mg/kg b.w.). The mice were orally gavaged with PVaq daily for 14 days and cisplatin was given intravenously on every 1st, 5th and 9th day. Hematological and biochemical parameters were studied by using hematology analyzer and kits, respectively. E6 and E7 gene expression in the tumor samples was determined by qPCR. Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels were determined by ELISA.PVaq induced mitochondrial depolarization in SiHa and HeLa, and increased the expression of generic caspases, resulting into apoptosis. PVaq upregulated the expression of tumor suppressor proteins (p53 and pRb) and reduced the expression of viral oncoproteins (E6 and E7). Acute toxicity study displayed non-toxicity of PVaq while DRF study ensured its safe dose for further efficacy studies. PVaq reduced tumor volume and weight in mouse papilloma model and induced immunomodulation in the animals. It increased serum levels of IL-2 (Th1) with a concomitant decrease in IL-10 (Th2) cytokines. The drug did not affect body weight, food consumption and organ histopathology of the animals.PVaq exhibited anticancer and immunomodulatory activities against cervical cancer cells and female mouse papilloma model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFicus benghalensis 3aFicus racemosa 3aFicus religiosa 3aFicus virens 3aThespesia 3aacute oral toxicity 3aalbino 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acaspases 3acisplatin 3adyes 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afemales 3afood consumption 3agene expression 3ahematology 3ahistopathology 3aimmunomodulation 3aimmunomodulators 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-2 3aintravenous injection 3amembrane potential 3amice 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aoncogene proteins 3apapilloma 3atraditional medicine 3auterine cervical neoplasms 0aPanchvalkala 0aCervical cancer 0ap53 0aRb 0aE6 0aE7 0aMouse papilloma model 0aImmunomodulatory 0aAcute toxicity 0aDose range finding study1 aShinde, Kavita1 aPandita, Savita1 aMahajan, Minal1 aRaina, Prerna1 aMishra, J.N.1 aKaul-Ghanekar, Ruchika1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1542-10380 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 280 p.114405-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.1144053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245010800191300001600299520155000315592002801865650002001893650000701913650002401920650002101944653002201965653002501987653001102012653002202023653001902045653000902064653001602073700002002089700002302109773010102132856011702233852000902350655001202359IND50065147420221118052703.0151127e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006514742DNAL7 a10.1658/1100-9233(2004)015[0847:MEARTT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWamelink, G. W W.10aMeasurement errors and regression to the mean cannot explain bias in average Ellenberg indicator values  ap. 847-851.  aSmart & Scott (2004, this issue) criticized our paper (Wamelink et al. 2002) about the bias in average Ellenberg indicator values. Their main criticism concerns the method we used, regression analysis. They state the bias can be mimicked by the construction of an artificial data set and that regression analysis is not a suited tool to investigate underlying phenomena. Moreover they claim that the present bias is caused by the distribution of Ellenberg indicator values between syntaxa, instead of a bias in average Ellenberg indicator values per species. We show that their criticism of the use of regression analysis does not hold. We selected average Ellenberg values per vegetation group for several pH classes and applied an F-test to determine whether or not the vegetation groups within each pH class differed significantly from each other. This was the case for all tested classes (P < 0.001). Moreover we simulated an artificial data set, of which the F-test for varying measurement error could not explain the magnitude of the F-value we found earlier. This indicates that the bias we found in average Ellenberg indicator values cannot be explained by measurement errors or by regression to the mean. In the end, Smart & Scott, as we did, come to the conclusion that there is a bias present and that separate regression lines per vegetation type are necessary, but the debate remains open on whether or not this is caused by the bias in Ellenberg indicator values per species.Abbreviation: Ellenberg IV == Ellenberg indicator value.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3apH 3aregression analysis 3avegetation types 0aAbiotic condition 0aAnalysis of variance 0aF-test 0aLinear regression 0aPhytosociology 0aSoil 0aSyntaxonomy1 aGoedhart, P.

Numerous studies have shown that exposures to Ln cause pulmonary injury in animals, but very little is known about the molecular mechanisms of the pulmonary inflammation caused by cerium chloride (CeCl₃) exposure. In this study, we evaluated the oxidative stress and molecular mechanism underlying with the pulmonary inflammation associated with chronic lung toxicity in mice treated with nasally instilled CeCl₃ for 90 consecutive days. Our findings suggest that significant cerium accumulated in the lung, leading the obvious increase of the lung indices, significant increases in inflammatory cells and levels of lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphate, and total protein, overproduction of reactive oxygen species and peroxidation of lipids, reduced antioxidant capacity, and pulmonary inflammation. CeCl₃ exposure also activated nuclear factor κB, increased the expression of tumor necrosis factor α, cyclooxygenase-2, heme oxygenase 1, interleukin 2, interleukin 4, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, interleukin 18, interleukin 1β, and CYP1A1. However, CeCl₃ reduced the expression of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-inhibiting factor and heat shock protein 70. These findings suggest that the pulmonary inflammation caused by CeCl₃ in mice is closely associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acerium 3aheat-shock protein 70 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-18 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alipid peroxidation 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3apneumonia 3aprostaglandin synthase 3areactive oxygen species 3arisk 3atoxicity 3atumor necrosis factors 2aAnimals 2aCeriumxtoxicity 2aCyclooxygenase 2xmetabolism 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP1A1xmetabolism 2aHeme Oxygenase-1xmetabolism 2aInterleukin-18xmetabolism 2aInterleukin-1betaxmetabolism 2aInterleukin-2xmetabolism 2aInterleukin-4xmetabolism 2aInterleukin-6xmetabolism 2aInterleukin-8xmetabolism 2aLungxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMice 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aRats, Wistar1 aYu, Xiaohong1 aPan, Xiaoyu1 aZhao, Xiaoyang1 aSheng, Lei1 aSang, Xuezi1 aLin, Anan1 aZhang, Chi1 aZhao, Yue1 aGui, Suxin1 aSun, Qingqing1 aWang, Ling1 aHong, Fashui0 tBiological trace element research.g2014 June, v. 159, no. 1-3 p.269-277dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-014-9953-3  aDNAL 7aarticle01398naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245006000166300002000226520032800246592002800574650001600602650001200618650002700630650002300657650001600680650001800696650001300714700002400727700002800751700002300779700002600802773013700828856007400965852000901039655001201048IND60659618120221122224611.0190823e20120917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065961812DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc33974a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiesielski, Arkadiusz10aOn the aromatic stabilization of benzenoid hydrocarbons  ap. 10129-10131.  aA general scheme for estimation of aromatic stabilization energies of benzenoid hydrocarbons based on selected topological features has been presented.

Development of berries is influenced by the type and ratio of different nitrogen supplies in the soil. To understand the impact of varying sources and levels of nitrate and ammonium on sucrose and nitrogen metabolism of Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, we tested nutrient solutions with four NO₃⁻‐N:NH₄⁺‐N ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 0:100) through the root system. RESULTS: The form and quantity of nitrogen affected berries and leaves with source–sink relationships. Soluble sugar levels were significantly higher in plants treated with mixed nitrogen sources (75:25 and 50:50) compared to single nitrogen sources (100:0 and 0:100). In particular, treating plants with mixed nitrogen source at a 75:25 ratio resulted in 22% higher fructose levels in berries compared to the 50:50 treatment. In addition, mixed nitrogen treatments resulted in significantly higher amino acid levels and protein content. Mixed nitrogen substrates also increased the expression of enzymes involved in both nitrogen and sucrose metabolism. CONCLUSION: Plants did not maximize the nitrogen supply when single form nitrogen was provided, and the mixed nitrogen substrates consistently increased the amount of available carbon and nitrogen in the berries and leaves. We found that NO₃⁻­N:NH₄⁺‐N ratio of 75:25 was the optimum formula for improving nitrogen and sucrose metabolism, and reducing the competition between nitrogen and sucrose. By examining the nutrient utilization of plants cultivated with different nitrogen forms, the present study provides insights into improving cultivation and production practices. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS‐29‐zp‐6cChina Agriculture Research System for Grape  a2018JZ3003cChina Shaanxi Provincial Natural Science Basic Research Program  a31772258cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aVitis vinifera 3aagriculture 3aamino acids 3aammonium 3acarbon 3afructose 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen metabolism 3anutrient utilization 3aprotein content 3aroot systems 3asoil 3asucrose 3awines1 aLi, Bing1 aWang, Xuefei1 aXi, Zhumei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9866-72140 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2020 Nov., v. 100, no. 14 p.5239-5250dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.105743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245013400178300001400312520134700326592002801673650001601701650001801717650001101735650001001746650001501756650001501771650001301786650001501799650002001814650002301834650001301857650001601870651001201886653002601898653001201924653001901936653002501955700001801980700002801998700001602026773010002042856008702142852000902229655001202238IND60126454720221117002917.0151107s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012645472DNAL7 a10.7872/crya.v34.issl.2013.572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaab, Marie Abboud-Abi10aSeasonal and Spatial Variations of the Dinoflagellate Ostreopsis siamensis in the Lebanese Coastal Waters (Eastern Mediterranean)  ap. 57-67.  aThe dinoflagellate Ostreopsis siamensis was studied as part of a broad national monitoring program along the Lebanese coastal waters. The monthly and spatial variations of its density in water samples were carried out at 4 different rocky stations from September 2000 to December 2001 and for a longer period (April 1997-December 2001 and January 2010 to December 2010) in one of the stations.Results showed that O. siamensis is present almost in all rocky shores along the Lebanese coastline from south to north between May and November when the surface seawater temperature ranges from 23 to 30.5 °C, with a maximum in abundance between July and September. In 2001, the population densities reached 10 500 cells/L in July and 5 700 cells/L in September at two stations both located in the southern coast. In 2010, the analysis of larger water volumes revealed the presence of this species in February, March and April; however densities were lower than 1–3 cells/L. Significant positive correlation was observed (P<0.01) between the occurrence of the species and nitrate concentrations, whereas the correlation was negative with orthophosphates. Our results suggest that O. siamensis is a thermophilic species. It constitutes a permanent component of the microalgal flora of Lebanese waters and its abundance depends on water enrichment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDinophyceae 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3aflora 3amicroalgae 3amonitoring 3anitrates 3aoccurrence 3aorthophosphates 3apopulation density 3aseawater 3atemperature 3aLebanon 0aEastern Mediterranean 0aLebanon 0aDinoflagellate 0aOstreopsis siamensis1 aFakhri, Milad1 aKassab, Marie-Thérèse1 aMatar, Nada0 tCryptogamie.g2013, v. 34, no. 1 p.57-67dAssociation des Amis des Cryptogamesx1776-09847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7872%2Fcrya.v34.issl.2013.573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003600151245013900187300001800326500001500344520126000359592002801619650002001647650002501667650001101692650002501703650001501728650001201743650001301755650001501768651001101783653002301794653001101817653002101828653001501849700002501864700003301889773012001922856008502042852000902127655001202136IND60595864920221119172456.0180608e20180519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059586492DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2017.13275562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuevedo, Claudia Maria Gomes de10aInfluence of the detergent formulation on the concentration of phosphorus in the sewage inflows to the WWTPs: the Brazilian experience  ap. 1260-1270.  a2019-12-06  aThis work seeks to discuss the presence of phosphorus in raw sewage considering the formulation of the powder detergent for cleaning fabrics currently sold in Brazil. Based on the results of laboratory analyses performed in the sewage inflows to three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in São Paulo state, it evaluates the different fractions of this element and sizes the impact caused by the product. The average concentration of total phosphorus (total-P) in sewage inflows has shown a reduction trend over the years, and it is currently between 5.3 and 7.6 mg/L. The participation of organic phosphorus (org-P) tends to be higher than that of the inorganic phosphorus (inorg-P) with average around 64% of total-P. This situation indicates a change from the default and it may be influenced by the reduced contribution of phosphorus in the powder detergents. It was concluded that the formulation of the Brazilian products, which have a very low phosphate content, less than 0.01% by weight, may have altered the phosphorus dynamics in sewage. In other respects, results have shown the need to enhance actions aimed at controlling the sources of phosphorus in sewage, with a view to assure preventive measures to water pollution processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3awater pollution 3ainorganic phosphorus 3asewage 3awastewater treatment 3aphosphates 3afabrics 3acleaning 3adetergents 3aBrazil 0aorganic phosphorus 0aSewage 0atotal phosphorus 0aphosphorus1 aPiveli, Roque Passos1 aPaganini, Wanderley da Silva0 tEnvironmental technology.g2018 May 19, v. 39, no. 10 p.1260-1270dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2017.13275563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01543naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013700161300001800298520031600316592002800632650001600660650001900676650002700695650001400722650001900736650001300755650001700768700002700785700002000812700002100832700002200853700001900875700002400894700002200918773013400940856007401074852000901148655001201157IND60659618220221122224449.0190823e20120725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065961822DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc33978a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyère, Cédric10aSynthesis of microsphere-loaded porous polymers by combining emulsion and dispersion polymerisations in supercritical carbon dioxide  ap. 8356-8358.  aHighly porous materials were produced by acrylamide polymerisation templated by supercritical CO₂-in-water emulsions using new fluorinated glycosurfactants.

Wind power needs to be integrated efficiently into electricity grids, and to optimize the power dispatch, techniques to predict the level of wind power and the associated variability are critical. Ideally, one would like to obtain reliable probability density forecasts for the wind power distributions. We aim at contributing to the literature of wind power prediction by developing and analysing a spatio-temporal methodology for wind power production, that is tested on wind power data from Denmark. We use anisotropic spatio-temporal correlation models to account for the propagation of weather fronts, and a transformed latent Gaussian field model to accommodate the probability masses that occur in wind power distribution due to chains of zeros. We apply the model to generate multi-step ahead probability predictions for wind power generated at both locations where wind farms already exist but also to nearby locations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3amodels 3apower generation 3aprediction 3aprobability 3aprobability distribution 3aweather 3awind farms 3awind power 3aDenmark1 aLenzi, Amanda1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4303-46950 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2018 Apr., v. 32, no. 4 p.931-948dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-017-1435-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011300174300001600287520130200303592002801605650002801633650002101661650001201682650001101694650001001705650001901715650002201734650000901756651001201765651001401777653001401791653002101805653002201826653001801848653001901866700002001885773011701905856008502022852000902107655001202116IND60519038520221118070751.0160420e20160518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051903852DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2016.11583092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRinaldi, Francesca10aDoes it take prices to make volumes move? A comparison of timber market functioning in Finland and Lithuania  ap. 428-433.  aForest ownership structure is known to have implications for forest management and the production of forest products and services. The ownership structure, as well as the degree of state regulation of forestry, could thus be expected to affect the functioning of timber markets. Hence, in the presence of strict prescriptions for forest management, the self-regulating mechanisms of timber markets – governed by the economic principle of supply and demand – could be inhibited. Using Finland and Lithuania as contrasting cases, we found empirical evidence for the existence of such a self-regulating mechanism in timber markets that are liberal in terms of state regulation of forest management, but not in those under strict state regulation. The results highlight how price increases (reductions) generally anticipate high (low) sales volumes or at least volume increases (reductions) in the Finnish case, suggesting that timber markets here self-regulate toward the equilibrium. Such patterns were not found in the Lithuanian case. The inability to respond to – and take advantage of – price signals could hamper the economic viability of forest ownership in timber markets constrained by regulation, and thus also impede efforts to mobilize wood to satisfy a foreseen increased demand.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic sustainability 3aforest ownership 3amarkets 3aprices 3asales 3asupply balance 3atimber production 3awood 3aFinland 3aLithuania 0aOwnership 0astate regulation 0aforest management 0atimber market 0amarket signals1 aJonsson, Ragnar0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2016 May 18, v. 31, no. 4 p.428-433dTaylor & Francisx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2016.11583093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01689naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245006600161300001600227520086100243592002801104650001001132650001101142650001101153650001301164700001401177773009501191856008101286990002301367852000901390655001201399IND60096359720221120234547.0141104e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009635972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2010.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHui, K.N.10aVertically-stacked LEDs with invariance of color Chromaticity  ap. 662-666.  aThis study investigated the variance of color chromaticity of a vertically-stacked LEDs device with respect to the viewing angles.

The red, green and blue truncated inverted pyramid LED chips were vertically-stacked to form the white LEDs with color tunable function. A well mix of colors from the polychromatic LED chips was achieved in the layout of the vertically-stacked LEDs without utilizing additional optics. Compared to the commercial RGB LEDs, the stacked LEDs device showed insignificant angular dependence of color chromaticity.

It shows that the cathode prepared by Sol–Gel doping method has fine microstructure containing rare earth oxide (RE₂O₃) nanoparticles and uniform distribution of different substances. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) depth profile result shows that an RE₂O₃ layer about 28 nm in thickness could be formed on the cathode surface, which plays an important role in the emission. Pre-activation of the cathode is favorable for the improvement of emission property. La₂O₃–Y₂O₃–Mo cathode pre-activated exhibits good secondary emission property. The secondary emission yield could reach 5.24, about 1.8 times higher than that of original cathode. The enhancement on the conductivity of materials resulting from the pre-activation is favorable for the replenishment and transport of electrons, thus the secondary emission property of the cathode could be improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrodes 3aelectrons 3amicrostructure 3ananoparticles 3aphysics 3aspectroscopy1 aLiu, Wei1 aRen, Zhiyuan1 aYang, Fan1 aWang, Yiman1 aDu, Yucheng1 aZhou, Meiling0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 May, v. 11, no. 3 p.667-672dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2010.11.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245015000165300001600315500001900331520176800350592002802118650001302146650002502159650001902184650001602203650001402219650001602233650000902249650001802258650000902276650001802285650002002303650001202323650001402335650001202349650001202361650000902373650002002382650002802402650001902430650001802449650001902467650002302486653001902509653002302528653002502551700002102576700002202597700002302619773010802642856007902750852000902829655001202838IND60736698420221120035204.0210514e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073669842DNAL7 a10.2478/aoas-2020-00862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKholif, Ahmed E.10aTop-dressing of chelated phytogenic feed additives in the diet of lactating Friesian cows to enhance feed utilization and lactational performance  ap. 657-673.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present experiment evaluated the inclusion of chelated phytogenic feed additives mixture in the diet of lactating cows for the first 3 months of lactation. A week before calving, thirty multiparous Friesian cows were divided into three treatments in a complete randomized design and fed a basal diet without supplementation (Control treatment), or the control diet supplemented with chelated phytogenic additives at 3 g (PHY3 treatment), or at 6 g/cow/d (PHY6 treatment). Menthol, levomenthol, β-linaloolm, anethole, hexadecanoic acid and pmenthane were the principal compounds identified in the additives mixture. Milk production, total solid, protein, fat, and lactose were increased with PHY3, but decreased by PHY6 (P<0.01). Whereas the PHY3 treatment increased (P<0.05) milk contents of Ca and Zn, PHY3 and PHY6 treatments increased (P<0.05) milk Fe and Mn concentrations. Though the PHY3 treatment increased (P<0.05) nutrient digestibility, the PHY6 treatment decreased (P<0.05) the digestibility of organic matter, crude protein and neutral detergent fiber. The PHY3 treatment increased (P<0.05) ruminal volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentration and proportional acetate and propionate and decreased butyrate, while the PHY6 treatment decreased ruminal VFA concentration and proportional acetate. The PHY3 treatment increased (P<0.05) serum total protein, glucose, total antioxidant capacity, and the concentrations of Ca and Zn. Both PHY3 and PHY6 treatment decreased (P<0.05) the concentrations of serum triglycerides, and cholesterol. Daily inclusion of 3 g/cow of chelated feed additives mixture in diet of lactating cows improved milk production and ruminal fermentation, but additives dose of 6 g/cow/d had negative impact on cows’ performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood proteins 3ablood serum 3abutyrates 3acholesterol 3acows 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afeed conversion 3aglucose 3alactation 3alactose 3amenthol 3amilk 3amilk production 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aorganic matter 3apalmitic acid 3apropionic acid 3arumen fermentation 0afeed additives 0aphytogenic chelate 0aruminal fermentation1 aHassan, Ayman A.1 aMatloup, Osama H.1 aEl Ashry, Ghada M.0 tAnnals of animal science.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 21, no. 2 p.657-673dSciendowJournal:2194x2300-87337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aoas-2020-00863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008500171520148600256592002801742650001501770650001101785650001901796650002201815650001401837650001101851650002201862650001601884650002101900650001201921650001001933650001101943700002301954700002701977700002202004773012302026856008102149852000902230655001202239IND60745612320221119003041.0210723e20210720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074561232DNAL7 a10.3390/resources100700732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChećko, Jarosław 10aGas Migration in the Aspect of Safety in the Areas of Mines Selected for Closure  aOne of the main hazards occurring in post-mining areas is the uncontrolled migration of gases to the surface, which may pose a serious threat to life and health. These gases are mainly methane and carbon dioxide, in smaller amounts ethane and higher hydrocarbons, carbon oxide, hydrogen sulfide, and radon. Methane migrating into the lower levels of buildings, garages, cable ducts, and sewage systems reaching the concentrations of above 5% may cause an explosion hazard. The concentration of carbon dioxide over 4% also represents a serious threat to life. Moreover, carbon dioxide and methane, emitted into the atmosphere, constitute a considerable source of greenhouse gases. The methane could be utilized, yet it is necessary to develop effective capture and purification methods with the first step of determination being its migration routes. The paper presents the application of numerical modelling with the use of TOUGHv2.0 software, which enabled effective simulation of the multiphase flow, applying adsorption and diffusion phenomena. The results of gas migration modelling were compared to the outcomes of geological tests, and the obtained results were satisfying. It was observed that both geological investigation and computer simulations are proper tools for investigation of the phenomenon of gas migration and identification of gas hazard areas on the surface, constituting the basis for development of effective methane capture methods for further application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3aethane 3aexplosive hazards 3agreenhouses 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amethane 3aradon 3asewage1 aHowaniec, Natalia 1 aParadowski, Krzysztof 1 aSmoliński, Adam,0 tResources.g2021 July 20, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21558x2079-92767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources100700733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245013700171520124500308592002801553650001601581650001701597650002201614650001501636651001001651773013201661856008401793852000901877655001201886IND60780783520221120094803.0220623e20220525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078078352DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120607482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVercher, Néstor 10aTerritorial Social Innovation and Alternative Food Networks: The Case of a New Farmers’ Cooperative on the Island of Ibiza (Spain)  aSocial innovation is gaining attention as a perspective that stresses the relevance of transforming social relations to promote sustainable territorial development. This paper adopts the social innovation approach to examine Alternative Food Networks. The main aim of the study is to identify key factors in the emergence and development of social innovation processes that give rise to new organisational formulas among farmers, which contribute to the coordination and efficiency of food supply in Alternative Food Networks. The article provides an original conceptual framework on territorial social innovation (TerriSI), which is empirically tested in a case study in Ibiza (Spain). Through a mixed methods approach, the study analyses the emergence and development of a new agricultural cooperative that involves producers participating in Alternative Food Networks in Ibiza. This is considered a socially innovative initiative since it comprises novel social reconfigurations within the local context. The findings underline key factors of territorial social innovation linked to the particular conditions of territories, triggers, leadership, coordination mechanisms, and the capacity to disseminate innovation through the territory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3acase studies 3afood availability 3aleadership 3aSpain0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 May 25, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120607483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009000161300001600251500001900267520109600286592002801382650002301410650001301433650001801446650001901464650001401483650001401497650001701511653001501528653001801543653001201561700003101573700002501604700003601629773010801665856007901773852000901852655001201861IND60736698620221120035235.0210514e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073669862DNAL7 a10.2478/aoas-2020-00882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNowak, Piotr14aThe effects and mechanisms of acids on the health of piglets and weaners – a review  ap. 433-455.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe rearing of piglets is the most difficult period in the pigs’ production because of their poorly developed digestive system and the low activity of digestive enzymes. Problems in nutrition and stress cause some disorders in the functioning of the digestive system leading to diarrhea and the mortality of piglets. Starting in 2006 in the EU, a total ban on antibiotics in their use as growth promoters was introduced. Since then, new and safe feed additives have been sought in order to replace antibiotics. Organic and inorganic acids as well as their salts were recognized as effective and safe additives. Due to their properties, they can improve feed palatability and digestibility, reduce the buffer capacity of feed, impact the development and functioning of the pig’s digestive system and improve the health and growth parameters. However, the effectiveness of acids is related to their qualitative and quantitative share in the feed additive. In this review, some strategies for using organic acids, their mixtures and also some new multi-component products will be discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffering capacity 3adiarrhea 3adigestibility 3afeed additives 3amortality 3anutrition 3apalatability 0aacidifiers 0aorganic acids 0apiglets1 aZaworska-Zakrzewska, Anita1 aFrankiewicz, Andrzej1 aKasprowicz-Potocka, Małgorzata0 tAnnals of animal science.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 21, no. 2 p.433-455dSciendowJournal:2194x2300-87337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aoas-2020-00883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245010400169300001600273520137400289592002801663650001901691650002601710650002501736650001601761650002401777650002201801650001301823650001201836650002901848650002401877650002601901650001801927650001401945650001201959651001201971653002501983653002402008653002002032700001702052773007802069856008302147852000902230655001202239IND60096900320221118033057.0160903e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009690032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuble, Isabella10aIntroducing mandatory standards for select household appliances in Lebanon: A cost-benefit analysis  ap. 608-617.  aLebanon's energy sector crisis leads to a lack of access to uninterrupted, basic modern electricity services that affects all sectors of the economy. Energy conservation measures are nearly inexistent yet they can potentially lead to substantial reductions in energy demand growth, environmental damages and public expenditures. This paper presents an analysis of the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of mandatory standards for energy efficiency for four different household appliances (refrigerator/freezers, AC split units, washing machines and lighting) over the period 2013–2027. Our results show potential savings in electricity consumption reaching 2054GWh annually in 2027 as well as a reduction of subsidies paid to the public utility of 3.6 billion USD in 2027 while CO2 emissions avoided amount to 8.9 million tons over the period of analysis. Furthermore, we propose a financially attractive refrigerator/freezer replacement program for low income households. If this program would cover all existing low-income households in 2013, the savings in electricity consumption would lead to a reduction in subsidies of 9 billion USD (NPV) over the period 2013–2027, while full funding for this program would cost the government 223.8 million USD. This program would thereby benefit consumers, the government and further economic development.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acost benefit analysis 3aeconomic development 3aelectricity 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3afreezers 3afunding 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahousehold equipment 3alow income households 3arefrigerators 3asubsidies 3awashing 3aLebanon 0aEconomic development 0aEnergy conservation 0aPublic finances1 aKaraki, Sami0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 Jan., v. 52 p.608-617dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01835naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245006700163300001400230500001100244520091400255592002801169650001601197650001301213650000801226650001201234650001601246650000901262650001001271700002001281773011701301856008201418852000901500655001201509IND60590900720221118040150.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059090072DNAL7 a10.1007/s00497-017-0319-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujii, Sota10aMultilayered dominance hierarchy in plant self-incompatibility  ap. 15-19.  aReview  aKEY MESSAGE: Epigenetic dominance modifier. In polymorphic loci, complex genetic dominance relationships between alleles are often observed. In plants, control of self-incompatibility (SI) expression via allelic interactions in the Brassicaceae is the best-known example of such mechanisms. Here, with emphasis on two recently published papers, we review the progress toward understanding the dominance regulatory mechanism of SI in the Brassicaceae. Multiple small RNA genes linked to the Self-incompatibility (S) locus were found in both Brassica and Arabidopsis genera. Mono-allelic gene expression of the male determinant of SI, SP11/SCR, from a dominant S-allele is under epigenetic control by such small RNA genes. Possible evolutionary trajectories leading to the formation of multilayered dominance hierarchy in Brassicaceae are discussed. We also identify some remaining questions for future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aBrassica 3aRNA 3aalleles 3aepigenetics 3aloci 3amales1 aTakayama, Seiji0 tPlant reproduction.g2018 Mar., v. 31, no. 1 p.15-19dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:12165x2194-79537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-017-0319-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245011300165520138600278592002801664650001601692650001601708650002001724650002801744650003101772650002401803650000901827650000901836700001901845700002001864700001701884700001601901700001801917700001801935773013301953856008402086852000902170655001202179IND60780783720221120094746.0220623e20220610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078078372DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120608392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Depeng 10aAnalyzing Rice Grain Collision Behavior and Monitoring Mathematical Model Development for Grain Loss Sensors  aGrain loss in the harvesting process of combine harvesters not only causes economic losses to farmers but also affects the soil environment because of the lost grain covering the soil, influencing crop growth in the next season. Grain sieve loss-monitoring sensors represent an important accessory in combine harvesters, as they can not only provide current grain loss levels for the operator to adopt a rational action in time but also serve as an important performance signal for the control system. To reflect the rice grain sieve loss level of combine harvesters in real time, an indirect grain sieve loss-monitoring system is proposed in this paper. First, the grain collision rise time was obtained by the finite element method (FEM), and the parameters of the grain loss sensor signal processing circuit were determined accordingly to upgrade the monitoring accuracy. Then, grain loss distribution behind the cleaning shoe was analyzed in detail under different working parameters. Grain loss distribution functions at the end of the sieve and a monitoring mathematical model with relevant variables were established based on the laboratory experiment results. Finally, calibration experiments were carried out to verify the measurement accuracy of the sensor on a cleaning test bench, with an obtained relative monitoring error ≤6.41 % under different working conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3acalibration 3aedaphic factors 3afinite element analysis 3alaboratory experimentation 3amathematical models 3arice 3asoil1 aWang, Zhiming 1 aLiang, Zhenwei 1 aZhu, Fangyu 1 aXu, Tingbo 1 aCui, Xinyang 1 aZhao, Peigen 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 June 10, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120608393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03606naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024002700134024002300161024004100184024002500225040001800250100005900268245009800327500002000425520185400445592002802299650001402327650001902341650002302360650001702383650001102400650001402411650002202425650002402447650000902471650001802480650002102498650001302519650002102532650001502553650001102568650001202579650001102591700006402602700002302666700002102689700002502710773010702735856011402842856007402956961001303030852000903043655001203052IND60795113820221214231735.0220930e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079511382DNAL7 a3684492aris7 a10113/79511382hdl7 a10.1002/ecs2.42262doi7 a3684492seq_no_1157 a2052-13610-014-000D2aris_project_no7 a4361552aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerry, Tyson J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1839-067110aTrends in soil microclimate and modeled impacts on germination timing in the sagebrush steppe  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPast and projected changes in climate affect soil microclimate, impacting seeds that use soil moisture and soil temperature as cues for germination. Seed germination and plant establishment are among the most important processes regulating plant community assembly in response to climate change. Changes in germination timing expose seedlings to new abiotic and biotic risk factors that can affect recruitment success. Species with seed dormancy strategies to avoid harsh winter conditions could experience more mortality if changes in germination timing cause early germination and subsequent exposure to freezing conditions. We analyzed soil microclimate trends in the sagebrush steppe from 1979 to 2017 using a soil physics model (SHAW) and calculated the germination timing of native species used in restoration efforts with wet‐thermal response curves from lab trials. We applied the germination curves to modeled soil microclimate at 10 sites in the sagebrush steppe. Our results indicate that warmer and wetter fall seasons have become more prevalent and will likely lead to accelerated germination of several native restoration species in the sagebrush steppe. Changes to spring soil conditions favor slightly more germination in early spring, but strong trends of earlier onset of spring soil conditions were not evident. Trends in climate have created drier and warmer summer seedbed conditions, likely to increase stress on seedlings. Historic cycles of alternating slow or fast germination appeared less frequently during the last 12 years of the study (2004–2016). Seedbed microclimate trends will likely impact seedling establishment by altering germination timing and exposing seeds to more harsh abiotic conditions, likely resulting in decreased recruitment of native species and increased abundance of invasive annual grasses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aclimate change 3aindigenous species 3amicroclimate 3amodels 3amortality 3aplant communities 3aplant establishment 3arisk 3aseed dormancy 3aseed germination 3aseedbeds 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3aspring 3asteppes 3asummer1 aHardegree, Stuart P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9941-30801 aMadsen, Matthew D.1 aRoundy, Bruce A.1 aSt. Clair, Samuel B.0 tEcosphere.g2022 Sept., v. 13, no. 9 p.e4226-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/79511383Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.42263Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245013100168300001600299500001900315520192800334592002802262650001802290650002402308650001902332650002402351650001502375650001602390650001302406650001402419650002602433650002002459650001102479651001102490653004602501653002502547700002102572773010802593856007902701852000902780655001202789IND60736698720221120035119.0210514e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073669872DNAL7 a10.2478/aoas-2020-00902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLigaszewski, Maciej10aReproduction of the Roman snail (Helix pomatia L.) from a local natural population in farm conditions and in a natural habitat  ap. 693-708.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this study was to compare the quality of clutches and reproduction results of two groups of Roman snails (Helix pomatia) from the same local population, laying eggs simultaneously in semi-natural farm conditions and in a natural habitat. The study material were Roman snails aged 2 or more years which had entered the third phenological season of their life and thus the first season of sexual maturity. Observations were conducted at an earthen enclosure in a greenhouse belonging to the experimental farm for edible snails at the National Research Institute of Animal Reproduction in Balice near Kraków (Poland) as well as at a site where a local population naturally occurs in the uncultivated park surrounding the Radziwiłł Palace. In the June-July season, differences among such parameters as weight of clutch, number of eggs in clutch, mean egg weight, and hatchling percentage when compared to the total number of eggs in the clutch were compared. It was determined that clutches of eggs from the natural population laid in the greenhouse were of lesser weight (P<0.01), contained fewer eggs (P<0.05), and the mean weight of individual eggs was less (P<0.05) than in clutches laid simultaneously in a natural habitat. Both in the greenhouse and the natural habitat, in the first phase of laying eggs (June) the weight of the clutch and number of eggs its contained were greater than in the second phase (July). However, only for snails laying eggs in the greenhouse were these differences statistically significant (P<0.05) and highly significant (P<0.01), respectively. Statistically significant differences were not observed in hatchling percentage between eggs laid in the greenhouse and the natural habitat. The lower number of eggs laid in the farmed conditions of the greenhouse was successfully compensated for by the absence of mass destruction by rodents which occurred in the natural habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelix pomatia 3aanimal reproduction 3aanimal science 3ademonstration farms 3aegg weight 3agreenhouses 3ahabitats 3aphenology 3aresearch institutions 3asexual maturity 3asnails 3aPoland 0afarmed reproduction of natural population 0anatural reproduction1 aPol, Przemysław0 tAnnals of animal science.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 21, no. 2 p.693-708dSciendowJournal:2194x2300-87337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aoas-2020-00903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008200166300001600248520171300264592002801977650001702005650000802022650002002030650000902050650001502059650001802074650001202092650001702104650002002121650001002141650001302151650001502164650001002179650001202189650000802201650000902209650001602218650001102234700005902245773011902304856008202423852000902505655001202514IND60590900820221118040046.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059090082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00497-017-0318-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukawa, Yumiko10aCell cycle in egg cell and its progression during zygotic development in rice  ap. 107-116.  aKEY MESSAGE: Rice egg is arrested at G1 phase probably by OsKRP2. After fusion with sperm, karyogamy, OsWEE1-mediated parental DNA integrity in zygote nucleus, zygote progresses cell cycle to produce two-celled embryo. In angiosperms, female and male gametes exist in gametophytes after the complementation of meiosis and the progression of nuclear/cell division of the haploid cell. Within the embryo sac, the egg cell is specially differentiated for fertilization and subsequent embryogenesis, and cellular programs for embryonic development, such as restarting the cell cycle and de novo gene expression, are halted. There is only limited knowledge about how the cell cycle in egg cells restarts toward zygotic division, although the conversion of the cell cycle from a quiescent and arrested state to an active state is the most evident transition of cell status from egg cell to zygote. This is partly due to the difficulty in direct access and analysis of egg cells, zygotes and early embryos, which are deeply embedded in ovaries. In this study, precise relative DNA amounts in the nuclei of egg cells, developing zygotes and cells of early embryos were measured, and the cell cycle of a rice egg cell was estimated as the G1 phase with a 1C DNA level. In addition, increases in DNA content in zygote nuclei via karyogamy and DNA replication were also detectable according to progression of the cell cycle. In addition, expression profiles for cell cycle-related genes in egg cells and zygotes were also addressed, and it was suggested that OsKRP2 and OsWEE1 function in the inhibition of cell cycle progression in egg cells and in checkpoint of parental DNA integrity in zygote nucleus, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3aDNA 3aDNA replication 3aeggs 3aembryo sac 3aembryogenesis 3afemales 3agametophytes 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahaploidy 3ainterphase 3amales 3ameiosis 3aova 3arice 3aspermatozoa 3azygote1 aOkamoto, Takashi1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6531-210X0 tPlant reproduction.g2018 Mar., v. 31, no. 1 p.107-116dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:12165x2194-79537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-017-0318-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02109naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245011400167300001600281520129300297592002801590650002801618650001401646650001201660773012601672856004801798852000901846655001201855IND4487516120221118083649.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448751612DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590110601612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhigalskii, O.

Four phases of a multiannual population cycle and two of its structural parts have been detected for both populations. The first part of the cycle is âdetermined,â with the âpeakâ phase passing into a âdepressionâ (population collapse). This transition is mainly determined by intrapopulation processes and is weakly dependent on the external conditions of each individual year. The second part is âstochastic,â starting from a stable point in the cycle in the depression phase. The duration of the second part is determined by the state of the population and its ability to increase its size, as well as by the weather and food factors, predation pressure, and location of the population within the species area. The transition from the peak phase to the depression phase (the determined part) for both populations takes place during one fall-winter-spring season and has no effect on the cycle duration. The duration of the stochastic part in the core of the species area (the period from depression phase to peak phase) is 1â3 years and in the periphery, 2â4 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClethrionomys glareolus 3apredation 3aweather0 tBiology bulletin of the Russian Academy of Sciences.g2011 Dec., v. 38, no. 6 p.629-641dSpringer-Verlagx1062-35907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1062359011060161  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013300168300001600301520120400317592002801521650002501549650001901574650002101593650001101614650001801625650002901643650001101672653001701683653002201700653002401722700002601746773007801772856008301850852000901933655001201942IND60096900620221118033036.0160903e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009690062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPani, Ratnakar10aManagement accounting approach to analyse energy related CO2 emission: A variance analysis study of top 10 emitters of the world  ap. 639-655.  aThe paper undertakes a decomposition study of carbon dioxide emission of the top ten emitting countries over the period 1980–2007 using variance analysis method, with the objectives of examining the relative importance of the major determining factors, the role of energy structure and impact of liberalisation on emission and exploring the possibilities of arresting emission with simultaneous rise in population and income. The major findings indicate that although rising income and population are the main driving forces, they are neither necessary nor sufficient for increasing emission, rather energy structure and emission intensities are the crucial determinants, pointing towards the fact that a country with higher income and population with proper energy policy may be a low emitter and vice-versa. Since modern energy-intensive production limits the scope of reduction in total energy use, it is necessary to decouple the quantum of energy use from emission through technological upgradation. The results indicate that liberalisation resulted in higher emission. The paper attempts to illustrate the required adjustments in energy structure and suggests necessary policy prescriptions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3acarbon dioxide 3aemissions factor 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aincome 0aCO2 emission 0aVariance analysis 0aEmission offsetting1 aMukhopadhyay, Ujjaini0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 Jan., v. 52 p.639-655dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016200163300001600325520171400341592002802055650002102083650001902104650002502123650001402148650001902162650001802181650001602199650001802215650001602233650002202249650002402271650002102295650004402316650001902360650000902379650001802388650002502406651001102431651001802442653000802460653001002468653000802478653001302486653000802499653000702507653000802514653000802522653001102530653000802541653002702549653003202576653003302608653003302641653002102674700002002695700002202715700002202737773015202759856008102911852000902992655001203001IND60600536420221121235830.0180703e20140314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060053642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2013.12.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChua, Thiam10aPharmacological characterization and chemical fractionation of a liposterolic extract of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens): Effects on rat prostate contractility  ap. 283-291.  aSaw palmetto (Serenoa repens) was first used medicinally by native American Indians to treat urological disorders. Nowadays, saw palmetto extracts are widely used in Europe and North America to treat the urinary symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia even though its mechanisms of action are poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize the bioactive constituents of a lipid extract of saw palmetto that are able to affect contractility of the rat prostate gland. The mechanism of action will also be investigated.A commercially available lipid extract of saw palmetto was subjected to fractionation using normal phase column chromatography. Composition of fractions was assessed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). Contractile activities of these fractions were evaluated pharmacologically using isolated preparations of rat prostate gland and compared to the activity of the crude extract.Saw palmetto extract inhibited contractions of the rat prostate gland which were consistent with smooth muscle relaxant activity. Only the ethyl acetate fraction resulting from chromatography inhibited contractions of isolated rat prostates similarly to the inhibition produced by the crude lipid extract. Comparison with authentic samples and analysis of NMR data revealed that this bioactivity was due to the fatty acid components present in the ethyl acetate fraction. Bioassay using various pharmacological tools identified multiple contractile mechanisms which were affected by the bioactive constituents.A fatty acid component of saw palmetto extract causes inhibition of prostatic smooth muscle contractions via a non-specific mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmerican Indians 3aSerenoa repens 3abioactive properties 3abioassays 3achromatography 3aethyl acetate 3afatty acids 3afractionation 3ahyperplasia 3amass spectrometry 3amechanism of action 3amuscle relaxants 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprostate gland 3arats 3asmooth muscle 3atraditional medicine 3aEurope 3aNorth America 0aATP 0a2-APB 0aBPH 0aESI/APCI 0aIP3 0aMS 0aPDA 0aPKC 0a1H NMR 0aTLC 0aChemical fractionation 0aSmooth muscle contractility 0aBenign prostatic hyperplasia 0aLower urinary tract symptoms 0aHerbal medicines1 aEise, Nicole T.1 aSimpson, Jamie S.1 aVentura, Sabatino0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2014 Mar. 14, v. 152, no. 2 p.283-291dElsevier Ireland LtdaElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.12.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245009000202500002000292520194400312592002802256596002402284596002602308650001302334650001902347650001602366650002102382650002702403650001502430650001002445650001602455650001302471650001302484650002202497650001002519650001402529651001502543700001602558700005702574700006702631700006202698700006502760773010702825856007402932852000903006655001203015IND60795114020221119080516.0220930e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079511402DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.42052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDillis, Christopher1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4208-533214aThe threat of wildfire is unique to cannabis among agricultural sectors in California  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAt the intersection of climate change and rural development, wildfire has emerged as a threat to agriculture in the Western United States. This nexus is particularly problematic for the rapidly developing cannabis industry in California, which includes farms located outside of traditional agricultural zones and within landscapes potentially more prone to wildfire. With the goal of determining whether cannabis is uniquely vulnerable to direct wildfire impacts (in terms of crop loss to burning), we integrated fire hazard severity zone (FHSZ) data, wildfire perimeters, and future burn regime projections in relation to the location and cultivated area of cannabis farming. We then applied descriptive statistics and generalized additive models (GAMs) to compare the location of licensed cannabis farms to other agricultural types in California, including grapes, pasture, and all other general crops combined. We found cannabis farming was located more often in high and very high FHSZs and closer to wildfire perimeters than any other agricultural type. GAM estimates of likelihood of occurrence in high and very high severity zones were highest for cannabis, even after accounting for spatial clustering of farm types, although there was no reliable difference in predicted distances to wildfire. Cannabis more often occurred in projected (from 2020 to 2100) wildfire hotspots than all other agricultural types, with GAM estimates affirming a reliably higher likelihood of cannabis in future hotspots than pasture or general crops. Our findings highlight cannabis' particular vulnerability to wildfire in California and may in fact underestimate wildfire risks given the potential indirect impacts of smoke to crops and farmworkers, which were not evaluated in this study. In light of the sector's growing economic importance in the state, these vulnerabilities should be considered in future cannabis and rural development policies.  aPublisher supplied data  cCampbell Foundation  cResources Legacy Fund 3aCannabis 3aclimate change 3acrop losses 3acultivation area 3adescriptive statistics 3afarm labor 3afarms 3afire hazard 3aindustry 3apastures 3arural development 3asmoke 3awildfires 3aCalifornia1 aButsic, Van1 aMoanga, Diana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7269-84181 aParker‐Shames, Phoebe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1738-04711 aWartenberg, Ariani1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0052-50051 aGrantham, Theodore E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9089-90260 tEcosphere.g2022 Sept., v. 13, no. 9 p.e4205-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.42053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007200163300001400235500001100249520106000260592002801320650001701348650001501365650000901380650001701389650001201406650001701418650001001435650001101445650001101456650001701467650002501484650002401509650001601533650001201549700002001561700001801581773011701599856008201716852000901798655001201807IND60590901020221118040123.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059090102DNAL7 a10.1007/s00497-018-0324-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hong-Ju10aMultilayered signaling pathways for pollen tube growth and guidance  ap. 31-41.  aReview  aSexual reproductive success is essential for the survival of all higher organisms. As the most prosperous and diverse group of land plants on earth, flowering plants evolved highly sophisticated fertilization mechanisms. To adapt to the terrestrial environment, a tubular structure pollen tube has been evolved to deliver the immobile sperm cells to the egg and central cell enclosed within the ovule. The pollen tube is generated from the vegetative cell of the pollen (male gametophyte), where two sperm cells are hosted. Pollen tube elongation in the maternal tissue and navigation to the ovule require intimate cell–cell interactions between the tube and female tissues. Questions on how the single-celled pollen tube accomplishes such task and how the female tissues accommodate the tube have attracted many plant biologists. Here, we review recent progresses and concepts in understanding the molecular mechanisms governing pollen tube growth and its interactions with the female tissues. We will also discuss the future perspective in this field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3abiologists 3aeggs 3aembryophytes 3afemales 3agametophytes 3amales 3aovules 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3areproductive success 3asignal transduction 3aspermatozoa 3atissues1 aMeng, Jiang-Guo1 aYang, Wei-Cai0 tPlant reproduction.g2018 Mar., v. 31, no. 1 p.31-41dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:12165x2194-79537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-018-0324-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245009600164520177000260592002802030650001402058650002402072650001502096650001002111650001902121650001602140650000902156650001302165650001502178650001402193650001602207650001302223650000902236650002602245650001602271650000902287650002302296700002202319700002102341700002502362700002202387700001602409773013202425856007702557852000902634655001202643IND60745612820221119003342.0210723e20210712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074561282DNAL7 a10.3390/vetsci80701292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Jennifer 10aImproved Cardiovascular Tolerance to Hemorrhage after Oral Resveratrol Pretreatment in Dogs  aResveratrol has been shown to preserve organ function and improve survival in hemorrhagic shock rat models. This study investigated whether seven days of oral resveratrol could improve hemodynamic response to hemorrhage and confer benefits on risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) without inducing coagulopathy in a canine model. Twelve greyhound dogs were randomly allocated to receive oral resveratrol (1000 mg/day) or placebo for seven days prior to inducing hemorrhage until a targeted mean blood pressure of ≤40 mmHg was achieved. AKI biomarkers and coagulation parameters were measured before, immediately following, and two hours after hemorrhage. Dogs were euthanized, and renal tissues were examined at the end of the experiment. All investigators were blinded to the treatment allocation. A linear mixed model was used to assess effect of resveratrol on AKI biomarkers and coagulation parameters while adjusting for volume of blood loss. A significant larger volume of blood loss was required to achieve the hypotension target in the resveratrol group compared to placebo group (median 64 vs. 55 mL/kg respectively, p = 0.041). Although histological evidence of AKI was evident in all dogs, the renal tubular injury scores were not significantly different between the two groups, neither were the AKI biomarkers. Baseline (pre-hemorrhage) maximum clot firmness on the Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) was stronger in the resveratrol group than the placebo group (median 54 vs. 43 mm respectively, p = 0.009). In summary, seven days of oral resveratrol did not appear to induce increased bleeding risk and could improve greyhound dogs’ blood pressure tolerance to severe hemorrhage. Renal protective effect of resveratrol was, however, not observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGreyhound 3aacute kidney injury 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3ablood pressure 3acoagulation 3adogs 3afirmness 3ahemorrhage 3ahistology 3ahypotension 3aplacebos 3arats 3arenoprotective effect 3aresveratrol 3arisk 3astatistical models1 aRaisis, Anthea L.1 aSharp, Claire R.1 aCianciolo, Rachel E.1 aWallis, Steven C.1 aHo, Kwok M.0 tVeterinary sciences.g2021 July 12, v. 8, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27139x2306-73817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vetsci80701293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01857naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245005600168300001600224520092200240592002801162650001101190650001901201650002201220650001301242650001101255653001301266653001601279653001501295700002001310700001901330773007801349856008301427852000901510655001201519IND60096900720221118033110.0160903e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009690072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgrell, Per J.10aSmart-grid investments, regulation and organization  ap. 656-666.  aGrid infrastructure managers worldwide are facing demands for reinvestments in new assets with higher on-grid and off-grid functionality in order to meet new environmental targets. The roles of the current actors will change as the vertical interfaces between regulated and unregulated tasks become blurred. In this paper, we characterize some of the effects of new asset investments policy on the network tasks, assets and costs and contrast this with the assumptions of the current economic network regulation. To provide structure, we present a model of investment provision under regulation between a distribution system operator and a potential investor–generator. The results from the model confirm the hypothesis that network regulation should find a focal point, should integrate externalities in the performance assessment and should avoid wide delegation of contracting-billing for smart-grid investments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3amanagers 3amodels 0aNetworks 0aInvestments 0aRegulation1 aBogetoft, Peter1 aMikkers, Misja0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 Jan., v. 52 p.656-666dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01819naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001200145245012700157300001600284520090300300592002801203650001201231650001101243650001001254650002201264650001601286651001001302700002001312700001401332773010201346856004801448852000901496655001201505IND4473998720221118031720.0121003e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447399872DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954110600442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAra, G.10aGene diversity for haptoglobin and transferrin classical markers among Hindu and Muslim populations of Aligarh city, India  ap. 744-748.  aThe present paper reports the distribution of serum protein markers viz. haptoglobin and transferrin in two major groups of Aligarh city of North India.

The principle is based on manipulation of flow direction in the artificially saturated soil region below the auger hole. As with the original double-tube method, the presence of a water table is not required. If the water levels in the inner and the outer tube differ, the streamlines in the resulting flow system below the auger hole have both horizontal and vertical portions. Thus, the hydraulic conductivity measured with the conventional double-tube method from this flow system on the basis of assumed isotropy, symbol Kdₜ, is some resultant of Kₕ and Kᵥ. If the water levels in the inner and the outer tube are the same, the flow in the soil below the inner tube is, initially, vertically downward. Piezometers are used to measure the vertical hydraulic gradient and knowing the intake rate, Kᵥ can be computed. By transformation to equivalent isotropic systems, the relationship between Kdₜ/Kᵥ and Kₕ/Kᵥ can be determined and expressed in the form of a graph. Thus, knowing Kdₜ and Kᵥ, the conductivity Kₕ can be evaluated from that graph. Laboratory studies on artificial anisotropic soil consisting of alternating 0.5-cm. layers of coarse and fine soil were performed to verify and exemplify the method.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil water 3awater table 3ahydraulic conductivity 3atubes 0asoil physics0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1964 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.19-23dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/503183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1964.03615995002800010019x3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02553naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013300170300001800303520117200321592002801493650001901521650001501540650002601555650002001581650001401601650001601615650001201631650001301643650001101656650001501667650002801682650001501710650001401725650002301739700005401762700005401816700005401870773011401924856008402038852000902122655001202131IND60744425920221119022309.0210713e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074442592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c008232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wenliang10aZr-MOFs Integrated with a Guest Capturer and a Photosensitizer for the Simultaneous Adsorption and Degradation of 4-Chlorophenol  ap. 8157-8166.  aA bifunctional metal–organic framework (MOF) was successfully designed to realize the purification of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) under simulated sunlight irradiation. Owing to the large-size mesopores of the MOF matrix NU-1000, β-CMCD (carboxylic β-cyclodextrin) could be incorporated into the frameworks with a density of 2.4% to pre-enrich the pollutant of 4-CP. Meanwhile, the photodegradation promoter [Pd(II) meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine] was in situ co-assembled with the organic ligand to realize its synchronous degradation. As for the current integrator, a Langmuir model was used to explain the adsorption isotherm, and the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model exhibited a better fit to its catalytic degradation behavior. Thanks to the simultaneous presence of a capturer and a photodegradation promoter, the adsorption capacity of 4-CP reached as high as 296 mg g–¹, which was further completely detoxified within 60 min under simulated sunlight irradiation with a half-life time of only 5.98 min. Such excellent integrated decontamination properties prefigure the great promising potential of multifunctional MOFs in the field of pollution purification.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-chlorophenol 3aadsorption 3acoordination polymers 3adecontamination 3ahalf life 3airradiation 3aligands 3alighting 3amodels 3aphotolysis 3aphotosensitizing agents 3apollutants 3apollution 3asorption isotherms1 aGong, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1572-08631 aYang, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4451-04971 aGu, Jinlou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3190-573X0 tLangmuir.g2021 June 30, v. 37, no. 27 p.8157-8166dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c008233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01276naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245008200164300002000246520030700266592002800573650001100601650002300612650002100635650001400656650001200670700001700682700001800699700002300717773013500740856007800875852000900953655001200962IND60580211420221121094608.0171109e20170913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058021142DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b076672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkumura, Shintaro10aPalladium-Catalyzed Intermolecular Exchange between C–C and C–Si σ-Bonds  ap. 12414-12417.  aA palladium–isocyanide complex opens the two four-membered rings of benzocyclobutenone and silacyclobutane to merge them into an eight-membered ring skeleton.

A novel fractionation scheme was developed to segregate three different fractions of Fe and Cu present in ambient PM₂.₅: (i) complexed with hydrophobic organic compounds, (ii) complexed with hydrophilic organic compounds, and (iii) free or inorganic metal fraction. A solid phase extraction (C-18) column was used to separate these fractions. The fractionation scheme applied to the ambient PM₂.₅ samples collected from an urban site showed that up to 70–90% of water-soluble Fe and Cu were complexed with the organic compounds. The capability of the complexes of Fe(II) and Cu(II) with Suwanee river fulvic acid (SRFA), a proxy for the atmospheric organic compounds, to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) (·OH and H₂O₂) in a surrogate lung fluid (SLF) was measured. The complex of Fe–SRFA showed a strong synergistic effect in the generation of ·OH in SLF, while that of Cu–SRFA showed an additive effect. Overall, our results indicate that organic complexation of the metals in ambient PM could significantly alter their OP and needs to be considered while assessing their health impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive effect 3acopper 3afractionation 3afulvic acids 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3alungs 3aparticulates 3arivers 3asolid phase extraction 3asynergism 3awater solubility1 aYu, Haoran1 aWang, Yixiang1 aVerma, Vishal0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Dec. 27, v. 53, no. 3 p.1661-1671dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b057313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011800170520135900288592002801647650001601675650001001691650001501701650001701716650001801733650001501751650001401766650002301780650000901803700002801812700002401840700002601864773013301890856008402023852000902107655001202116IND60780784220221123014752.0220623e20220611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078078422DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120608442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qianqian 10aPositive Selection and Adaptive Introgression of Haplotypes from Bos indicus Improve the Modern Bos taurus Cattle  aComplex evolutionary processes, such as positive selection and introgression can be characterized by in-depth assessment of sequence variation on a whole-genome scale. Here, we demonstrate the combined effects of positive selection and adaptive introgression on genomes, resulting in observed hotspots of runs of homozygosity (ROH) haplotypes on the modern bovine (Bos taurus) genome. We first confirm that these observed ROH hotspot haplotypes are results of positive selection. The haplotypes under selection, including genes of biological interest, such as PLAG1, KIT, CYP19A1 and TSHB, were known to be associated with productive traits in modern Bos taurus cattle breeds. Among the haplotypes under selection, we demonstrate that the CYP19A1 haplotype under selection was associated with milk yield, a trait under strong recent selection, demonstrating a likely cause of the selective sweep. We further deduce that selection on haplotypes containing KIT variants affecting coat color occurred approximately 250 generations ago. The study on the genealogies and phylogenies of these haplotypes identifies that the introgression events of the RERE and REG3G haplotypes happened from Bos indicus to Bos taurus. With the aid of sequencing data and evolutionary analyses, we here report introgression events in the formation of the current bovine genome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3acolor 3ahaplotypes 3ahomozygosity 3aintrogression 3amilk yield 3aphylogeny 3asequence diversity 3azebu1 aSchönherz, Anna Amanda1 aLund, Mogens Sandø1 aGuldbrandtsen, Bernt 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 June 11, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120608443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015500173300001600328520148300344592002801827650001301855650002701868650001601895650000901911650001801920650002501938650001001963650001201973650001901985650001902004650001602023650000902039650001702048650003502065650003402100650001902134651001002153653001102163653001102174653002002185653002502205653002402230700002202254700002202276700002402298700002402322700003102346700001602377700001902393700002802412700002302440700002502463773008802488856008502576852000902661655001202670IND60519039220221118071013.0160420e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051903922DNAL7 a10.1080/00087114.2015.11365432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerucatti, Angela10aChromosome instability in lymphocytes of Friesian cows naturally exposed to dioxins being raised close to a metallurgic factory area in southern Italy  ap. 133-140.  aDioxins (PCDDs, PCDFs and DL-PCBs) are a large family of congeners that are considered highly toxic and are reported to be teratogenic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, immunotoxic and hepatotoxic, also affecting the nervous and reproductive systems. Farm animals are particularly exposed to these chemicals when they are fed with grass produced close to polluted areas such as those located in vicinity of metallurgic factories. Cytogenetic tests can be very useful to check genetic damage occurring to domestic animal cells exposed to these chemicals. Fifty-two randomly selected Italian Friesian cows (Bos taurus , 2 n = 60) from two farms located in the vicinity of and (as a control) far from the a metallurgic industrial area underwent cytogenetic investigations to ascertain possible differences in their chromosome fragility. One farm was under legal sequestration due to the presence in the milk mass of higher mean values of dioxins (24.78 ± 3.19 pg g ⁻¹ of fat as sum of PCDD + PCDF + DL-PCBs as WHO-TEQ (World Health Organization-Toxic Equivalent Quantity), with DL-PCBs being the main chemical component) than those permitted (5.5 pg g ⁻¹ of fat as WHO-TEQ). Cytogenetic analyses, performed by using both the chromosome abnormality (CA) test (chromosome and chromatid breaks) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test, revealed a significantly (p < 0.01) higher chromosome fragility in cells of exposed cows (26 cows) compared to those of the control (23 cows).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3achromosome aberrations 3achromosomes 3acows 3acrossing over 3acytogenetic analysis 3afarms 3agrasses 3ahepatotoxicity 3aimmunotoxicity 3alymphocytes 3amilk 3amutagenicity 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3ateratogenicity 3aItaly 0aDioxin 0aDL-PCB 0aFriesian cattle 0achromosome fragility 0ametallurgic factory1 aGenualdo, Viviana1 aColonna, Maria A.1 aGiannico, Francesco1 aIncarnato, Domenico1 aLubrano-Lavadera, Giuseppe1 aIorio, Ciro1 aVonghia, Luisa1 aCaputi-Jambrenghi, Anna1 aIannuzzi, Leopoldo1 aIannuzzi, Alessandra0 tCaryologia.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 69, no. 2 p.133-140dTaylor & Francisx2165-53917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00087114.2015.11365433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012200166300001400288520152600302592002801828650002201856650002201878650001901900650001701919650001501936650002301951650001101974650002101985650001402006650001302020650001802033650001002051650002002061650001602081650002202097650001802119651001102137700001702148700001702165700001802182773009702200856004802297852000902345655001202354IND50061620020221118083648.0130319e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006162002DNAL7 a10.1007/s13595-012-0239-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiedel, Judith10aGrowth, herbivore distribution, and herbivore damage of timber trees in a tropical silvopastoral reforestation system  ap. 75-86.  aCONTEXT: The reforestation of degraded tropical pastures requires innovative tree planting systems that consider land user needs. AIM: We established a silvopastoral reforestation system and assessed the effects of companion trees on the native timber tree Tabebuia rosea in Panama. Timber tree individuals were established in (1) solitary plantings (TSol) or in companion plantings with (2) Guazuma ulmifolia (TGua) or (3) the nitrogen-fixing Gliricidia sepium (TGli). METHODS: We quantified growth characteristics and herbivory of T. rosea, and analyzed leaf chemistry (including the stable isotopes δ¹⁵N and δ¹³C) and structure (leaf mass per area). RESULTS: Companion trees significantly affected stem diameter growth of T. rosea. Stem diameter growth was as high in TGli trees as in TSol trees but was reduced in TGua trees. Furthermore, TGua trees had higher leaf water content, and lower δ¹³C and lower leaf mass-to-area ratio than TGli trees, suggesting there were effects of shading by G. ulmifolia on T. rosea. Herbivory was high but not affected by planting regimes. Leafing phenology did not differ between planting regimes and G. sepium did not increase nitrogen content in T. rosea leaves. CONCLUSION: Companion tree planting can support timber tree growth in silvopastoral reforestations, but adequate species selection is crucial for successful implementation of this planting system. Tree–tree interactions seem to be more relevant for timber tree growth than herbivory in the studied system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGliricidia sepium 3aGuazuma ulmifolia 3aTabebuia rosea 3aforest trees 3aherbivores 3aindigenous species 3aleaves 3anitrogen content 3aphenology 3aplanting 3areforestation 3ashade 3astable isotopes 3atree growth 3atropical pastures 3awater content 3aPanama1 aDorn, Silvia1 aPlath, Mirco1 aMody, Karsten0 tAnnals of forest science.g2013 Jan., v. 70, no. 1 p.75-86dSpringer-Verlagx1286-45607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-012-0239-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013700170300001800307520163100325592002801956650004401984650001602028650001602044650001802060650001102078650001902089650001102108650001102119650003302130650001402163700002402177700002602201700002202227700002102249700006002270700002402330700002602354700006502380773011402445856008402559852000902643655001202652IND60744426120220418000000.0210713e20210629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074442612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c008532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaubade, Fabien10aPrincipal Component Analysis to Determine the Surface Properties That Influence the Self-Cleaning Action of Hydrophobic Plant Leaves  ap. 8177-8189.  aIt is well established that many leaf surfaces display self-cleaning properties. However, an understanding of how the surface properties interact is still not achieved. Consequently, 12 different leaf types were selected for analysis due to their water repellency and self-cleaning properties. The most hydrophobic surfaces demonstrated splitting of the νₛ CH₂ and ν CH₂ bands, ordered platelet-like structures, crystalline waxes, high-surface-roughness values, high-total-surface-free energy and apolar components of surface energy, and low polar and Lewis base components of surface energy. The surfaces that exhibited the least roughness and high polar and Lewis base components of surface energy had intracuticular waxes, yet they still demonstrated the self-cleaning action. Principal component analysis demonstrated that the most hydrophobic species shared common surface chemistry traits with low intra-class variability, while the less hydrophobic leaves had highly variable surface-chemistry characteristics. Despite this, we have shown through partial least squares regression that the leaf water contact angle (i.e., hydrophobicity) can be predicted using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy surface chemistry data with excellent ability. This is the first time that such a statistical analysis has been performed on a complex biological system. This model could be utilized to investigate and predict the water contact angles of a range of biological surfaces.

Effective retardation value of the fabricated film was characterized by experiment and calculation using simulation. The results showed that the film has a hybrid alignment with a tilt angle variation from 3° to 19°. The optical compensation effects are evaluated in terms of light leakage in the dark state and contrast ratio (CR). The measured results showed that the light leakage is greatly suppressed with the compensation film and the viewing angle characteristics of TN device are greatly improved, most particularly in the up direction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliquid crystal display 3aliquid crystals 3aphysics1 aLim, Young Jin1 aJeon, Eun Jeong1 aKim, Dae Hyun1 aKim, Jong-Hoon1 aKumar, Pankaj1 aLee, Myong-Hoon1 aLee, Seung-Hee,0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 May, v. 11, no. 3 p.725-730dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2010.11.0393Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245008900163300001800252520122400270592002801494650002101522650001501543650001601558650001101574650003001585650001301615650002201628650001201650650001701662650001301679650001101692650001301703650001901716650001201735700005301747700001401800700001701814700001601831773013901847856007901986852000902065655001202074IND60630070820221120021655.0190206e20190104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063007082DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b057772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Fenghua10aDevelopment of O₂ and NO Co-Doped Porous Carbon as a High-Capacity Mercury Sorbent  ap. 1725-1731.  aIn this study, a novel Hg⁰ adsorption strategy based on nonthermal plasma and porous carbon was proposed and tested. The O₂ and NO in flue gas were used to activate porous carbon with auxiliary plasma. The plasma significantly increased the functionalities on the carbon surface, and it has a negligible effect on the textural properties of porous carbon. The O₂/NO co-doped porous carbon was used to remove elemental mercury (Hg⁰). The sample functionalized by plasma in 4% O₂ and 200 ppm NO (balanced with N₂) for 3 min exhibited superior Hg⁰ adsorption ability, which could be assigned to the formation of a large amount of C═O, C–NO, and C–NO₂. O₂, NO, and HCl have a positive effect on Hg⁰ adsorption, whereas SO₂ and H₂O have an inhibitory effect on Hg⁰ removal. The equilibrium Hg⁰ adsorption capacity of optimal O₂/NO co-doped porous carbon was found to be 12315 μg/g, which was far greater than that of brominated activated carbon (1061 μg/g). Density functional theory was used to investigate the mechanism responsible for Hg⁰ adsorption. C═O and C–NO improved the interaction of Hg⁰ with neighboring carbon sites. C–NO₂ could react with Hg⁰ by forming HgO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3abromination 3acobalt 3adensity functional theory 3aflue gas 3ahydrochloric acid 3amercury 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3asorbents 3asulfur dioxide 3atexture1 aLiu, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6520-96121 aWu, Dawei1 aDong, Yuchen1 aZhang, Zhen0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Jan. 04, v. 53, no. 3 p.1725-1731dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b057773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03607naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008700166300001600253520178900269592002802058650002402086650002002110650002302130650002602153650001402179650000902193650002402202650001502226650001202241650001002253650001702263650001302280650001302293650001302306650001002319650002802329650001302357650001702370650003202387650001202419650001902431650002202450650001902472650004402491650001402535650001502549650002302564650002502587653002602612653001702638653001202655653001402667653002302681700002102704700002402725773013002749856008102879852000902960655001202969IND60600536920221121225419.0180703e20140227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060053692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2013.12.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukhija, Minky10aBioactive Lignans from Zanthoxylum alatum Roxb. stem bark with cytotoxic potential  ap. 106-112.  aZanthoxylum alatum is used in traditional medicinal systems for number of disorders like cholera, diabetes, cough, diarrhea, fever, headache, microbial infections, toothache, inflammation and cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate Zanthoxylum alatum stem bark for its cytotoxic potential and to isolate the bioactive constitiuents.Cytotoxicity of the different extracts and isolated compounds was studied on lung carcinoma cell line (A549) and pancreatic carcinoma cell line (MIA-PaCa) using MTT assay. Isolation of compounds from most active extract (petroleum ether) was done on silica gel column. Structure elucidation was done by using various spectrophotometric techniques like UV, IR, ¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR and mass spectroscopy. The type of cell death caused by most active compound C was explored by fluorescence microscopy using the acridine orange/ethidium bromide method.Petroleum ether extract of plant has shown significant cytotoxic potential. Three lignans sesamin (A), kobusin (B), and 4'O demethyl magnolin (C) has been isolated. All lignans showed cytotoxic activities in different ranges. Compound C was the novel bioactive compound from a plant source and found to be most active. In apoptosis study, treatment caused typical apoptotic morphological changes. It enhances the apoptosis at IC50 dose (21.72µg/mL) however showing necrotic cell death at higher dose after 24h on MIA-PaCa cell lines.Petroleum ether extract (60–80°C) of Zanthoxylum alatum has cytotoxic potential. The lignans isolated from the petroleum ether extract were responsible for the cytotoxic potential of the extract. 4'O demethyl magnolin was novel compound from Zanthoxylum alatum. Hence the Zanthoxylum alatum can be further explored for the development of anticancer drug.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZanthoxylum armatum 3aacridine orange 3aactive ingredients 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3abark 3abioactive compounds 3acell lines 3acholera 3acough 3acytotoxicity 3adiabetes 3adiarrhea 3aethidium 3afever 3afluorescence microscopy 3aheadache 3ainflammation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alignans 3alung neoplasms 3amass spectrometry 3aneoplasm cells 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apetroleum 3asilica gel 3aspectrophotometers 3atraditional medicine 0aColumn chromatography 0aCytotoxicity 0aLignans 0aMTT assay 0aZanthoxylum alatum1 aLal Dhar, Kanaya1 aNath Kalia, Ajudhia0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2014 Feb. 27, v. 152, no. 1 p.106-112dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.12.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04487naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003200164245013800196300001600334520227400350592002802624650002102652650001102673650001702684650002102701650001002722650001502732650001102747650001502758650002202773650002102795650001302816650001302829650001802842650001902860650001202879650001302891650001002904650000902914650003302923650001102956650001102967650004202978650001103020650001103031650002403042650000903066650002603075650001603101650001303117650003603130650006003166650003603226650002203262650002803284650002803312650001603340651001103356651001103367700003403378700003003412700003303442700004003475700002403515773011203539856008103651852000903732655001203741IND4468600220221118031534.0141111e20120327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446860022DNAL7 a223386462pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2012.01.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Simone Gomes Dias13aAn ethnomedicinal survey on phytotherapy with professionals and patients from Basic Care Units in the Brazilian Unified Health System  ap. 428-437.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In this study, an ethnomedicinal survey was conducted in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, with professionals and patients in the Unified Health System (SUS). With the approval of the National Policy on Medicinal Plants and Herbal Medicines, and with the adoption of a National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices in the SUS in Brazil, there is growing concern regarding Brazilian medicinal plants and their proper use in medicine. The expansion of the therapeutic options offered to the users of the SUS includes access to medicinal plants and herbal drugs, as well as related services, such as phytotherapy. For improving health and for the social inclusion of phytotherapies, safety, efficacy, and quality are important strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Interviews of both professionals and patients were conducted at five Basic Care Units, and a sample size of 393 was obtained. RESULTS: Of the patients attending the Basic Care Units, 91.6% had experienced the use of medicinal plants at least once to treat certain diseases. Of the professionals, 65% had used medicinal plants but only 10% prescribed phytotherapeutics to their patients. Generally, the users were homemakers (26%) of the female gender (71.5%) who were older than 60 years (26%) and had a family income between 1 and 2 Brazilian minimal salaries. The professionals were predominantly female (80%), and a high proportion (80%) believed in the positive effects of phytotherapy (80%), even though these professionals had not been taught phytotherapy as undergraduate students (75%) and had not discussed the topic with their teachers (85%). Patients (81.5%) and professionals (45%) reported that their knowledge of medicinal plants came from their parents or grandparents. From a total of 66 different herbs used by the subjects, mauve (24%) was the most commonly used, often to treat toothaches (24.2%). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that a high proportion of users and professionals made use of medicinal plants, and of the large number of plants mentioned in the questionnaire, mauve was the most commonly used, mainly for the treatment of toothaches. The major source of the transmission of knowledge concerning herbal medicine was parents or grandparents.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollege students 3agender 3agrandparents 3aherbal medicines 3aherbs 3ahomemakers 3aincome 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3amedicinal plants 3amedicine 3apatients 3aprofessionals 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3ateachers 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAttitude of Health Personnel 2aFamily 2aFemale 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aIncome 2aInterviews as Topic 2aMale 2aMedicine, Traditional 2aMiddle Aged 2aPatients 2aPractice Patterns, Physicians'. 2aPhytotherapyxstatistics & numerical dataxutilization. 2aPlant Extractsxtherapeutic use 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aProfessional Competence 2aToothachexdrug therapy 2aYoung Adult 3aBrazil 0aBrazil1 ade Moura, Flávio Renato Reis1 aDemarco, Flávio Fernando1 aNascente, Patrícia da Silva1 aPino, Francisco Augusto Burkert Del1 aLund, Rafael Guerra0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2012 Mar. 27, v. 140, no. 2 p.428-437dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2012.01.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245014100204300001800345520125400363592002801617650001301645650002501658650000901683650001001692650002101702650001601723650002501739650001301764650001201777650001601789650000901805650001401814650002201828650001401850651001401864651001101878651001801889700001801907700001901925700002201944700001401966700001501980700005401995700001802049700001902067700001502086700001602101700001502117700001402132700001602146700003902162773013902201856007902340852000902419655001202428IND60630070920221117171531.0190206e20181226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063007092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b058072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcIntosh, J.

Secure retention of fluids (natural gas, saline formation waters, oil, HVHF fluids) during and after well stimulation is important to prevent unintended environmental contamination, and release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Here, we critically review state-of-the-art techniques and promising new approaches for identifying oil and gas production from unconventional reservoirs to resolve whether they are the source of fugitive methane and associated contaminants into shallow aquifers. We highlight future research needs and propose a phased program, from generic baseline to highly specific analyses, to inform HVHF and unconventional oil and gas production and impact assessment studies. These approaches may also be applied to broader subsurface exploration and development issues (e.g., groundwater resources), or new frontiers of low-carbon energy alternatives (e.g., subsurface H₂ storage, nuclear waste isolation, geologic CO₂ sequestration).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acarbon sequestration 3acoal 3agases 3agreenhouse gases 3agroundwater 3ahydraulic fracturing 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3anatural gas 3aoils 3apollution 3aradioactive waste 3asandstone 3aAustralia 3aCanada 3aUnited States1 aHendry, M.

Their reaction to different disturbance and management regimes was studied in spruce forests (Lariceto-Piceetum) 10 years after a severe windthrow in the Tatra National Park (Slovak Republic). ECM community structure was compared between different “management types″—cleared area (EXT), area affected by wildfire (FIRE), uncleared area left for natural development (NEX), and mature forest as a control (REF). Based on Illumina sequencing of soil samples, we determined that the percentage of sequences assigned to ECM fungi decreased with increasing disturbance and management intensity (REF → NEX → EXT → FIRE). Similarly, the total number of ECM species per each of ten sampling points per plot (100 ha) differed between managed (EXT-11 species, FIRE-9) and unmanaged (NEX-16, REF-14) treatments. On the other hand, the percentage of sequences belonging to ericoid mycorrhizal fungi increased. Management type significantly influenced the composition of the ECM community, while vegetation and soil characteristics explained less data variation. The ECM species assemblage of the unmanaged site (NEX) was the most similar to the mature forest, while that of the burnt site was the most different. Thelephora terrestris dominated in all treatments affected by windthrow, accompanied by Tylospora fibrillosa (NEX) and Tylospora asterophora (EXT and FIRE). Management regime was also the most important factor affecting ECM species composition on the roots of spruce seedlings assessed by Sanger sequencing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aThelephora terrestris 3acommunity structure 3aectomycorrhizae 3aforest regeneration 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anational parks 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asoil properties 3asoil sampling 3aspecies diversity 3asymbionts 3atemperate forests 3atrees 3awildfires 3awindthrow 3aSlovakia1 aEdwards-Jonášová, Magda1 aVeselá, Petra1 aEffenberková, Lenka1 aFleischer, Peter1 aCudlin, P.q(Pavel),0 tMycorrhiza.g2018 Apr., v. 28, no. 3 p.221-233dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58547x0940-63607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-018-0820-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03783naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245015200205300001800357520196300375592002802338650001402366650003102380650001602411650001902427650001502446650002102461650001602482650001002498650001102508650001502519650002102534650002002555650001202575650001902587650001602606650000902622650000902631650001902640650002002659650001102679650002802690650003602718650003202754653002702786653002002813653002002833700007402853700006002927773015402987856007903141852000903220655001203229IND60697390320221117191848.0201023e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069739032DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2019-180672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanahipour, Layla1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3557-349310aHypoallergenic infant formula lacks transforming growth factor beta activity and has a lower anti-inflammatory activity than regular infant formula  ap. 6771-6781.  aHypoallergenic formulas are recommended for infants who are not breastfed and cannot tolerate cow milk formulas due to allergy. These formulas are hydrolyzed to break down larger protein chains into shorter, easy-to-digest, and potentially less allergenic proteins. Hydrolysis, however, possibly occurs at the expense of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and anti-inflammatory activity that is inherent in regular formula. Our objective was to determine the TGF-β and the anti-inflammatory activity of commercially available hypoallergenic and regular formulas. Human gingival fibroblasts were incubated with reconstituted formulas followed by detection of TGF-β target genes and activation of Smad2/3 signaling. Gingival fibroblasts and the oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line HSC-2 were also exposed to formulas before adding interleukin (IL)1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α to provoke expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. For murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was stimulated with saliva. Changes in p65 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of smad3 and p38 were analyzed by immunostaining. Our study demonstrated that regular formula, but not hypoallergenic formula, enhanced the expression of TGF-β target genes IL11, PRG4, and NOX4 in gingival fibroblasts. Hypoallergenic formulas also failed to initiate nuclear translocation of Smad2/3 and phosphorylation of Smad3. Moreover, regular formulas were more potent than hypoallergenic formulas in reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in gingival fibroblasts, HSC-2 epithelial cells, and murine bone marrow macrophages. Hypoallergenic and regular formulas had a similar capacity to reduce p65 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of p38 in fibroblasts. These findings suggest that hypoallergenic formulas lack in vitro TGF-β activity and have a lower anti-inflammatory activity compared with regular formulas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergens 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abone marrow 3abreast feeding 3acell lines 3aepithelial cells 3afibroblasts 3agenes 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3ahypersensitivity 3ainfant formulas 3ainfants 3ainterleukin-11 3amacrophages 3amice 3amilk 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphorylation 3asaliva 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3atransforming growth factor beta 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0ahypoallergenic formula 0aregular formula 0aTGF-β activity1 aTabatabaei, Amirali Abooneghab1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8090-88571 aGruber, Reinhard1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5400-90090 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 Aug., v. 103, no. 8 p.6771-6781dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-180673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007600168300001800244520111500262592002801377650002101405650001401426650001001440650001401450700005401464700006301518700002201581700006601603700001801669700006201687773011401749856008401863852000901947655001201956IND60744426320220418000000.0210713e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074442632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c009042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgo, Quynh P.10aReconfigurable Pickering Emulsions with Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes  ap. 8204-8211.  aPickering emulsions (PEs) achieve interfacial stabilization by colloidal particle surfactants and are commonly used in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have recently been used as stabilizing materials to create dynamic single emulsions. In this study, we used the formation of Meisenheimer complexes on functionalized CNTs to fabricate complex biphasic emulsions containing hydrocarbons (HCs) and fluorocarbons (FCs). The reversible nature of Meisenheimer complex formation allows for further functionalization at the droplet–water interface. The strong affinity of fluorofluorescent perylene bisimide (F-PBI) to the CNTs was used to enhance the assembly of CNTs on the FC–water interface. The combination of different concentrations of the functionalized CNTs and the pelene additive enables predictable complex emulsion morphologies. Reversible morphology reconfiguration was explored with the addition of molecular surfactants. Our results show that the interfacial properties of functionalized CNTs have considerable utility in the fabrication of complex dynamic emulsions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acosmetics 3adrugs 3aemulsions1 aHe, Maggie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0588-95451 aConcellón, Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8932-90851 aYoshinaga, Kosuke1 aLuo, Shao-Xiong Lennon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5308-45761 aAljabri, Nouf1 aSwager, Timothy M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3577-05100 tLangmuir.g2021 June 30, v. 37, no. 27 p.8204-8211dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c009043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245008100161300001600242520116300258592002801421650001101449650002401460650001101484650001501495650002201510651001601532653002701548653002601575653002301601700002201624700001701646700001701663700001701680773007801697856008301775852000901858655001201867IND60096901320221118033111.0160903e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009690132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Q.10aIntervention strategy to stimulate energy-saving behavior of local residents  ap. 706-715.  aThis study investigates intervention strategy in stimulating energy-saving behavior to achieve energy neutral urban development. A tree structure overview of potential interventions classified into three categories is revealed. An integrated behaviour model is developed reflecting the relations between behaviour and influence factors. A latent class model is used to identify segments of local residents who differ regarding their preferences for interventions. Data are collected from a sample of residents in the Eindhoven region of the Netherlands in 2010. The results indicate that social-demographic characteristics, knowledge, motivation and context factors play important roles in energy-saving behaviour. Specifically, four segments of residents in the study area were identified that clearly differed in their preferences of interventions: cost driven residents, conscious residents, ease driven residents and environment minded residents. These findings emphasize that the intervention strategy should be focused on specific target groups to have the right mixture of interventions to achieve effective results on stimulating them to save energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3amodels 3amotivation 3aurban development 3aNetherlands 0aEnergy-saving behavior 0aIntervention strategy 0aLatent class model1 aNieuwenhijsen, I.1 ade Vries, B.1 aBlokhuis, E.1 aSchaefer, W.0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 Jan., v. 52 p.706-715dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005400145245014700199300001800346520148000364592002801844650001301872650001101885650002501896650001401921650001801935650001001953650001501963650001301978650002001991650001402011650001102025650001602036650001802052650003102070651001202101700002102113700001702134700002702151700002002178700001802198773013902216856007902355852000902434655001202443IND60630071020221117171536.0190206e20190107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063007102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.8b058262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5049-211710aChemical Characterization of Highly Functionalized Organonitrates Contributing to Night-Time Organic Aerosol Mass Loadings and Particle Growth  ap. 1165-1174.  aReactions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) with NO₃ radicals and of reactive intermediates of oxidized VOC with NOₓ can lead to the formation of highly functionalized organonitrates (ON). We present quantitative and chemical information on ON contributing to high night-time organic aerosol (OA) mass concentrations measured during July–August 2016 in a rural area in southwest Germany. A filter inlet for gases and aerosols coupled to a high-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer (FIGAERO-HR-ToF-CIMS) was used to analyze the molecular composition of ON in both the gas and particle phase. We find larger contributions of ON to OA mass during the night. Identified ON are highly functionalized, with 4 to 12 oxygen atoms. The diel patterns of ON compounds with 5, 7, 10, or 15 carbon atoms per molecule vary, indicating a corresponding behavior of their potential precursor VOC. The temporal behavior of ON after sunset correlates with that of the number concentration of ultrafine particles, indicating a potential role of ON in night-time new particle formation (NPF) regularly observed at this location. We estimate an ON contribution of 18–25% to the mass increase of newly formed particles after sunset. Our study provides insights into the chemical composition of highly functionalized ON in the rural atmosphere and the role of anthropogenic emissions for night-time SOA formation in an area where biogenic VOC emissions dominate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3acarbon 3achemical composition 3aemissions 3afree radicals 3agases 3aionization 3anitrates 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3arural areas 3aspectrometers 3avolatile organic compounds 3aGermany1 aSaathoff, Harald1 aShen, Xiaoli1 aRamisetty, Ramakrishna1 aLeisner, Thomas1 aMohr, Claudia0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2019 Jan. 07, v. 53, no. 3 p.1165-1174dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b058263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03510naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005100147245012600198300001400324520197300338592002802311650002102339650001702360650001702377650002102394650002802415650001302443650002502456650001502481650002002496650001902516650001902535650001002554650002502564650002602589651002102615653002602636653002602662653003102688653001902719653002702738653002602765700001902791773012802810856008102938852000903019655001203028IND60600537020221120090658.0180703e20140411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060053702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2013.12.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyunc(Associate professor of geography),10aAnalysis of traditional knowledge for wild edible mushrooms consumed by residents living in Jirisan National Park (Korea)  ap. 90-97.  aThis study aims to record and analyze the traditional knowledge of wild edible mushrooms utilized by residents living in Jirisan National Park (Korea).Data was collected through participant observations and in-depth interviews with semi-structured questionnaires. Quantitative comparative analyses were accomplished through informant consensus factor (ICF), fidelity level (FL), and inter-network analysis (INA).The amounts of traditional knowledge recorded from the communities were 158 practices classified within 22 families, 33 genera, and 38 species. The representative families were Tricholomataceae (23.20%) followed by Pleurotaceae (13.10%), Polyporaceae (8.21%), and Hymenochaetaceae (6.33%). The results revealed 24 modes of preparation for the mushrooms, with the most common methods being for preparing them as, seasoned cooked mushrooms (40.75%), soups (13.84%), teas (12.18%), simmered (9.19%), and roasted (6.20%). The informant consensus factor (ICF) values in the ailment categories were birth-related disorders (1.00), genitourinary system disorders (1.00), other conditions (0.91), circulatory system disorders (0.76), and diabetes (0.33). In terms of fidelity levels, five mushroom species showed 100% of fidelities.Regarding the inter-network analysis (INA) of mushrooms and ailments, the positions of medicinal mushrooms is distributed into three main groups. Also, regarding the network of mushrooms and foods, the location of edible mushrooms is distributed into two main food groups.The utilization of the inter-network analysis has been used typically within the social sciences for the analysis of social trends and phenomena through the interrelationship of specific social components, from this study it is being applied for the interpretation of traditional knowledge utilizing mushrooms in the local communities. Through this study, we are confident that the useful application of the inter-network analysis has been successfully proven.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHymenochaetaceae 3aPleurotaceae 3aPolyporaceae 3aTricholomataceae 3acardiovascular diseases 3adiabetes 3aindigenous knowledge 3ainterviews 3amedicinal fungi 3anational parks 3aquestionnaires 3asoups 3atraditional medicine 3awild edible mushrooms 3aKorean Peninsula 0aTraditional knowledge 0aWild edible mushrooms 0aInformant consensus factor 0aFidelity level 0aInter-network analysis 0aJirisan National Park1 aSong, Mi-jang,0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2014 Apr. 11, v. 153, no. 1 p.90-97dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.12.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015900173300001800332520117100350592002801521650001301549650001501562650000901577650001201586650000901598700002101607700002401628700006201652773011401714856008401828852000901912655001201921IND60744426420221119022518.0210713e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074442642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c009212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalimbe, Prasad C.10aPrecise Evaluation of Spatial Characteristics of Periodically Precipitating Systems via Measurement of RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) Values of Pattern Images  ap. 8212-8221.  aIn the present study, a method is described for precise determination of spatial characteristics of Liesegang bands formed by employing a classical 1D setup using a web-based free resource (https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/pms/color_picker_from_image.php). The method involves the compartmentalization of the information on each pixel into R (red), G (green), or B (blue) values from the pattern images obtained using a simple digital camera. The values can further be converted to absorbance values by using the system blank. Each trough (or peak) in the graph of RGB values (or absorbance values) corresponds to a band in the pattern. The method is employed to determine the spacing and width of the periodically precipitating AgCl, AgBr, and Co(OH)₂ in an agar gel. It is observed that AgCl shows revert banding, and AgBr shows revert banding at the top of the tube and then diverges to regular banding at the bottom of the tube, whereas the Co(OH)₂ patterns explicitly show regular banding under given experimental conditions. It is also observed that minute instabilities, such as the formation of secondary bands, can also be visualized by the present method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aabsorbance 3aagar 3acameras 3agels1 aTakale, Kiran D.1 aKulkarni, Preeti S.1 aKulkarni, Sunil D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6555-837X0 tLangmuir.g2021 July 01, v. 37, no. 27 p.8212-8221dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c009213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010300175300001600278520133400294592002801628650001301656650001601669650001601685650002601701650001401727650003901741650001801780650001201798650002301810650001601833650001201849650001201861650001301873651001001886653003101896653001601927653001401943653002101957700002701978700002902005700003102034773008802065856008502153852000902238655001202247IND60519039620221118071028.0160420e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051903962DNAL7 a10.1080/00087114.2016.11521112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoshi, Hemant Suhas10aCytogenetics of two endemic Barleria species (Acanthaceae) from the northern Western Ghats (India)  ap. 170-174.  aChromosome studies have been carried out on two endemic species of the northern Western Ghats, India, viz. Barleria lawii and B. sepalosa . Both species showed 2 n = 40 mitotic chromosomes. Chromosomes had median region centromeres and both species exhibited a karyotype formula of 20m. Karyotypes were moderately symmetrical and fell into category 4b of Stebbins’ asymmetry classes. Values for the intrachromosomal index (A ₁) for Barleria lawii and B. sepalosa were 0.23 and 0.28, respectively, while the interchromosomal index (A ₂) for the former was 0.19 and 0.23 for the latter. Meiosis was found to be normal and both species had 20 bivalents at diplotene/diakinesis. These data on cytogenetics add to the information about karyosystematics of Barleria section Chrysothrix and will be useful in understanding species interrelationships and also in undertaking hybridization programmes for producing hybrids of ornamental interest. Since gross chromosome morphology of the two species in particular, and all Barleria species for which chromosome data are available in general, is similar, it is suggested that further linear differentiation of chromosomes and better understanding of karyotype evolution in Barleria should be possible using banding techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBarleria 3aChrysothrix 3acentromeres 3achromosome morphology 3aevolution 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3aindigenous species 3akaryotyping 3ameiosis 3amitosis 3aprophase 3aIndia 0aBarleria sect.

Climate change has resulted in both warm and cold temperature extremes, including an increased frequency of severe cold snaps at middle latitudes in North America. These unusually cold air masses cause rapid declines in nearshore ocean temperatures in coastal areas, with detrimental effects on marine organisms. Acute cold‐stun events (hereafter cold stuns) occur when hundreds to thousands of resident juvenile sea turtles fail to escape shallow water during cold snaps. Human intervention through rescue and recovery largely mitigates direct juvenile sea turtle mortality, but delayed effects of cold stuns on rescued individuals are not well understood. Our objective was to examine long‐term juvenile green turtle (Chelonia mydas) survival across four cold stuns of varying severity in St. Joseph Bay, Florida, between 2010 and 2018. We used the classic Cormack–Jolly–Seber model in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to estimate apparent survival (i.e., emigration and mortality) of rescued turtles at different time intervals. Our results indicated about half of a cohort rescued during a severe cold stun in January 2010 likely remained in the population 1 year later, with 10%–20% remaining 4 years later, and as few as 5% by 2018. The results also suggested higher apparent survival for cohorts rescued during two subsequent milder cold stuns. Emigration was a more plausible ecological explanation for low apparent survival than delayed mortality. Potential ecological mechanisms underlying emigration include a reduction in food availability and a behavioral response to either the severe weather event or handling during rescue (or both). However, the typical annual turnover of juvenile green turtles, though assumed low, is not well known in St. Joseph Bay. Thus, our apparent survival estimates may be reflective of higher‐than‐expected emigration in the broader population. Our study provides important baseline information about long‐term juvenile sea turtle survival after cold stuns in temperate regions. We also highlight the importance of strategic monitoring between cold stuns to examine additional ecological questions.  aPublisher supplied data  a21366cNational Marine Fisheries Service  a17183cNational Marine Fisheries Service  a118cState of Florida Marine Turtle 3aBayesian theory 3aChelonia mydas 3aair 3aclimate change 3acold 3afood availability 3ahumans 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3amortality 3asea turtles 3atemperature 3aweather 3aFlorida1 aLamont, Margaret M.1 aFoley, Allen0 tEcosphere.g2022 Sept., v. 13, no. 9 p.e4221-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.42213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245018800159300001400347520142700361592002801788650002001816650002801836650002601864650001401890650001001904650002101914650001501935650001001950650001001960650001701970650001801987650001402005650001902019650001302038650002402051650002502075653002102100653001602121653001402137653002502151700001602176773011602192856007802308852000902386655001202395IND60679396620221118015613.0191228e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067939662DNAL7 a10.2478/hppj-2020-00022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSumbul, A.10aInteractive effect of Meloidogyne incognita and Macrophomina phaseolina on the development of root–rot disease complex in relation to growth and physiological attributes of chickpea  ap. 13-23.  aThe interactive relationship between the root–knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita and the root-rot fungus Macrophomina phaseolina in a root–rot disease complex of chickpea (Cicer arietinum var. avrodhi) was studied in a net house. The present study was carried out in such a manner so that the pathogenic potential of M. incognita and M. phaseolina individually, simultaneously and sequentially could be monitored. The pathogens singly as well as in combination led to significant reduction in growth, yield, nutrient and biochemical parameters. Gaseous exchange parameters like photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance were also reduced following infection of plants by the pathogens. However, maximum reduction was noticed in simultaneous inoculation with both pathogens. Sequential inoculation, where M. incognita preceded M. phaseolina by 15 days, was more damaging to the crop in comparison to that where M. phaseolina preceded M. incognita inoculation by 15 days. Infection by M. phaseolina caused a considerable reduction in the number of galls, egg–masses and nematode multiplication, with the highest reduction observed in plants simultaneously inoculated with the pathogens. Those plants also showed the highest disease severity in terms of percent root–rot. Thus, a manifold action plan to reduce the impact of the root-rot disease complex on chickpea crops has to be formulated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3aMacrophomina phaseolina 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3achickpeas 3acrops 3adisease severity 3aegg masses 3afungi 3agalls 3agas exchange 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aphotosynthesis 3aroot rot 3aroot-knot nematodes 3astomatal conductance 0agaseous exchange 0ainteraction 0anutrients 0apathogenic potential1 aMahmood, I.0 tHellenic Plant Protection Journal.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 13, no. 1 p.13-23dSciendowJournal:23084x1791-36917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/hppj-2020-00023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03660naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005500144245016400199300001800363520212300381592002802504650001902532650002502551650001502576650001602591650001602607650002002623650001002643650001202653650001902665650001202684650001402696650001002710650001502720650002002735650002602755650001402781650002502795650001402820650002102834650003302855653002002888653002802908773015402936856007903090852000903169655001203178IND60697390520221117191914.0201023e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069739052DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2019-181192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, H.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5449-281110aADSA Foundation Scholar Award: Influencing hepatic metabolism: Can nutrient partitioning be modulated to optimize metabolic health in the transition dairy cow?  ap. 6741-6750.  aHepatic de novo production of glucose and oxidation of fatty acids are critical in supporting milk production during the transition to lactation period. During this period of metabolic challenge, there is an increase in fatty acids taken up by the liver. Although the primary fate for these fatty acids is complete oxidation, alternative fates include incomplete oxidation via ketogenesis, storage within the liver as triglycerides (TG), and secretion of TG within very low density lipoproteins. Influencing the relative capacity of these pathways, and thus shifting nutrient partitioning, may allow for improved hepatic efficiency and metabolic health. Hepatic nutrient partitioning reflects complex regulation of key metabolic pathways by factors such as fatty acids and other substrates. Relative flux of fatty acid through oxidation or re-esterification to TG leads to the onset of metabolic disorders that are associated with negative production outcomes, such as hyperketonemia and fatty liver. Although recent work has focused on understanding how stored TG are lipolyzed for subsequent oxidation, the mechanism and regulation of this remains unclear. The source of mobilized fatty acids is similarly important, both in terms of amount and profile of fatty acids mobilized. There is likely a complex, coordinated whole-body response, given that fatty acids mobilized from adipose tissue affect hepatic regulation. Fatty acids mobilized from adipose tissue have regulatory effects on genes such as pyruvate carboxylase; however, in vivo work suggests there may also be other influences resulting in differential regulation between cows that subsequently develop sub-clinical ketosis and those that do not. Optimizing nutrient partitioning between critical metabolic pathways may allow for nutritional opportunities to reduce incidence of metabolic challenges and improve feed efficiency. Although further research is needed to continue refining our understanding of the intricate balance regulating hepatic metabolism, shifting nutrient partitioning may be key in supporting both efficiency and metabolic health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3abiochemical pathways 3adairy cows 3afatty acids 3afatty liver 3afeed conversion 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahyperketonemia 3aketosis 3alactation 3aliver 3ametabolism 3amilk production 3anutrient partitioning 3aoxidation 3apyruvate carboxylase 3asecretion 3atriacylglycerols 3avery low density lipoprotein 0agluconeogenesis 0anegative energy balance0 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 Aug., v. 103, no. 8 p.6741-6750dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-181193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245011300185300001600298520093000314592002801244650001501272650001101287650001101298650000901309650001401318650001001332650001501342650002401357650001201381650001801393650002101411650002601432650002501458650002901483650005501512650002801567650001401595650003901609650002501648651001201673700001901685700002201704700001901726700002701745773009601772856004801868852000901916655001201925IND50062535820221118031608.0130322e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006253582DNAL7 a230535202pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-012-1490-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaulitz, Danny10aImproved pig donor screening including newly identified variants of porcine endogenous retrovirus-C (PERV-C)  ap. 341-348.  aPorcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) are widely distributed in the genomes of pigs. PERV-A and PERV-B are present in all pigs. They infect human cells in vitro and therefore represent a risk for xenotransplantation when pig cells, tissues or organs are used. PERV-C infects only pig cells and is not present in the genomes of all pigs. However, PERV-A/C recombinants infecting human cells and characterized by high replication titers were found in pigs. To select PERV-C-free animals that cannot generate such recombinants, PCR-based assays were developed (Kaulitz et al., J Virol Methods, 175:60, 2011). When screening for PERV-C in German wild boars (Sus scrofa scrofa), applying these methods, a new variant of PERV-C was identified. Whereas in all 125 wild boar only the new variant of PERV-C was found, different variants were present in some landrace pigs, and most importantly, some pigs were totally free of PERV-C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSus scrofa 3agenome 3ahumans 3arisk 3ascreening 3aswine 3awild boars 3axenotransplantation 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aDonor Selectionxmethods 2aEndogenous Retrovirusesxclassificationxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSus scrofaxvirology 0aGermany1 aMihica, Debora1 aAdlhoch, Cornelia1 aSemaan, Marwan1 aDenner, J.q(Joachim),0 tArchives of virology.g2013 Feb., v. 158, no. 2 p.341-348dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-012-1490-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245013500167300001600302520165300318592002801971650001901999650002302018650002002041650001902061650001102080650002402091650001802115650001402133650002902147651001002176653003002186653002202216653001002238773007802248856008302326852000902409655001202418IND60096901620221118033131.0160903e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009690162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Chun Chun10aPotential energy savings and reduction of CO2 emissions through higher efficiency standards for polyphase electric motors in Japan  ap. 737-747.  aJapan has shut down more than 70% of its nuclear power plants since the March 2011 Tohoku earthquake and the ensuing accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The country has been challenged with power shortages in the short-term and faces complex energy security decisions in the long-term. Japan has a long history of implementing energy conservation policies, such as the Top Runner Program, which covers 23 products including appliances and industrial equipment. However, Japan's efficiency policy for polyphase electric motors is considered below international standards. Polyphase electric motors accounted for about 55% of the nation's total power consumption in 2008. The aim of this study is to estimate potential energy savings and reduction in CO2 emissions (2014–2043) by examining scenarios involving adopting two different polyphase motor efficiency standards and comparing them to a base case and concludes by suggesting pathways for further policy development using the results obtained. The study finds that if level IE2 of the international efficiency standard IEC 60034-30 were implemented, it would save 8.3TWh (or 0.03 quads) per year, which is equivalent to about 0.8% of Japan's total electric power consumption in 2010. If level IE3 of the IEC 60034-30 were implemented instead, it would save about 13.3TWh (or 0.05 quads) per year. The corresponding cumulative energy savings and reduction in CO2 emissions for the IE2 scenario would be 249TWh (or 0.85 quads) and 93Mt. The corresponding cumulative energy savings and reduction in CO2 emissions for the IE3 scenario would be 398TWh (or 1.36 quads) and 149Mt.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adevelopment policy 3aelectric motors 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy policy 3aequipment 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aJapan 0aPolyphase electric motors 0aEnergy efficiency 0aJapan0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 Jan., v. 52 p.737-747dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245006100168300001400229500001900243520122500262592002801487650002201515650001701537650001801554650001901572650000901591650001401600650001401614650002101628650002801649650001501677650001301692650001201705650002101717653002101738653001601759653000901775700002501784700002201809700002001831773012901851856008001980852000902060655001202069IND60736699720221122032830.0210510e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073669972DNAL7 a10.2478/prolas-2021-00142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSokolovska, Lība10aAqueous C60 Fullerene Solution Effects on Cell Viability  ap. 86-91.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFullerenes are carbon nanoparticles with the ability to quench reactive oxygen species. The biomedical potential of fullerenes is diminished by their low solubility in water, but many approaches have been developed to bypass this problem, like chemical modification of the carbon cage and the use of the solvent exchange method to transfer fullerenes from one solvent to the other. These two approaches were used in this study. Carboxylated fullerene aqueous solution was acquired using solvent exchange method transferring fullerene nanoparticles (C60) from toluene to water. Effects of varying concentration (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 10 µM) of aqueous fullerene solution on cell viability and their antioxidative capabilities were evaluated on PC-3 and on monocytes isolated from a blood donor using Resazurin Cell Viability Assay. PC-3 cell viability was drastically affected by the 10 µM fullerene solution but remained relatively stable when treated with other concentrations even after longer periods of incubation with resazurin dye. Elevated cell viability was observed in monocytes treated with various fullerene concentrations, possibly indicative of fullerene protective activity against oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3ablood donors 3acarboxylation 3acell viability 3adyes 3afullerene 3amonocytes 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species 3asolubility 3asolvents 3atoluene 3aviability assays 0acarboxyfullerene 0aantioxidant 0aPC-31 aČistjakovs, Maksims1 aSultanova, Alīna1 aMurovska, Modra0 tProceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 75, no. 2 p.86-91dSciendowJournal:21686x1407-009X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/prolas-2021-00143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01850naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245008200206300001600288520070300304592002801007650001501035650001801050650002301068650001501091650002701106650001301133650002001146650001001166650002001176650001301196650002901209773011301238856008101351990002301432852000901455655001201464IND60094179420221120215507.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009417942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gde.2011.01.0182doi7 aPMC30708592pmcid7 a213246712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDorsett, Dale10aCohesin: genomic insights into controlling gene transcription and development  ap. 199-206.  aOver the past decade it has emerged that the cohesin protein complex, which functions in sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair, also regulates gene expression and development. Even minor changes in cohesin activity alter several aspects of development. Genome-wide analysis indicates that cohesin directly regulates transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation, pluripotency, and differentiation through multiple mechanisms. These mechanisms are poorly understood, but involve both partial gene repression in concert with Polycomb group proteins, and facilitating long-range looping, both between enhancers and promoters, and between CTCF protein binding sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA repair 3abinding sites 3acell proliferation 3achromatids 3achromosome segregation 3acohesion 3agene expression 3agenes 3aprotein binding 3aproteins 3atranscription (genetics)0 tCurrent Opinion in Genetics & Development.g2011 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.199-206dElsevier Ltdx0959-437X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gde.2011.01.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245015200156300001600308500002000324520196300344592002802307596005602335650002002391650002202411650003602433650001702469650002502486650001702511650001502528651001602543700002102559700002102580700002002601700001702621700002902638700005902667700001902726700002002745773013602765856007402901852000902975655001202984IND60759419720221123030227.0211209e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075941972DNAL7 a10.1111/ajr.127782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNixon, Garry10aDeveloping the geographic classification for health, a rural‐urban classification for New Zealand health research and policy: A research protocol  ap. 939-946.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aINTRODUCTION: Rural‐urban health inequities, exacerbated by deprivation and ethnicity, have been clearly described in the international literature. To date, the same inequities have not been as clearly demonstrated in Aotearoa New Zealand despite the lower socioeconomic status and higher proportion of Māori living in rural towns. This is ascribed by many health practitioners, academics and other informed stakeholders to be the result of the definitions of 'rural' used to produce statistics. AIMS: To outline a protocol to produce a ‘fit‐for‐health purpose’ rural‐urban classification for analysing national health data. The classification will be designed to determine the magnitude of health inequities that have been obscured by use of inappropriate rural‐urban taxonomies. METHODS: This protocol paper outlines our proposed mixed‐methods approach to developing a novel Geographic Classification for Health. In phase 1, an agreed set of community attributes will be used to modify the new Statistics New Zealand Urban Accessibility Classification into a more appropriate classification of rurality for health contexts. The Geographic Classification for Health will then be further developed in an iterative process with stakeholders including rural health researchers and members of the National Rural Health Advisory Group, who have a comprehensive ‘on the ground’ understanding of Aotearoa New Zealand's rural communities and their attendant health services. This protocol also proposes validating the Geographic Classification for Health using general practice enrolment data. In phase 2, the resulting Geographic Classification for Health will be applied to routinely collected data from the Ministry of Health. This will enable current levels of rural‐urban inequity in health service access and outcomes to be accurately assessed and give an indication of the extent to which older classifications were masking inequities.  aPublisher supplied data  aGA219FcNew Zealand Health Research Council Project 3ahealth services 3aissues and policy 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3arural health 3asocioeconomic status 3astakeholders 3astatistics 3aNew Zealand1 aWhitehead, Jesse1 aDavie, Gabrielle1 aFearnley, David1 aCrengle, Sue1 aDe Graaf, B.q(Brandon),1 aSmith, Michelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7580-88941 aWakerman, John1 aLawrenson, Ross0 tAustralian journal of rural health.g2021 Dec., v. 29, no. 6 p.939-946dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000053x1038-52827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajr.127783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03748naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245010500161300001800266520229200284592002802576650001602604650001302620650001202633650001502645650001602660650001002676650001802686650002202704650002402726650001202750650001402762650002402776650001902800650002802819650002302847650000902870650002302879651001802902653002202920653002002942653001702962700001702979700001502996773015503011856007903166852000903245655001203254IND60649624120221118060426.0200103e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064962412DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2019-166012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolder, H.M.10aEffects of in-feed enzymes on milk production and components, reproduction, and health in dairy cows  ap. 8011-8026.  aOur objectives were to characterize responses in the field to a mix of fibrolytic enzymes using large commercial dairy herds and sufficient study power to evaluate milk production and reproductive responses to an enzyme treatment started during the precalving period. We hypothesized that the use of the enzyme treatment would increase milk production when provided to dairy cows precalving and for approximately 200 d of lactation. The study was conducted on 7,507 cows, in 8 replicates and 16 pens, at 3 dairies in the United States. Eight pens were randomly allocated as control pens and received no enzyme, and another 8 pens received enzyme treatment at a dose of 750 mL/t of dry matter feed. Milk production and energy-corrected milk yield were increased with the enzyme treatment by 0.70 and 0.80 kg/d, respectively, across a 5-month period. Milk fat percentage was not significantly increased by enzyme treatment, but milk fat yield was significantly increased by 0.040 kg/d, compared with controls. Milk protein yield increased 0.010 kg/d with enzyme treatment despite a small reduction of 0.020 percentage units in milk protein percentage. We found no evidence of an increase in the ln somatic cell count for the enzyme-treated cows. Body weight overall was not increased for enzyme-treated cows, but we did observe a numerical increase in dry matter intake (0.20 kg/head per day) for enzyme-treated cows. Most production responses to the enzyme treatment were influenced by dairy. Compared with controls, milk yield in enzyme-treated cows was significantly higher by 3.6 kg/d in dairy 2 and numerically higher by 0.60 and 0.20 kg/d in dairies 1 and 3, respectively. Reproduction, health, and risk of removal or death were not significantly influenced by treatment, apart from a reduced time to first breeding. Production responses to the enzyme treatment varied by dairy from substantial to minor increases, but variation among dairies was not evident in differences in dry matter intake or in partitioning of body weight among enzyme-treated and control pens and cows. It appears likely that the increase in production reflected increased digestibility of feed; however, further work is needed to identify factors influencing the variation in production responses to enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3abreeding 3adairies 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3adeath 3adigestibility 3adry matter intake 3aenzymatic treatment 3aenzymes 3alactation 3amilk fat percentage 3amilk fat yield 3amilk protein percentage 3amilk protein yield 3arisk 3asomatic cell count 3aUnited States 0afibrolytic enzyme 0amilk production 0areproduction1 aRossow, H.A.1 aLean, I.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2019 Sept., v. 102, no. 9 p.8011-8026dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-166013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04675naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245017200174300001600346520228300362536036602645592002803011596020503039596008803244650002103332650002303353650001203376650002203388650002503410650002103435650002703456650002003483650002303503650001503526650002503541650002103566650001303587650001803600650001503618650001503633650002703648650002503675653004003700653002503740653001703765653003803782653005403820700001503874700002003889773011803909856008504027852000904112655001204121IND60595862220221119172545.0180608e20180418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059586222DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2017.13178422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFudala-Ksiazek, S.10aNitrification, denitrification, and dephosphatation capability of activated sludge during co-treatment of intermediate-age landfill leachates with municipal wastewater  ap. 986-996.  aThis study focuses on the possible use and efficacy of the co-treatment of landfill leachate (intermediate-age) with municipal wastewater. The nitrification, denitrification, and dephosphatation capability of activated sludge acclimated with a mixture of raw municipal wastewater (RWW) with gradually increasing amounts of raw landfill leachate (RLL) (from 0.5 to 5% v/v) were tested. Biochemical tests were conducted simultaneously in batch reactors (BRs). According to the obtained data, the ammonia utilization rate (AUR) was 3.68 g N/(kg volatile suspended solids (VSS)·h) for RWW, and it increased to 5.78 g N/(kg VSS·h) with the addition of 5% RLL. The nitrate utilization rate under anoxic conditions (NURAX) remained at a comparable level of 1.55–1.98 g N/(kg VSS·h). During the anoxic phase, both nitrate utilization and phosphorus uptake occurred, suggesting that denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating organisms (DPAOs) utilized N–NO₃. With the addition of RLL, the rates of anoxic and aerobic phosphate uptake (PURAX and PURAE) and phosphate release rate (PRR) decreased. The PRR was likely negatively influenced by high N–NO₃ concentrations but not completely inhibited due to the availability of a biodegradable fraction of chemical oxygen demand (COD).

Among the known heavy metals, arsenic (As) toxicity widely affects plants and animals. In the recent past, various approaches have been used to study and ameliorate As accumulation in the plants. Of the different approaches, the detoxification mechanism utilizes various sulfur-related compounds; therefore, the limitation of sulfur leads to enhanced toxicity in plants. Though studies have suggested links between As and sulfur responses, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of these responses is required. In this study, transcriptome analysis of the Arabidopsis accessions (Koz2–2 and Ri-0) with contrasting responses to sulfate limitation and As stress was carried out to identify genes involved in regulating various processes. Several genes associated with growth and development, stress, or sulfate metabolism and secondary plant product biosynthesis were found to be differentially expressed in contrasting accessions under sulfate limitation and As stress. A set of genes, including DREB1A and Marneral Synthase 1(MRN1), were exclusively upregulated under the combined stress in Koz2–2. Further, transcriptome analysis also revealed higher nucleotide variation in Koz2–2 than in Ri-0, which could be a reason for the contrasting response under the different stresses among these accessions. Interestingly, LCR44 (Low molecular weight Cysteine Rich 44), a putative defensin-like protein 73, was found to be uniquely upregulated in Koz2–2. The sequence analysis of LCR44 through transcriptome datasets suggested intron retention and insertion of nucleotides in Koz2–2. Hence, this study enriches the knowledge of genetic components to cope with sulfate assimilation and As stress in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aarsenic 3abiosynthesis 3abotany 3acysteine 3adata collection 3aecotypes 3agenetic variation 3agrowth and development 3aintrons 3amolecular weight 3anucleotides 3aplant products 3asequence analysis 3asulfates 3asulfur 3atoxicity 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0aDifferential gene expression 0aLimiting sulfur 0aNucleotide variation 0aTranscriptome analysis1 aDhar, Yogeshwar V.1 aSandhu, Gurpreet1 aSingh, Shikha1 aKumar, Smita1 aKhan, Aruba1 aAsif, Mehar Hasan1 aTrivedi, Prabodh Kumar0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2022 Mar., v. 195 p.104764-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1047643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245011500201300001600316500002000332520185600352592002802208650001302236650001402249650001902263650001002282650001802292650000902310650002502319650001602344650001702360650001202377700005702389700005702446700005702503773013602560856007402696852000902770655001202779IND60759419920221120135523.0211209e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075941992DNAL7 a10.1111/ajr.128012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKennedy, Alison J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4450-843410aRural suicide risk and physical ill health: A qualitative study of the Victorian Suicide Register, 2009‐2015  ap. 927-938.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To gain new insight into contextual factors shaping how physical ill health acts as a stressor in rural suicides—informing the development of appropriate targeted interventions. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Non‐metropolitan Victoria, Australia. SAMPLE: 802 rural (non‐metropolitan) suicide deaths between the years 2009 and 2015. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Qualitative data from the Victorian Suicide Register relating to physical ill health of suicide decedents. RESULTS: Thematic analysis identified 4 themes: (a) ‘living with physical ill health in a rural area’ highlights both practical and cultural challenges associated with managing physical ill health within the context of life in a rural setting; (b) ‘causes and experience of chronic pain’ highlights rural risk factors for chronic pain, how pain was experienced and treatment managed; (c) ‘when living an independent, contributing life is no longer possible’ describes the debilitating physical and mental outcomes of chronic ill health and pain; and (d) ‘the cumulative impact of physical ill health and other factors on suicide risk’ highlights the complexity of risk factors—in combination with (or as a result of) physical ill health—that contribute to a suicide death. CONCLUSION: Identified themes suggest pathways to improve understanding and support for those experiencing physical ill health and associated suicide risk. These supports include contextually and culturally appropriate rural services to provide effective and necessary treatment, pain relief and mental health support; acknowledgement and response to a culture of alcohol misuse as an (ultimately ineffective) coping strategy; proactive psychosocial support mechanisms; and alternative approaches to support including consideration of innovative peer support models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aanalgesia 3acohort studies 3adeath 3amental health 3apain 3aqualitative analysis 3arural areas 3arural health 3asuicide1 aAdams, Jessie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1553-29421 aDwyer, Jeremy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4486-53321 aBrumby, Susan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6332-33740 tAustralian journal of rural health.g2021 Dec., v. 29, no. 6 p.927-938dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000053x1038-52827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajr.128013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01696naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245009600208300001600304520065600320592002800976650000801004650002101012650002001033650001001053650002601063700002201089700002101111773011301132856008101245990002301326852000901349655001201358IND60094179720221120215450.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009417972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gde.2011.01.0092doi7 aPMC30817122pmcid7 a214208512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPápai, Gábor,10aNew insights into the function of transcription factor TFIID from recent structural studies  ap. 219-224.  aThe general transcription factor IID is a key player in the early events of gene expression. TFIID is a multisubunit complex composed of the TATA binding protein and at least 13 TBP associated factors (TAfs) which recognize the promoter of protein coding genes in an activator dependant way. This review highlights recent findings on the molecular architecture and dynamics of TFIID. The structural analysis of functional transcription complexes formed by TFIID, TFIIA, activators and/or promoter DNA illuminates the faculty of TFIID to adjust to various promoter architectures and highlights its role as a platform for preinitiation complex assembly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abinding proteins 3agene expression 3agenes 3atranscription factors1 aWeil, P.

Since the cost is closely linked to the precursor, considerable research has focussed on the use of low-cost alternatives. A promising candidate is a composite fibre consisting of blended cellulose and lignin, which has the added benefit of being derived from sustainable resources. The benefits of blending cellulose and lignin reduce some of the negative aspects of converting single component cellulose and lignin fibres to carbon fibre, although the production from such a blend, remains largely underdeveloped. In this study, the effects of stabilisation temperature and the stabilisation process of the blended fibres are explored. Moreover, the viscoelastic properties of the cellulose-lignin fibre are investigated by DMA for the first time. Finally, the cause of fusion in the stabilisation is adressed and solved by applying a spin finish.  aPublisher supplied data  a715788cH2020 European Institute of Innovation and Technology 3acarbon fibers 3acellulose 3aenergy 3alignin 3atemperature 3aviscoelasticity1 aTrogen, Mikaela1 aMa, Yibo1 aVarley, Russell J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3792-11401 aHummel, Michael1 aByrne, Nolene0 tCellulose.g2021 Jan., v. 28, no. 2 p.911-919dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-020-03583-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016900168300001600337520132100353592002801674650001101702650001001713650001501723650001401738650002501752650002701777650000901804650001101813650001601824650001701840650001601857650002501873650001501898651001001913653001001923653001601933653001101949653002501960653001301985700001401998700001802012700001402030700001702044773011402061856008602175852000902261655001202270IND60610772620221119170821.0190613e20181005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061077262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.07.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMei, Xuebing10aPharmaceuticals and personal care products in the urban river across the megacity Shanghai: Occurrence, source apportionment and a snapshot of influence of rainfall  ap. 429-436.  aOccurrence of eleven pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) along Huangpu River, a representative urban river of megacity Shanghai, was investigated in four sampling campaigns. The overall concentrations of PPCPs ranged from <LOQ to 1455 ng/L, and untreated domestic wastewater was proposed as an important source of PPCPs in Huangpu River. Higher contamination levels of target PPCPs were detected in the lower reach (urban area) and dry season, compared to those in the upper reach (rural area) and wet season, respectively. The influence of rainfall on the occurrence of PPCPs was also extensively discussed in different regions along Huangpu River. At sampling sites in the rural area, similar or even lower concentrations of PPCPs were detected after rainfall; while increased concentrations of PPCPs were observed at most sampling sites, especially in the urban area, suggesting that overflow of untreated wastewater exceeding the capacity of wastewater treatment plants and leachates generated at temporary storage and transfer station of solid wastes might be the additional sources of PPCPs in the urban area in rainy days. These findings indicated that management of wastewater or/and solid wastes was more important to solve the problem of PPCPs contamination in the urban river of megacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adrugs 3adry season 3aleachates 3amunicipal wastewater 3apersonal care products 3arain 3arivers 3arural areas 3asolid wastes 3aurban areas 3awastewater treatment 3awet season 3aChina 0aPPCPs 0aUrban river 0aSource 0aSpatial distribution 0aRainfall1 aSui, Qian1 aLyu, Shuguang1 aWang, Dan1 aZhao, Wentao0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2018 Oct. 05, v. 359 p.429-436dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.07.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010700167300001700274520119400291536036001485592002801845596010801873596005901981596012602040650004402166650001502210650001502225650002202240650003102262650001502293650001302308650000902321650000902330650001402339650001302353650000702366650001502373650003302388650002302421650001602444650001902460653002202479653001502501653003902516653002202555653001402577700001502591700001502606700001402621773011902635856008502754852000902839655001202848IND60595862320221119172633.0180608e20180418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059586232DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2017.13178432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ling10aPhosphate adsorption from aqueous solution by lanthanum–iron hydroxide loaded with expanded graphite  ap. 997-1006.  aIn this study, a novel adsorbent of expanded graphite loaded with lanthanum (III)–iron (III) hydroxide (EG-LaFe) was prepared for phosphate removal. The single factor of oscillating time, La/Fe molar ratio and total concentration of EG-LaFe were studied for optimization of preparation conditions. Effects of contact time, initial phosphate concentration, adsorption temperature and coexisting ions on the phosphate removal performance of EG-LaFe were investigated in detail. Adsorption kinetics and isothermal adsorption studies showed that the pseudo-second-order and the Langmuir model fitted the experimental data quite well. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the phosphate adsorption of EG-LaFe was spontaneous and endothermic. In addition, EG-LaFe exhibit high sorption selectivity toward phosphate over other coexisting ions. The phosphate adsorption mechanism was investigated by means of pH study, scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that the probable mechanisms of phosphate adsorption on EG-LaFe were the replacement of surface hydroxyl groups (M-OH), electrostatic interaction and Lewis acid–base interaction.  aThis work was supported by National Key Technology Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [grant number 2014BAB11B00]; Program for Innovative Research Team in University of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [grant number IRT13078] and National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 21207085].  aPublisher supplied data  aIRT13078cProgram for Innovative Research Team in University of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission  a21207085cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2014BAB11B00cNational Key Technology Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aendothermy 3agraphene 3aions 3airon 3alanthanum 3amoieties 3apH 3aphosphates 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aPhosphate removal 0aadsorption 0alanthanum–iron bimetal composite 0aexpanded graphite 0amechanism1 aJin, SuWan1 aWang, Yong1 aJi, Jiang0 tEnvironmental technology.g2018 Apr. 18, v. 39, no. 8 p.997-1006dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2017.13178433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01673naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245007000179300001800249500000900267520059400276592002800870650001300898650002400911650001600935650001500951650001800966650001700984650001001001650001801011700002001029700001901049773015001068856009601218852000901314655001201323IND60667883720221119004821.0191125e197711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066788372DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1977.03615995004100060044x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Guy D.14aThe Lithoplinthic Horizon, a Diagnostic Horizon for Soil Taxonomy  ap. 1212-1214.  aepub  aA new diagnostic horizon, the lithoplinthic horizon, is proposed for an indurated ironstone that contains many irregular, tubular, channels filled with fine earth, that conduct water and permit plant roots to reach underlying horizons.

Heat treatments (HT) can be applied to improve their primary characteristics. In this experiment, control (non‐treated), HT₁ (3 h; 45 °C) and HT₂ (2 h; 50 °C) were studied. Fruit were stored (10 days; 0 ± 0.5 °C; 90–95% RH) followed by a simulated retail sale period (3 days; 15 °C; 70–75% RH). RESULTS: HT fruit showed higher weight loss (2.76 ± 0.06% and 3.32 ± 0.01% for HT₁ and HT₂, respectively; vs. 2.23 ± 0.14% for control) and lower firmness than control samples (28.88% and 21.67% less for HT₁ and HT₂, respectively). HT treatments induced an increase in soluble solids content and a decrease in total acidity, which led to a better sensory quality. These changes were positively received by consumers. Total antioxidant capacity was enhanced by HT due to an increase in phenolic compound content. A higher enzymatic activity was found in pectin methylesterase and polygaracturonase in HT nectarines when compared to control. CONCLUSION: The application of HT on extra‐early nectarine cv. demonstrated a strong potential to improve consumption quality in the industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aantioxidant activity 3acultivars 3aenzyme activity 3afirmness 3aheat treatment 3aindustry 3anectarines 3anutritive value 3apectinesterase 3asensory properties 3atotal soluble solids 3aweight loss1 aArtés, Francisco1 aAguayo, Encarna1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0052-41680 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Mar., v. 98, no. 4 p.1469-1475dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.86153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002000161245009500181300001600276500000900292520086000301592002801161650002401189650002101213650002401234650001201258650001201270650001901282650001301301650002201314650001901336650001601355650001001371650000901381650000901390650001601399650001901415700002201434700002201456773014801478856009601626852000901722655001201731IND60667883920221119005011.0191125e197103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066788392DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1971.03615995003500020031x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKass, Donald L.10aNitrogen Fixation by Azotobacter paspali in Association with Bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum)  ap. 286-289.  aepub  aEstablishment of Azotobacter paspali in the rhizosphere of Paspalum notatum grown in sand was consistently successful only with tetraploid varieties of the grass when glucose was added at the time of inoculation. Increases in the nitrogen content of the roots and in the total nitrogen content of the sandplant system were associated with successful Azotobacter colonization. These increases were significant at p < 0.05. There was no evidence for improved growth or for nitrogen gains in the above-ground portions of the plants resulting from A. paspali establishment. Soils containing tetraploid P. notatum and A. paspali showed considerable nitrogen fixation, as measured by acetylene reduction. The nitrogen gains appeared to be a consequence of growth of photosynthetic microorganisms, since all fixation ceased when soils were incubated in the dark.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzotobacter paspali 3aPaspalum notatum 3aacetylene reduction 3aglucose 3agrasses 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aphotosynthesis 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asand 3asoil 3atetraploidy 3atotal nitrogen1 aDrosdoff, Matthew1 aAlexander, Martin0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1971 Mar., v. 35, no. 2 p.286-289dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1971.03615995003500020031x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245018000181520163400361592002801995650001802023650001102041650001902052650001902071650000902090650001602099650001902115650001902134650001102153650001902164650001902183650002102202653001502223653003702238653001502275653003102290653002102321700001902342700001302361700002502374700001902399700002002418773012102438856008802559852000902647655001202656IND60761614020221116165429.0220207e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076161402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1047772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkereke, Chikodinaka N.10aImpact of heat stress of varying severity on papaya (Carica papaya) leaves: Major changes in stress volatile signatures, but surprisingly small enhancements of total emissions  aTropical plants are considered to be highly heat stress resistant, but heat waves of different frequency and duration induced by global climate change can exceed the plant heat stress tolerance in the tropics. To gain insight into the overall heat resistance, leaves of papaya were exposed to mild (37 and 41 °C), moderate (46 °C) and severe (49 °C) heat stress (applied for 5 min), and plant recovery was monitored for 48 h upon return to pre-stress conditions. Leaf photosynthetic characteristics were reduced immediately after stress in all cases, but photosynthesis rate almost fully recovered after mild heat treatment, and partly recovered in 48 h after moderate stress, while no recovery was observed under severe stress. Constitutive BVOC emissions dominated by long-chained aldehydes, and glucosinolate breakdown products, attained the emission maxima at 46 °C. Acute heat stress led only to a minor induction of BVOC emissions, and the greatest share of induced emissions was observed in leaves exposed to 46 °C. Induced emissions were dominated by oxygenated monoterpenes, indicating an increase in leaf oxidative status. Our results demonstrate that papaya could withstand moderately severe heat stress of up to 46 °C, but this level of stress will have negative impacts on plant carbon gain due to delayed photosynthetic recovery after heat stress. Although volatile profiles sensitively responded to heat stress, the magnitude and degree of elicitation were surprisingly small throughout the recovery, suggesting that papaya is relatively heat resistant and possess a suite of heat-protective traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarica papaya 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aglucosinolates 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3aheat treatment 3aleaves 3amonoterpenoids 3aphotosynthesis 3astress tolerance 0aHeat shock 0aGlucosinolate breakdown products 0aTerpenoids 0aVolatile organic compounds 0aTropical species1 aKaurilind, Eve1 aLiu, Bin1 aKanagendran, Arooran1 aPazouki, Leila1 aNiinemets, Ulo,0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2022 Mar., v. 195 p.104777-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.1047773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245007800166300001500244520196700259592002802226650001902254650001502273650001602288650003402304650001802338650001402356650002202370650002102392650000902413650001302422700001802435700001302453700002302466700001702489700001702506773009602523856008302619852000902702655001202711IND60082651920221119214805.0141101e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008265192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jangwoo10aSDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling mediates digit tip regeneration promoted by BMP-2  ap. 98-109.  aPreviously we demonstrated that BMP signaling is required for endogenous digit tip regeneration, and that treatment with BMP-2 or -7 induces a regenerative response following amputation at regeneration-incompetent levels (Yu et al., 2010, 2012). Both endogenous regeneration and BMP-induced regeneration are associated with the transient formation of a blastema, however the formation of a regeneration blastema in mammals is poorly understood. In this study, we focus on how blastema cells respond to BMP signaling during neonatal digit regeneration in mice. First, we show that blastema cells retain regenerative properties after expansion in vitro, and when re-introduced into the amputated digit, these cells display directed migration in response to BMP-2. However, in vitro studies demonstrate that BMP-2 alone does not influence blastema cell migration, suggesting a requirement of another pivotal downstream factor for cell recruitment. We show that blastema cell migration is stimulated by the cytokine, SDF-1α, and that SDF-1α is expressed by the wound epidermis as well as endothelial cells of the blastema. Blastema cells express both SDF-1α receptors, CXCR4 and CXCR7, although the migration response is inhibited by the CXCR4-specific antagonist, AMD3100. Mice treated with AMD3100 display a partial inhibition of skeletal regrowth associated with the regeneration response. We provide evidence that BMP-2 regulates Sdf-1α expression in endothelial cells but not cells of the wound epidermis. Finally, we show that SDF-1α-expressing COS1 cells engrafted into a regeneration-incompetent digit amputation wound resulted in a locally enhanced population of CXCR4 positive cells, and induced a partial regenerative response. Taken together, this study provides evidence that one downstream mechanism of BMP signaling during mammalian digit regeneration involves activation of SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling by endothelial cells to recruit blastema cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCXCR4 receptor 3aamputation 3aantagonists 3aatypical chemokine receptor 3 3acell movement 3acytokines 3aendothelial cells 3ain vitro studies 3amice 3aregrowth1 aMarrero, Luis1 aYu, Ling1 aDawson, Lindsay A.1 aMuneoka, Ken1 aHan, Manjong0 tDevelopmental biology.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 382, no. 1 p.98-109dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02065naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009700164300001800261520105200279592002801331650001701359650002601376650001201402650001601414650001301430651001001443700001201453700001501465700001501480700001601495700001601511700001701527773010201544856004801646852000901694655001201703IND50090147720221120171640.0140612e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009014772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-014-0359-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Chunlin10aFlabellariopteris, a new aquatic fern leaf from the Late Triassic of western Liaoning, China  ap. 2410-2418.  aAn aquatic fern leaf, Flabellariopteris mii Sun gen. et sp. nov. from the Late Triassic of Western Liaoning, China, is described and proposed as the type species of the new morphortaxon of the Marsileaceae. The fossil leaves are preserved as impression. No fertile and rhizomatic materials are found. The leaves attached at a common point on the top of the petiole are composed of two leaflets joined basally in an opposite arrangement. The petiole is slender. The leaflet is fan-shaped or semi-circular, and commonly divided into four wedge-shaped lobes. Terminal margin of lobes is usually incised, incisions shallow or deep, with bluntly rounded or notched apex. The veins are conspicuously dichotomous, but anastomoses and marginal vein are absent. The unique morphological features, including two-parted thin leaflets, size, shape, veins and slender petiole, indicate that the present specimen represents an aquatic fern, which is the oldest fossil record and the first megafossil evidence assignable to Marsileaceae from the Triassic floras.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarsileaceae 3aferns and fern allies 3afossils 3anew species 3apetioles 3aChina1 aLi, Tao1 aNa, Yuling1 aWu, Wenhao1 aLi, Yunfeng1 aWang, Lixia1 aZhang, Lijun0 tChinese science bulletin.g2014 July, v. 59, no. 20 p.2410-2418dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-014-0359-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03942naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012300165520219700288592002802485650003602513650001502549650003002564650002002594650001202614650001002626650002702636650001602663650001502679650001102694650001602705650001902721650001502740650002002755650002802775650001302803650001902816650001002835650001702845650001702862650001502879650001002894651001002904653003002914653002002944653001602964653003902980653002703019700005603046700001503102700001803117700001703135773010503152856008603257852000903343655001203352IND60649624620221118060618.0200228e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064962462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.1239212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Hai10aVariation in depth of water uptake for Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica along a precipitation gradient in sandy regions  aMongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) has been widely used in vegetation restoration and for windbreaks in sandy regions of northern China where water is the principal factor limiting tree survival and growth. An understanding of water use in Mongolian pine plantations is critical for effective vegetation restoration. To determine water sources in a Mongolian pine plantation, we investigated the stable isotopic ratios of δ¹⁸O and δD in precipitation, groundwater, in soil water in different soil layers, and in tree xylem at different tree ages along a precipitation gradient and in different micro-landforms. The results indicated that the main water sources for Mongolian pine were precipitation-derived shallow soil water in semi-humid regions and that the contribution proportion decreased with an increase in tree age. With reduced precipitation in semi-arid and arid regions, contribution of deep soil water to Mongolian pine water use gradually increased, and differences in soil water contribution among trees due to tree age also significantly increased. Water use patterns in trees planted in different micro-landforms (e.g. sand dune crest or inter-dune lowland) became more distinct as precipitation gradually decreased across humid to semiarid and arid regions. Moreover, Mongolian pine, including 15-, 20-, 25-, and 45-year-old trees, similar height and DBH without groundwater in semi-arid climate (in Ejin Horo banner), while trees planted in extremely arid climate (Linze) relied on irrigation for survival despite abundant and available groundwater at that study site. These results indicated that groundwater may be beyond reach to be a main water source for Mongolian pine trees. Soil water conditions determined the survival and sustainable growth of planted trees, especially at depths less than 1 m where soil layers were recharged mainly by precipitation. Although Mongolian pine exhibits strong ecological adaptability, a trait that makes it ideally-suited for controlling desertification in sandy regions of northern China, water stress, crown dieback, or even tree mortality are likely to occur under conditions of extremely low precipitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris var. mongolica 3aarid zones 3aatmospheric precipitation 3adesertification 3adieback 3adunes 3aecological restoration 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3aoxygen 3aplantations 3asemiarid zones 3asoil water 3astable isotopes 3asustainable development 3atree age 3atree mortality 3atrees 3awater stress 3awater uptake 3awindbreaks 3axylem 3aChina 0aMongolian pine plantation 0aStable isotopes 0aSandy soils 0aAsian summer monsoon precipitation 0aWater extraction depth1 aZhao, Wenzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5145-22831 aHe, Zhibin1 aYan, Jialiang1 aZhang, Gefei0 tJournal of hydrology.g2019 Oct., v. 577 p.123921-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.1239213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011700164300001800281520118100299536028801480592002801768596011901796596011301915596010302028650002102131650001202152650002202164650002102186650001802207650002002225650001502245650001502260650001802275650001502293650000902308650000702317650001802324653002102342653001902363653002602382653002002408653001902428700001902447700001602466700001102482700001402493700001802507773012002525856008502645852000902730655001202739IND60595862620221119172558.0180608e20180418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059586262DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2017.13194222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yang10aInfluence of calcium compounds as a compression framework on activated sludge dewaterability and calorific value  ap. 1025-1031.  aCalcium compounds have been known to be important for enhancing aggregation and dewaterability of activated sludge. In this study, the effect of calcium compounds (CaO, Ca(OH)₂, CaCl₂, CaSO₄ and CaCO₃, respectively) on sludge dewaterability and calorific value was investigated. Upon addition of CaO, Ca(OH)₂, CaCl₂, CaSO₄ and CaCO₃ (112 mg/g dry sludge) into activated sludge, after compressed filtration the moisture content of sludge was found to be 49.7%, 55.7%, 57.1%, 65.3% and 56.5%, respectively. The addition of calcium compounds altered the structure of sludge by CaCO₃ and Ca(OH)₂ production, which improved sludge filterability and provided frameworks and water passages during compression. Furthermore, sludge conditioned by CaO addition had better dewaterability than other calcium compounds. The heat generated from the CaO hydration and high pH might damage flocs’ structure and improve dewaterability of sludge. Moreover, it was found that excess addition of calcium compounds led to low calorific value in combustion process. The study concluded that CaO is the optimal additive for sludge further dewatering by compressed filtration.  aThis work was financially supported by Major Science and Technology Projects of Shandong Province [Grant No. 2015ZDXX0402B01], the Key Programs of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [Grant No. ZDRW-ZS-2016–5] and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, DICP [Grant No. DICP ZZBS201614].  aPublisher supplied data  a2015ZDXX0402B01cMajor Science and Technology Projects of Shandong Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004295  aZDRW-ZS-2016–5cthe Key Programs of the Chinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005151  aDICP ZZBS201614cDalian Institute of Chemical Physics, DICPdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002979 3aactivated sludge 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3acalcium chloride 3acalcium oxide 3acalcium sulfate 3acombustion 3adewatering 3afilterability 3afiltration 3aheat 3apH 3awater content 0aActivated sludge 0adewaterability 0acompressed filtration 0acalorific value 0acombustion gas1 aWei, Huangzhao1 aYu, Yonghui1 aYu, Li1 aWang, Sen1 aSun, Chenglin0 tEnvironmental technology.g2018 Apr. 18, v. 39, no. 8 p.1025-1031dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2017.13194223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245016000162300001800322500002000340520142300360592002801783650002501811650001801836650001701854650002101871650002001892650001801912650001301930650000701943650002301950650001401973650001401987650001102001700002002012700002002032700002002052700002202072700005602094700001802150773014802168856007402316852000902390655001202399IND60589215420221119004337.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058921542DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.85922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiocinovic, Jelena10aApplication of new insoluble dietary fibres from triticale as supplement in yoghurt – effects on physico‐chemical, rheological and quality properties  ap. 1291-1299.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The need to increase the daily intake of dietary fibres opens a new chapter in the research of functional foods enriched with fibres. The potential application of an innovative product – insoluble dietary fibres from triticale in yoghurts – was deployed by characterising their food application and evaluating physico‐chemical, rheological and sensory properties and was the aim of this research. RESULTS: Detailed characterisations of these fibres are presented for the first time and showed very good hydration properties, optimal pH (slightly acidic), optimal chemical composition, high antioxidant capacity which was proven by phenolics contents. Besides, these fibres showed negligible calorific value, with no phytates and high antioxidant capacity, mainly from ferulic acid. Therefore they could be successfully added to yoghurt. Enrichment of yoghurt having different milk fat content (1.5 and 2.8% w/w) with triticale insoluble fibre (1.5% and 3.0% w/w) significantly influenced the syneresis level, its apparent viscosity, yield stress and thixotropic behaviour. The overall sensory quality scores indicated that yoghurt enriched with 1.5% triticale insoluble fibres was recognised as ‘excellent’ and had enhanced antioxidant activity. CONCLUSIONS: Insoluble triticale fibre could therefore be used as a supplement to produce functional yoghurt. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3adietary fiber 3aferulic acid 3afunctional foods 3ainsoluble fiber 3alipid content 3amilk fat 3apH 3asensory properties 3atriticale 3aviscosity 3ayogurt1 aTomić, Nikola,1 aDojnov, Biljana1 aTomasevic, Igor1 aStojanovic, Sanja1 aDjekic, Ilija1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8132-82991 aVujcic, Zoran0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Mar., v. 98, no. 4 p.1291-1299dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.85923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04303naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015800160520263600318592002802954650000902982650002802991650001003019650001503029650002103044650001203065650000903077650001703086650002003103650001803123650001903141650002103160650001203181651001603193651002003209700002303229700002003252700002103272700002203293700001903315700002203334700002303356700002403379700002303403700002403426700002103450700002303471700002703494700002203521773012203543856007503665852000903740655001203749IND60769785520221121165137.0220310e20220303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076978552DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140510672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahbah, Wael A.12aA Survey to Identify the Current Management of Cow’s Milk Disorders and the Role of Goat Milk-Based Formulas in the Middle East and North Africa Region  aBackground: Cow’s milk allergy (CMA) and cow’s milk intolerance (CMI) are the major cow’s milk disorders observed in infants and young children. This study investigates, for the first time, physician knowledge regarding CMA and CMI prevalence, diagnosis, and management in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. In addition, we explore the role of goat milk-based formula as an alternative in infants suffering from CMI. Method: This cross-sectional survey was conducted from December 2020 to February 2021. A convenience sample of 2500 MENA-based physicians received the questionnaire, developed by a working group of pediatric experts. Results: 1868 physicians completed the questionnaire, including pediatric specialists (80.8%), training physicians (0.2%), dermatologists (0.1%), family/general physicians (12.9%), neonatologists (3.6%), neurosurgeons (0.2%), allergy nurse specialists (0.3%), pharmacists (2.1%), and public health workers (0.1%). Differentiation between CMA and CMI was recognized by the majority of respondents (80.7%), for which the majority of respondents (35.4%) identified that the elimination and challenge test was the best test to differentiate CMA from CMI, whereas 30.7% and 5.4% preferred the immunoglobulin E (IgE) test and skin prick test, respectively. In addition, 28.5% of respondents reported that there is no confirmatory test to differentiate CMA from CMI. The majority of respondents (47.3%) reported that amino acid-based formula (AAF)/ extensively hydrolyzed formula (EHF) is the cornerstone for the management of CMA. However, most respondents (33.7%) reported that lactose avoidance was best for the management of CMI. Overall, 65% of the respondents were aware of nutritionally adapted goat’s milk formula as an alternative to cow’s milk products and 37% would recommend its routine use in infants (≤2 years of age). Conclusion: The results of this survey demonstrate that the majority of physicians are aware of the underlying pathophysiology and management of CMA and CMI. However, a significant proportion of physicians do not follow the clinical guidelines concerning CMA/CMI diagnosis and management. Notably, this survey identified that goat’s milk formulas may offer a suitable alternative to AAF/EHF in infants with CMI as they contain β-casein protein which is easily digestible. In addition, goat’s milk formulas contain higher levels of oligosaccharides and medium-chained fatty acids compared with standard cow’s milk formulas, yet further clinical trials are warranted to support the inclusion of goat’s milk formulas in clinical guidelines.  aPublisher supplied data 3acows 3across-sectional studies 3agoats 3ahydrolysis 3aimmunoglobulin E 3alactose 3amilk 3amilk allergy 3apathophysiology 3apublic health 3aquestionnaires 3askin prick tests 3asurveys 3aMiddle East 3aNorthern Africa1 aElHodhod, Mostafa 1 aSalah, Mohamed 1 aAlRefaee, Fawaz 1 aAlTuraiki, Muath 1 aMousa, Samira 1 aAl Mehaidib, Ali 1 aAyesh, Wafaa Helmi1 aEl-Bazzar, Ahmed N.1 aEl Haddad, Joseph 1 aEl Khashab, Heba Y.1 aEl Zawahry, Amr 1 aHasosah, Mohammed 1 aShaaban, Sanaa Youssef1 aVandenplas, Yvan 0 tNutrients.g2022 Mar. 03, v. 14, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140510673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01807naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245007400166300001600240520083300256592002801089650001801117650001101135650000901146650001301155650001401168650002901182650002601211650001101237700002001248773012501268856007901393852000901472655001201481IND60302177120221121220519.0150704e20140221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030217712DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12490462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPayne, Joshua L.14aThe Robustness and Evolvability of Transcription Factor Binding Sites  ap. 875-877.  aRobust to Change The variation in genetic sequences determining the binding of transcription factors is believed to be an important facet of evolution. However, the degree to which a genome is robust, that is, able to withstand changes and how robustness affects evolution is unclear. Payne and Wagner (p. 875) investigated the empirical support for mutational robustness by examining transcription factor (TF) binding in the mouse and yeast genomes. A network analysis of the degree of variation revealed that the sites with the highest affinity for TF binding exhibit the greatest tolerance for nucleotide substitutions, whereas low-affinity sites exhibit greater sensitivity to mutation. Thus, while mutational robustness and evolvability are antagonistic at the genotypic level, they are synergistic at the phenotypic level.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3agenome 3amice 3amutation 3aphenotype 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3ayeasts1 aWagner, Andreas0 tScience.g2014 Feb. 21, v. 343, no. 6173 p.875-877dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12490463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245013200178520117500310592002801485650001401513650002601527650001401553650002901567650002601596650001701622650001501639650003701654650001601691650002001707650001401727650001701741650001701758653002701775653001501802653003401817653002701851700002401878700003401902700003601936700003001972700002802002700002902030700004302059700003102102700003602133773010302169856008602272852000902358655001202367IND60683633820221122042326.0200427e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068363382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1040342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenezes-Silva, Suellen10aModulation of drug resistance in Staphylococcus aureus by 132-hydroxy-(132-R/S)-pheophytin isolated from Sargassum polyceratium  aEfflux pumps are integral parts of the bacterial plasma membrane that are responsible for many cases of antibiotic resistance. Modulators of drug resistance are regarded as the most suitable new antibacterial therapies. We evaluated the extracts of Sargassum polyceratium and the isolated compound pheophytin (Sp-1) for antibiotic modifying activity in strains of Staphylococcus aureus with efflux pump. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for norfloxacin, tetracycline and erythromycin were determined by the microdilution broth method, in the absence and presence of the extract at a sub-inhibitory concentration (MIC/4). The extracts and isolated compounds showed no significant antimicrobial activity, but they changed the antibiotic activity, decreasing bacterial resistance by 2 to 4x. Using a checkerboard method, it was also possible to observe the synergistic effect (ΣFIC ≤ 0.5) between Sp-1 and the antibiotics erythromycin and norfloxacin. The results indicate that the seaweed Sargassum polyceratium and pheophytin are potential sources of an antibiotic adjuvant that modulates bacterial resistance, acting as a putative efflux pump inhibitor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSargassum 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadjuvants 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aerythromycin 3amacroalgae 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anorfloxacin 3aplasma membrane 3asynergism 3atetracycline 3atransporters 0aSargassum polyceratium 0aPheophytin 0aModulation of drug resistance 0aEfflux pump inhibition1 aLira, Narlize Silva1 aMangueira do Nascimento, Yuri1 aAraújo Ramos Meireles, Roseana1 ada Silva Dias, Celidarque1 aTavares, Josean Fechine1 aSobral da Silva, Marcelo1 aCavalcanti de Miranda, George Emmanuel1 aBarbosa Filho, José Maria1 aPinto de Siqueira-Junior, José0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2020 Apr., v. 141 p.104034-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1040343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245010000167300002000267520134700287592002801634650002701662650002301689650002301712650001101735650002801746650001301774650001601787650001101803700002501814700002901839773013601868856007402004852000902078655001202087IND60659615820221123005623.0190823e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065961582DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc33920j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez Rivas, David10aMerging microfluidics and sonochemistry: towards greener and more efficient micro-sono-reactors  ap. 10935-10947.  aMicrofluidics enable the manipulation of chemical reactions using very small amounts of fluid, in channels with dimensions of tens to hundreds of micrometers; so-called microstructured devices, from which the iconic image of chips emerges. The immediate attraction of microfluidics lies in its greenness: use of small quantities of reagents and solvents, and hence less waste, a precise control of reaction conditions, integration of functionality for process intensification, safer and often faster protocols, reliable scale-up, and possibility of performing multiphase reactions. Among the limitations found in microfluidics the facile formation of precipitating products should be highlighted, and in this context, the search for efficient mass and energy transfers is a must. Such limitations have been partially overcome with the aid of ultrasound in conventional flow systems, and can now be successfully used in microreactors, which provide new capabilities. Novel applications and a better understanding of the physical and chemical aspects of sonochemistry can certainly be achieved by combining microfluidics and ultrasound.

We here show that transcriptional inhibitors α-amanitin and actinomycin D specifically disrupt the symmetry and orientation of these two proteloblast cell divisions while having no apparent effect on the timing or geometry of other divisions. Transcriptional inhibition had a similar effect on both proteloblasts, i.e. cytokinesis was highly asymmetric and the cleavage plane roughly orthogonal to that seen during normal development. These findings suggest that zygotic gene product(s) are required, either directly or indirectly, for the correct placement of the proteloblast cleavage furrow. The same phenotypes were also observed following in vivo expression of dominant-negative Pax gene constructs. These dominant-negative phenotypes depended on protein/DNA interaction, and could be rescued by coexpression of full length Pax proteins. However, symmetric cleavage of the mesodermal proteloblast was rescued by full length constructs of either Hau-Paxβ1 or Hau-Pax2/5/8, while only Hau-Paxβ1 rescued the symmetry of ectodermal cleavage. We conclude that both proteloblasts need Pax-mediated transcription to adopt their normally symmetric cleavage patterns, but differ in terms of the specific Pax proteins required. The implication of these findings for the evolution of spiral cleavage is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aactinomycin D 3aadults 3aalpha-amanitin 3acytokinesis 3aevolution 3agenes 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3atranscription (genetics)1 aNull, Ryan W.1 aShankland, Marty0 tDevelopmental biology.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 382, no. 1 p.149-159dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02108naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245019400168300001600362520085500378592002801233650001301261650001301274650001601287650001001303650001001313650001601323650001101339650001401350651002201364653001201386653001501398653001301413653001501426653001901441700001601460700001901476773011201495856008201607852000901689655001201698IND60126451720221117003118.0151107e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012645172DNAL7 a10.1163/193724012X6402812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConradi, Mercedes13aAn Unexpected Parasitic Relationship Between a new Species of Anthessius (Copepoda: Cyclopoida) and a Decapod Crustacean, Alpheus macrocheles (Hailstone, 1835) from the NW Mediterranean Sea  ap. 860-870.  aWe describe from the NW Mediterranean Sea a new copepod species of Anthessiidae, Anthessius alpheusicolous, found in association with the snapping shrimp Alpheus macrocheles (Hailstone, 1835). The new species is differentiated from its 40 congeners by the formula of the third segment of the fourth exopod, the number and morphology of the terminal claws on the antenna, the armature of the mandible, and the length of leg 5. A key to the 41 species currently included in Anthessius is presented. The relationship between A. alpheusicolous and its decapod host likely arose through host switching, and the known symbiotic relationships between the species of Anthessius and their respective hosts are reviewed within this frame. Additionally, the synonymy between A. projectus Kim, 1993 and A. kimjensis Suh, 1993 is here reported for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3aDecapoda 3aMacrocheles 3aclaws 3ahosts 3anew species 3ashrimp 3asymbiosis 3aMediterranean Sea 0aAlpheus 0aAnthessius 0aCopepoda 0aCyclopoida 0ahost-switching1 aMarin, Ivan1 aMartin, Daniel0 tJournal of crustacean biology.g2012 Sept., v. 32, no. 5 p.860-870dThe Crustacean Societyx0278-03727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163%2F193724012X6402813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04024naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024004000134024002500174024004100199024002300240040001800263100002900281245012400310520196600434592002802400650001002428650002302438650001302461650000902474650001302483650002502496650002102521650001002542650001502552650001302567650001502580650002402595650001102619650001102630650002402641650001102665651002202676653002102698653001602719653002202735653002202757653001702779700002402796700006202820700002102882700001902903700002202922700002602944700002502970700001502995700001703010773011203027856008703139856011403226961001303340852000903353655001203362IND60761614320221214230228.0220207e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076161432DNAL7 a3815702aris7 a10113/76161432hdl7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2021.1047042doi7 a4355642aris_accn_no7 a3050-11210-009-000D2aris_project_no7 a3815702seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyamuryekung'e, Shelemia10aMovement, activity, and landscape use patterns of heritage and commercial beef cows grazing Chihuahuan Desert rangeland  aThe objective of this study was to compare foraging behavior of mature Raramuri Criollo (RC, heritage breed) and Angus Hereford crossbred (AH, commercial breed) cows grazing Chihuahuan Desert rangeland during summer and winter in three consecutive years. Movement, activity, and spatial distribution variables were calculated from 10-min interval GPS positions of 5–11 randomly selected cows of each breed. Thirteen pasture pixel attributes were used to analyze grazing utilization and selection patterns of both breeds. Statistical mixed models were used to determine the effects of breed and season on all foraging response variables. Spatial regression analysis was used to examine resource utilization. Compared to AH, RC cows traveled farther at higher velocity rates, spent less time resting, more time grazing and traveling, explored larger areas as individuals, and exhibited lower herd cohesion. The RC herd explored more grazing patches (30-m pixel) overall and exhibited lower patch residence times in winter, a foraging strategy linked with lighter environmental footprint. During summer, similar pixel variables explained re-visitation rates of cows of both breeds. Both breeds avoided areas far from water, but RC cows showed higher avoidance of pixels farther out from a drinker during the dormant season. RC cows appeared to exhibit a keener ability to select patches with differing surface temperature, and greenness compared to AH counterparts. RC cows showed higher preference for pixels with high shrub density than AH counterparts in summer. During the dormant season, AH cows exhibited a strong preference for black grama patches, a species with high ecological value, and higher avoidance of patches with high density of other grasses. Differences in foraging behavior documented in this study support the hypothesis that RC cattle could impose a lighter footprint on desert rangeland relative to commonly raised commercial beef cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngus 3aBouteloua eriopoda 3aHereford 3abeef 3acohesion 3aecological footprint 3aecological value 3aherds 3alandscapes 3apastures 3arangelands 3aregression analysis 3ashrubs 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3awinter 3aChihuahuan Desert 0aRaramuri Criollo 0aBeef cattle 0aForaging behavior 0aHabitat selection 0aGPS tracking1 aCibils, Andrés F.,1 aEstell, Richard E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3469-47121 aVanLeeuwen, Dawn1 aSpiegal, Sheri1 aSteele, Caitriana1 aGonzález, Alfredo L.1 aMcIntosh, Matthew M.1 aGong, Qixu1 aCao, Huiping0 tJournal of arid environments.g2022 Apr., v. 199 p.104704-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2021.1047043Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/76161433Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245006800156300001600224500001900240500002000259520148700279592002801766596028301794596005802077650001402135650001302149650001002162650000902172650001402181650002402195650002002219650001402239650001602253650001202269700001602281700001602297700001502313700001602328700001502344700001502359700005702374773012502431856007402556852000902630655001202639IND60712166820221123045304.0201009e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071216682DNAL7 a10.1111/jtxs.125402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kexin10aLow‐temperature steaming improves eating quality of whitefish  ap. 830-840.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, effects of different steaming conditions (temperature–time scales) on quality characteristics of cooked whitefish (Coregonus peled) were characterized to guide product development. Investigation of three cooking conditions, including 60°C (3–20 min) 80°C (1–12 min) and 100°C (1–6 min) indicated that properties including textural properties, cooking loss, color change, water holding capacity (WHC), and protein content were all significantly correlated to the cooking condition. It was observed that the color changes of fish meat, especially the brightness L* were strongly correlated to the relative extraction rate (RER) of myofibrillar proteins (MFPs), which could be considered as a marker for the doneness of the cooked whitefish. Our results indicated that during the steaming process, the water holding capacity of the fish continued to decline, and the cooking loss continued to increase. However, a sudden jump in cooking loss occurred when the fish sample became overcooked. To minimize cooking loss, a good control of the doneness hence is needed to avoid overcooking. Moreover, results of this study demonstrated that low‐temperature steaming could better maintain the springiness and cohesiveness of the fish as the myofibrillar proteins experienced less sudden swelling and shrinkage. Hence, low temperature steaming should be the preferred method for whitefish processing to minimize the negative impact on fish sensory qualities.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017B01004‐4cthe Key Technologies for Processing and Quality Improvement of Cold Water Fish, Integration and Demonstration of Key industrial Technology for Cold Water Fish in Xinjiang Autonomous Region, Major Research & Development Program of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region  a2019YFD0902000cthe National Key R&D Program of China 3aCoregonus 3acohesion 3acolor 3afish 3afish meat 3aproduct development 3aprotein content 3ashrinkage 3atemperature 3atexture1 aLin, Xiaoyu1 aZhao, Wenyu1 aFan, Xinru1 aYu, Wanying1 aMa, Zhuang1 aYu, Chenxu1 aDong, Xiuping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5675-89320 tJournal of texture studies.g2020 Oct., v. 51, no. 5 p.830-840dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl372x0022-49017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jtxs.125403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011100158300001600269500001900285500002000304520136900324592002801693596009601721650001501817650002201832650001801854650001601872650001101888650001501899650001601914650001201930650001401942700002501956700006001981773012502041856007402166852000902240655001202249IND60712166920221123045351.0201009e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071216692DNAL7 a10.1111/jtxs.125372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇavdir, Esra10aModeling and analyzing rheological behavior of sour lemon juice concentrate using image processing methods  ap. 789-799.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, temperature‐concentration related rheological behavior of sour lemon juice concentrate (SLJC) were investigated. Lemons were squeezed, and lemon juices were obtained. SLJC samples were produced by two methods: atmospheric and vacuum conditions. The rheological properties of SLJC at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50°C for each 31, 36, 41, 46, 51 °Bx were measured with rheometer. Firstly, it was determined that the SLJC showed Newtonian flow behavior at measured concentrations and temperatures. Then, viscosity of SLJC produced under vacuum conditions was determined higher than SLJC produced under atmospheric conditions. This difference was calculated statistically significant (p < .05). Furthermore, activation energy values of samples produced under atmospheric and vacuum conditions ranged between 13.6–24.0 kJ/mol and 9.0–17.9 kJ/mol, respectively. Finally, temperature‐concentration dependent viscosity variations were modeled by surface equations, and the data predicted were transformed into images to provide visual analysis. It was determined by images that the viscosity change is proportional to concentration while inversely proportional to temperature. Ascorbic acid value was found higher under vacuum conditions than atmospheric conditions. In contrast, the HMF value was detected in low quantities under vacuum conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aOKUBAP‐2018‐PT3‐020cOsmaniye Korkut Ata University Scientific Research Projects Unit 3aacid value 3aactivation energy 3aascorbic acid 3alemon juice 3alemons 3arheometers 3atemperature 3atexture 3aviscosity1 aAkben, Selahaddin B.1 aBozdoğan, Adnan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3612-58980 tJournal of texture studies.g2020 Oct., v. 51, no. 5 p.789-799dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl372x0022-49017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jtxs.125373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01782naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245007100213300001600284520066600300592002800966650002500994650003201019650001601051650001901067650002001086650001001106650002401116650002901140700002501169773011301194856008101307990002301388852000901411655001201420IND60094180520221122070012.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009418052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gde.2011.01.0112doi7 aPMC30708422pmcid7 a213162152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalbraith, Matthew D10aLessons on transcriptional control from the serum response network  ap. 160-166.  aResponse to environmental stimuli is critical for cell survival and function and requires high fidelity signal transduction into the nucleus to facilitate the coordinated transcriptional regulation of appropriate gene networks.

Triconia constricta belongs to the dentipes-subgroup of Triconia characterized by the absence of integumental pockets on the anterior surface of the labrum. It is distinguished from the closely related species of this subgroup, T. dentipes (Giesbrecht, 1891), T. elongata Böttger-Schnack, 1999, and T. giesbrechti Böttger-Schnack, 1999, by the following combination of morphological features in females: 1) lateral margins of genital double-somite in dorsal view slightly constricted at midlength; 2) P5 with very long outer basal seta, reaching beyond paired secretory pores on posterior part of genital double-somite, as well as distinctive length ratios of exopodal setae; in both sexes; 3) length ratios of caudal setae, and 4) relative spine lengths on distal endopodal segments of swimming legs 2 to 4. Triconia pararedacta is a member of the conifera-subgroup characterized by a dorsal projection on the second pedigerous somite in the female. It differs from females of other species of this subgroup in the following: 1) very small-sized dorsal projection on second pedigerous somite, 2) different length to width ratio of P5 exopod, 3) relative lengths of outer basal seta and exopodal setae of P5, and 4) different length ratio of outer distal spine to distal spine on endopods of P2–P4. Additional character states are proposed for defining the dentipes-subgroup within Triconia and for recognizing three sets of species within the conifera-subgroup.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3afemales 3alegs 3anew species 3aswimming 3aEast China Sea 0aCopepoda 0aOncaeidae 0aTriconia1 aBöttger-Schnack, Ruth1 aSoh, Ho Young0 tJournal of crustacean biology.g2012 Sept., v. 32, no. 5 p.843-859dThe Crustacean Societyx0278-03727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163%2F193724012X6506593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01684naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245005900207300001600266520066600282592002800948650002000976650003100996650001001027650001301037650002901050700002101079700002001100773011301120856008101233990002301314852000901337655001201346IND60094180620221122070130.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009418062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gde.2011.01.0232doi7 aPMC40413332pmcid7 a213456652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeister, Peter10aLocking the genome: nuclear organization and cell fate  ap. 167-174.  aThe differentiation of pluripotent or totipotent cells into various differentiated cell types is accompanied by a restriction of gene expression patterns, alteration in histone and DNA methylation, and changes in the gross nuclear organization of eu- and heterochromatic domains. Several recent studies have coupled genome-wide mapping of histone modifications with changes in gene expression. Other studies have examined changes in the subnuclear positioning of tissue-specific genes upon transcriptional induction or repression. Here we summarize intriguing correlations of the three phenomena, which suggest that in some cases causal relationships may exist.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahistones 3atranscription (genetics)1 aMango, Susan E.,1 aGasser, Susan M0 tCurrent Opinion in Genetics & Development.g2011 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.167-174dElsevier Ltdx0959-437X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gde.2011.01.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245022000171300001400391520145500405592002801860650001501888650001001903650001601913650002001929650002101949650001701970650003901987650000902026650001302035650000702048650001502055650001702070650001202087650003702099653001402136653001602150653002202166653001402188653002502202700002002227700006402247773011202311856008602423852000902509655001202518IND60610773420221119170206.0201125e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061077342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.07.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartwal, Gaurav12aA highly selective pH switchable colorimetric fluorescent rhodamine functionalized azo-phenol derivative for thorium recognition up to nano molar level in semi-aqueous media: Implication towards multiple logic gates  ap. 51-61.  aA new rhodamine functionalized Schiff base (3′,6′-bis(diethylamino)-2-((Z)-(5-((E)-(1,5-dimethyl-3-oxo-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)diazenyl)-2,4-dihydroxybenzylidene) amino)spiro[isoindoline-1,9′-xanthen]-3-one (1) has been synthesized and was characterized spectroscopically. The optical properties of the schiff base have been studied using UV–vis and fluorescence spectra. Schiff base 1 displayed a selective behaviour towards Th⁴⁺ ions, as evidenced by UV–vis and fluorescence spectra. It shows visible colour change from orangish-yellow to red upon addition of Th⁴⁺ ions. A strong new emission band at 586 nm and about 24-fold enhancement in fluorescence intensity was observed upon binding with Th⁴⁺ which could be quenched by subsequent addition of oxalate and chromate ions. Probe 1 also acts as a reversible pH sensor in the highly acidic region (pH < 4, pKₐ ₌ 2.01) via the photophysical response to pH as well as visible detectable colour change from orangish-yellow to red to pink. The absorbance and emission intensities of 1 diminished in the pH region from 4 to 11.5 and could be recovered by adding acid to adjust the pH < 4. Probe 1 exhibited high binding constant (8.595 × 10⁶ M⁻¹) and low limit of detection (1.122 × 10⁻⁹) compared to most previously reported sensors for Th⁴⁺ ions. Furthermore, two multiple logic gates i.e. 3 and 5 input, have been constructed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3aemissions factor 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aions 3aoxalates 3apH 3arhodamines 3aschiff bases 3athorium 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aRhodamine 0aSchiff base 0aThorium detection 0apH sensor 0aMultiple logic gates1 aAggarwal, Komal1 aKhurana, Jitender M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0433-96530 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 360 p.51-61dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.07.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245006600178300001600244500000900260520132500269592002801594650002201622650000901644650001101653650002301664650003101687650002401718650000901742650001801751700001801769700001901787773014801806856009601954852000902050655001202059IND60667884520221119005101.0191125e198007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066788452DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1980.03615995004400040016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, K.

Oxygen consumption rates were measured after introduction of a known amount of oxygen into a reduced (anaerobic) soil system and following the disappearance of oxygen as a function of time. The time dependence of oxygen consumption in all flooded soils could be described as a two-phase first order reaction process. Rapid oxygen consumption during Phase I was followed by relatively slower consumption during Phase II. The first-order rate coefficient (k₁, hour⁻¹) for Phase I was approximately the same for all 37 soils evaluated, whereas each soil was characterized by a different rate coefficient (k₁₁, hour⁻¹) for Phase II. The average value for k₁ was 0.15 hour⁻¹ (coefficient of variation = 20%) while the values of k₁₁ ranged from 0.0027 to 0.054 hour⁻¹. Step-wise regression analysis of the data showed that NaOAc-extractable Fe of a reduced soil was the single best predictor of k₁₁ and also the fractional consumption associated with Phase I. Significant improvement in these regressions was obtained when total NH₄-N content of the reduced soil, in addition to reducible Fe²⁺ was considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3airon 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3aphysicochemical properties 3aregression analysis 3asoil 3asoil sampling1 aRao, P.

We evaluated K(θ) for a Walla Walla silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haploxeroll) using two field methods and the Mualem–van Genuchten model (MVG). Field methods were the internal drainage method (ID) and the Klaij and Vachaud method (MKV), which was modified to include hydraulic head (H), and used 20 yr of data from a dryland field experiment. Four approaches to estimate WRC were compared for the MKV, and two approaches to estimate parameters of the MVG. For water contents >0.20 m³ m⁻³, the MKV gave K values that were two orders of magnitude less than those obtained from internal drainage experiments conducted under wetter conditions. When MVG parameters were predicted by the Rosetta model, which uses pedotransfer functions, K values approached those of the MVK. However, when model parameters were estimated from internal drainage and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K ₛₐₜ) data, K(θ) values were closer to those of the internal drainage experiments. The study reaffirms the difficulty of reconciling K(θ) determined by different methodologies, and of extrapolating to values of θ outside those measured. It also demonstrates the sensitivity of the MVG and pedotransfer functions to different sources of input values. Advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches to determining K(θ) are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaploxerolls 3aarid lands 3afield experimentation 3afield methods 3ainternal drainage 3amodels 3apedotransfer functions 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asilt loam soils 3atexture 3aunsaturated hydraulic conductivity1 aPayne, W.

One of the major consequences of the antibiotics discharge into the environment could be the prevalence of a bacterial resistance to antibiotic. In this review, four groups of antibiotics (Tetracyclines, Fluoroquinolones, Macrolides and Sulfonamides) were focused for the background on their wide spread occurrence in sludge and manure and for their effects on several target and non-target species. The antibiotics concentrations range between 1 and 136,000 μg kg−1 of dry matter in sludge and manure, representing a potential risk for the human health and the environment. Composting of sludge or manure is a well-known and used organic matter stabilization technology, which could be effective in reducing the antibiotics levels as well as the antibiotic resistance genes. During sludge or manure composting, the antibiotics removals range between 17–100%. The deduced calculated half-lives range between 1–105 days for most of the studied antibiotics. Nevertheless, these removals are often based on the measurement of concentration without considering the matter removal (lack of matter balance) and very few studies are emphasized on the removal mechanisms (biotic/abiotic, bound residues formation) and the potential presence of more or less hazardous transformation products.The results from the few studies on the fate of the antibiotic resistance genes during sludge or manure composting are still inconsistent showing either decrease or increase of their concentration in the final product.Whether for antibiotic or antibiotic resistance genes, additional researches are needed, gathering chemical, microbiological and toxicological data to better understand the implied removal mechanisms (chemical, physical and biological), the interactions between both components and the environmental matrices (organic, inorganic bearing phases) and how composting process could be optimized to reduce the discharge of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes into the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3acomposting 3afluoroquinolones 3agroundwater 3ahalf life 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amacrolides 3anontarget organisms 3aorganic matter 3arisk 3asediments 3asludge 3asoil 3asulfonamides 3atetracyclines 3aveterinary drugs 3awastewater treatment 0aSludge 0aManure 0aComposting 0aAntibiotics 0aAntibiotic resistance genes1 aHafidi, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6049-83981 aKhadra, Ahmed1 aAemig, Quentin1 aEl Fels, Loubna1 aBarret, Maialen1 aMerlina, Georges1 aPatureau, Dominique1 aPinelli, Eric0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2018 Oct. 05, v. 359 p.465-481dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.07.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245025400169520138200423592002801805650002801833650001701861650001401878650002001892650003701912650001401949650001101963650001301974650002001987650002402007650002302031700002602054700002802080700002002108700002202128700002102150773012202171856007502293852000902368655001202377IND60769786020221121103032.0220310e20220303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076978602DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140510732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopez-Gonzalez, Desiree 10aBody Composition Assessment in Mexican Children and Adolescents. Part 1: Comparisons between Skinfold-Thickness, Dual X-ray Absorptiometry, Air-Displacement Plethysmography, Deuterium Oxide Dilution, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging with the 4-C Model  aThe evaluation of body composition (BC) is relevant in the evaluation of children’s health-disease states. Different methods and devices are used to estimate BC. The availability of methods and the clinical condition of the patient usually defines the ideal approach to be used. In this cross-sectional study, we evaluate the accuracy of different methods to estimate BC in Mexican children and adolescents, using the 4-C model as the reference. In a sample of 288 Mexican children and adolescents, 4-C body composition assessment, skinfold-thickness (SF), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), air displacement plethysmography (ADP), and deuterium dilution (D₂O) were performed, along with MRI in a subsample (52 participants). The analysis of validity was performed by correlation analysis, linear regression, and the Bland–Altman method. All methods analyzed showed strong correlations for FM with 4-C values and between each other; however, DXA and MRI overestimated FM, whereas skinfolds and ADP under-estimated FM. Conclusion: The clinical assessment of BC by means of SF, ADP, DXA, MRI and D₂O correlated well with the 4-C model and between them, providing evidence of their clinical validity and utility. The results from different methods are not interchangeable. Preference between methods may depend on their availability and the specific clinical setting.  aPublisher supplied data 3across-sectional studies 3adensitometry 3adeuterium 3adeuterium oxide 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3amagnetism 3amodels 3apatients 3aplethysmography 3aregression analysis 3askinfold thickness1 aWells, Jonathan C.

Two numerically efficient and accurate solution methods are presented to study the transient dynamic responses of FG shells subjected to either internal or external mechanical shock loading. Employing the displacement-based layerwise theory in conjunction with the Hamilton’s principle, the transversely discretized equations of motion are obtained. The differential quadrature method (DQM) is used to discretize the resulting equations in the axial direction. To solve the developed time-dependent equations, either DQM (named LWDQ) or Newmark’s time integration scheme (named LWDQN) is employed. The material properties are graded continuously in the thickness direction according to a volume fraction power-law distribution. The developed results are successfully compared with those obtained by ANSYS and also with the available results in the literature. The comparisons demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the aforementioned methods on achievement of fast convergence rate with relatively low computational cost. Finally, the effects of different geometric and material parameters on the dynamic behavior of the FG shells are investigated. Due to high accuracy of the method, the results can be used as benchmarks for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amechanical stress 3avibration1 aTahani, M.1 aSelahi, E.0 tComposites.g2012 July, v. 43, no. 5 p.2161-2171dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.02.0313Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03453naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245014900178300001600327520188000343592002802223650001202251650001702263650001102280650003002291650002002321650002002341650001102361650001302372650001102385650001102396650001902407650001202426650001302438650003102451653001302482653002302495653001902518653001402537653003002551700002802581700005702609700006802666773014202734856008602876852000902962655001202971IND60762612620220221000000.0220110e20211224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076261262DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c067562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZapata-Boada, Santiago10aIntegrating Technoeconomic, Environmental, and Safety Criteria in Solvent Screening for Extraction Processes: The Case of Algae Lipid Extraction  ap. 472-485.  aVolatile organic solvents derived from fossil resources are typically used in extraction processes, but this usually involves high energy consumption for solvent recovery and negative environmental impacts due to solvents’ hazardous, volatile, and flammable nature. This study presents a systematic approach to solvent screening, using molecular and process simulation techniques, data analysis, and classification methods applying technoeconomic, environmental, and safety criteria. This methodology is demonstrated for lipid extraction from wet algae biomass in biofuel production. First, relevant thermodynamic equilibrium data are predicted with the Conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS) method. The resulting solvents are clustered according to their partition coefficient and selectivity toward the target solute and then screened further, considering their physicochemical properties and health, safety, and environmental (HSE) performance. Finally, the lipid extraction process is simulated in Aspen Plus using all screened solvents to obtain technical, economic, and environmental performance data. Out of 88 initial candidates, cyclohexane, limonene, and ethyl tert-butyl ether are identified as potential alternatives to the benchmark solvent, hexane. While these solvents tend to be more expensive and their recovery is more energy-intensive (higher boiling points) compared to hexane, they have a higher selectivity toward lipids, thus reducing the solvent intensity of the process, and are less volatile and nonhazardous according to the HSE classification. This methodology can be applied to other extraction process applications or implemented at early stages in the process design to evaluate technoeconomic, environmental, and safety trade-offs when considering and selecting more sustainable alternatives to fossil-derived solvents.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acyclohexanes 3aenergy 3aenvironmental performance 3afuel production 3agreen chemistry 3ahexane 3alimonene 3alipids 3amodels 3aprocess design 3asolutes 3asolvents 3avolatile organic compounds 0aCOSMO-RS 0aprocess simulation 0agreen solvents 0abiodiesel 0asustainability indicators1 aGonzalez-Miquel, María1 aJobson, Megan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9626-58791 aCuéllar-Franca, Rosa M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2324-35450 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Dec. 24, v. 10, no. 1 p.472-485dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c067563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01874naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008200164300001600246520067500262592002800937650002100965650002700986650002301013650002401036650002601060650002601086650001201112650002201124650001901146650001001165650002601175700001601201700001401217700001501231700001701246700001801263773010001281856007401381852000901455655001201464IND60440432620221122051854.0151024e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044043262DNAL7 a10.1007/BF028187092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPezelj-Ribarić, S.10aInfluence of calcium hydroxide root-canal sealer on microbial growth in vitro  ap. 458-460.  aThe calcium hydroxide-based filling material Apexit, which is often used in endodontic practice, was evaluated for its antibacterial and antifungal effects against microorganisms isolated from oral cavity (Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas putida, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans).

Therefore, Gluconobacter oxydans especially is used for several biotechnological applications, e.g., the efficient oxidation of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone (DHA). For this reaction, G. oxydans is equipped with a membrane-bound glycerol dehydrogenase that is also described to oxidize sorbitol, gluconate, and arabitol. Here, we demonstrated the impact of sldAB overexpression on glycerol oxidation: Beside a beneficial effect on the transcript level of the sldB gene, the growth on glycerol as a carbon source was significantly improved in the overexpression strains (OD 2.8 to 2.9) compared to the control strains (OD 2.8 to 2.9). Furthermore, the DHA formation rate, as well as the final DHA concentration, was affected so that up to 350 mM of DHA was accumulated by the overexpression strains when 550 mM glycerol was supplied (control strain: 200 to 280 mM DHA). Finally, we investigated the effect on sldAB overexpression on the G. oxydans transcriptome and identified two genes involved in glycerol metabolism, as well as a regulator of the LysR family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGluconobacter oxydans 3aarabitol 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agluconates 3aglycerol 3aglycerol dehydrogenase 3ametabolism 3aoxidation 3asorbitol 3atranscriptome 2aBase Sequence 2aBiotechnology 2aBiotransformation 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDihydroxyacetonexbiosynthesis 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGluconobacter oxydansxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGlycerolxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSugar Alcohol Dehydrogenasesxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aDegner, Ursula1 aBringer-Meyer, Stephanie1 aHerrmann, Ute0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2007 Sept., v. 76, no. 3 p.553-559dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-007-1003-z3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02388naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007100158300001800229500001900247520108800266592002801354650002201382650001801404650001001422650001201432650001001444650001301454650001301467650001701480650001501497653001801512653003701530653001401567653001501581653003301596700002001629700002001649700001801669773018401687856007401871852000901945655001201954IND60692928120221120042005.0200503e20130523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069292812DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1300212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNOMURA, Taiji10aMolecular Diversity of Tuliposide A-Converting Enzyme in the Tulip  ap. 1042-1048.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTuliposide A-converting enzyme (TCEA) catalyzes the conversion of 6-tuliposide A to its lactonized aglycon, tulipalin A, in the tulip (Tulipa gesneriana). The TgTCEA gene, isolated previously from petals, was transcribed in all tulip tissues but not in the bulbs despite the presence of TCEA activity, which allowed prediction of the presence of a TgTCEA isozyme gene preferentially expressed in the bulbs. Here, the TgTCEA-b gene, the TgTCEA homolog, was identified in bulbs. TgTCEA-b polypeptides showed approximately 77% identity to the petal TgTCEA. Functional characterization of the recombinant enzyme verified that TgTCEA-b encoded the TCEA. Moreover, the TgTCEA-b was found to be localized to plastids, as found for the petal TgTCEA. Transcript analysis revealed that TgTCEA-b was functionally transcribed in the bulb scales, unlike the TgTCEA gene, whose transcripts were absent there. In contrast, TgTCEA-b transcripts were in the minority in other tissues where TgTCEA transcripts were dominant, indicating a tissue preference for the transcription of those isozyme genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTulipa gesneriana 3abiotechnology 3abulbs 3aenzymes 3agenes 3aisozymes 3aplastids 3apolypeptides 3aprediction 0aglucose ester 0alactone-forming carboxylesterase 0atulipalin 0atuliposide 0atuliposide-converting enzyme1 aTSUCHIGAMI, Aya1 aOGITA, Shinjiro1 aKatō, Yasuo,0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2013 May 23, v. 77, no. 5 p.1042-1048dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.1300213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009100172300001600263520115200279592002801431650002201459650001001481650001401491650001001505650000901515650001901524650000901543650002401552650002201576653002101598653002201619653002201641653001701663773010001680856008701780852000901867655001201876IND60525985620221119103923.0190402e20160401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052598562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.09.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGüneşer, Onur10aPigment and color stability of beetroot betalains in cow milk during thermal treatment  ap. 220-227.  aThermal stability of beetroot betalains in cow milk was determined during heating at 70–90°C.

Degradation of betalains followed first order kinetics while changes of L∗, Hue angle and Chroma values fitted zero order and first order kinetic, respectively. Reaction rate for degradation of betalains, L∗, Hue angle and Chroma values ranged between 1.588–30.975×10−3min−1, 90.50–379.75 L∗min−1, 0.581–5.008 Hue anglemin−1 and 3.250–19.750×10−3min−1, respectively.

The strain produced antibiotics phenazine (PHE), 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (PHL) and siderophore pyoverdin (PYO) in standard King’s B and succinic acid media, respectively. After extraction, PYO was identified by comparing the UV-spectra and moss-green color development after ‘diazotized sulfanilic acid’ (DSA) spray in TLC. PHE and PHL were identified by comparing standard compounds on TLC and orange-color development immediately after DSA spray. In vitro antibiosis study of the metabolites revealed their antibacterial and antifungal activity against bacterial test organisms Corynebacterium sp., Mycobacterium phlei and M. smegmatis and test fungi Fusarium moniliforme, F. oxysporum, F. semitectum, F. solani and Rhizoctonia solani. A statistically significantly higher plant growth was recorded in siderophore-amended plantlets under gnotobiotic conditions whereas PHE and PHL did not show any plant-growth-promoting activity. These results support the importance of the secondary metabolites produced by the strain P. fluorescens in enhancing plant growth and in controling fungal and bacterial pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiosis 3aantibiotics 3aantifungal properties 3aaseptic conditions 3acolor 3afungi 3apathogens 3aplant growth 3aplantlets 3asecondary metabolites 3asiderophores 3asuccinic acid1 aDileep Kumar, B.

In general, it is said that hydroxyl-rich phenolics act as reducing agents for metal ions, but little is discussed about the stabilizing ligands of metal nanoparticles (NPs). Thus, despite the popularity of plant extract-mediated synthesis of NPs, the phytochemical basis of the process and the exact mechanism are still unclear. Herein, a systematic study was carried out to unveil the mechanism of St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum (H. perforatum) L.) extract-mediated synthesis of silver (Ag) NPs. Among the phytochemicals present in the extract, phenolic acids and flavonoids are shown to be involved in the reduction of Ag⁺ ions, while xanthones and phloroglucinols act as capping agents, and naphthodianthrones were involved in both steps. Analysis of the postreaction residues by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a photodiode array and high-resolution mass spectrometry showed a sharp decrease in the concentration of various secondary metabolites present in the extract, of which large amounts of xanthones and phloroglucinols were recovered from the NPs. Consequently, the low polar fraction of H. perforatum extract, rich in xanthones and phloroglucinols, and the pure compounds of these classes (mangiferin and hyperforin) did not reduce Ag⁺ ions. In contrast, the polar fraction of the extract, rich in flavonoids and naphthodianthrones, and the pure compounds of these classes (kaempferol-3-glucoside, quercetin, quercetin-3-glucoside, hypericin, pseudohypericin, and protohypericin) were able to reduce Ag⁺ ions. Overall, the present study contributes significantly to the understanding of green synthesis of NPs by plant extracts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypericum perforatum 3agreen chemistry 3ahyperforin 3ahypericin 3aligands 3amass spectrometry 3ananosilver 3aplant extracts 3aquercetin 3asecondary metabolites 3asilver 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3axanthones 0aplant extract 0aHypericum perforatum L. 0aphytochemicals 0agreen synthesis 0asilver nanoparticles 0amechanism1 aKruszka, Dariusz1 aKachlicki, Piotr1 aMondal, Dibyendu1 aFranklin, Gregory1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6745-35280 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Dec. 16, v. 10, no. 1 p.562-571dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c069603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03370naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245006300202300001600265500001100281520162500292592002801917596005901945596004302004596005402047650001702101650002002118650002202138650001502160650001502175650001702190650001602207650001302223650001002236650001102246650001502257650001102272650001402283650001502297650001802312650000802330650001502338650002202353650001502375650002102390650001802411650001702429650001002446700006502456700001902521700005902540773011102599856007302710852000902783655001202792IND60670416220221121061135.0191002e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067041622DNAL7 a10.1111/btp.126962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeekiyanage, Nalaka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7400-345310aPlant ecology of tropical and subtropical karst ecosystems  ap. 626-640.  aREVIEW  aSubstantial areas of tropical forests, including those within nine tropical biodiversity hotspots, contain karst landscapes that have developed on soluble carbonate rocks. Here, we review how the ecology of karst forest trees is influenced by hydrological, edaphic, and topographic factors that exhibit fine spatial heterogeneity. Comparative analysis of drought tolerance traits including wood density contributes to the assessment of whether karst tree species are more drought‐tolerant compared to non‐karst trees. Although karst ecosystems are generally considered to have low phosphorus availability, foliar nitrogen‐to‐phosphorus ratios exhibit wide variation across karst regions without a clear difference from non‐karst ecosystems. According to the analyses of leaf phenology, stem water storage, and isotopic signatures from xylem sap, water use strategies of karst trees can be classified into five types: (a) soil water dependent, (b) epikarst water dependent (mainly use water stored in fine pores and gaps within the epikarst rock during the dry season), (c) groundwater dependent, (d) fog water dependent, and (e) drought‐deciduous (shed leaves during the dry season). Overall, published data suggest that only a subset of karst tree species are exclusively distributed within karst hilltops where water availability is limited. The diverse resource acquisition and utilization strategies of karst plants across edaphic habitats must be considered when developing effective strategies to conserve and restore biodiversity in karst landscapes, which are under increasing anthropogenic pressure.  aPublisher supplied data  a31660125cNatural National Science Foundation of China  cArnold Arboretum of Harvard University  cGuangxi University Invited Expert Special Project 3abiodiversity 3acarbonate rocks 3adrought tolerance 3adry season 3aecosystems 3aforest trees 3agroundwater 3ahabitats 3ahills 3akarsts 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3aphenology 3aphosphorus 3aplant ecology 3asap 3asoil water 3aspatial variation 3atopography 3atropical forests 3awater storage 3awood density 3axylem1 aGoodale, Uromi Manage1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3111-88991 aCao, Kun-Fang,1 aKitajima, Kaoru1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6822-85360 tBiotropica.g2019 Sept., v. 51, no. 5 p.626-640dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45461x0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/btp.126963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01496naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245004900163300001600212520069000228592002800918650001600946650001600962650001900978650001700997650002101014773010001035856007401135852000901209655001201218IND60440433020221119042740.0151024e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044043302DNAL7 a10.1007/BF028186912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSüleymanoĝlu, E.10aElectrorelease of Escherichia coli nucleoids  ap. 365-370.  aBacterial chromosome is assembled and folded into one or several nucleoids, depending on the metabolic status of the cell.

We selected a fringing reef along the lagoon of Dahab (Sinai, Egypt) as a model for a management strategy. Point-intercept line transects were used to determine substrate composition, coral community and condition, and the coral damage index (CDI) was applied. Approximately 84% of the coral colonies showed signs of damage such as breakage, partial mortality or algal overgrowth, especially affecting the most frequent coral genus Acropora. Questionnaires were used to determine the visitors’ socio-economic background and personal attitudes regarding snorkelling, SCUBA-diving and interest in visiting a prospective snorkelling trail. Experiencing nature (97%) was by far the strongest motivation, and interest in further education about reef ecology and skill training was high. Less experienced snorkellers and divers – the target group for further education and skill training – were those most prepared to financially support such a trail. We therefore recommend a guided underwater snorkelling trail and restricting recreational use to a less sensitive ‘ecotourism zone’ while protecting the shallow reef flat. Artificial structures can complete the trail and offer the opportunity to snorkel over deeper areas at unfavourable tide or wind conditions. This approach provides a strategy for the management and conservation of shallow-water reefs, which are facing increasing human impact here and elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amotivation 3aquestionnaires 3aattitudes and opinions 3aAcropora 3awind 3areefs 3atides 3amodels 3arisk assessment 3amortality 3acorals 3aanthropogenic activities 3aecotourism 3aeducation 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAnimals 2aAnthozoa 2aAttitude 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxeconomicsxmethods. 2aCoral Reefs 2aEducation 2aEndangered Species 2aEnvironment 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNature 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Assessment 2aSports 2aSwimming 2aTravel 2aWalking 2aYoung Adult 3aEgypt 3aRed Sea 0aEgypt 0aIndian Ocean 0atrails1 aKompatscher, Sarah1 aStachowitsch, Michael1 aHerler, Jürgen0 tJournal of environmental management.g2011 Oct., v. 92, no. 10 p.2723-2733dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014900163300001800312520134600330592002801676650001601704650002301720650001301743650002001756650002001776650001601796650001501812650006601827650002101893650001501914650001301929650002401942650001601966650002101982700001502003700001202018700001602030700001302046700001402059773009502073856008102168852000902249655001202258IND60523766520221119140717.0160624e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052376652DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-016-0413-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qing10aApplication of Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry for the Analysis of Compounds in Deep-Fat Frying Oil  ap. 2352-2363.  aConstituents in soybean oil fried with chicken breast meat (CBM) were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) according to the corresponding molecular weight (MW) distributions. The possible molecular formulas of the constituents deduced based on the parent triacylglycerols (TAGs) were investigated in three MW distributions. TAGs and oxygenated TAGs were found in region A (m/z853-1001). Diacylglycerols (DAGs), oxygenated DAGs, and oxidized TAG decomposition products were observed in region B (m/z600-853). Combination products between one TAG and one or two short-chain oxidative decomposition products (ODPs), one TAG and one DAG, two TAGs (dimers), one TAG dimer and one or more short-chain ODPs, and three TAGs (trimers) and so on were shown in region C (m/z1001-3000). Some even MWs were assigned to nitrogen- and sulfur-containing TAG derivatives due to the introduction of proteins contained in CBM. Furthermore, the possible reaction mechanisms which occurred during the deep-fat frying process were also discussed based on the deduced molecular structures of constituents. Depending on the obtained results, the composition profile of frying oil can be well elucidated by the MALDI-TOF-MS-based method for the quality monitoring of the frying oil or fried food.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast meat 3achemical structure 3achickens 3adeep fat frying 3adiacylglycerols 3afried foods 3afrying oil 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3amonitoring 3aproteins 3areaction mechanisms 3asoybean oil 3atriacylglycerols1 aLin, Shang1 aLi, Jie1 aLiu, Yuntao1 aQin, Wen1 aShen, Qun0 tFood analytical methods.g2016 Aug., v. 9, no. 8 p.2352-2363dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-016-0413-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002100156245010600177300001800283500001500301520092500316592002801241650001701269650001601286650002301302650000901325650001301334650001101347650001001358650001401368650001201382650001501394650002301409650002601432650001701458650004301475650003001518650006701548650001201615650001001627650001901637653000901656653002101665653001201686653001601698653001601714653001601730653002001746653001001766700001701776700001801793700002101811700002201832700001901854700001801873700002101891773013301912852000902045856007502054655001202129IND4463849820221118235057.0160905e20120620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446384982DNAL7 a226303302pmid7 a10.1021/jf300265x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuji, Toshikazu10aNovel Method To Reduce Fishy Aftertaste in Wine and Seafood Pairing Using Alcohol-Treated Yeast Cells  ap. 6197-6203.  a2019-12-05  a“Fishy aftertaste” is sometimes perceived in wine consumed with seafood. Iron in wine has been reported to be a key compound that produces fishy aftertaste. However, cost-effective methods to remove iron from wine have not been developed. Here, we describe a cost-effective and safe iron adsorbent consisting of alcohol-treated yeast (ATY) cells based on the observation that nonviable cells adsorbed iron after completion of fermentation. Treatment of cells with more than 40% (v/v) ethanol killed them without compromising their ability to adsorb iron. Drying the ATY cells did not reduce iron adsorption. Use of ATY cells together with phytic acid had a synergistic effect on iron removal. We term this means of removing iron the “ATY–PA” method. Sensory analysis indicated that fishy aftertaste in wine-seafood pairings was not perceived if the wine had been pretreated with both ATY cells and phytic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3afermentation 3aphytic acid 3asensory evaluation 3airon 3aseafoods 3ayeasts 3awines 3asynergism 3aethanol 2aAdsorption 2aAlcoholsxanalysis 2aEthanolxpharmacology 2aFermentation 2aIronxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPhytic Acidxpharmacology 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexchemistryxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aSeafood 2aTaste 2aWinexanalysis 0awine 0aFishy aftertaste 0aseafood 0amethodology 0agrape juice 0anew methods 0aalcohol-treated 0ayeast1 aKanai, Keiko1 aYokoyama, Aki1 aTamura, Takayuki1 aHanamure, Kenichi1 aSasaki, Kanako1 aTakata, Ryoji1 aYoshida, Satoshi0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 June 20, v. 60, no. 24 p.6197-6203dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf300265x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03608naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002100181245011500202300001800317506007600335520137600411592002801787506003701815650002101852650001301873650001001886650002601896650002701922650001901949650001101968650001501979650002001994650001002014650001302024650001302037650001302050650002402063650001402087650001302101650001302114650006402127650005102191650005002242650001702292650001802309650004402327650004202371650002802413650004102441650002702482650002502509700002102534700001802555700001902573700001902592700002002611700002102631700002002652700002202672700001702694773013502711856004302846852000902889655001202898IND4468240920221207115500.0120419e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446824092DNAL7 a222869812pmid7 aPMC33026212pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.07226-112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLüddeke, Frauke10aGeraniol and Geranial Dehydrogenases Induced in Anaerobic Monoterpene Degradation by Castellaniella defragrans  ap. 2128-2136.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCastellaniella defragrans is a Betaproteobacterium capable of coupling the oxidation of monoterpenes with denitrification. Geraniol dehydrogenase (GeDH) activity was induced during growth with limonene in comparison to growth with acetate. The N-terminal sequence of the purified enzyme directed the cloning of the corresponding open reading frame (ORF), the first bacterial gene for a GeDH (geoA, for geraniol oxidation pathway). The C. defragrans geraniol dehydrogenase is a homodimeric enzyme that affiliates with the zinc-containing benzyl alcohol dehydrogenases in the superfamily of medium-chain-length dehydrogenases/reductases (MDR). The purified enzyme most efficiently catalyzes the oxidation of perillyl alcohol (kcat/Km = 2.02 x 106 M–1 s–1), followed by geraniol (kcat/Km = 1.57 x 106 M–1 s–1). Apparent Km values of <10 μM are consistent with an in vivo toxicity of geraniol above 5 μM. In the genetic vicinity of geoA is a putative aldehyde dehydrogenase that was named geoB and identified as a highly abundant protein during growth with phellandrene. Extracts of Escherichia coli expressing geoB demonstrated in vitro a geranial dehydrogenase (GaDH) activity. GaDH activity was independent of coenzyme A. The irreversible formation of geranic acid allows for a metabolic flux from β-myrcene via linalool, geraniol, and geranial to geranic acid.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aacetates 3aacids 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aaldehyde dehydrogenase 3abenzyl alcohol 3aclones 3acoenzyme A 3adenitrification 3agenes 3ageranial 3ageraniol 3alinalool 3aopen reading frames 3aoxidation 3aproteins 3atoxicity 2aAlcaligenaceaexenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAldehyde Dehydrogenasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnaerobiosis 2aCulture Media 2aEscherichia colixenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMonoterpenesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTerpenesxmetabolism1 aWülfing, Annika1 aTimke, Markus1 aGermer, Frauke1 aWeber, Johanna1 aDikfidan, Aytac1 aRahnfeld, Tobias1 aLinder, Dietmar1 aMeyerdierks, Anke1 aHarder, Jens0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 78, no. 7 p.2128-2136dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.07226-11  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010600163300001800269520094600287592002801233650001701261650001301278650001301291650002301304650001401327650001701341650001101358650001701369650004101386650002301427650002501450650001101475650001201486650001901498650001701517650003201534700001401566700002001580700001201600700001701612700001301629773009501642856008101737852000901818655001201827IND60523766620221119140554.0160624e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052376662DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-016-0410-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Zhiying10aComparison of Different Extraction Methods in the Analysis of Volatile Compounds in Pomegranate Juice  ap. 2364-2373.  aConsumption and production of pomegranate fruit and juice have been increasing. Many pomegranate volatile reports involved commercial samples, complicated isolation methods, or different cultivars. In this study, three different techniques including simultaneous distillation extraction (SDE), headspace solid-phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME), and purge and trap (P&T) with Tenax TA absorbent were employed to extract the aromatic compounds of two different juices (PJ and PJS) of red Socotran pomegranate. A total of 36 compounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that the P&T and HS-SPME methods complementarily contributed to extract the aroma compounds related with the pomegranate flavor, and the most important contributors to the pomegranate juice flavors were identified as n-hexaldehyde, leaf aldehyde, 1-hexyl alcohol, butyl acetate, myrcene, and phenyl acetaldehyde in this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetates 3aalcohols 3aaromatic compounds 3acultivars 3adistillation 3aflavor 3afruit juices 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3aisolation techniques 3aleaves 3amyrcene 3aodor compounds 3apomegranates 3asolid phase microextraction1 aFeng, Tao1 aZhuang, Haining1 aYe, Ran1 aLi, Mingming1 aLiu, Tao0 tFood analytical methods.g2016 Aug., v. 9, no. 8 p.2364-2373dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-016-0410-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03621naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011700168300001400285520177300299592002802072650002402100650003102124650003102155650000902186650001202195650002602207650003202233650001902265650002802284650002002312650002102332650001702353650001402370650001702384650002302401650001302424650002002437650001502457650003002472650001602502650001802518650001002536650001702546650001902563700002002582700002602602700002302628700001802651700002002669700002602689700001902715700006302734773013102797856008202928852000903010655001203019IND60627638320221122064519.0190314e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062763832DNAL7 a10.1007/s13213-018-1389-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerjani, Raoudha10aPlant growth-promoting Rhizopseudomonas: expanded biotechnological purposes and antimicrobial resistance concern  ap. 51-59.  aThe present study was conducted to characterize a collection of plant growth-promoting (PGP) Rhizopseudomonas isolated from date palm roots for their biosurfactant production ability, heavy metal tolerance, and antimicrobial susceptibility. A collection of 36 bacterial strains was evaluated for several plant growth-promoting abilities including indole acetic acid (IAA) production, mineral phosphate solubilization, siderophores and ammonia release, and protease and cellulase activity. Biosurfactant production was screened throughout hemolytic activity, bleu agar test, and drop collapse method. Strains exhibiting tolerance to heavy metals at high concentration were subjected to PCR for the detection of heavy metal gene tolerance. Moreover, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined using the disk-diffusion method. High rates of plant growth promotion activities were registered among the isolated rhizopseudomonads, mainly, the indole acetic acid production (88.8%), phosphate solubilization (63.8%), siderophore release (83.3%), and ammonia synthesis (52.7%). Furthermore, biosurfactant production was recorded, using three distinct methods, on 77.7% of the tested strains. Particularly, two strains affiliated to Pseudomonas vancouverensis and Pseudomonas brassicacearum harboring copA-arsR and arsB genes, respectively, and producing biosurfactants, were selected. The evaluation of antibiotic resistance dissemination risk analysis in the environment revealed a low rate of resistance among the analyzed strains and the absence of known antibiotic resistance genes. This investigation could provide the basis for the development of microbial inoculums showing multifarious properties for biotechnological application while caring human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aPseudomonas brassicacearum 3aPseudomonas vancouverensis 3aagar 3aammonia 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3abiosurfactants 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3agrowth promotion 3aheavy metals 3ahemolysis 3ahuman health 3aindole acetic acid 3ainoculum 3ametal tolerance 3aphosphates 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aproteinases 3arisk analysis 3aroots 3asiderophores 3asolubilization1 aGharsa, Haythem1 aEstepa-Pérez, Vanesa1 aGómez-Sanz, Elena1 aCherni, Marwa1 aMahjoubi, Mouna1 aBoudabous, Abdelatlif1 aTorres, Carmen1 aOuzari, Hadda-Imene1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3237-554X0 tAnnals of microbiology.g2019 Jan., v. 69, no. 1 p.51-59dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl62868x1590-42617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13213-018-1389-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245009900175300001800274500001500292520105500307592002801362650001701390650000901407650002501416650001601441650002301457650002501480650001901505650001401524650001501538650002601553650001101579650002401590650001501614650006101629650002501690650002401715650002501739650003101764650002101795653001801816653001901834653001701853653003401870653001501904700001901919700002101938773013301959852000902092856007502101655001202176IND4463850020221118235225.0160905e20120620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446385002DNAL7 a226301332pmid7 a10.1021/jf300278k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKristo, Eleana10aStructural Changes Imposed on Whey Proteins by UV Irradiation in a Continuous UV Light Reactor  ap. 6204-6209.  a2019-12-05  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the structural changes of whey proteins during exposure in a continuous-flow UV reactor. Varying UV irradiation dosages were obtained by controlling the flow rate and the mixing speed. Whey protein isolate (WPI) solutions at concentrations of 1% and 5% (w/v) were circulated at flow rates ranging from 30 to 800 mL·min–¹, and changes in physicochemical properties of the proteins were investigated. Intrinsic fluorescence spectra and surface hydrophobicity measurements suggested changes in the tertiary structure of the proteins with UV exposure. The UV treatment also increased the concentration of total and accessible thiol groups in 1% WPI solutions, while no change was measured in 5% WPI solutions. Size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated the formation of UV-induced aggregates and oxidation products (N-formylkynurenine and dityrosine) of aromatic amino acids. Furthermore, the UV-induced changes in protein conformation increased the susceptibility of whey proteins to pepsin hydrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence 3awhey 3aprotein conformation 3aamino acids 3agel chromatography 3awhey protein isolate 3ahydrophobicity 3aoxidation 3ahydrolysis 3aultraviolet radiation 3apepsin 2aChromatography, Gel 2aHydrolysis 2aMilk Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aPepsin Axmetabolism 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aProtein Conformation 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aUltraviolet Rays 0awhey proteins 0aUV irradiation 0adenaturation 0asize exclusion chromatography 0aUV reactor1 aHazizaj, Artan1 aCorredig, Milena0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 June 20, v. 60, no. 24 p.6204-6209dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf300278k3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02722naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014100157300001800298500001400316520122100330592002801551650001801579650001301597650001801610650001601628650001301644650001301657650001001670650001501680650001101695650001501706653002101721653001501742653002401757653003001781653003101811700001801842700001801860700001901878700001201897700001701909700001701926700001701943773018501960856007402145852000902219655001202228IND60692928920221120031047.0200503e20130623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069292892DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1300362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHAO, Jin-yu10aInfluence of HbCO Structure of the Bar-Headed Goose on Photolysis Thermodynamics as Studied by the Nanosecond Laser-Ultrasonic Technique  ap. 1251-1257.  aNAL-light  aThe bar-headed goose, a specialized high-altitude species, has a capacity for high oxygen uptake from a hypoxic environment. It thus has a higher oxygen affinity than other bird species of lower-altitude environments. Oxygen affinity is determined by molecular structures and genetic mutations of hemoglobin (Hb), which can also influence the coordinating structures and dynamics of oxygen-Hb. To explore the structural differences in Hbs as between high and low altitude species, photolysis dynamic parameters, including quantum yield, enthalpy, and conformational volume changes in carboxy-Hbs (HbCO) for the bar-headed goose and low altitude counterparts (the Chinese goose and chicken) were investigated by the laser pumping-probing technique and photoacoustic calorimetry. Comparing the photolysis results for HbCO of the three species, the enthalpy and conformational volume changes of the bar-headed goose were much smaller than those of the others, although the quantum yields of all three species are similar. To explain the possible mechanisms of these differences, modifications of salt bridges and key residue mutations at the α β subunit interfaces of the proteins are described and discussed briefly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnser indicus 3aaltitude 3abiotechnology 3acalorimetry 3achickens 3aenthalpy 3ageese 3ahemoglobin 3aoxygen 3aphotolysis 0abar-headed goose 0acarboxy-Hb 0aphotolysis dynamics 0aphotoacoustic calorimetry 0alaser pump-probe technique1 aLI, Jia-huang1 aZhang, Zheng,1 aZhang, Shu-yi,1 aQU, Min1 aHUA, Zi-qian1 aSHUI, Xiu-ji1 aHUA, Zi-chun0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2013 June 23, v. 77, no. 6 p.1251-1257dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.1300363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245010300199300001800302500002000320506007600340520126700416592002801683506003701711650001901748650003301767650002401800650001801824650003101842650002601873650001601899650001901915650002001934650001701954650001901971650001901990650002202009650001902031650001002050650001802060650001302078650001502091650001702106650003602123700002102159700002302180700002102203700002102224700002002245773013502265856007302400852000902473655001202482IND60650000820221207130134.0190709e20150928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065000082DNAL7 a10.3390/nu71053962doi7 aPMC46324162pmcid7 a264260442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalasca, Katia10aEffect of Probiotic Supplement on Cytokine Levels in HIV-Infected Individuals: A Preliminary Study  ap. 8335-8347.  aJournal Article  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInflammation persists in patients infected with HIV. Reduction of inflammatory cytokines and microbial translocation might be one way that this could be managed. Purpose: The anti-inflammatory properties of certain probiotic strains prompted us to investigate whether a probiotic could reduce the inflammatory index of HIV-infected patients. Methods: The study involved 30 HIV+ males on antiretroviral therapy, who were given one bottle of fermented milk Yakult Light® containing Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) twice a day for four weeks. Results: The probiotic LcS was associated with an increase of T lymphocytes and a significant increase of CD56+ cells (p = 0.04). There was also a significant decrease of mRNA levels of TGFβ, IL-10 and IL-12 (p < 0.001) and IL-1β expression (p < 0.001) and an increase of serum IL-23 (p = 0.03). In addition, decreased inflammation and cardiovascular risk were observed, as shown by a reduction of cystatin C (p < 0.001). Conclusions: These data provide preliminary evidence that probiotic supplementation may modulate certain immunological parameters and some of the cytokines that were analyzed. Thus, we propose that LcS may be an inexpensive and practical strategy to support the immune function of HIV+ patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aLactobacillus casei 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantiretroviral agents 3ablood serum 3afermented milk 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-23 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3apatients 3aprobiotics 3atherapeutics 3atransforming growth factor beta1 aVecchiet, Jacopo1 aUcciferri, Claudio1 aDi Nicola, Marta1 aD'Angelo, Chiara1 aReale, Marcella0 tNutrients.g2015 Sept. 28, v. 7, no. 10 p.8335-8347dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu71053963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013800167520209100305592002802396650001502424650001502439650001502454650001602469650001202485650001802497650001402515650001502529650001502544650000902559650001202568653002602580653002602606653001302632653002402645653002202669700001302691700001902704700005702723700001802780700001602798773011202814856008602926852000903012655001203021IND60770151920221116142915.0220523e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077015192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1312022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Tianyu10aAdsorption-desorption kinetics and phosphorus loss standard curve in erosive weathered granite soil: Stirred flow chamber experiments  aWeathered granite has a high soil adsorption rate and it is difficult to apply phosphate fertilizers. In order to effectively use phosphorus, it is very important to study the intensity and speed of soil retention and desorption of phosphorus. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the kinetics of adsorption and desorption in soils with different erodibility. We selected three weathered granite soils with hugely different erosions: topsoil layer (TL-Tillage layer), laterite layer (LL-Laterite layer) and sand layer (SL-Sand layer). Phosphorus adsorption and desorption experiments were successively carried out in the stirred flow reaction chamber, and the stirred flow experiment under unsaturated adsorption conditions was carried out for the first time. The maximum absorption capacity (qₐₘₐₓ) and desorption capacity (qdₘₐₓ) of phosphorus in TL soil was both greater than that in LL and SL soil. The adsorption process mainly occurs within the first 250 min of the reaction. The desorption ratio (Dᵣ) in the TL soil is smaller than the LL and SL soil. The order of the fast reaction sites proportion (F) is SL > LL > TL in adsorption process and LL > SL > TL in desorption process. Seven key soil property indicators can fit qₐₘₐₓ and qdₘₐₓ values well. In the determination coefficient (R²) of the standard curve of phosphorus loss, SL soil is the larger than TL and LL. The qₐₘₐₓ and Dᵣ values measured in the stirred flow experiment are both larger than those in the batch experiment. Among the three soils, LL has the lowest adsorption capacity for P and the highest accessibility. The slow adsorption sites in TL account for the main part, and the adsorption in LL and SL mainly occurs at fast adsorption sites. Through the establishment of the phosphorus loss standard curve, the maximum phosphorus loss in the entire region can be predicted and calculated. This study can provide theoretical basis and reference for phosphorus management in similar soil types or physical geographical areas with severely eroded soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3aerodibility 3agranite 3agranite soils 3alaterites 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3asand 3atopsoil 0aPhosphorus adsorption 0aPhosphorus desorption 0aKinetics 0aStirred flow method 0aWeathered granite1 aFei, Kai1 aDeng, Longzhou1 aZhang, Liping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8688-485X1 aFan, Xiaojuan1 aWu, Yanhong0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 May 01, v. 347 p.131202-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1312023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245008700209300001600296520152000312592002801832650001601860650002501876650001401901650002001915650001101935650001901946650001101965650000901976650001401985650001101999650000902010653002402019653002902043653002302072653002302095653001302118653002402131700006402155700002402219700006202243700006102305773014202366856008602508852000902594655001202603IND60762613420220221000000.0220110e20211222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076261342DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c070432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemetti, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1845-752X10aRecombinant Spider Silk Protein and Delignified Wood Form a Strong Adhesive System  ap. 552-561.  aFor developing novel fully biological materials, a central question is how we can utilize natural components in combination with biomimetic strategies in ways that both allow feasible processing and high performance. Within this development, adhesives play a central role. Here, we have combined two of nature’s excellent materials, silk and cellulose, to function as an adhesive system. As an initial step in processing, wood was delignified. Without lignin, the essential microstructure and alignment of the wood remain, giving a strong scaffold that is versatile to process further. A recombinant spider silk protein was used as a fully biological and water-based adhesive. The adhesive strength was excellent with an average value of 6.7 MPa, with a maximum value of up to 10 MPa. Samples of different strengths showed characteristic features, with high tear-outs for weaker samples and only little tear-out for strong samples. As references, bovine serum albumin and starch were used. Based on the combined data, we propose an overall model for the system and highlight how multiple variables affect performance. Adhesives, in particular, biobased ones, must be developed to be compatible with the overall adherend system for suitable infiltration and so that their mechanical properties match the adherend. The engineering of proteins gives an unmatched potential for designing adhesive systems that additionally have desired properties such as being fully water-based, biologically produced, and renewable.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomimetics 3abovine serum albumin 3acellulose 3agreen chemistry 3alignin 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3asilk 3aspidroins 3astarch 3awood 0aprotein engineering 0acellulose-binding domain 0alap shear strength 0aAraneus diadematus 0aadhesion 0aamino acid analysis1 aTersteegen, Jennifer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7356-01861 aSammaljärvi, Juuso1 aAranko, A.

Two components of ring rail acceleration are measured in the direction of the measured force to eliminate the influence of various disturbances on the measurement of force at the yarn guide. Yarn tension is analyzed without the influence of air drag force or gravitational and Coriolis acceleration. To track the influence of spinning position, winding diameter, feeding yarn angle, and balloon angle at the yarn guide on yarn tension, a slowly variable force component is analyzed. The slowly varying component of the measured force is determined by numerical filtering with a computer. The angle of the yarn balloon at the yarn guide is determined by recording the balloon with an SVHS camera, whereas the feeding yarn angle at the yarn guide is determined mathematically from the kinematics of ring rail and yarn guide movement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acameras 3acomputers 3aequations 3afabrics 3akinematics 3aspinning 3atextile fibers 3ayarns1 aOrešković, Vladimir1 aPerić, Petar1 aKalinovčić, Hrvoje0 tTextile research journal.g2001 Apr., v. 71, no. 4 p.343-350dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517501071004113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008700167300001100254520090500265592002801170596006001198596006101258596009801319596002001417650002001437650001601457650001101473650002201484700001901506700002001525700006801545773009801613856008301711852000901794655001201803IND60705077920221120131720.0201208e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070507792DNAL7 a10.1186/s12863-020-00894-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Manthan10aCGGBP1-regulated cytosine methylation at CTCF-binding motifs resists stochasticity  ap. 84.  aBACKGROUND: The human CGGBP1 binds to GC-rich regions and interspersed repeats, maintains homeostasis of stochastic cytosine methylation and determines DNA-binding of CTCF. Interdependence between regulation of cytosine methylation and CTCF occupancy by CGGBP1 remains unknown. RESULTS: By analyzing methylated DNA-sequencing data obtained from CGGBP1-depleted cells, we report that some transcription factor-binding sites, including CTCF, resist stochastic changes in cytosine methylation. By analysing CTCF-binding sites we show that cytosine methylation changes at CTCF motifs caused by CGGBP1 depletion resist stochastic changes. These CTCF-binding sites are positioned at locations where the spread of cytosine methylation in cis depends on the levels of CGGBP1. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that CTCF occupancy and functions are determined by CGGBP1-regulated cytosine methylation patterns.  aPublisher supplied data  aEMR/2015/001080cScience and Engineering Research Board  aFAP-1337 (SSA/4873)cGujarat State Biotechnology Mission  aBT/PR15883/BRB/10/1480/2016cDepartment of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology  aT-357cDST-ICPS 3aDNA methylation 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3asequence analysis1 aPatel, Divyesh1 aDatta, Subhamoy1 aSiṃha, Umāśaṅkara,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8578-82010 tBMC genetics.g2020 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.84-84dBioMed CentralwJournal:2166x1471-21567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12863-020-00894-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001400147245007100161300001200232520154800244592002801792650002501820650001401845650001201859650001301871650001401884650001901898650001301917650001001930650001101940650001201951650001101963700003101974773008002005856008302085852000902168655001202177IND4470697420221117205132.0150812e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447069742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2012.05.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBooth, P.14aThe effect of water consumption on cognitive and motor performance  ap. 621.  aEvidence suggests that a proportion of children may come to school in a dehydrated state. Dehydration can have negative effects on both physical and cognitive performance. Furthermore, a proportion of children may drink less than the minimum recommended amount whilst at school. There is an emerging literature on the positive effects of water consumption in schoolchildren. Studies have consistently found that children who have had a drink of water perform better on tasks requiring memory, visual perception and speeded processing than children who have not had a drink of water. However, no improvement has been found in tasks requiring motor skills. This study investigated the effects of drinking water on tasks that require both cognitive and motor performance. Children (n=15) aged 8 and 9 completed series of tasks, once when they had been offered a 250 ml bottle of water and once when not. The children completed thirst and mood scales and a letter cancellation task followed by step ups, ball catching and the Wii game “Raving Rabbid” – a whack-a-mole game. The children performed significantly better in the letter cancellation task, p< 0.001, and “Raving Rabbid”, p=0.047, on the occasion on which they had been given a drink. These results support the notion that drinking water improves performance on tasks that require both a motor and visual response. This has implications for improving performance in activities at school that require these skills and for promoting the need for children to drink more at school.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacademic achievement 3abeverages 3abottles 3achildren 3acognition 3adrinking water 3aemotions 3agames 3amemory 3aschools 3athirst1 aC.J.

The study covers the impact of global warming potential, eutrophication potential (freshwater and marine) and particulate matter. The analysis was based on detailed primary data provided by Nordic Sugar A/S, from the Örtofta Sugar Factory (southern Sweden). The results of this analysis are presented for the functional unit of 1 tonne (t) white sugar without allocation. Economic and energy allocations were also applied and compared for white sugar and its by-products. The allocation of emissions to the product and by-products reduced the emissions for white sugar by 9% in the economic allocation, and by 21% in the energy allocation. The low economic value of the by-products gave rather low emissions for all by-products when applying economic allocation. These results were compared with those in the literature for white sugar in terms of global warming potential (GWP), and the results showed the lowest impact for both allocations. Replacing fossil natural gas as the main process energy source with softwood chips reduced the GWP for white sugar (without allocation to by-products) from 623 to 342 kg CO₂ₑq/t, illustrating the considerable potential for greenhouse gas emission reduction by replacing fossil fuels in the production process.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeet pulp 3abeet sugar 3aeconomic valuation 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alife cycle assessment 3amolasses 3anatural gas 3aparticulates 3aprocess energy 3asoftwood 3asugar beet 3asugar industry 3asugars 3awhite sugar 3aSweden 0aMolasses 0aSugar beet pulp 0aEconomic allocation 0aEnergy allocation 0aSoftwood chips1 aBjörnsson, Lovisa0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Apr. 20, v. 346 p.131211-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1312113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245011900199300001800318500001100336506007600347520142300423592002801846506003701874650001601911650002501927650002401952650002401976650002502000650001802025650002602043650001502069650003102084650001402115650002502129650001002154700001702164700001802181700001702199700001802216700001902234773013402253856007302387852000902460655001202469IND60650001020221207130131.0190709e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065000102DNAL7 a10.3390/nu71053982doi7 aPMC46324182pmcid7 a264374292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Meng-Xi10aVitamin D Deficiency Increases the Risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies  ap. 8366-8375.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe results investigating the relationship between vitamin D levels and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are inconsistent. Thus, we focused on evaluating the association of vitamin D deficiency with GDM by conducting a meta-analysis of observed studies. A systematic literature search was conducted via PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane library to identify eligible studies before August 2015. The meta-analysis of 20 studies including 9209 participants showed that women with vitamin D deficiency experienced a significantly increased risk for developing GDM (odds ratio (OR) = 1.53; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.33, 1.75) with a little heterogeneity (I² = 16.20%, p = 0.252). A noteworthy decrease of 4.93 nmol/L (95% CI, −6.73, −3.14) in serum 25(OH)D was demonstrated in the participants with GDM, and moderate heterogeneity was observed (I² = 61.40%, p = 0.001). Subgroup analysis with study design showed that there were obvious heterogeneities in nested case–control studies (I² > 52.5%, p < 0.07). Sensitivity analysis showed that exclusion of any single study did not materially alter the overall combined effect. In summary, the evidence from this meta-analysis indicates a consistent association between vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of GDM. However, well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to elicit the clear effect of vitamin D supplementation on prevention of GDM.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood serum 3acase-control studies 3aconfidence interval 3aexperimental design 3agestational diabetes 3ameta-analysis 3aobservational studies 3aodds ratio 3arandomized clinical trials 3avitamin D 3avitamin D deficiency 3awomen1 aPan, Guo-Tao1 aGuo, Jian-Fen1 aLi, Bing-Yan1 aQin, Li-Qiang1 aZhang, Zeng-Li0 tNutrients.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 7, no. 10 p.8366-8375dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu71053983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245012200176300001800298520128100316592002801597650001701625650001201642650001201654650003001666650002001696650001701716650001501733650001301748650002001761650000701781650001601788650001401804650000901818650002501827700002001852700001801872700001701890700002601907773009501933856008102028852000902109655001202118IND60523767120221119140752.0160624e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052376712DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-015-0394-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSājidah Parvīn,d1953-10aLarge-Volume Sample Staking of Rice Polyphenols Prior to Their Determination by Non-aqueous Capillary Electrophoresis  ap. 2152-2160.  aA rapid non-aqueous capillary electrophoretic (NACE) method for the separation of (−)-epicatechin (EPI), (+)-catechin (−CAT), kaempferol (KAE), quercetin (QUR), naringanin (NAR), ferulic acid (FA), and p-coumaric acid (p-CA) has been developed and applied to the determination of these compounds in different rice varieties. All seven compounds were separated on capillary of 50 μm × 68 cm (60-cm effective length) using 20 mmol L⁻¹ borate buffer of pH 9.0 and 5 % acetonitrile in methanol. Large-volume sample stacking (LVSS) technique was optimized and used to preconcentrate non-detectable polyphenols of white polished rice. Rice extracts were concentrated on-line by LVSS prior to separation by non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis. An improvement of 10–55 times in detectability was achieved with injection at 50 mbar for 30 s followed by voltage inversion (−20 kV) for 5 s. Linear calibration range of 1–300 μg L⁻¹ and 0.01–60 μg L⁻¹ was observed for NACE and NACE-LVSS method respectively, with the detection limit of 0.33–2.0 and 0.006–0.19 μg L⁻¹. Good reproducibility with standard deviations of less than 5 % was achieved. Polyphenol contents of different rice varieties were determined using developed method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aborates 3abuffers 3acapillary electrophoresis 3adetection limit 3aferulic acid 3akaempferol 3amethanol 3ap-coumaric acid 3apH 3apolyphenols 3aquercetin 3arice 3astatistical analysis1 aMemon, Saima Q.1 aSiyal, Ali N.1 aMemon, Najma1 aKhuhawar, Muhammad Y.0 tFood analytical methods.g2016 Aug., v. 9, no. 8 p.2152-2160dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-015-0394-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01717naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245005900174300001800233520078700251592002801038650001101066650002001077650001301097650001801110650001101128650001301139650001401152700001901166773008501185856008901270990002301359852000901382655001201391IND60095970620221119081921.0141104e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009597062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStefanidou, M.10aInfluence of nano-SiO₂ on the Portland cement pastes  ap. 2706-2710.  aThe evolution of nanotechnology provides materials with new properties and over the last years a lot of effort has been put to introduce nano-particles into cement pastes in order to improve their properties and to produce materials of better performance.

The pixels over the floats in an image that can portray fiber paths are detected and labeled, then the labeled pixels are connected to a chain-coded curve by tracing the path of individual fibers. Thus, fiber angles are estimated by the trigonometric relationship between the measured rectangular components of the chain-coded curves. The approximate twist angle of a yarn is statistically computed from all the estimated fiber angles with this yarn.

For multiplex PCR primers, YeaD was used to detect the three Vibrio species. Bioinformatic analysis such as MultiPLX and primer-BLAST was used to design stable and species-specific multiplex PCR primers. Multiplex PCR results showed clear band patterns with bands at 185 bp for V. alginolyticus, 396 bp for V. harveyi, 805 bp for V. arahaemolyticus, and 596 bp for common Vibrio species. The minimum concentration of DNA was measured by PCR; the value for V. alginolyticus was 0.1 ng, that of V. harveyi was 0.03 ng, and that of V. parahaemolyticus was 0.003 ng. Taken together, YeaD showed stability and specificity in identifying Vibrio species. Our multiplex PCR amplification method is an effective and inexpensive tool for identifying Vibrio species.  aPublisher supplied data  a201502422cThe Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries  a201502422cThe Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries  a201502422cThe Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries  a201502422cThe Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries  a201502422cThe Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries  a201502422cThe Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries  a201502422cThe Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries  a201502422cThe Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aVibrio alginolyticus 3aVibrio harveyi 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3abioinformatics 3agenes 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3avibriosis1 aJo, Ara1 aKim, So-Won1 aLee, Hee Eun,1 aKim, Young Chul1 aJeong, Hyun Do1 aChoi, Yung Hyun1 aKim, Suhkmann1 aCha, Hee-Jae1 aKim, Heui-Soo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5226-65940 tGenes & genomics.g2019 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.35-42dSpringer SingaporewJournal:J000001676x1976-95717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13258-018-0736-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245016000166520151000326592002801836650004401864650003701908650001501945650001501960650001401975650002201989650001802011650003002029650000902059650001102068650001102079650002302090650001502113653001102128653002102139653002502160653002102185653002602206653002002232700001402252700001602266700002002282700001602302700001302318700001302331700005602344700001702400700002002417773011202437856008602549852000902635655001202644IND60770152420221116142923.0220523e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077015242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1312192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Xiran10aSynthesis, characterization, and utilization of poly-amino acid-functionalized lignin for efficient and selective removal of lead ion from aqueous solution  aEffectively removing heavy metals from the wastewater using a green low-cost natural polymer-based adsorbent received a great deal of attention. In this study, natural γ-polyglutamic acid (γ-PGA) and ε-poly-L-lysine (ε-PL) functionalized lignin (DLGS and DLLS) were synthesized through demethylation/phenolation and amination to increase its intrinsic reactivity and adsorption sites, which were used to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions. DLGS and DLLS were comprehensively characterized by ³¹P, 2D HSQC NMR, and elemental analysis (EA). The adsorption property of DLGS and DLLS for Pb²⁺ have been systematically investigated. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms were compliant with the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm model, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity of DLGS and DLLS for Pb²⁺ was 275.9 and 231.8 mg g⁻¹ at 298 K, respectively, which is higher than that of most of the lignin-based adsorbent reported. Furthermore, it is confirmed that DLGS and DLLS exhibit excellent selectivity for removing Pb²⁺ through competitive adsorption experiments. Based on the Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, methoxyl, and dithiocarbamate groups are contributed to the binding with Pb²⁺, and density functional theory calculation further suggested dithiocarbamate and the carboxyl group are the primary active sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aamination 3aaqueous solutions 3ademethylation 3adensity functional theory 3alead 3alignin 3amodels 3asorption isotherms 3awastewater 0aLignin 0aLead ion removal 0aγ-polyglutamic acid 0aε-Poly-L-lysine 0aAdsorption mechanisms 0aDFT calculation1 aShen, Tao1 aLi, Minghui1 aShaoyu, Jingwen1 aZhuang, Wei1 aLi, Ming1 aXu, Hong1 aZhu, Chenjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7917-36491 aYing, Hanjie1 aOuyang, Pingkai0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 May 01, v. 347 p.131219-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1312193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03701naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245026000158300001600418506002800434520224600462592002802708506003702736650002102773650002202794650002402816650001202840650001602852650001702868650001202885650002502897650002202922650001702944650002102961650001902982650002003001700002803021700003503049773010703084856007903191852000903270655001203279IND60774137620221207073734.0161227e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077413762DNAL7 a10.22146/agritech.95042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNurhayati10aKOMPOSISI KIMIA DAN KRISTALINITAS TEPUNG PISANG TERMODIFIKASI SECARA FERMENTASI SPONTAN DAN SIKLUS PEMANASAN BERTEKANAN-PENDINGINAN (Chemical Composition and Crystallinity of Modified Banana Flour by Spontaneous Fermentation and Autoclaving-Cooling Cycle)  ap. 146-150.  aResource is Open Access  aStudies on the chemical composition and crystallinity of the native banana flour and modified banana flour were carried out on “agung var semeru” banana (Musa paradisiaca formatypica). Native banana flour was produced by drying the banana slice, ground and passed through a 80 mesh screen. Modified banana flour were produced by spontaneous fermentation (room temperature, 24 h)and one or two cycles of autoclaving (121 oC, 15 min) followed by cooling (4 oC, 24 h) of the slices before drying process. The results showed that spontaneous fermentation of banana slices increased amylose content. Two cycles of autoclaving-cooling significantly increased resistant starch content of banana flour (39.13 – 42.68% db) than the one cycle (29.34 – 35.93% db). Retrogradation process decreased the crystallinity from 18.74% -20.08% to 6.98% - 9.52%. X-ray diffraction showed that the starch granule was type C granule as a mixture of A and B polymorphs.

Many of these studies have been conducted among adults, while children have not been sufficiently investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the association between residential exposure to greenness and cognitive development at age 7 and to evaluate nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) as a potential mediator of this association.Methods This longitudinal study was based on a cohort of newborns enrolled at delivery in two large obstetric hospitals in Rome. We assessed cognitive development at 7 years of age through the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III edition (WISC-III). We estimated residential surrounding greenness, using satellite derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), within 300m and 500m buffers around each residential address at birth. We applied weighted multiple linear regression analyses to study the association between NDVI and the WISC-III cognitive scores, using the inverse probability weighting methodology to correct for potential selection bias. We performed a mediation analysis to evaluate the mediating role of NO₂ in the association under study.Results We enrolled 719 children at birth and performed our analyses only on 465 children with data on exposure and outcome. The results were not consistent for the average residential surrounding greenness in 300m buffer. For an IQR increase in greenness within 500m buffer around home addresses at birth we found a progress in Arithmetic subtest (β:0.39; 90% CI: 0.11–0.6), a test concerning with attention, concentration and numerical reasoning, apart from an indication of the positive association with Full scale IQ and Verbal IQ. This association was partly mediated by reduction in NO₂, since adding this pollutant in our model explained 35% (90% CI: 7%–62%) of our estimate.Conclusions Our findings showed an association between residential surrounding greenness within 500m and better scores on attention tests at 7 years of age. The observed association between Arithmetic subtest and NDVI was mediated, in part, by a reduction in NO₂. This topic has important public health implications in supporting green urban planning policies and promoting children's well-being.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarithmetics 3acognition 3acognitive development 3alongitudinal studies 3amental health 3amodels 3anitrogen dioxide 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apollutants 3aprobability 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3asatellites 0aGreen spaces 0aBirth cohort 0aCognitive development 0aAir pollution 0aChildren 0aWISC-III 0aNDVI 0aSEP 0aNO2 0aCI 0aIQR 0aDAG 0aNDE 0aCDE 0aNIE1 aMichelozzi, Paola1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1646-25551 aCesaroni, Giulia1 aDe Sario, Manuela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1117-27351 aDavoli, Marina1 aPorta, Daniela0 tEnvironmental research.g2021 May, v. 196 p.110358-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1103583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011100161300001800272500001500290520120700305592002801512650001401540650001901554650003701573650002201610650001201632650002501644651001501669653000901684653001701693700001601710700001701726700001301743700001601756700001501772700001901787700001401806773010201820856004801922852000901970655001201979IND50067921720221123005717.0130718e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006792172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-012-5441-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jin14aThe yellow sea green tides were dominated by one species, Ulva (Enteromorpha) prolifera, from 2007 to 2011  ap. 2298-2302.  a2019-12-05  aGreen tides have occurred in the Yellow Sea successively from 2007 to 2011. Genetic analysis of the 5-year green-tide-forming algae needs to be performed to determine the source of the biomass and understand the mechanism of the green tide blooms. In this study, free-floating green algae were collected at different sites in the Yellow Sea in 2010 and 2011. Data on 182 free-floating samples and 155 attached Ulva samples from previous studies on the Yellow Sea green tides from 2007 to 2009 were also taken into consideration. Morphology observation and molecular phylogenetic analyses indicated that the Yellow Sea green tides were dominated by a single species, Ulva prolifera, from 2007 to 2011. Considering that at least five Ulva species inhabit the north coast of China, the unialgal composition of the green tides implied that (1) there may be some special physiology and propagation pathways of U. prolifera for its rapid expansion, (2) the mechanisms of the Yellow Sea green tide formation were similar for the last five years, and (3) the intra-species genetic variation and population structure of U. prolifera need to be studied to determine the exact origin of the bloom-forming biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphylogeny 3aUlva prolifera 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3abiomass 3apopulation structure 3aYellow Sea 0aUlva 0aEnteromorpha1 aJiang, Peng1 aLiu, ZhengYi1 aWei, Wei1 aLin, HanZhi1 aLi, FuChao1 aWang, Jinfeng,1 aQin, Song0 tChinese science bulletin.g2013 July, v. 58, no. 19 p.2298-2302dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-012-5441-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03524naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011000169300001600279520131200295536036801607592002801975596006102003596008002064596005002144596007002194650001302264650001502277650000902292650001502301650001202316650001602328650001102344650001302355650002602368650002502394650001902419650002102438650001502459650002302474650001802497650002502515651001002540653001502550653001202565653001002577653001602587653001802603700001602621700001802637700001302655700001902668700001302687773012802700856008502828852000902913655001202922IND60595494220221121055642.0180605e20180403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059549422DNAL7 a10.1080/09064710.2017.13944862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaimei, Liang10aExploring optimal soil mulching to enhance maize yield and water use efficiency in dryland areas in China  ap. 273-282.  aWater and nutrient availability significantly limits global crop production, especially for dryland agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions. To explore the optimal soil mulching options for the Loess Plateau in China, a 3-year field study was conducted to investigate the effects of various soil mulching practices on soil temperature and the water use and grain yield of spring maize. The treatments included traditional flat farming (CK), narrow plastic film mulch (NM), wide plastic film mulch (WM) and narrow plastic film mulch + maize straw mulch between rows (MS). The results showed that MS treatment increased consistently soil temperature during the initial stages of maize growth, and more importantly, it reduced diurnal temperature variation. MS also increased in soil water storage by 10.1%, leading to the highest water use efficiency (WUE = 30.9 kg ha⁻¹ mm⁻¹) over CK on 3 year average. MS significantly increased maize yield and net income of farmers by up to 20%, compared to CK. In conclusion, optimisation of soil mulching strategies significantly enhanced crop yield and water productivity in dryland agriculture in China. Our study provides important guidance for exploring better soil management practice for dryland agriculture in the other regions of the world.  aThis work was financially supported by the China Science-Technology Support Program [grant number 2015BAD22B03-2], the Special Fund for Agro-Scientific Research in the Public Interest [grant number 201303104], the Shanxi Scholarship Council of China [grant number 2015-117], and the Shanxi Province Science-Technology Support Program [grant number 20140311002-4].  aPublisher supplied data  a2015BAD22B03-2cChina Science-Technology Support Program  a201303104cSpecial Fund for Agro-Scientific Research in the Public Interest  a2015-117cShanxi Scholarship Council of China  a20140311002-4cShanxi Province Science-Technology Support Program 3aZea mays 3aarid lands 3acorn 3acorn straw 3afarmers 3agrain yield 3aincome 3amulching 3anutrient availability 3aplastic film mulches 3asemiarid zones 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water storage 3astraw mulches 3awater use efficiency 3aChina 0aSoil water 0adryland 0amulch 0amaize yield 0aprecipitation1 aYuguo, Wang1 aBaoliang, Chi1 aNana, Li1 aWenliang, Chen1 aWei, Qin0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2018 Apr. 3, v. 68, no. 3 p.273-282dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4441738x1651-19137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2017.13944863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002900142245011700171500001400288520143900302592002801741650001601769650001101785650001501796650002201811650001001833650002001843650002401863650001701887650002101904650001501925650001301940653002801953653002401981700002902005700002702034700002202061700002402083700002702107773011302134856007702247852000902324655001202333IND60727257820221119160154.0210308e20201103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072725782DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.8.e569992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzalez, Juan Carlos T.10aUnderstorey to canopy vertebrate fauna of a lowland evergreen forest in Mt. Makiling Forest Reserve, Philippines  aNAL-light  aWe examined the vertical stratification of forest wildlife, from the ground up to the canopy layer, within a 2-hectare permanent plot of lowland evergreen rainforest on the Mt. Makiling Forest Reserve. Our aim was to determine the species richness of the different forest layers and evaluate their ecosystem services. Understorey, sub-canopy and canopy sampling were conducted during July 2016, March to April 2017 and February to March 2018, respectively. We were able to record a total of 68 species, consisting of 11 amphibians, 15 reptiles, 25 birds and 17 mammals. Increasing species richness with increasing vertical stratification was observed for both reptiles and mammals. For birds, the peak richness was observed in the sub-canopy and then decreased in the canopy. A decreasing trend was observed with amphibians wherein the peak species richness was observed in the understorey. Increasing vertical stratification influenced vertical habitat use and species richness. For the similarity index, the same pattern was observed for all species groups. Highest similarity was observed between the sub-canopy and the canopy and the least similarity was observed between the understorey and canopy. These results indicate that the understorey and the canopy host different species groups, thus, sampling of the understorey alone, often done in biodiversity surveys, may lead to the underestimation of species richness in an area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhilippines 3acanopy 3aecosystems 3aevergreen forests 3afauna 3aforest reserves 3ahabitat preferences 3arain forests 3aspecies richness 3aunderstory 3awildlife 0avertical stratification 0atropical rainforest1 ade Guia, Anna Pauline O.1 aDimalibot, Judeline C.1 aPantua, Khryss V.1 aGustilo, Whizvir O.1 aBantayan, Nathaniel C.0 tBiodiversity data journal.g2020 Nov. 03, v. 8 p.e56999-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:21364x1314-28287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.8.e569993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02164naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245015100170300001400321520081700335592002801152650001501180650001801195650001101213650003001224650002001254650001201274650001701286650001201303650001001315650001101325651001401336651001801350653001501368653001901383653001801402653001701420653002101437700002401458700002101482773012401503856008201627852000901709655001201718IND60083246820221121095442.0190318e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008324682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2013.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlischuk, Santiago10aSpore loads of Paranosema locustae (Microsporidia) in heavily infected grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acridoidea) of the Argentine Pampas and Patagonia  ap. 89-91.  aParanosema locustae, an entomopathogen of grasshoppers and locusts, remains the only microsporidium registered as a biocontrol agent.

The fate and toxicity of ZnO NPs in the environment are determined by their stability and dissolution. In this study, the influence of water chemistry on aggregation, sedimentation, and dissolution of ZnO NPs was investigated. The stabilized ZnO NPs aggregated and precipitated when the aqueous pH closed to their zero point of charge (pHzpc). Counter-ions neutralized the surface charge of NPs and promoted their destabilization. However, a high concentration of counter-ion (SO4²⁻, >10meq/L) made the NPs more stable because of the inverted surface potential. The stability of ZnO NPs was maintained by high concentration of Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA, 10mg/L) even the concentration of electrolytes was high. The influence of water chemistry on the stability and dissolution of ZnO NPs was further demonstrated in different wastewaters. In one wastewater sample, ZnO NPs was unexpectedly stable and with a high dissolution, which was due to the effects of pH value, organic matter concentration, as well as the concentration of counter ions. Our findings facilitate the predictions of the fate of stabilized ZnO NPs in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental impact 3ahumic acids 3ahydrochemistry 3aions 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aprediction 3arivers 3asulfates 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3azinc oxide 0aZinc oxide nanoparticle 0aAggregation 0aSedimentation 0aDissolution 0aWastewater1 aTsai, Yi-Chun1 aHsiung, Chia-En1 aLin, Yi-Hsuan1 aShih, Yang-hsin0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 322 p.348-356dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01697naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245012000152300001800272520054700290592002800837650001300865650001900878650001500897650001100912650000900923650002000932650001400952650001100966650002000977650001000997700001901007700001501026700002001041700001901061700001501080773012101095856007401216852000901290655001201299IND60664040920221122224010.0190910e20120227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066404092DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra00915c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ren12aA facile approach to prepare Ni, Co, and Fe nanoarrays inside a native porous alumina template via a redox reaction  ap. 2250-2253.  aWe report a novel approach to prepare magnetic metal (e.g. Ni, Co and Fe) nanowire arrays by reduction of metal chloride salts in the pores of an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template with a backside Al sheet via a hydrothermal process.

Upon presentation, the physical examination was unremarkable except for a non-painful, subcutaneous mass, 2 cm in diameter, firmly attached to the underlying tissue on the left lateral side of the tail base. Complete blood count, biochemistry and urinalysis were within normal limits; thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of metastatic disease. After removing the mass with 3 cm margins laterally and two deep fascial planes, the defect was reconstructed after tail amputation using a coccygeal axial pattern flap based on the lateral coccygeal arteries and veins. There were no complications with wound healing and the only visible change was a difference in hair coat direction at the 1 month re-check. This is the first report to describe the utility and feasibility of the coccygeal axial pattern flap to reconstruct a large cutaneous defect over the caudodorsal pelvic region in a cat.  aFunding The authors received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors for the preparation of this case report.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamputation 3aarteries 3abiochemistry 3ablood 3aclinical examination 3aexcision 3ainjection site 3amales 3ametastasis 3apelvis 3aradiography 3asarcoma 3atail 3atissue repair 3aurinalysis1 aMassari, Federico1 aRomanelli, Giorgio0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 17, no. 4 p.371-374dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X145365693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015700163300001800320520138400338592002801722650001501750650001301765650001701778650001701795650001001812650001601822650001501838650001901853650001901872650002101891650001501912650001301927650001801940650001401958650001701972650001601989650001702005700001302022700001802035700001402053700001502067700001602082700001602098773010202114856004802216852000902264655001202273IND50067922020221123005618.0130718e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006792202DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-013-5733-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yuqi,10aSynthesis and evaluation of methionine and folate co-decorated chitosan self-assembly polymeric micelles as a potential hydrophobic drug-delivery system  ap. 2379-2386.  aIn this study, an amphiphilic copolymer folate-succinyl-methionine-chitosan-octyl (FSMCO) was successfully synthesized step by step for self-assembling polymeric micelles. The copolymers formed micelle-like nanoparticles by their amphiphilic characteristics and structures were examined by UV-Vis absorption and Fourier transform spectroscopy. The sizes of blank and ICG derivative-loaded micelles measured by dynamic light scattering were about 170 and 140 nm, respectively, which were spherical in shape with an average zeta potential of −10 mV. Further studies on the stability showed that the micellar solutions maintain their sizes at room temperature for 1 month without distinct aggregation or dissociation. ICG derivative was much better photostable after being entrapped by the new carrier. The prepared FSMCO micelles displayed a good drug loading content (11.7%), entrapment efficiency (66.5%) and sustained release rate for the model drug fluorescein. The copolymers demonstrated weeny cytotoxicity toward Bel-7402, L02 and A549 cells when incubated for 2 d. Ligands modified micelles endowed preferable cell targeting capability and beautiful cell inhibition of HCPT-FSMCO on Bel-7402 tumor cells.

Solute supply to sedentary plant-parasitic nematodes  ap. 451-458.  aNAL-light  aSedentary cyst and root-knot nematodes withdraw large amounts of solutes from feeding structures induced in host roots. The feeding structures are specialised cells with a high metabolic activity and a tremendous capacity in translocation of nutrients. The required nutrients are provided by the plant transport systems – water and inorganic solutes from the xylem, assimilates such as sugars and amino acids from the phloem. Here we discuss the available data on the mechanisms by which nutrients are translocated into the nematode feeding sites. The interaction between Heterodera schachtii and Arabidopsis thaliana serves as a model system for cyst nematodes. In this case sufficient data are available to propose a conclusive concept for the mechanisms of nutrient flow: basically, in the early stages of nematode development syncytia are symplasmically isolated, so that transport proteins are responsible for the nutrient supply. Later, connections to the phloem via plasmodesmata are established, so that developing females are well supplied with assimilates. The interactions of root-knot nematodes with their hosts share a number of similarities but the data currently available are not sufficient to draw similar conclusions. As nutrient supply and functionality of feeding structures are the basis of biotrophic parasitism of sedentary nematodes, it is tempting to unravel the mechanisms by which both plant and nematodes influence each other via nutrient fluxes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aHeterodera schachtii 3abiochemical pathways 3acyst nematodes 3agiant cells 3anematology 3aparasitism 3aphloem 3aplasmodesmata 3aroot-knot nematodes 3asolutes 3axylem 0aBIOTROPHIC PARASITISM 0aSYNCYTIA 0aSUGAR TRANSPORT 0aFEEDING SITES1 aGrundler, Florian0 tNematology.g, v. 9, no. 4 p.451-458dBrillwJournal:2154x1388-55457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568541077814873053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03579naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245019100183300001800374520201300392592002802405650001702433650002402450650001902474650001802493650001102511650001202522650001002534650001102544650003002555650001302585650002402598650002402622650002202646650002002668653001502688653002002703700002502723700002402748700002002772700001902792700002502811700002202836773013702858856008102995852000903076655001203085IND60654878320221119001221.0190726e20160514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065487832DNAL7 a269508242pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145160005202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiallo, Abou10aAssociations between fruit, vegetable and legume intakes and prostate cancer risk: results from the prospective Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants (SU.VI.MAX) cohort  ap. 1579-1585.  aAlthough experimental studies suggest that fruits, vegetables and legumes may exert protective effects against prostate carcinogenesis through various bioactive compounds such as dietary fibre and antioxidants, epidemiological evidence is lacking. Notably, very few prospective studies have investigated the relationship between legume intake and prostate cancer risk. Our objective was to prospectively investigate the association between fruit, vegetable, tomato products, potatoes and legume intakes and prostate cancer risk. This study included 3313 male participants to the SUpplémentation en VItamines et Minéraux AntioXydants cohort (follow-up: 1994–2007) who completed at least three 24-h dietary records during the first 2 years of follow-up. Associations between tertiles of intake and prostate cancer risk were assessed by multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. After a median follow-up of 12·6 years, 139 incident prostate cancers were diagnosed. An inverse association was observed between prostate cancer risk and tertiles of legume intake (hazard ratio (HR)T₃ᵥ.T₁=0·53; 95 % CI 0·34, 0·85; P ₜᵣₑₙd=0·009). This association was maintained after excluding soya and soya products from the legume group (HRT₃ ᵥ.T₁=0·56; 95 % CI 0·35, 0·89; P ₜᵣₑₙd=0·02). No association was observed between prostate cancer risk and tertiles of intakes of fruits (P ₜᵣₑₙd=0·25), vegetables (P ₜᵣₑₙd=0·91), potatoes (P ₜᵣₑₙd=0·77) and tomato products (P ₜᵣₑₙd=0·09). This prospective study confirms the null association between fruit and non-starchy vegetable intakes and prostate cancer risk observed in most previous cohorts. In contrast, although very few prospective studies have been published on the topic, our results suggest an inverse association between legume intake and prostate cancer risk, supported by mechanistic plausibility. These results should be confirmed by large-scale observational and intervention studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abioactive compounds 3acarcinogenesis 3adietary fiber 3afruits 3alegumes 3amales 3amodels 3anutrition risk assessment 3apotatoes 3aprospective studies 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aprotective effect 3atomato products 0aVegetables 0aProstate cancer1 aDeschasaux, Mélanie1 aGalan, P.q(Pilar),1 aHercberg, Serge1 aZelek, Laurent1 aLatino-Martel, Paule1 aTouvier, Mathilde0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2016 May 14, v. 115, no. 9 p.1579-1585dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145160005203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011400168300001600282520099200298592002801290650001401318650001301332650001801345650002401363650001101387650001401398650001401412650001601426650001401442650001401456650001801470650001101488650001201499651001201511653001801523653001301541653001201554653001401566653001301580653001301593700002601606700002401632700001801656773012601674856008201800961001301882852000901895655001201904IND60083247020221122180043.0190318e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008324702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2013.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBecnel, James J.10aMultilamina teevani gen. et sp. nov., a microsporidian pathogen of the neotropical termite Uncitermes teevani  ap. 100-105.  aA new genus and species of microsporidia is described from adults of the termite Uncitermes teevani (Emerson) (n. comb., formerly Armitermes teevani), collected in Ecuador. Masses of elongate, ovoid, uninucleate spores were localized to the coelomic cavity of adult workers and measured 6.29×3.33μm (fresh) and 5.83×3.00μm (fixed). These spores were individually contained within a multi-layered sporophorous vesicle and contained an isofilar polar filament with 24–28 coils. Blast-n analysis revealed that the small subunit ribosomal DNA (ssrDNA) sequence of this new species exhibited 85% identity with that of a Varimorpha species from the fire ant, Solenopsis richteri, and slightly less (78–85% identity) to a large clade of microsporidian parasites from mosquitoes and microcrustacea. The morphological and sequence data support the conclusion that Multilamina teevani gen. et sp. nov. is a novel microsporidium and distinct from any previously described genera or species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aIsoptera 3aMicrosporidia 3aSolenopsis richteri 3aadults 3afire ants 3anew genus 3anew species 3aparasites 3apathogens 3aribosomal DNA 3aspores 3atropics 3aEcuador 0aMicrosporidia 0aIsoptera 0aTermite 0aPhylogeny 0aParasite 0aTaxonomy1 aScheffrahn, Rudolf H.1 aVossbrinck, Charles1 aBahder, Brian0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2013 Sept., v. 114, no. 1 p.100-105dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2013.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245005000167500001400217520158500231536018701816592002802003650001602031650001702047650001502064650001702079650001002096650001502106651001102121653002002132653001602152653001302168653001102181653001402192653001502206653002102221700002402242700002302266700002602289700002202315700001802337700002102355700002602376700002102402700001702423700001902440773011302459856007702572852000902649655001202658IND60727258120221119155912.0210308e20201002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072725812DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.8.e572012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeto, Ana I.

The published information reflects occasional collections from sporadic field visits to the Island. To overcome this, a thorough investigation under the Expedition “GRACIOSA/2004”, the Campaigns “PADEL/2006”, “MACROBIOLMOL/2014” and “PIMA-BALA/2017” involving sample collecting and presence data recording, was undertaken over an area of 19 km² encompassing littoral and sublittoral levels down to about 40 m around the Island. This paper lists the taxonomic records and provides information on species ecology and occurrence around the Island improving the knowledge of the Azorean macroalgal flora at both local and regional scales. A total of 1692 specimens belonging to 250 taxa of macroalgae (and including 55 taxa identified only at the genus level) are registered, comprising 166 Rhodophyta, 36 Chlorophyta and 48 Ochrophyta (Phaeophyceae). From these, 195 are identified to the species level (126 Rhodophyta, 31 Chlorophyta and 38 Ochrophyta) and comprise 156 native, 20 of uncertain origin and 14 introductions to the Island. Predaeafeldmanniisubsp.azorica Gabriel is an Azorean endemic, whereas Codiumelisabethiae O.C. Schmidt, Botryocladiamacaronesica Afonso-Carrillo, Sobrino, Tittley & Neto, Phyllophoragelidioides P.Crouan & H.Crouan ex Karsakoff and Laurenciaviridis Gil-Rodríguez & Haroun represent Macaronesian endemics. Seventy-nine species are newly recorded to the algal flora of the Island.  aThis work is financed by the ERDF in 85% and by regional funds in 15%, through the Operational Program Azores 2020, within the scope of the project “ACORES-01-0145-FEDER-000072”.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorophyta 3aPhaeophyceae 3aRhodophyta 3abiodiversity 3aflora 3amacroalgae 3aAzores 0aGraciosa Island 0anew records 0aendemism 0anative 0auncertain 0aintroduced 0aoccurrence data.1 aParente, Manuela I.1 aBotelho, Andrea Z.1 aPrestes, Afonso C.

The disease is transmitted by blood-feeding females, which seek aggregations of males above potential hosts both to mate and blood-feed. Pheromones produced by male sand flies could potentially be used as lures in L. longipalpis control programs. We investigated whether attraction of male and female sand flies to pheromone could be increased by addition of host odor. Pheromone was attractive to females in the absence of host odor, although a 10-fold increase in concentration did not increase numbers attracted or reduce the proportion of flies not responding during trials. Odors from Syrian hamsters, Mesocricetus auratus, were more attractive to females than air when presented without sex pheromone, but this effect was masked by hexane, suggesting attraction to host odor alone may be relatively weak. Addition of hamster odor both increased the number of virgin female L. longipalpis attracted to sex pheromone (relative to a solvent control) and reduced the number of nonresponders, indicating that host odor may have both a synergistic and activating effect. Male sand flies were not attracted to pheromone with or without host odor, although addition of pheromone did counteract an apparent avoidance of host odor combined with a hexane control. These results indicate L. longipalpis pheromones function primarily to attract females and that their efficacy as lures may be increased through addition of host odor, or by deploying traps in the vicinity of host animals. 3achemical concentration 3aLutzomyia longipalpis 3aMesocricetus auratus 3asex pheromones 3ahosts 3asex attractants 3ainsect vectors 3avisceral leishmaniasis 3ahematophagous insects 3ahost seeking 3asynergism 3aodors 3avirgin females 2aAnimals 2aCricetinae 2aFemale 2aHexanesxchemistry 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aLeishmaniasis, Visceralxtransmission 2aMale 2aMesocricetusxparasitology 2aOdorants. 2aPsychodidaexphysiology 2aSex Attractantsxphysiology 0agolden hamsters 0ahamster odor1 aHamilton, J.G.C.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2007 Sept., v. 44, no. 5 p.779-787dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-2585(2007)44[779:HOSAOV]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20071219b20080102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/12/19  aOther US 7aarticle01425naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010600158300001800264520028800282592002800570650001400598650002300612650001700635650002400652650001800676650001900694650001200713700001700725700001700742700001700759700001500776700001300791700001600804700001500820773012100835856007400956852000901030655001201039IND60664041320221119014849.0190910e20120227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066404132DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra00923d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zailei10aFlower-like CuO microspheres with enhanced catalytic performance for dimethyldichlorosilane synthesis  ap. 2254-2256.  aFlower-like CuO microspheres synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method were found to be an effective catalyst for the Rochow reaction with a higher dimethyldichlorosilane selectivity and Si conversion because of the enhanced formation of an active CuₓSi phase and mass transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acupric oxide 3ahot water treatment 3amass transfer 3amicroparticles 3asilicon1 aChe, Hongwei1 aWang, Yingli1 aGao, Jiajian1 aShe, Xilin1 aSun, Jin1 aZhong, Ziyi1 aSu, Fabing0 tRSC advances.g2012 Feb. 27, v. 2, no. 6 p.2254-2256dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ra00923d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245010100158300002000259500001900279520154000298592002801838650001401866650001601880650001501896650002201911653003801933653001501971653002101986653002102007653001302028700001602041700001502057700001302072700001702085700001402102700001702116700001602133700001302149700002002162700005402182773014202236856007802378852000902456655001202465IND60711084720221120074330.0200916e20200824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071108472DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c128682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yan10aFlexible Capacitive Humidity Sensors Based on Ionic Conductive Wood-Derived Cellulose Nanopapers  ap. 41896-41904.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWith the growing requirements for the renewability and sustainability of electronic products, environmentally friendly cellulose-based materials have attracted immense research interests and gained increasing prominence for electronic devices. Humidity sensors play an essential role in industries, agriculture, climatology, medical services, and daily life. Here, for the first time, we fabricate capacitive humidity sensors based on ionic conductive wood-derived cellulose nanopapers (WCNs). The WCN-based humidity sensors exhibited ultrahigh sensitivity, fast response, small hysteresis, and more importantly, a wide working range of relative humidity (RH). The sensors showed >10⁴ times increase in the sensing signal over the 7–94% RH range at 20 Hz, while many reported humidity sensors with high sensitivity often have the working range limited to high RH levels. Our sensors can realize the distinction of nuances in humidity and exhibit outstanding noncontact skin humidity sensing properties. Flexible WCN-based humidity sensors were also fabricated, and they displayed excellent sensing properties with long-time stability, endowing them with multifunctional applications. The contrast humidity sensing experiment compared to the existing commercial humidity sensor further demonstrated the higher and faster response of our WCN-based sensors. Thus, this work provides effective guidance for the design of high-performance humidity sensors using nanopapers and opens a new dimension for a variety of future applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3aclimatology 3ahysteresis 3arelative humidity 0awood-derived cellulose nanopapers 0acapacitive 0ahumidity sensors 0aionic conductive 0aflexible1 aHou, Shijie1 aLi, Tingyu1 aJin, Shu1 aShao, Yinlin1 aYang, Hui1 aWu, Dongping1 aDai, Shilei1 aLu, Yang1 aChen, Shaojiang1 aHuang, Jia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2873-77040 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 24, v. 12, no. 37 p.41896-41904dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c128683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245006500176300001600241520100200257592002801259650004401287650002301331650002201354650001501376650001501391650002401406650002201430650003701452650001301489650000901502650001401511650001901525650001101544650001901555650001801574650000701592650002301599650003701622650001201659653002201671653001401693653001801707653001201725653001501737700002701752700001701779700001801796700002301814700001601837700001801853700001701871773011401888856008502002852000902087655001202096IND60610701020221121224237.0180829e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061070102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Maghrabi, Heba H.10aMagnetic graphene based nanocomposite for uranium scavenging  ap. 370-379.  aMagnetic graphene based ferberite nanocomposite was tailored by simple, green, low cost and industrial effective method.

The prepared nanocomposites were introduced as a novel adsorbent for uranium ions scavenging from aqueous solution. Different operating conditions of time, pH, initial uranium concentration, adsorbent amount and temperature were investigated. The experimental data shows a promising adsorption capacity. In particular, a maximum value of 455mg/g was obtained within 60min at room temperature with adsorption efficiency of 90.5%. The kinetics and isotherms adsorption data were fitted with the pseudo-second order model and Langmuir equation, respectively. Finally, the designed nanocomposites were found to have a great degree of sustainability (above 5 times of profiteering) with a complete maintenance of their parental morphology and adsorption capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3aaqueous solutions 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agraphene 3aions 3amagnetism 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3ananomaterials 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3atransmission electron microscopy 3auranium 0aMagnetic graphene 0aFerberite 0aNanocomposite 0aUranium 0aAdsorption1 aAbdelmaged, Shaimaa M.1 aNada, Amr A.1 aZahran, Fouad1 aEl-Wahab, Saad Abd1 aYahea, Dena1 aHussein, G.M.1 aAtrees, M.S.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 322 p.370-379dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245017300168300001600341500001400357520095900371592002801330650001501358650002101373650001501394650000901409650001101418650001101429651002201440651001001462653001801472653001301490653003201503653001501535653002901550653002901579653002501608700002201633700003301655773007901688856008201767852000901849655001201858IND60711180720221118224915.0200917s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071118072DNAL7 a10.1163/1568541077814872512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerrero, Pablo10aNematodes of the order Dorylaimida from Andalucía Oriental, Spain.

In developing measures for disaster prevention or emergency response for disaster relief of big cities, an analysis of social vulnerability is very necessary but quite difficult. In order to address the problem, using Beijing as an example, we established a social vulnerability index system including 26 factors and developed an improved analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. The weight of each factor was evaluated using the improved AHP process that obviously increased the passing rate of consistency of the experts’ questionnaire. The population, career, economy, infrastructure and social vulnerability distribution maps of Beijing were obtained. From them, it’s easy to see the characteristics of various vulnerability distributions. Through sensitivity analysis, the influencing factors of each area were listed in order of importance. The approach are useful for assessing, reducing the social vulnerability of big cities in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3adisaster preparedness 3adisaster recovery 3ainfrastructure 3apsychosocial factors 3apublic safety 3aquestionnaires 3aChina1 aHuang, Hong0 tChinese science bulletin.g2013 July, v. 58, no. 19 p.2387-2394dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-013-5835-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014900164300001400313520122200327592002801549650001501577650002201592650002401614650001101638650001501649650002001664650002001684650001301704650002001717650002101737650001101758650001801769650001501787650002101802650002201823650001201845650002401857650002901881650002701910650001201937653000901949653002201958653001501980653000901995653002402004653002402028700001802052773012402070856008202194852000902276655001202285IND60083247420221122235129.0190318e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008324742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2013.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHepat, Rahul12aA viral factor, CpBV15α, interacts with a translation initiation factor, eIF2, to suppress host gene expression at a post-transcriptional level  ap. 34-41.  aAn endoparasitoid wasp, Cotesia plutellae, possesses its specific symbiotic virus called C. plutellae bracovirus (CpBV) and parasitizes young larvae of Plutella xylostella. CpBV encodes CpBV15α, which was previously shown to interfere with host protein translation. In vivo transient expression of CpBV15α induced a significant decrease in a storage protein level without its transcriptional level change. In vitro translation assay using rabbit reticulocyte lysate showed that CpBV15α suppressed translation efficiency of mRNAs extracted from fat body of P. xylostella. Transient expression of CpBV15α in nonparasitized P. xylostella suppressed humoral immunity and development to pupal and adult stages. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of CpBV15α co-precipitated eIF2 and eIF2B (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor of eIF2) in parasitized P. xylostella. Additionally, IP of eIF2 co-precipitated CpBV15α as well as eIF2B and eIF5 in parasitized larvae. IP with eIF5 antibody showed that relative amount of eIF2 bound to eIF5 was much decreased in parasitized larvae, while significant amount of eIF2 was bound to CpBV15α. These results suggest that CpBV15α inhibits some host mRNA translation by sequestering eIF2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBracovirus 3aCotesia plutellae 3aPlutella xylostella 3aadults 3aantibodies 3acoprecipitation 3aendoparasitoids 3afat body 3agene expression 3ahumoral immunity 3alarvae 3amessenger RNA 3aparasitism 3aprecipitin tests 3apupal development 3arabbits 3aregulatory proteins 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics) 3aviruses 0aHTIF 0aCotesia plutellae 0aBracovirus 0aeIF2 0aTranslation control 0aPlutella xylostella1 aKim, Yonggyun0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2013 Sept., v. 114, no. 1 p.34-41dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2013.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01720naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009400162300001800256520087100274592002801145650001501173650001501188650001701203700001601220700001701236700001801253773010201271856004801373852000901421655001201430IND50067922820221123005613.0130718e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006792282DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-013-5871-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ying10aSatellite orbit determination combining C-band ranging and differenced ranges by transfer  ap. 2323-2328.  aThe constraint in the transverse direction of satellite orbit with differenced ranges between master station and slave stations by transfer as an angular observation data is explained in theory.

Both the orbital overlapping and orbit prediction experimentations can testify the constraint in the transverse direction of satellite orbit with differenced ranges, and the results show that the accuracy of orbit determination and orbit prediction is improved by combining differenced ranges and C-band ranging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprediction 3asatellites 3aspace flight1 aYang, XuHai1 aLi, Zhigang,1 aFeng, ChuGang0 tChinese science bulletin.g2013 July, v. 58, no. 19 p.2323-2328dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-013-5871-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010400158300002000262520129000282592002801572650001801600650001301618650001101631650001001642650001901652650001901671650001101690650001601701650002301717700002301740700002501763700002001788700002501808700002601833773012301859856007501982852000902057655001202066IND60558279520221119171237.0161113e20121108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055827952DNAL7 a10.1021/jp307250c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsekov, Roumen10aDelta-Comb Potential in Modeling Three-Phase Contact Line (TPCL) on Periodically Patterned Surfaces  ap. 13248-13253.  aThis work is a study of wetting of small water droplets on smooth glass surfaces with periodic patterns in the form of imprinted net with hydrophilic cells and hydrophobic bars. Microcover slides consisted of soda lime glass were used. The imprinted images of the net were with cell sizes in the range 40–200 μm, which corresponds to a quite narrow scope of hydrophilic surface fractions f₁(30–36%) due to the relative increase in the size of the hydrophobic bars. The receding contact angles θR of small water droplets, positioned on the patterned surfaces, were measured. The experiment showed significantly lower receding contact angles as compared to the theoretical expectations by the Cassie formula, which accounts for the contribution to the contact angle of the surface fraction of the imprinted hydrophobic/hydrophilic net. For this reason, we developed new theory accounting for the periodicity of the surface and the contribution of the three-phase contact line on the contact angle. This new theory considered delta-comb potential energy Δ(x,y) of the surface, effective line tension κ, and the lattice parameter a. The restriction of theory was discussed as well. It was pointed out that the theory is not valid for very small and very large lattice parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontact angle 3adroplets 3aenergy 3aglass 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3aperiodicity 3aphysical chemistry1 aGrozev, Nikolay A.1 aDelcheva, Iliyana V.1 aIvanov, Ivan T.1 aBalashev, Konstantin1 aKarakashev, Stoyan I.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Nov. 08, v. 116, no. 44 p.13248-13253dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp307250c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245014500171300001800316520164600334592002801980650001802008650002202026650001802048650001502066650002202081650001802103650001902121650001102140650003702151650001402188650000902202650002002211650001102231650001002242650001102252650001702263650001302280650001902293650001402312650001602326700002302342700002302365700001702388700002302405773014602428856008302574852000902657655001202666IND60754777620221122055328.0211023e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075477762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-021-02636-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamidian, Khadijeh10aStudy of photocatalytic activity of green synthesized nickel oxide nanoparticles in the degradation of acid orange 7 dye under visible light  ap. 2667-2678.  aEnvironmental pollution is one of the most important problems that human beings face. Today, nanotechnology has played an important role in green chemistry and the use of nanoparticles in the removal of environmental pollutants is one of the newest methods of removing pollutants in the world. So, in this study, Nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO NPs) of this work were successfully synthesized via a green method by the usage of nickel nitrate hexahydrate as the source of metal and Biebersteinia multifida extract as the stabilizing agent throughout different annealing temperatures. The physicochemical properties of the obtained NiO NPs were characterized through the application of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), ultraviolet visible (UV–vis), and Raman analysis. According to the results of SEM and PXRD, the prepared product contained a satisfying distribution and very fine cubic structure with minimal accumulation. The average crystal size of prepared nanoparticles was obtained 54–58 nm. The energy band gap of synthesized NiO NPs was calculated 3–3.7 using Tauc equation. The photocatalytic performance of NiO NPs was investigated under visible light through the decolourization reaction of acid orange 7 (AO7) dye in aqueous solution. Being composed at 300 °C of annealing temperature, these nanoparticles exhibited excellent adsorption and photocatalytic activity (90.2%) toward AO7 dye. Therefore, it can be indicated that the synthesized NiO NPs demonstrated an excellent dispersion in dye solution, as well as considerable photocatalytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBiebersteinia 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacid orange 7 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abioprocessing 3adecolorization 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aequations 3aface 3agreen chemistry 3ahumans 3alight 3anickel 3anickel oxide 3anitrates 3aphotocatalysis 3apollution 3atemperature1 aRigi, Amir Hossein1 aNajafidoust, Ahmad1 aSarani, Mina1 aMiri, Abdolhossein0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2021 Dec., v. 44, no. 12 p.2667-2678dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3920376x1615-75917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-021-02636-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01854naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009700171300001400268520068600282592002800968650001900996650001901015650001501034650001901049650001501068650001401083650001101097650001401108653001901122653001901141653001901160653001901179700001801198700002201216773013901238856008201377852000901459655001201468IND60083247520221122231250.0190318e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008324752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2013.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilbrath, Meghan O.10aNosema ceranae induced mortality in honey bees (Apis mellifera) depends on infection methods  ap. 42-44.  aNosema ceranae infection can reduce survival of the Western honey bee, Apis mellifera, but experiments examining its virulence have highly variable results. This variation may arise from differences in experimental techniques. We examined survival effects of two techniques: Nosema infection at day 1 without anesthesia and infection at day 5 using CO2 anesthesia. All bees infected with the latter method had poorer survival. Interestingly, these bees also had significantly fewer spores than bees infected without anesthesia. These results indicate that differences in Nosema ceranae-induced mortality in honey bees may be partially due to differences in experimental techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aNosema ceranae 3aanesthesia 3acarbon dioxide 3ahoney bees 3amortality 3aspores 3avirulence 0aApis mellifera 0aCarbon dioxide 0aNosema ceranae 0aMicrosporidian1 aXie, Xianbing1 aHuang, Zachary Y.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2013 Sept., v. 114, no. 1 p.42-44dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2013.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245004600167500001400213520151700227536018701744592002801931650001601959650001701975650001501992650001702007650001002024650001802034650001502052651001102067653001602078653001602094653001302110653001102123653001502134653001402149653002102163700002602184700002102210700002202231700002102253700001702274700001902291773011302310856007702423852000902500655001202509IND60727258720221119160629.0210308e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072725872DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.8.e574612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeto, Ana I.

Despite this, the macroalgal flora of the island cannot be considered well-known as published information reflects only occasional collections. To overcome this, a thorough investigation encompassing collections and presence data recording was undertaken. Research under the Campaigns “AÇORES/89”, “PICO/91”, “PICOBEL/2007” and “LAUMACAT/2011” covered a relatively large area (approximately 39 km²) around the island, encompassing the littoral and sublittoral levels down to about 40 m around the Island. This paper improves the knowledge of the Azorean macroalgal flora at local and regional scales by listing taxonomic records and providing information on the ecology and occurrence of each species present on the Island’s littoral. A total of 4043 specimens (including taxa identified only to genus level) belonging to 303 taxa of macroalgae are registered, comprising 197 Rhodophyta, 53 Chlorophyta and 53 Ochrophyta (Phaeophyceae). From these, 225 were identified to species level (142 Rhodophyta, 41 Chlorophyta and 42 Ochrophyta), encompassing 110 new records for the island (69 Rhodophyta, 20 Chlorophyta and 21 Ochrophyta), three Macaronesian endemisms (Botryocladiamacaronesica Afonso-Carillo, Sobrino, Tittley & Neto; Laurenciaviridis Gil-Rodríguez & Haroun; Codiumelisabethiae O. C. Schmidt), 14 introduced and 25 species with an uncertain status.  aThis work is financed by the ERDF in 85% and by regional funds in 15%, through the Operational Program Azores 2020, within the scope of the project “ACORES-01-0145-FEDER-000072”.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorophyta 3aPhaeophyceae 3aRhodophyta 3abiodiversity 3aflora 3alittoral zone 3amacroalgae 3aAzores 0aPico Island 0anew records 0aendemism 0anative 0aintroduced 0auncertain 0aoccurrence data.1 aPrestes, Afonso C.

Thin films of tin-based perovskites were exposed to continuous light soaking and/or thermal annealing in the dark under an inert atmosphere, which simulate pragmatic anoxic operation conditions of solar cells with the absorber layer isolated from the (re)action of oxygen and moisture by appropriate encapsulation. Using a set of complementary techniques such as optical spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectra, we have elucidated that hybrid tin halide perovskites undergo rapid thermal and light-induced degradation with the complete elimination of organic cations and the formation of some volatile decomposition products and Sn(IV) halide species. On the contrary, all-inorganic compositions comprising CsSnBr₃ and, particularly, CsSnI₃ showed a much superior thermal and photochemical stability with respect to both light and elevated temperatures. Unfortunately, all investigated complex tin halides suffer from heat- and light-induced Sn(II) disproportionation with the formation of Sn(IV) species and, presumably, metallic Sn⁰. This facile disproportionation and chemical degradation pathway reduces dramatically the intrinsic stability of Sn(II) complex halides and limits their potential for practical applications. While this problem can be addressed using additional stabilizing additives and crystal-lattice-engineering approaches, the analysis of the comprehensive sets of our results solidifies further rational design approaches for the development of lead-free absorbers for inorganic perovskite-based solar cells with enhanced stability for efficient and durable photovoltaic systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadditives 3aannealing 3aatomic force microscopy 3abromides 3acations 3acesium 3achemical degradation 3aencapsulation 3afilms (materials) 3aheat 3aiodides 3aoxygen 3aphotochemistry 3aphysical chemistry 3asoaking 3asolar cells 3asolar collectors 3atemperature 3atin1 aTsarev, Sergey A.1 aElshobaki, Moneim1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2125-03941 aLuchkin, Sergey Yu.1 aZhidkov, Ivan S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8727-47301 aKurmaev, Ernst Z.1 aAldoshin, Sergey M.1 aStevenson, Keith J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1082-28711 aTroshin, Pavel A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9957-41400 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 123, no. 44 p.26862-26869dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b092003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245012800157300002000285500001900305520215500324592002802479650002202507650001202529650001302541650001102554650001202565650002302577653000902600653002402609653002802633653002902661653001402690700001602704700005802720700001902778700006002797773014202857856007802999852000903077655001203086IND60711085120221123000758.0200916e20200820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071108512DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c131252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Hui10aEnhanced Proton Conductivity by Aliovalent Substitution of Cadmium for Indium in Dimethylaminium-Templated Metal Anilicates  ap. 41605-41612.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with excellent proton conducting ability are crucial to fuel cells, chemical sensors, and redox flow batteries, but achieving them remain a challenge because of the difficulty in simultaneous fulfillment of large number of proton carriers, high mobility of protons, and long-term durable proton conduction. To explore a simple, efficient, and general route toward highly proton-conducting MOFs, we propose herein an aliovalent substitution metal strategy for isostructural aminium-templated MOFs which benefit the acquisition of rich proton sources without modifying ligands or exchanging protic organic molecules. This idea is verified by 100-fold enhancement of conductivity in compounds (Me₂NH₂)₂[Cd(mdhbqdc)₂] (Cd-BQ) and (Me₂NH₂) (Me₂NH)[In(mdhbqdc)₂] (In-BQ) (H₂mdhbqdc = dimethyl 3,6-dihydroxy-2,5-benzoquinone-1,4-dicarboxylic acid) that feature three-dimensional diamond-like structures with two-dimensional intersected channels. Accompanied by the in situ formation of an anilicate ligand, a great number of −OH groups are grafted onto the inner wall of pores, which interact with neutral Me₂NH and/or protonated Me₂NH₂⁺ cations via N–H···O hydrogen bonds. The high concentration of protons and dynamics of protic amines in the porous framework readily leads to a moderate conductivity of In-BQ (2.10 × 10–⁴ S cm–¹, at 303 K under 95% RH) and an activation energy of 0.73 eV (95% RH). It should be noted that the aliovalent substitution of Cd(II) for In(III) results in the doubling of dimethylaminium proton carriers in Cd-BQ, indicating more frequent hopping and multiple proton-transfer pathways. This indication is supported by a very high protonic conductivity of 2.30 × 10–² S cm–¹ and a reduced activation energy of 0.48 eV under the same conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations visually elucidate the fact that compared with In-BQ, aliovalent-substituted Cd-BQ has shorter proton-migration distances, which in combination with more proton numbers results in more frequent hopping and sliding of protons, in agreement with the experimental results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acadmium 3ahydrogen 3aindium 3aligands 3amolecular dynamics 0aMOFs 0aproton conductivity 0aaliovalent substitution 0adimethylaminium template 0aanilicate1 aHe, Yan-Bin1 aHou, Juan-Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9258-14761 aZhai, Quan-Guo1 aZhang, Xian-Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8809-34020 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 20, v. 12, no. 37 p.41605-41612dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c131253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245008500199300002000284506007600304520142400380592002801804506003701832650000801869650001501877650001201892650001301904650004901917650002201966650001401988650001102002650002302013650001602036650003002052650001902082650001202101650002302113650000902136700002502145773012302170856007502293852000902368655001202377IND60558279920221207111300.0161113e20121108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055827992DNAL7 a10.1021/jp307851g2doi7 aPMC35465412pmcid7 a230671292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlack, Paul J.10aExcess Electron Trapping in Duplex DNA: Long Range Transfer via Stacked Adenines  ap. 13211-13218.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAn understanding of charge transfer (CT) in DNA lies at the root of assessing the risks and benefits of exposure to ionizing radiation. Energy deposition by high-energy photons and fast-charged particles creates holes and excess electrons (EEs) in DNA, and the subsequent reactions determine the complexity of DNA damage and ultimately the risk of disease. Further interest in CT comes from the possibility that hole transfer, excess electron transfer (EET), or both in DNA might be used to develop nanoscale circuits. To study EET in DNA, EPR spectroscopy was used to determine the distribution of EE trapping by oligodeoxynucleotides irradiated and observed at 4 K. Our results indicate that stretches of consecutive adenine bases on the same strand serve as an ideal conduit for intrastrand EET in duplex DNA at 4 K. Specifically, we show that A is an efficient trap for EE at 4 K if, and only if, the A strand of the duplex does not contain one of the other three bases. If there is a T, C, or G on the A strand, then trapping occurs at T or C instead of A. This holds true for stretches up to 32 A’s. Whereas T competes effectively against A for the EE, it does not compete effectively against C. Long stretches of T pass the majority of EE to C. Our results show that AT stretches channel EE to cytosine, an end point with significance to both radiation damage and the photochemical repair of pyrimidine dimers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aadenine 3acytosine 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3aionizing radiation 3airradiation 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aphotochemistry 3aphotons 3aphysical chemistry 3arisk1 aBernhard, William A.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Nov. 08, v. 116, no. 44 p.13211-13218dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp307851g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245005800165300001300223520146800236592002801704650001701732650001301749650001201762650002701774650001601801650001901817650001501836650001401851650001901865650001501884650001801899650001101917650001101928650001501939650001501954650001301969650002101982650001102003650001102014653001502025653001102040653002002051653002602071653001302097653001602110700001902126700001802145700001802163700002102181700002802202700001702230700001802247773009802265856008102363852000902444655001202453IND60085462120221121015143.0161024e20130915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008546212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2013.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhen, Junyan,10aMicroalgae-based carbohydrates for biofuel production  ap. 1-10.  aMicroalgae are considered as the most promising renewable feedstock for biofuel production and biorefineries, due to their advantages of fast growth, efficient carbon dioxide fixation, not competing for arable lands and potable water, and potentially accumulating high amounts of lipids and carbohydrates. Since carbohydrates in microalgae biomass are mainly cellulose in the cell wall and starch in the plastids without lignin and low hemicelluloses contents, they can be readily converted into fermentable sugars. However, to date there are very few studies focusing on the use of microalgae-based carbohydrates for biofuel production, which requires more understanding and knowledge to support the technical feasibility of this next-generation feedstock. This review article elucidates comprehensive information on the characteristics and metabolism of main fermentable microalgal carbohydrates (e.g., starch and cellulose), as well as the key factors and challenges that should be addressed during production and saccharification of microalgal carbohydrates. Furthermore, developments on the utilization of microalgae-based feedstock in producing liquid and gaseous biofuels are summarized. The objective of this article is to provide useful knowledge and information with regard to biochemistry, bioprocess engineering, and commercial applications to assist in the viable technology development of for biofuels generation from microalgae-based carbohydrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarable soils 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abioprocess engineering 3abiorefining 3acarbon dioxide 3acell walls 3acellulose 3adrinking water 3afeedstocks 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3alipids 3ametabolism 3amicroalgae 3aplastids 3asaccharification 3astarch 3asugars 0aMicroalgae 0aBiogas 0aGrowth kinetics 0aIntegrated Processing 0aBiofuels 0aBiorefinery1 aZhao, Xin-Qing1 aYen, Hong-Wei1 aHo, Shih-Hsin1 aCheng, Chieh-Lun1 aLee, D.

Due to the cyanobacterial blooms and cyanotoxins produced, these organisms are recognized as a threat and ecological risk for water bodies. Released cyanotoxins may cause death of many organisms including birds and fish. Vaya Lake is the largest natural lake in Bulgaria. It is located on the Via Pontica migration route of birds between Europe and Africa. Since 2003, the lake has been declared as a "Wetland of international importance” under the Ramsar Convention. According to the literature data from 2002-2006, the Lake is defined as highly eutrophied due to strong anthropogenic pressure, but regular monitoring of the cyanobacterial blooms and presence of cyanotoxins after this period is missing. Taking into account the importance of this unique, protected ecosystem, our aim was to make a complete ecological assessment of the present state of Lake Vaya by using the phytoplankton, with an emphasis on cyanobacterial blooms and the presence of cyanotoxins. As results of the study, we 1) characterized the phytoplankton composition qualitatively and quantitatively; 2) evaluated the ecological status of the western and eastern part of the Lake; 3) identified the potential producers of cyanotoxins; 4) observed cyanobacterial blooms and discussed the influence of macrophytes on their spread; 5) measured the concentrations of the cyanotoxins MCs, CYL and STXs in water samples from both parts of the Lake. Our results indicated the need for continued observation of cyanobacterial composition, blooming and the presence of cyanotoxins in Lake Vaya.  aBulgarian National Science Fund (research grant DN 01/2) and the Executive Environment Agency, Ministry of Environment and Water (project: „Provide data for the year 2017 of hydrological monitoring of surface waters in accordance with an order of the Minister of Environment and Waters“)  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3acyanobacterial toxins 3adeath 3aecosystems 3afish 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3aphytoplankton 3arisk 3awetlands 3aAfrica 3aBulgaria 0aphytoplankton composition 0acyanoprokaryota 0acyanotoxins 0aecological indices 0aLake Vaya (Burgas)1 aBelkinova, Detelina1 aMladenov, Rumen1 aStoyanov, Plamen1 aMoten, Dzhemal1 aBasheva, Diyana1 aKazakov, Stefan1 aDzhambazov, Balik0 tBiodiversity data journal.g2020 Dec. 16, v. 8 p.e57507-dPensoft PublisherswJournal:21364x1314-28287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.8.e575073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04056naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245012500187300001800312520234700330592002802677650000802705650001302713650002502726650001302751650001702764650001702781650002402798650002402822650001402846650001002860650001602870650001302886650001202899650001002911650001702921650002602938650001902964650002602983650000903009653001903018653001703037653002003054653001403074700002103088700002503109700002003134700002203154700002003176700002003196700002303216773013703239856008103376852000903457655001203466IND60654879120221119001233.0190726e20160514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065487912DNAL7 a269611282pmid7 a10.1017/S000711451600060X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLezon, Christian10aEffect of chronic undernutrition on body mass and mechanical bone quality under normoxic and altitude hypoxic conditions  ap. 1687-1695.  aBoth undernutrition and hypoxia exert a negative influence on both growth pattern and bone mechanical properties in developing rats. The present study explored the effects of chronic food restriction on both variables in growing rats exposed to simulated high-altitude hypoxia. Male rats (n 80) aged 28 d were divided into normoxic (Nx) and hypoxic (Hx) groups. Hx rats were exposed to hypobaric air (380 mmHg) in decompression chambers. At T₀, Nx and Hx rats were subdivided into four equal subgroups: normoxic control and hypoxic controls, and normoxic growth-restricted and hypoxic growth-restricted received 80 % of the amount of food consumed freely by their respective controls for a 4-week period. Half of these animals were studied at the end of this period (T₄). The remaining rats in each group continued under the same environmental conditions, but food was offered ad libitum to explore the type of catch-up growth during 8 weeks. Structural bone properties (strength and stiffness) were evaluated in the right femur midshaft by the mechanical three-point bending test; geometric properties (length, cross-sectional area, cortical mass, bending cross-sectional moment of inertia) and intrinsic properties of the bone tissue (elastic modulus) were measured or derived from appropriate equations. Bone mineralisation was assessed by ash measurement of the left femur. These data indicate that the growth-retarded effects of diminished food intake, induced either by food restriction or hypoxia-related inhibition of appetite, generated the formation of corresponding smaller bones in which subnormal structural and geometric properties were observed. However, they seemed to be appropriate to the body mass of the animals and suggest, therefore, that the bones were not osteopenic. When food restriction was imposed in Hx rats, the combined effects of both variables were additive, inducing a further reduction of bone mass and bone load-carrying capacity. In all cases, the mechanical properties of the mineralised tissue were unaffected. This and the capacity of the treated bones to undergone complete catch-up growth with full restoration of the biomechanical properties suggest that undernutrition, under either Nx or Hx conditions, does not affect bone behaviour because it remains appropriate to its mechanical functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaltitude 3aanaerobic conditions 3aappetite 3abiomechanics 3abone density 3abone mineralization 3acompensatory growth 3aequations 3afemur 3afood intake 3ageometry 3ahypoxia 3amales 3amalnutrition 3amechanical properties 3amineralization 3amodulus of elasticity 3arats 0aUndernutrition 0aBone quality 0aCatch-up growth 0aBody mass1 aBozzini, Clarisa1 aAgûero Romero, Alan1 aPinto, Patricia1 aChampin, Graciela1 aAlippi, Rosa M.1 aBoyer, Patricia1 aBozzini, Carlos E.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2016 May 14, v. 115, no. 9 p.1687-1695dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000711451600060X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245009000166300001600256520116100272536016801433592002801601650001801629650001501647650001101662650001701673650001301690650000901703650001901712650001101731650002501742650001701767650001601784650001301800650001001813650000901823650001901832650001301851650001401864650001301878700002301891700002101914700002101935700001601956773012401972856008002096852000902176655001202185IND60623557620221118232059.0181127e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062355762DNAL7 a10.1177/1098612X145412622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewton, Jamie A10aExtra-nodal subcutaneous Hodgkin’s-like lymphoma and subsequent regression in a cat  ap. 543-547.  aHodgkin’s-like lymphoma is a slow growing neoplasm, usually affecting the lymph nodes of the head and neck, which has been sporadically described in veterinary patients. This report describes the clinical and histopathological features in a 9-year-old male neutered Siamese cat that presented with a 6 week history of mid-dorsocranial swelling. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated positive staining for CD79a, paired box protein and B lymphocyte antigen-36, with variable, weak-to-moderate cytoplasmic staining for human leukocyte antigen-DR and CD18, and negative staining for antimacrophage antibody. The diagnosis based on incisional biopsy was Hodgkin’s-like lymphoma; however, no evidence of neoplasia was found following wide surgical excision. This case report demonstrates two unreported items of note: the novel extranodal site of Hodgkin’s-like lymphoma in a cat and tumour regression following initial biopsy. It is hypothesised that the surgical trauma of biopsying the lesion or the introduction of foreign material may have caused the regression of the neoplastic cells through induction of an anti-tumour immune or inflammatory response.  aFunding The authors received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors for the preparation of this case report.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aantibodies 3abiopsy 3acase studies 3aexcision 3ahead 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3alymph nodes 3alymphoma 3amales 3aneck 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3aremission 3astaining1 ade Vicente, Felipe1 aHaugland, Sean P1 aScase, Timothy J1 aHelm, Jenny0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 17, no. 6 p.543-547dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X145412623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245013300163300002000296500001900316520113500335592002801470650002501498650003001523650001601553650002001569650002001589650001801609650002601627650001001653650001301663650001901676650002301695653003101718653003801749653002301787653002501810653003001835700005601865700001701921700005401938700001301992700001202005700001902017700005702036700005602093773014202149856007802291852000902369655001202378IND60711085320221122224908.0200916e20200824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071108532DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c131692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Dongdong10aBacterial Vesicle-Cancer Cell Hybrid Membrane-Coated Nanoparticles for Tumor Specific Immune Activation and Photothermal Therapy  ap. 41138-41147.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCell membrane camouflaged nanoparticles (NPs) have been increasingly explored to leverage natural cellular functions and adapt to various biomedical applications.

We harness the advantage of OMV immunotherapy together with HPDA-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) to improve the antitumor efficacy toward melanoma. When injected intravenously via the tail vein, HPDA@[OMV-CC] NPs homogeneously target melanoma and activate the immune response by rapidly stimulating dendritic cell (DC) maturation in lymph nodes in the vaccinated mice. Our results show that the antitumor immune response and PTT reciprocally potentiate the therapeutic ability and fully eradicate melanoma without notable adverse effects. The homogeneous-target and immune activation hybrid biomimetic membrane provides the adaptability to various synergistic therapeutic and imaging applications by incorporating payload with application-specific functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3abacterial outer membranes 3acaudal vein 3adendritic cells 3aimmune response 3aimmunotherapy 3aintravenous injection 3alymph 3amelanoma 3aneoplasm cells 3aphotothermotherapy 0ahybrid biomimetic membrane 0ahollow polydopamine nanoparticles 0ahomogeneous target 0aphotothermal therapy 0aantitumor immune response1 aLiu, Conghui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4873-82771 aYou, Shiquan1 aZhang, Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3761-32091 aLi, Meng1 aCao, Yu1 aWang, Changtao1 aDong, Haifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6907-65781 aZhang, Xueji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0035-38210 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 24, v. 12, no. 37 p.41138-41147dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c131693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008900161300001800250520160300268592002801871650001501899650002001914650001201934650001301946650001701959650001001976650001801986650001302004650001702017650000902034700002302043700002102066773012002087856007502207852000902282655001202291IND60533959820170629000000.0160802e20121018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053395982DNAL7 a10.1021/ef301081q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalamanca, Maurin10aParticulate Formation in Premixed and Counter-flow Diffusion Ethylene/Ethanol Flames  ap. 6144-6152.  aThe role of ethanol, as substituent to ethylene, on the formation of particulate matter has been investigated in different flame configurations by using in situ optical techniques. Laser induced fluorescence and incandescence signals, correlated to small precursor nanoparticles and large soot particles, respectively, have been measured in premixed and counter-flow diffusion flames of ethylene doped with different amounts of ethanol, covering a wide range of ethanol addition, much higher than that reported in the literature. In premixed flames, the addition of ethanol reduces nanoparticle and soot particle formation. The effect is stronger for the soot particles, that is, particles with sizes larger than 10 nm, and in flames operated close to the soot threshold limit. The addition of 30% of ethanol reduces soot particle concentration below the detection limit, whereas nanoparticles are still formed in large amounts. The counter-flow diffusion flame configuration shows a different behavior. In the fuel side of the flame, a noticeable increase of both nanoparticle and soot particle concentrations is detected for amounts of ethanol added up to 20 vol %, whereas a decrease of the particulate formation, both nanoparticles and soot, is observed for larger amounts of ethanol added. Conversely, in the oxidizer side of the flame, particulate matter is always reduced when ethanol is added to the fuel. The results show that the role of ethanol in the formation of nanoparticles and soot is not always in the sense of reduction, but it also strongly depends on the combustion conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3adetection limit 3aethanol 3aethylene 3afluorescence 3afuels 3ananoparticles 3aoxidants 3aparticulates 3asoot1 aSirignano, Mariano1 aD’Anna, Andrea0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2012 Oct. 18, v. 26, no. 10 p.6144-6152dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef301081q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245018600169300001800355520136700373592002801740596006101768650001301829650002901842650002501871650001701896650001801913650001901931650001701950650001901967650002101986650001302007650001902020650001402039650001902053650001402072650001302086650002002099650001302119650003702132700002002169700002202189700001902211700002602230700006402256773014602320856008302466852000902549655001202558IND60754778120221120082332.0211023e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075477812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-021-02637-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, Shraddha10aBiogenic synthesis and characterization of selenium nanoparticles and their applications with special reference to antibacterial, antioxidant, anticancer and photocatalytic activity  ap. 2679-2696.  aOxyanions of selenium, selenite (SeO₃)²⁻ and selenate (SeO₄)²⁻ are toxic to terrestrial and aquatic biota but few microorganisms including cyanobacteria are resistant to high levels of selenite. Cyanobacteria evade selenite toxicity through bioreduction and synthesis of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs). In this study, extracellular biosynthesis of SeNPs (Se⁰) using cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 on exposure to sodium selenite and characterization was done by using UV–visible spectroscopy, SEM–EDX, TEM and FTIR analyses which confirmed spherical shape with size range of 5–50 nm diameter. These biogenic SeNPs demonstrated significant antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity against bacterial pathogens. Furthermore, these SeNPs showed high antioxidant activity at minimum concentration of 50 µg/mL and significant anti-proliferative activity against HeLa cell line with IC₅₀ value of 5.5 µg/mL. The SeNPs also induced accumulation of cancer cells in the sub-G1 phase which was clearly observed in cellular and nuclear morphology. These biofabricated SeNPs also reduced and decolorized toxic methylene blue dye significantly through photocatalytic degradation. Therefore Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 may be employed as a green bioresource to synthesize SeNPs with potential applications in medicine and environmental bioremediation.  aPublisher supplied data  a5/13/51/2020/NCD-IIIcIndian Council of Medical Research 3aAnabaena 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abioprocessing 3abioremediation 3abiosynthesis 3adecolorization 3ahuman cell lines 3amedicine 3amethylene blue 3aoxyanions 3aphotocatalysis 3aselenates 3aselenium 3asodium selenite 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aAwasthee, Nikee1 aShekher, Anusmita1 aRai, Lal Chand1 aGupta, Subash Chandra1 aDubey, Santosh Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4601-76550 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2021 Dec., v. 44, no. 12 p.2679-2696dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3920376x1615-75917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-021-02637-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245007600181300001600257520096900273536018301242592002801425596010601453596008201559650002001641650000901661650002001670650002301690650001201713650002001725650001501745650002401760650002401784650001001808653002401818653001401842653002001856653002601876653002301902653002001925700002101945773012801966856008502094852000902179655001202188IND60595495520221121065251.0180605e20180704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059549552DNAL7 a10.1080/09064710.2017.14161562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollins, Obiora Cornelius10aOptimal control of foliar disease dynamics for multiple maize varieties  ap. 412-423.  aMaize is a very important food crop world-wide and is vulnerable to diseases. Maize varieties that have high disease resistance are highly recommended for economic and health reasons. We consider a maize field with multiply varieties and develop a mathematical model to investigate the impact of foliar disease on the population dynamics. The possible benefit of considering control measures in reducing the spread of foliar diseases are evaluated. Results show that farmers must be aware of the disease dynamics of each variety as the dynamics vary. Also, in controlling diseases some methods are more effective than others. For the example given here controlling susceptibility of seeds to disease was the most effective method. As controlling diseases can be costly, optimal methods are important. Our results show that the most effective controls are those introduced at the outset of an outbreak and this can reduce the spread of diseases with the least cost.  aThis work was supported by the African Union Research Grant (supported by the European Union) AURG/090/2012 and the South African Department of Science and Technology UID: 92810.  aPublisher supplied data  aUID: 92810cSouth African Department of Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006312  aAURG/090/2012cAfrican Union Research Grant (supported by the European Union) 3acontrol methods 3acorn 3adisease control 3adisease resistance 3afarmers 3afoliar diseases 3afood crops 3amathematical models 3apopulation dynamics 3aseeds 0aPopulation dynamics 0amodelling 0amaize varieties 0amaize foliar diseases 0astability analyses 0aoptimal control1 aDuffy, Kevin Jan0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2018 July 4, v. 68, no. 5 p.412-423dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4441738x1651-19137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2017.14161563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009200166300001600258520141600274592002801690650003401718650003701752650001501789650001901804650000901823650001101832650000701843650001101850650001801861650002301879650001201902653001001914653001501924653001001939653003401949700001401983700001201997700001302009700001602022700001702038773011402055856008502169852000902254655001202263IND60610701820221122004006.0180829e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061070182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Haibo10aMechanical investigation of U(VI) on pyrrhotite by batch, EXAFS and modeling techniques  ap. 488-498.  aThe interaction mechanism of U(VI) on pyrrhotite was demonstrated by batch, spectroscopic and modeling techniques. Pyrite was selected as control group in this study. The removal of U(VI) on pyrite and pyrrhotite significantly decreased with increasing ionic strength from 0.001 to 0.1mol/L at pH 2.0–6.0, whereas the no effect of ionic strength was observed at pH >6.0. The maximum removal capacity of U(VI) on pyrite and pyrrhotite calculated from Langmuir model was 10.20 and 21.34mgg⁻¹ at pH 4.0 and 333K, respectively. The XPS analysis indicated the U(VI) was primarily adsorbed on pyrrhotite and pyrite and then approximately 15.5 and 9.8% of U(VI) were reduced to U(IV) by pyrrhotite and pyrite after 20 days, respectively. Based on the XANES analysis, the adsorption edge of uranium-containing pyrrhotite located between UᴵⱽO2(s) and UⱽᴵO2²⁺ spectra. The EXAFS analysis demonstrated the inner-sphere surface complexation of U(VI) on pyrrhotite due to the occurrence of U-S shell, whereas the U-U shell revealed the reductive co-precipitates of U(VI) on pyrrhotite/pyrite with increasing reaction times. The surface complexation modeling showed that outer- and inner-surface complexation dominated the U(VI) removal at pH<4 and pH>5.0, respectively. The findings presented herein play a crucial role in the removal of radionuclides on iron sulfide in environmental cleanup applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aionic strength 3airon 3amodels 3apH 3apyrite 3aradionuclides 3asorption isotherms 3auranium 0aU(VI) 0aPyrrhotite 0aEXAFS 0aSurface complexation modeling1 aZhu, Yuke1 aXu, Bin1 aLi, Ping1 aSun, Yubing1 aChen, Tianhu0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 322 p.488-498dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01515naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010200162300001600264500001900280520036600299592002800665650001800693650001700711650001500728650002100743650001500764653002000779653001400799700001800813700001900831700001800850700001900868773018300887856007401070852000901144655001201153IND60692925120221120021947.0200503e20130423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069292512DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1209662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKOBAYASHI, Ryohei10aSynthesis of Okicamelliaside, a Glucoside of Ellagic Acid with Potent Anti-Degranulation Activity  ap. 810-813.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOkicamelliaside, a glucoside of ellagic acid with potent anti-degranulation activity, was synthesized from ellagic acid.

Reduction in grazing intensity has frequently been recommended to meet biodiversity and production goals in sustainable grazing systems. The objective of this experiment was to measure N and P ingestion and excretion by beef cattle grazing semiânatural pastures at two grazing intensities (Moderate or Lenient). The cattle grazing at Moderate grazing intensity had significantly more defaecations each day than those grazing at Lenient intensity (9Â·5 vs. 7Â·5) and tended to have more urinations (7Â·0 vs. 5Â·8). For the Moderate and Lenient treatments, respectively, 113 vs. 76âgâNâdâ1 was excreted compared with 136 vs. 94âgâNâdâ1 ingested; 12 vs. 8âgâPâdâ1 was excreted compared with 13 vs. 10âgâPâdâ1 ingested and urine N comprised 0Â·51 and 0Â·52 of the total N excreted each day. In improved, intensively managed grassland systems, urine N comprises a much higher proportion (approximately 0Â·70â0Â·85) of the daily total N excreted. The lower level found here is likely to impact on potential volatilization, denitrification and leaching losses, and these aspects should be examined further to see the extent to which semiâimproved grasslands containing increased plant diversity compared with improved grasslands can deliver higher resource protection, as well as enhanced grassland faunal diversity and abundance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aurine 3avolatilization 3abeef cattle 3aphosphorus 3aingestion 3agrasslands 3asustainable agriculture 3anitrogen content 3asoil pollution 3apastures 3aair 3aurination 3aleaching 3adefecation 3abiodiversity 3adenitrification 3aexcretion 3anitrogen 3agrazing intensity 3aenvironmental impact 0agrazing1 aGriffith, B.

W.10aFurther advances in orchid mycorrhizal research  ap. 475-486.  aReview  aOrchid mycorrhizas are mutualistic interactions between fungi and members of the Orchidaceae, the world’s largest plant family. The majority of the world’s orchids are photosynthetic, a small number of species are myco-heterotrophic throughout their lifetime, and recent research indicates a third mode (mixotrophy) whereby green orchids supplement their photosynthetically fixed carbon with carbon derived from their mycorrhizal fungus. Molecular identification studies of orchid-associated fungi indicate a wide range of fungi might be orchid mycobionts, show common fungal taxa across the globe and support the view that some orchids have specific fungal interactions. Confirmation of mycorrhizal status requires isolation of the fungi and restoration of functional mycorrhizas. New methods may now be used to store orchid-associated fungi and store and germinate seed, leading to more efficient culture of orchid species. However, many orchid mycorrhizas must be synthesised before conservation of these associations can be attempted in the field. Further gene expression studies of orchid mycorrhizas are needed to better understand the establishment and maintenance of the interaction. These data will add to efforts to conserve this diverse and valuable association.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrchidaceae 3acarbon 3agene expression 3amethodology 3amycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 2aAscomycotaxclassificationxphysiology. 2aBasidiomycotaxclassificationxphysiology. 2aMycorrhizaexphysiology 2aOrchidaceaexclassificationxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aResearch 2aSymbiosis0 tMycorrhiza.g2007 Sept., v. 17, no. 6 p.475-486dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58547x0940-63607nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-007-0138-13Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01795naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008600168300001600254520081200270592002801082650001101110650000901121650001201130650001401142650002301156650002501179650001501204650001901219700002101238773011901259856008201378852000901460655001201469IND60616907220221118144738.0181021e200102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061690722DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517501071002102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, J.I.N.R.10aMicroencapsulation of Acid Dyes in Mixed Lecithin/Surfactant Liposomic Structures  ap. 153-156.  aNon-uniformity occurring in polyamide dyeing, caused by the rapid uptake of dye by the fibers, can be reduced by retarding and leveling agents. The objective of this work is to study microencapsulation of the dye in liposomes with lecithin from soy, as an alternative to retarding and leveling agents. Liposomes are prepared with soy lecithin at different concentrations, containing the commercial acid dye C.I. Acid Blue 113. The effect on the dyeing rate of the microencapsulated dyes is compared with that from common retarding and leveling agents. The influence of surfactants on the stability of the liposomes and hence on the exhaustion curves of the dyeing is evaluated; exhaustion curves from anionic and a non-ionic surfactants are comparable to those from commercial retarding and leveling agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3adyeing 3adyes 3afabrics 3alecithins 3amicroencapsulation 3anonionic surfactants 3apolyamides 3atextile fibers1 aBaptista, A.L.F.0 tTextile research journal.g2001 Feb., v. 71, no. 2 p.153-156dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517501071002103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01679naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007500159300001600234520067500250592002800925650002100953650002200974650001400996650001601010650002601026650001101052700001901063700001901082700001501101700001401116700001601130773010001146856007401246852000901320655001201329IND60440430620221122051909.0151024e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044043062DNAL7 a10.1007/BF028176682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNesměrák, K.10aEffect of structure on antibiotic action of new 9-(ethylthio)acridines  ap. 118-120.  aSix new 9-(ethylthio)acridine derivatives were examined for antibacterial and antifungal activities with 10 bacterial and 8 yeast strains.

Here, the stability and expression pattern of AtHB7 (Arabidopsis homeodomain-leucine zipper class I) cDNA was characterized in 220 random population of transformed tomato clones where no AtHB7 orthologous has been identified in to date. Integration of p35S::AtHB7 casette was tested by the amplification of the stretches (700/425 bp) in the target by NPT II/AtHB7 oligos. Transcriptional expression pattern for the amplicons of the specific transcripts in the leaf tissues of transformants were determined by qRT-PCR. Transgene copy number was negatively correlated with transgene expression level, yet a majority of transformants (78%) carried single-copy of transgene. About 1:3 of the lines containing two-copy inserts showed less transcript expression. Heterologous CaMV 35S promoter drove AtHB7, illuminated no penalty on transgene expression levels, stability or plant phenotype under drought stress. Integration and expression analysis of transcription factors is of great significance for reliable prediction of gene dosing/functions in plant genomes so as to sustain breeding under abiotic stress to guarantee food security.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aabscisic acid 3abreeding 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3afood security 3agene expression 3aleaves 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3apromoter regions 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atomatoes 3atraffic 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atransgenes 3awater stress0 t3 Biotech.g2019 Jan., v. 9, no. 1 p.15-15dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-018-1542-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013000170300001600300520092800316592002801244650001901272650002001291650002001311650001901331650001001350650001001360650001801370650001101388650001501399650001301414650003101427650001301458653001901471653001901490653002601509653002201535653002301557700002101580700001601601700001701617773011301634856008601747852000901833655001201842IND50060659420221120201539.0190408e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006065942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.12.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJindal, Manish10aExploring potential new gum source Aegle marmelos for food and pharmaceuticals: Physical, chemical and functional performance  ap. 312-318.  aGums constitute a major group of naturally occurring polymers.

This implies that exposing salmon to such water temperatures is a welfare risk, not only due to the direct tissue injuries that may also be dependent on exposure time, but also due to risk of thermal pain and aversion, including flight reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaligidae 3aSalmo salar 3aacute effects 3abrain 3aexposure duration 3aeyes 3afarmed fish 3agills 3alaboratory experimentation 3alouse control 3anasal cavity 3apain 3arisk 3asalmon 3athymus gland 3awater temperature 0aFish 0aDelousing 0aThermal pain 0aTissue damage 0aWelfare1 aGåsnes, Siri K.1 aGu, Jinni1 aStien, Lars H.1 aMadaro, Angelico1 aNilsson, Jonatan0 tVeterinary and Animal Science.g2019 Dec., v. 8 p.100081-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23501x2451-943X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vas.2019.1000813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01360naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245018300160300001600343520037700359592002800736650001700764650001100781650001400792700001700806700002000823700001700843700001500860773010000875856007400975852000901049655001201058IND60440430820221122051902.0151024e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044043082DNAL7 a10.1007/BF028176702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWasfy, A.

Application of this archive to reconstruct the Nd isotope composition of bottom seawater in shallow shelf environments remained however to be tested. Yet as the Nd isotope composition of seawater on continental margins is particularly sensitive to changes in erosional inputs, establishment of neritic seawater Nd isotope evolution around areas of deep water formation would be useful to discriminate the influence of changes in oceanic circulation and in isotopic composition of erosional inputs on the Nd isotope record of deep waters. The purpose of this study is to test the potential of Fe–Mn coatings leached from foraminifera tests to reconstruct the Nd isotope composition of seawater in shelf environments for deep-time intervals. Albian to Turonian samples from two different outcrops have been recovered, from the Paris Basin (Wissant section, northern France) and from the Western Interior Seaway (Hot Spring, South Dakota, USA), that were deposited in epicontinental seas. Rare Earth Element (REE) spectra enriched in middle REEs in the foraminifera leach at Wissant highlight the presence of Fe–Mn oxides. The similarity of the Nd isotopic signal of the Fe–Mn oxide fraction leached from foraminifera tests with that of fish teeth suggests that Fe–Mn oxides coating foraminifera can be good archives of shelf bottom seawater Nd isotopic composition. Inferred bottom shelf water Nd isotope compositions at Wissant range from −8.5 to −9.7 ε-units, about 1.5–2 ε-units higher than that of the contemporaneous local detrital fraction. At Hot Spring, linear REE spectra characterizing foraminifera leach may point to an absence of authigenic marine Fe–Mn oxide formation in this area during the Late Cenomanian–Early Turonian, consistent with dysoxic to anoxic conditions at Hot Spring, contemporaneous to an Oceanic Anoxic Event. The similarity of the Nd isotopic signal of the carbonate matrix of foraminifera with that of fish teeth suggests that it records the Nd isotope composition of bottom shelf seawater as well. Inferred bottom shelf water Nd isotope compositions at Hot Spring are quite radiogenic, between −7 and −6 ε-units, about 2.5–4 ε-units higher than that of the contemporaneous local detrital fraction. In contrast, in both sections Fe–Mn oxides leached directly from the decarbonated sediment tend to yield a less radiogenic Nd isotopic composition, typically between 0.2 and 0.8 ε-units lower, that is intermediate between that of fish teeth and of the detrital fraction. This suggests the contribution of pre-formed continental Fe–Mn oxides to the Nd isotopic signal, along with authigenic marine oxides, or a detrital contamination during leaching.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3acoatings 3afish 3ahot springs 3aisotopes 3aleaching 3aoxides 3arare earth elements 3aseawater 3asediments 3ateeth 3aFrance 3aSouth Dakota1 aPucéat, Emmanuelle1 aBayon, Germain1 aDesmares, Delphine1 aDera, Guillaume1 aDurlet, Christophe1 aDeconinck, Jean-François,1 aAmédro, Francis,1 aGourlan, Alexandra T.1 aPellenard, Pierre1 aBomou, Brahimsamba0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2012 Dec. 15, v. 99 p.39-56dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.09.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011500159300001800274500001900292520128500311592002801596650002001624650001801644650002601662650001601688650001701704650001801721650001101739650001501750650001701765650001101782650001701793650001301810650001401823650001401837653002201851653002701873653001901900653001901919700001401938700001501952700001601967700001601983700001701999773018402016856007402200852000902274655001202283IND60692925620221117170833.0200503e20130523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069292562DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1209762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSONG, Dianrong10aEstablishment of an in Vitro Model of the Human Placental Barrier by Placenta Slice Culture and Ussing Chamber  ap. 1030-1034.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOur purpose was to establish an in vitro model of the human placental barrier based on placenta slice culture and Ussing chamber. The villous morphology, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG), mRNA and efflux function of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and the permeability of the fluorescent marker were confirmed. The results showed that syncytiotrophoblast cells with abundant endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria were covered with a dense microvillus in the placenta slice. The β-hCG secretion levels in the Ussing chamber were 274.13 ± 13.52 mIU/mL at 5 h, significantly higher than that in the incubator 95.2 ± 13.14 mIU/mL, and β-hCG continued to secrete for 48 h. P-gp mRNA was expressed in the placenta slice. The Rho123 apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) value from maternal side to the fetal side was 26.34 ± 1.87 nm/s, but it was significantly increased, to 289.55 ± 6.02 nm/s after adding verapamil. The Rho123 efflux value was >2. The fluorescein Papp value was (3.42 ± 0.24) × 10⁻³ nm/s. In contrast, the fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FD70) Papp value was (3.93 ± 0.08) × 10⁻⁵ nm/s. This indicates that the placenta slice in the Ussing chamber had the activity of a placenta, and can act as a valuable in vitro model of placental barrier.  aPublisher supplied data 3aP-glycoproteins 3abiotechnology 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afluorescein 3afluorescence 3agonadotropins 3ahumans 3amicrovilli 3amitochondria 3amodels 3apermeability 3aplacenta 3asecretion 3averapamil 0aplacental barrier 0aplacenta slice culture 0aUssing chamber 0ain vitro model1 aGuo, Jie,1 aHan, Fang,1 aZhang, Wei,1 aWANG, Yanan1 aWang, Yuhua,0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2013 May 23, v. 77, no. 5 p.1030-1034dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.1209763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03940naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245016000177500001400337520191100351592002802262650002002290650002202310650002702332650001702359650001902376650001102395650001102406650001802417650001502435650001202450650001702462650001602479650002102495650002302516650001702539650001302556650000702569650001502576650002102591650001502612650001602627650001702643650000902660650001502669650001902684650001202703650000902715650001502724653001602739653001802755653001902773653001802792653002502810653001602835653002402851653002002875700002702895700002202922700002202944700002002966700002302986700002303009773009203032856008503124852000903209655001203218IND60670414120221122180308.0200103e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067041412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rhisph.2019.1001702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMumtaz, Muhammad Zahid10aProduction of lactic and acetic acids by Bacillus sp. ZM20 and Bacillus cereus following exposure to zinc oxide: A possible mechanism for Zn solubilization  aNAL-light  aZinc (Zn) occurs in high concentrations in heavy metal polluted ecosystems which are colonized by bacterial populations. Some members of these communities are attractive candidates for phytoremediation of Zn-contaminated soils as they are able to convert insoluble forms of Zn into soluble forms, making Zn available to plants as a micronutrient. However, mechanisms of bacterial Zn solubilization and homeostasis are often not well understood. In the present study, two Gram positive rhizosphere strains, Bacillus sp. ZM20 and Bacillus subtilis ZM63, which were shown previously to solubilize phosphate and produce indole acetic acid plus siderophores, and two laboratory strains selected as controls (Bacillus cereus and Paenibacillus polymyxa), were tested for their ability to solubilize zinc oxide (ZnO). All of the strains tested could solubilize Zn to some degree, as they produced acids that lowered the medium pH. Two strains, Bacillus sp. ZM20 and B. cereus, were more Zn and acid resistant. When cultured aerobically in a minimum salt medium with glucose as carbon source plus 0.1% (w/v) Zn as ZnO, Bacillus sp. ZM20 and B. cereus both produced significantly higher concentrations of lactic and acetic acids than detected in control broths lacking Zn, with formic, citric, succinic, isobutyric and isovaleric acids detected as minor end-products. In in vitro tests, mixtures and individual acids at concentrations seen in broth cultures were shown to solubilize ZnO. However, the less acid- and Zn-resistant strains showed lower Zn solubility efficiency at higher concentrations of ZnO, as their growth was impaired, and higher concentrations of acids were not induced to the same extent by culture in ZnO. Induction of lactic, acetic, succinic, formic, isobutyric and isovaleric acids during culture correlated with ZnO solubilization, which has not been shown before for Gram positive species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aBacillus subtilis 3aPaenibacillus polymyxa 3aacetic acids 3aacid tolerance 3abroths 3acarbon 3aculture media 3aecosystems 3aglucose 3aheavy metals 3ahomeostasis 3ain vitro studies 3aindole acetic acid 3alaboratories 3amixtures 3apH 3aphosphates 3aphytoremediation 3apopulation 3arhizosphere 3asiderophores 3asoil 3asolubility 3asolubilization 3astrains 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aAcidophilic 0aBacillus spp. 0aBioremediation 0aOrganic acids 0aVolatile fatty acids 0aZincophilic 0aZinc solubilization 0aStress response1 aBarry, K.q(Karen M.),1 aBaker, Anthony L.1 aNichols, David S.1 aAhmad, Maqshoof1 aZahir, Zahir Ahmad1 aBritz, Margaret L.0 tRhizosphere.g2019 Dec., v. 12 p.100170-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23357x2452-21987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2019.1001703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245011300204300001200317500001900329520109700348592002801445650001301473650000801486650001801494650002001512650000901532650002301541650000901564650001301573650001901586650002301605651001001628700002301638700002501661700003401686700002001720700002001740700002001760700002101780773014101801856008301942852000902025655001202034IND60705075020221121082013.0200928e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070507502DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-020-04790-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGordo, Elisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0099-589110aTemporary Variations and Sources of Trace Metal and Radionuclides in Atmospheric Aerosols of Málaga (Spain)  ap. 419.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study focuses on the simultaneous analysis of metallic species and radionuclide data from January 2009 to December 2011 in the dust deposited on filters in Málaga (Spain). Some metallic elements (Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, Zn, Pb, Cu, Ni) and radionuclides (⁷Be and ²¹⁰Pb) have been determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy and gamma spectrometry, respectively. For this analysis, daily variation of PM₁₀ mass concentration was additionally recorded at the nearest station belonging to the regional atmospheric pollution monitoring network. The comparison between ²¹⁰Pb, elemental lead, and PM₁₀ mass concentration reveals a different time variation for raining months, and an increase in the ²¹⁰Pb/Pb ratio indicates local sources of the particulate mass. Principal components analysis (PCA) applied to the datasets and calculation of enrichment factors relative to soil and seawater reveal that the atmospheric aerosol chemistry in this area of the Mediterranean is mostly influenced by crustal and marine sources rather than anthropogenic ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair pollution 3adata collection 3adust 3agamma spectrometry 3alead 3aseawater 3asoil pollution 3atemporal variation 3aSpain1 aGonzález, Rocío,1 aDueñas, Concepción1 adel Carmen Fernández, María1 aCañete, Sergio1 aCabello, María1 aPérez, Manuel,1 aLiger, Esperanza0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2020 Aug., v. 231, no. 8 p.419-419dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-020-04790-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02072naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245008700163300001600250520087000266592002801136650001501164650001601179650001601195650001001211650002001221650001401241650001701255650001601272650002101288650000901309650001101318650001701329650002701346650001701373650001801390650001701408700002401425773011801449856007401567852000901641655001201650IND60440430920221122052008.0151024e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044043092DNAL7 a10.1007/BF028176712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeka Boruah, H.

CSMR is a solid waste mainly consisting of cemented soil generated from ground improvement and currently ends up in a landfill. Alkali-activated calcined CSMR (AA-CSMR) specimens were prepared and tested. The test variables included silicate modulus (Mₛ) and alkali dosage of activators, curing regimes, as well as the incorporation of slag. The alkaline activation products were characterized using X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Results demonstrate that ambient-cured AA-CSMR cement shows rapid early strength development and achieves a maximum 28-day compressive strength of 33.2 MPa, which can even be increased to 50 MPa or higher by either incorporating 10% ground blast furnace slag or 1-day curing at 70 °C. The primary reaction products of the AA-CSMR cement are C–(A)–S–H gels, which could be traced back to the reactive calcium-rich amorphous phases formed in the CSMR by the calcination. Ecological parameters demonstrate that in comparison to the ordinary Portland cement, the AA-CSMR cements save around 60% and 70% embodied energy and CO₂ emissions, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon dioxide 3acement 3acompression strength 3aembodied energy 3afeasibility studies 3afurnaces 3agreen chemistry 3alandfills 3asilicates 3aslags 3asoil 3asolid wastes 3athermogravimetry 0aCutter soil mixing 0aSoil−cement waste 0aAlkali-activated materials 0aAlkali dosage 0aSilicate modulus1 aYuan, Qiang1 aLi, Jiabin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7333-03210 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Dec. 20, v. 10, no. 1 p.288-304dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c061943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009400169300001400263520110800277592002801385650002501413650002001438650002101458650001801479650001701497650001701514650002301531650002101554650002001575650002601595650002501621650000901646650001501655653000901670653000801679653000801687653000801695653001001703653000901713653000801722653000901730653000801739653000801747653000801755653000901763653000801772653000801780653000801788653000801796653000901804653000801813653000801821653000801829653000801837653001001845653000701855653000901862653000901871653000701880653000801887653000901895653000901904653001801913653002901931653001701960653002501977653002102002653002002023653001802043700001602061700002902077773009802106856008702204852000902291655001202300IND60525984520221119103840.0190402e20160401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052598452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasisi, Kabo10aAntioxidant properties of diverse cereal grains: A review on in vitro and in vivo studies  ap. 90-97.  aCereal grains and products have gained popularity in contributing to healthy eating behavior because of their antioxidant properties associated with protection against chronic diseases. In this review, notable studies on the in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity of commonly consumed cereal grains are summarized. Cereals contain phytochemicals or certain minor components with antioxidant properties. The antioxidant potential of cereals depends on their bioaccessibility, absorption in the gastrointestinal and their bioavailability utilization in vivo. The in vitro gastrointestinal digestion and fermentation of cereals increased their antioxidant potentials which are significantly correlated with their total phenolic contents. Most studies performed in vivo have been concerned with the antioxidant properties of colored rice, wheat bran and rye products. There are inadequate in vitro and in vivo studies on antioxidative potentials of fermented versus unfermented cereals. Therefore, further studies are necessary to maximize possible health benefits of cereal antioxidative phytochemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abioavailability 3achronic diseases 3aeating habits 3afermentation 3ahealthy diet 3ain vitro digestion 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3aintestinal absorption 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3arice 3awheat bran 0aABTS 0aAOP 0aCAA 0aCAT 0aCUPRA 0aDPPH 0aFOs 0aFRAP 0aGAE 0aGPx 0aGSH 0aGSSG 0aHAT 0aLDL 0aLOX 0aNSP 0aORAC 0aPOX 0aROS 0aSOD 0aTAC 0aTBARS 0aTE 0aTEAC 0aTOSC 0aTP 0aTPC 0aTRAP 0aWEAX 0aCereal grains 0aBioactive phytochemicals 0aAntioxidants 0aAntioxidant capacity 0aOxidative stress 0aHealth benefits 0aHuman studies1 aBeta, Trust1 aMoghadasian, Mohammed H.0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 196 p.90-97dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245012700183300001600310520157700326592002801903650003001931650002101961650001101982650002101993650001502014650002102029650001902050650001402069650001402083650001102097650001402108650001102122650001102133650002202144650001102166650002302177650001202200650002002212650002302232700001902255700002002274700001902294773014302313852000902456856008202465655001202547IND4394590720221120055043.0200207e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439459072DNAL7 a176022202pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-007-1055-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Kyo Seong10aEffects of dilution on dissolved oxygen depletion and microbial populations in the biochemical oxygen demand determination  ap. 951-956.  aThe biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) value is still a key parameter that can determine the level of organics, particularly the content of biodegradable organics in water. In this work, the effects of sample dilution, which should be done inevitably to get appropriate dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion, on the measurement of 5-day BOD (BOD₅), was investigated with and without seeding using natural and synthetic water. The dilution effects were also evaluated for water samples taken in different seasons such as summer and winter because water temperature can cause a change in the types of microbial species, thus leading to different oxygen depletion profiles during BOD testing. The predation phenomenon between microbial cells was found to be dependent on the inorganic nutrients and carbon sources, showing a change in cell populations according to cell size after 5-day incubation. The dilution of water samples for BOD determination was linked to changes in the environment for microbial growth such as nutrition. The predation phenomenon between microbial cells was more important with less dilution. BOD₅ increased with the specific amount of inorganic nutrient per microbial mass when the natural water was diluted. When seeding was done for synthetic water samples, the seed volume also affected BOD due to the rate of organic uptake by microbes. BOD₅ increased with the specific bacterial population per organic source supplied at the beginning of BOD measurement. For more accurate BOD measurements, specific guidelines on dilution should be established.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiodegradability 3acarbon 3adissolved oxygen 3aguidelines 3amicrobial growth 3amicroorganisms 3anutrients 3anutrition 3aoxygen 3apredation 3asowing 3asummer 3awater temperature 3awinter 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aSeasons 2aWaterxanalysis 2aWater Microbiology1 aChang, Ho-nam,1 aPark, Joong Kon1 aChoo, Kwang-Ho0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2007 Sept., v. 76, no. 4 p.951-956dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-007-1055-03Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03432naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002500183245010800208300001200316506007600328520174600404592002802150506003702178650001402215650001802229650001602247650001502263650002402278650001002302650001602312650002802328650001702356650001102373650001802384650002202402650001102424650002202435650001102457650000902468650001602477650003902493650002402532700002102556700002002577700002502597700002202622700001902644700002302663700002202686773009202708856004502800852000902845655001202854IND4471604520221207122128.0130416e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447160452DNAL7 a212414652pmid7 aPMC30346672pmcid7 a10.1186/1475-2891-10-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchusdziarra, Volker10aImpact of breakfast on daily energy intake - an analysis of absolute versus relative breakfast calories  ap. 330.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: The role of breakfast energy in total daily energy intake is a matter of debate. Acute feeding experiments demonstrated that high breakfast energy leads to greater overall intake supported by cross-sectional data of a free-living population. On the other hand, a large intraindividual analysis has indicated that a high proportion of breakfast to overall intake is associated with lower daily energy intake. To evaluate these apparently contradictory results in greater detail both ways of analysis were applied to the same data set of dietary records. METHODS: On an intraindividual basis total daily energy intake was related to the absolute values of breakfast energy intake or to the ratio of breakfast to overall intake, respectively. Food intake of 280 obese and 100 normal weight subjects was analyzed who recorded over 10 (obese) or 14 (normal weight) consecutive days, respectively. RESULTS: Increasing breakfast energy was associated with greater overall intake in normal weight and obese subjects. The increasing ratio of breakfast to total daily energy intake was associated with a significant reduction of overall intake on days where post-breakfast energy was significantly reduced. Correlational and multiple regression analysis support the concept that absolute breakfast calories have the strongest influence on daily energy intake. CONCLUSION: Reduced breakfast energy intake is associated with lower total daily intake. The influence of the ratio of breakfast to overall energy intake largely depends on the post-breakfast rather than breakfast intake pattern. Therefore, overweight and obese subjects should consider the reduction of breakfast calories as a simple option to improve their daily energy balance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreakfast 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3aoverweight 3aregression analysis 2aAdult 2aBody Weight 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet Records 2aEating 2aEnergy Intake 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxepidemiologyxmetabolism. 2aRegression Analysis1 aHausmann, Margit1 aWittke, Claudia1 aMittermeier, Johanna1 aKellner, Marietta1 aNaumann, Aline1 aWagenpfeil, Stefan1 aErdmann, Johannes0 tNutrition journal.g2011 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.330-330dSpringer-Verlagx1475-28917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2891-10-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015500169300001600324500001900340520168400359592002802043650001502071650001502086650001302101650000902114650001302123650001302136650002102149650001402170650001202184650001602196650000902212650001302221650001502234650001902249650001102268650001902279700002202298773012002320856008102440852000902521655001202530IND60705075320221121082003.0200730e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070507532DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293200700302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerasimova, M.

The effects of these events along with manifestations of fluvial pedogenesis were studied in thin sections. Well-known micromorphological features of alluvial soils have been confirmed, specific properties related to the position of soils in lacustrine-alluvial landscape have been revealed. Fluvial fabric elements are rather mitigated, since flooding of this section was weak and irregular; topsoils are similar in natural and post-arable soils and have no traces of agrogenic degradation. The layland regime contributes to soil regradation: higher pedality and pedofauna activity were recorded. Artificial drainage is recognized in thin sections by changes in iron (hydr)oxide pedofeatures vs. the natural gley soils, namely, iron segregations and nodules in the former soils (Fluvic Mollic Gleysols), and iron coatings, zones of complete bleaching alternating with strong impregnations in the latter. Soil on the terrace outlier was identified as a truncated texturally differentiated soil, which upper part was removed during leveling, then a new layer was placed on BT (argic) horizon: (Terric Anthrosol (Loamic, Gleyic, over buried Retisol)). Filled layers may contain blocky subangular peds of BT horizon, partially assimilated in the soil mass. These peds serve as micromorphological markers for reconstructing soil history owing to their easily recognizable particular properties: blocky subangular microstructure, speckled b-fabric, clay (hypo)coatings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthrosols 3aB horizons 3aGleysols 3aclay 3acropland 3adrainage 3adrainage systems 3aevolution 3afabrics 3afloodplains 3airon 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amicrostructure 3arivers 3asoil formation1 aSavitskaya, N.

Here, we apply a phylogenetic analysis to 18,000 plant communities distributed across the Pyrenees, a south European mountain range, to identify climatic refugia from imprints of relictuality inferred from species’ evolutionary distinctiveness (ED). We produced a genus-level phylogenetic tree to calculate the standardized mean ED value of plant communities (cED). Then, we explored which habitats concentrate the plant communities with the highest cED and the interrelated effect of past (long-term climatic stability) and present (topographic and spatial position) factors. Results show strong differences of cED among habitats: forests ranked first, followed by some open habitats like high altitude wetlands. Climate stability and roughness positively influenced cED. A weak negative association resulted between the two diversity measurements (richness and endemism rate) and also with cED. We propose that forests acted as “mobile refugia” during the glacial-interglacial periods, supported by paleoenvironmental reconstructions revealing continuous presence at regional scale of key broadleaved trees at that time. Azonal habitats like the endemic-poor humid communities at high elevation would have also played an important role as more permanent microrefugia. Our approach identifies a variety of habitats and plant assemblages that have successfully withstood past climate change in different ways, and therefore would hold an important evolutionary potential to cope with current climate change. Given their potential role in preserving biodiversity, they should be integrated in future conservation agendas.  aPublisher supplied data  aCGL2017-90040-RcAgencia Española de Investigación  aPID2019-106050RB-I00cAgencia Española de Investigación  aPRE2018-083868cMinisterio de Ciencia 3aaltitude 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aindigenous species 3amountains 3apaleobotany 3apaleoecology 3aphylogeny 3arefuge habitats 3aroughness1 aMiranda, Hector1 aPizarro, Manuel1 aFont, Xavier1 aRoquet, Cristina1 aGonzález-Sampériz, Penélope0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2022 May, v. 31, no. 5-6 p.1665-1688dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl50341x0960-31157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-022-02419-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003000145245012000175300001400295520126100309592002801570650001901598650002701617650002301644650001901667650002001686650001301706650002301719650001001742650001501752650001201767650001101779650002101790650001601811650001401827650001401841650001701855650001001872650000901882651001201891700003001903700001801933700002801951773009001979856004802069852000902117655001202126IND4473416620221120190546.0120621e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447341662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-011-0798-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrÃ¶nemeyer, Jann Lasse10aIsolation and characterization of root-associated bacteria from agricultural crops in the Kavango region of Namibia  ap. 67-82.  aRoot-associated bacteria can have beneficial effects on their host plants. Microbial products can promote and stimulate plant growth or lead to bioprotection against pathogens. This study aimed to isolate putatively beneficial bacteria from traditional cereals grown by subsistence farmers in the Kavango of Namibia. Bacteria were isolated from surface-sterilized roots of Pennisetum glaucum, Sorghum bicolor, and Zea mays, and subjected to phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses. A total of 44 root-associated bacterial strains were isolated. From 33 distinct isolates, 22 belonged to Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, while 11 were Proteobacteria. Eleven novel phylotypes were among the isolates. Features known to contribute to plant growth-promotion and biocontrol were tested in vitro and revealed promising candidates with multiple beneficial characteristics. This is the first report on the characterization of native isolates associated with important agriculture crops in the Kavango region of Namibia. Such isolates have the potential for application as inoculants adapted to poor soils and local crops. Desiccation-tolerant or sporulating Gram-positive bacteria are of particular interest for this region, which is characterized by a long dry season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aPennisetum glaucum 3aProteobacteria 3aSorghum bicolor 3aZea mays 3abiological control 3acrops 3adry season 3afarmers 3agrains 3agrowth promotion 3ahost plants 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aplant growth 3aroots 3asoil 3aNamibia1 aBurbano, Claudia SofÃ­a1 aHurek, Thomas1 aReinhold-Hurek, Barbara0 tPlant and soil.g2012 July, v. 356, no. 1-2 p.67-82dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-011-0798-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245006800212300001800280520189300298592002802191650001902219650001502238650001702253650001602270650001602286650003002302650001202332650001502344650002402359650002202383650002002405650001502425650001102440650001702451650001802468650003502486650001902521650002902540700002202569700001802591700001802609700001802627773013002645856008302775852000902858655001202867IND60780302620221118181352.0220827e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078030262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-022-02411-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabel, Jan Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1378-938114aThe relevance of transition habitats for butterfly conservation  ap. 1577-1590.  aBiodiversity is declining across the globe. Main drivers causing the vanishing of species are habitat destruction and the transformation of former heterogeneous landscapes into homogeneous and intensively used landscapes. Modern land management focuses on the creation of landscape configuration with sharp boundaries between ecosystems. In consequence, transition zones between two ecosystems such as between forest and open grassland are rare, as it counteracts the efficient and commercial use of space. However, there are many species relying on such transition zones between habitats, as the Clouded Apollo butterfly Parnassius mnemosyne. This highly endangered butterfly species occurs in light deciduous forests, interspersed with extensively used grasslands. In our study, we analysed habitat requirements of this butterfly species. We recorded larvae and feeding marks at its primary larval food plant, Corydalis cava, and assessed microhabitat characteristics, including microclimatic conditions. We captured high-resolution multispectral aerial imagery with an unmanned aerial vehicle. We subsequently combined ground-truthing data with information from high resolution aerial pictures to calculate habitat suitability models. We found that P. mnemosyne larvae mainly occur in the transition zone between deciduous light forest and extensively used grasslands with C. cava. Caterpillars of P. mnemosyne are particularly found around trees, basking on foliage and grass to rapidly reach high operation temperatures. Results from Species Distribution Models underline the relevance of transition zones between habitats for P. mnemosyne, and for biodiversity in general. The Clouded Apollo may serve as excellent indicator species for light deciduous forests, and as flagship to promote the conservation and restoration of transition zones between habitats in nature conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorydalis cava 3aParnassius 3abiodiversity 3abutterflies 3afood plants 3ageographical distribution 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ahabitat destruction 3aindicator species 3aland management 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3amicroclimate 3amicrohabitats 3anatural resources conservation 3aremote sensing 3aunmanned aerial vehicles1 aAngerer, Viktoria1 aGros, Patrick1 aTeucher, Mike1 aEberle, Jonas0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2022 May, v. 31, no. 5-6 p.1577-1590dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl50341x0960-31157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-022-02411-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012900171506011700300506007600417520177900493592002802272506003702300650002702337650002402364650001202388650001702400650001302417650002402430650001602454650002202470650001202492650001302504650002302517650001102540650001902551653001402570653002302584653001302607653002402620653001302644653001602657653002302673700002802696700002002724700006102744700002002805773009602825856008702921852000903008655001203017IND60770149320221207075431.0220412e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077014932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.1089592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, Angela,10aFrom chicken to salad: Cooking salt as a potential vehicle of Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes cross-contamination  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEpidemiological studies show that improper food handling practices at home account for a significant portion of foodborne illness cases. Mishandling of raw meat during meal preparation is one of the most frequent hazardous behaviours reported in observational research studies that potentially contributes to illness occurrence, particularly through the transfer of microbial pathogens from the raw meat to ready-to-eat (RTE) foods. This study evaluated the transfer of two major foodborne pathogens, Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes, from artificially contaminated chicken meat to lettuce via cooking salt (used for seasoning) during simulated domestic handling practices. Pieces of chicken breast fillets were spiked with five different loads (from ca. 1 to 5 Log CFU/g) of a multi-strain cocktail of either S. enterica or L. monocytogenes. Hands of volunteers (gloved) contaminated by handling the chicken, stirred the cooking salt that was further used to season lettuce leaves. A total of 15 events of cross-contamination (three volunteers and five bacterial loads) were tested for each pathogen. Immediately after the events, S. enterica was isolated from all the cooking salt samples (n = 15) and from 12 samples of seasoned lettuce; whereas L. monocytogenes was isolated from 13 salt samples and from all the seasoned lettuce samples (n = 15). In addition, S. enterica and L. monocytogenes were able to survive in artificially contaminated salt (with a water activity of 0.49) for, at least, 146 days and 126 days, respectively. The ability of these foodborne pathogens to survive for a long time in cooking salt, make it a good vehicle for transmission and cross-contamination if consumers do not adopt good hygiene practices when preparing meals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella enterica 3abreasts 3achicken meat 3achickens 3across contamination 3afood safety 3afoodborne illness 3alettuce 3araw meat 3aready-to-eat foods 3asalads 3awater activity 0aFoodborne 0aConsumer practices 0aSurvival 0aCross-contamination 0aRaw meat 0aRead-to-eat 0aLow-water activity1 aSantos-Ferreira, Nânci1 aMagalhães, Rui1 aFerreira, Vânia,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7093-91931 aTeixeira, Paula0 tFood control.g2022 July, v. 137 p.108959-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.1089593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013400154300001800288500001900306520104700325592002801372650000901400650001801409650001001427650002801437650001601465650001801481650000901499650001401508650001001522650004001532650001801572650001801590650002201608650001701630653002901647653001601676653002701692653002001719653003201739700001901771700001701790700001801807700001501825700001801840700002101858700002001879700001801899700002001917773018501937856007402122852000902196655001202205IND60692926320221120023424.0200503e20130723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069292632DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1209992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Qing,10aMedium-Chain Fatty Acids Enhanced the Excretion of Fecal Cholesterol and Cholic Acid in C57BL/6J Mice Fed a Cholesterol-Rich Diet  ap. 1390-1396.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe objective of the present study was to investigate the cholesterol-reducing effect of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) completed by elevated excretion of fecal neutral steroids and/or bile acids. Blood and liver lipid profiles, fecal neutral steroids, bile acids, and mRNA and protein expression of the genes relevant to cholesterol homeostasis were measured and analyzed in C57BL/6J mice fed a cholesterol-rich diet with 2% caprylic acid or capric acid for 12 weeks. Blood total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels were reduced significantly as compared to diet with palmitic acid or stearic acid. Caprylic acid promoted the excretion of fecal neutral steroids, especially cholesterol. The excretion of fecal bile acids, mainly in the form of cholic acid was enhanced and accompanied by elevated expression of mRNA and the protein of hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). These results indicate that MCFAs can reduce blood cholesterol by promoting the excretion of fecal cholesterol and cholic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3abile 3abiotechnology 3ablood 3acholesterol homeostasis 3acholic acid 3adecanoic acid 3adiet 3aexcretion 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3aoctanoic acid 3apalmitic acid 3aprotein synthesis 3astearic acid 0amedium-chain fatty acids 0acholesterol 0afecal neutral steroids 0afecal bile acid 0acholesterol 7α-hydroxylase1 aXUE, Changyong1 aZhang, Yong,1 aLiu, Yinghua,1 aWang, Jin,1 aYu, Xiaoming,1 aZhang, Xinsheng,1 aZhang, Rongxin,1 aYang, Xueyan,1 aGUO, Changjiang0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2013 July 23, v. 77, no. 7 p.1390-1396dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.1209993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01885naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245012200168300001800290520101200308592002801320650001101348650001501359650001401374700001401388773008401402856008901486990002301575852000901598655001201607IND60095968220221122065008.0141104e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009596822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.11.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Yan10aEffects of braiding angle on modal experimental analysis of three-dimensional and five-directional braided composites  ap. 2423-2428.  aIn this paper, the experimental modal analysis of three dimensional (3D) and five (5)-directional braided composite cantilever beams with different braiding angle was conducted systematically with a simple testing system. Preforms were made by four-step 1×1 square integral braiding method. The first three order modes of composite specimens were derived, which are different with braiding angles. The experimental result and mechanism were discussed. Experimental observations and analytical predictions show that the natural frequency of specimens decreased and the damping ratio of specimens increased when the braiding angle increased. Furthermore, specimens with smaller braiding angle will be valuable for the better anti-exiting property, and have an opposite effect on dissipation of vibration energy. The comparison between the specimens with different braiding angles reveals that braiding angle is a crucial factor for the vibration performance design of 3D and 5-directional braided composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aprediction 3avibration1 aLi, Jialu0 tComposites.g2012 July, v. 43, no. 5 p.2423-2428dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2011.11.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03652naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245008600174506010400260506007600364520183300440592002802273506003702301650002302338650000902361650001502370650001602385650002202401650001202423650000902435650000902444653001502453653001502468653002502483653001902508653001302527700006302540700005902603700001602662700003002678700001802708700006002726700005502786700001902841700005902860700002302919773009602942856008703038852000903125655001203134IND60770149520221207075432.0220412e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077014952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.1089612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarvin, Hans J.P.10aGlobal media as an early warning tool for food fraud; an assessment of MedISys-FF  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFood fraud is a serious problem that may compromise the safety of the food products being sold on the market. Previous studies have shown that food fraud is associated with a large variety of food products and the fraud type may vary from deliberate changing of the food product (i.e. substitution, tampering, dilution etc.) to the manipulation of documents. It is therefore important that all actors within the food supply chain (food producers, authorities), have methodologies and tools available to detect fraudulent products at an early stage so that preventative measures can be taken. Several of such systems exist (i.e. iRASFF, EMA, HorizonScan, AAC-FF, MedISys-FF), but currently only MedISys-FF is publicly online available. In this study, we analyzed food fraud cases collected by MedISys-FF over a 6-year period (2015–2020) and show global trends and developments in food fraud activities. In the period investigated, the system has collected 4375 articles on food fraud incidents from 164 countries in 41 different languages. Fraud with meat and meat products were most frequently reported (27.7%), followed by milk and milk products (10.5%), cereal and bakery products (8.3%), and fish and fish products (7.7%). Most of the fraud was related to expiration date (58.3%) followed by tampering (22.2%) and mislabeling of country of origin (11.4%). Network analysis showed that the focus of the articles was on food products being frauded. The validity of MedISys-FF as an early warning system was demonstrated with COVID-19. The system has collected articles discussing potential food fraud risks due to the COVID-19 crisis. We therefore conclude that MedISys-FF is a very useful tool to detect early trends in food fraud and may be used by all actors in the food system to ensure safe, healthy, and authentic food.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCOVID-19 infection 3afish 3afood fraud 3afood safety 3afood supply chain 3amarkets 3ameat 3amilk 0aFood fraud 0aMedISys-FF 0aEarly warning system 0aTrend analysis 0aCOVID-191 aHoenderdaal, Wouter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7685-70411 aGavai, Anand K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4738-190X1 aMu, Wenjuan1 avan den Bulk, Leonieke M.1 aLiu, Ningjing1 aFrasso, Gianluca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1986-869X1 aOzen, Neris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9328-38921 aElliott, Chris1 aManning, Louise1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9900-73031 aBouzembrak, Yamine0 tFood control.g2022 July, v. 137 p.108961-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.1089613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013500167300001800302520144900320592002801769650001701797650002801814650002201842650001701864650002401881650001601905650001101921650001201932650001501944650001901959650001901978650001501997650001202012651001402024651001802038651001302056700001802069700002402087700005902111773013002170856008302300852000902383655001202392IND60780302920221118180852.0220827e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078030292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-022-02421-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiorgi, Aurora10aLong term benthic survey demonstrates a shift in the composition of benthic reef communities at shallow sites in Roatán, Honduras  ap. 1689-1708.  aCoral reefs ecosystems are facing an unprecedented decline due to the action of natural and anthropogenic stressors. The Caribbean Sea is considered to be one of the most impacted areas, as the average estimated scleractinian coral cover in this region decreased from approximately 50% to 10% over the last 30 years. In this study, a ten-year biodiversity survey was used to examine changes in abundance and percentage cover of benthic invertebrates on permanent transects located at four shallow coral reefs around Roatán, Honduras. This study represents the first long-term investigation of the coral ecosystem of Roatán and reports a decrease in scleractinian coral cover from 37.45 [± 5.37]% to 28.95 [± 3.62]% and a concomitant increase in macroalgal (7.02 [± 3.59]% to 13.94 [± 2.69]%) and turf (5.11[ ± 0.84]% to 7.23 [± 1.00]%) cover although no significant differences in the abundance of scleractinian corals, soft corals, or sponges were observed on the transects. While the four reef sites supported more variable benthic communities at the onset of the study, an overall homogenization of the benthic community composition occurred during the study period. Although our study sites were limited to a small region of Roatán’s southern coral reef system, these observations add to results from other Caribbean locations and provide insights into how Mesoamerican coral reefs have changed over the last decade.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScleractinia 3aanthropogenic stressors 3abenthic organisms 3abiodiversity 3acommunity structure 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3adecline 3aecosystems 3ahomogenization 3alawns and turf 3amacroalgae 3asurveys 3aCaribbean 3aCaribbean Sea 3aHonduras1 aMonti, Matteo1 aRadawski, James Doc1 aOlson, Julie B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4517-02090 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2022 May, v. 31, no. 5-6 p.1689-1708dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl50341x0960-31157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-022-02421-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02102naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007200167300001600239520111900255592002801374650001901402650002801421650001501449650001701464700001801481700002101499700002401520700001701544773010201561856008101663990002301744852000901767655001201776IND60108437620221119210640.0141108e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010843762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2012.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemke, Benjamin10aPiezoresistive CMOS-compatible sensor for out-of-plane shear stress  ap. 488-495.  aA piezoresistive CMOS-compatible sensor for measuring the temperature-compensated out-of-plane shear stress components σₓz and σyz is analyzed, implemented, and applied. The device exploits the shear piezoresistive effect due to vertical (out-of-plane) shear stress components. Possible sensor geometries are discussed and sensitivity considerations based on an affine transformation are presented. A bi-directional, 53μm×53μm-large sensor design measuring two output voltages linearly proportional to the vertical shear stress components σₓz and σyz is introduced. The experimental characterization of 17 such structures revealed an offset of the measurement voltage of −1.3±0.6mV and a linear sensitivity of −320±85μV/MPa. A variation of the supply voltage from 0V to 5V modulates the sensor resistance and voltage-related sensitivity by +6% and −12%, respectively. The geometry dependence of the sensitivity is evaluated using a finite element analysis. Design guidelines are extracted from these simulations. A demonstration of the sensor performance in an application concludes this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric power 3afinite element analysis 3aguidelines 3ashear stress1 aBaumann, Marc1 aGieschke, Pascal1 aBaskaran, Rajashree1 aPaul, Oliver0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

The major limitation of the UL method as applied by authoritative groups thus far is that no UL has been set for nutrients without established adverse effects. In contrast to the limitations inherent in the UL method, an alternative approach is available; it identifies a risk assessment value termed the Highest Observed Intake (HOI). In the absence of a UL, the HOI is the highest intake with adequate data to show, with acceptable confidence, the absence of adverse effects up to that intake. With this concept defined and accepted in a report by the authoritative international organizations FAO and WHO, a complete risk assessment for the nutrients and related substances would have to identify UL values for those with known adverse effects and HOI values for those without known adverse effects. The need for the HOI concept and value is illustrated by the unjustified policy and regulatory actions taken in relation to vitamin B12. Regulatory utility is explained and tentative HOI values are identified for several vitamins and non-essential nutrients. Endorsement of the concept and development of HOI values by authoritative bodies is likely to be required for broad acceptance and use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdequate Intakes 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aTolerable Upper Intake Level 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadverse effects 3aissues and policy 3anutrients 3arisk assessment 3avitamin B121 aKriengsinyos, Wantanee0 tRegulatory toxicology and pharmacology.g2011 Oct., v. 61, no. 1 p.115-118dElsevier Inc.x0273-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yrtph.2011.07.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03879naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012900167300001200296520232000308592002802628650001602656650002002672650001802692650002402710650001502734650001302749650001402762650002902776650001002805650001602815650002002831650001002851650002402861650001302885650001202898650001702910650001202927650001402939650001402953650001902967650002902986651001903015700001903034700001703053700002003070700002103090700001903111773007803130856008503208990002303293852000903316655001203325IND60103440120221120031948.0141106e20130227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010344012DNAL7 a10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60495-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacob, John12aA chemical-genetics approach to study the molecular pathology of central serotonin abnormalities in fetal valproate syndrome  ap. S55.  aValproate (VPA) is a commonly used drug worldwide despite increased awareness of its adverse effects, especially when used during pregnancy. Fetal valproate syndrome, characterised by birth defects, learning difficulties, and autism, is observed in up to 50% of children exposed in utero. The teratogenic properties of VPA are thought to result from altered gene expression through its inhibition of the chromatin modifying enzyme family of histone deacetylases (Hdac). Brainstem serotonergic abnormalities are believed to be important in mediating the behavioural manifestations of fetal valproate syndrome. Abnormal differentiation of these neurons has been reported in rodent models of autism and this syndrome. However, the role of Hdac and the identity of the salient genetic targets in VPA-associated serotonergic dysgenesis has not been determined; this has hampered the development of therapies that can ameliorate fetal valproate syndrome. Here we show that VPA specifically blocks serotonergic differentiation in a zebrafish model by downregulating the expression of the proneural gene, Ascl1b, which encodes a critical determinant of serotonergic fate. Using a chemical-genetics approach we show that VPA exposes cryptic transcriptional repression by tonic Notch signalling, which prevents the activation of Ascl1b. Chemical blockade of Notch signalling results in Ascl1b activation and the rescue of serotonergic differentiation in the presence of VPA. We find that the ability of VPA to silence Ascl1b and block serotonergic neurogenesis is specifically dependent on inhibition of Hdac1. Consistent with this finding, Hdac1 mutants fail to activate Ascl1b and lack 5-HT neurons. Moroever, treatment of Hdac1 mutants with a Notch inhibitor drug rescues 5-HT neurons, which confirms that Hdac1 mediates the effects of VPA. The current model of Hdac function proposes that cyclical Hdac activity is needed to prime active genes, such as Ascl1b, for further rounds of transcription. Our discovery of the interplay between chromatin modifiers and Notch in gene regulation adds a new layer of complexity to the epigenetic molecular model. Fetal valproate syndrome thus highlights the crucial role of the epigenetic interface in genome-environment interactions in disease.

Whereas PGRMC1 has been extensively characterized in in vitro studies, comparably little is known about PGRMC2. To determine PGRMC2’s role in ovarian cancer cell proliferation and mobility PGRMC1- and 2-depleted and -overexpressing SKOV-3 cells were generated. In electric cell-substrate impedance sensing studies, PGRMC2 negatively affects SKOV-3 migration rate if overexpressed; oppositely, depletion was associated with an increased migration rate. PGRMC1 had no effect in this assay. These effects were not associated with f-actin regulation or actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Yet, these highly homologous proteins share many properties. Both PGRMC1 and 2 are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. As PGRMC1 was reported to interact with cytochrome P450 proteins (CYP) binding of two different CYPs to PGRMC2 was tested; a stable interaction of PGRMC2 with CYP3A4 and CYP21A2 was found in human embryonic kidney cells. For both PGRMC types, cell viability assays revealed no significant differences of SKOV-3 survival in overexpressing and depleted cells. PGRMC2 also does not seem to have any influence on the apoptotic effect of cisplatin or the antiapoptotic effect of progesterone which had been reported for PGRMC1. In contrast to PGRMC1, protein levels of PGRMC2 in SKOV-3 cells are reduced by treatment with cisplatin (30–60μM). In conclusion, we show for the first time that PGRMC2 inhibits migration of SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell movement 3adrug therapy 3acell viability 3acisplatin 3ahumans 3akidney cells 3amicrofilaments 3aprogesterone 3acytochrome P-450 3aneoplasm cells 3ain vitro studies 3aactin 3aprogesterone receptors 3acell proliferation 3aanimal ovaries 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aapoptosis 3aovarian neoplasms 0aimpedance1 aHuck, Volker1 aWehling, Martin1 aWendler, Alexandra0 tSteroids.g2012 Dec., v. 77, no. 14 p.1543-1550dElsevier Inc.x0039-128X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.steroids.2012.09.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01852naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011300163300001800276520088200294592002801176650002401204650002001228650002401248650001601272700001901288700001901307773011101326856008101437990002301518852000901541655001201550IND60104084120221119195632.0141107e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010408412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2010.12.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Ya-Hui14aThe impact of inspection errors, imperfect maintenance and minimal repairs on an imperfect production system  ap. 1680-1691.  aThis paper develops an integrated model of production lot-sizing, maintenance and quality for considering the possibilities of inspection errors, preventive maintenance (PM) errors and minimal repairs for an imperfect production system with increasing hazard rates. In this study, a PM activity is imperfect in that a production system cannot be recovered as good as new and might cause the production system to shift to the out-of-control state with a certain probability. Numerical analyses are used to simulate the effect of changes in various parameters on the optimal solution for which the time that the process remains in the in-control state is assumed to follow a Weibull distribution. In addition, we investigate the effects of inspection errors and PM errors on the minimum total cost of the optimal inspection interval, inspection frequency and production quantity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer techniques 3adecision making 3amathematical models 3aprobability1 aChen, Jen-Ming1 aChen, Yan-Chun0 tMathematical and computer modelling.g2011 May, v. 53, no. 9-10 p.1680-1691dElsevier Ltdx0895-71777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2010.12.0403Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245007600174300001600250520140900266592002801675650002101703650002301724650001001747650001401757650001101771650001901782650001701801650001301818700002201831700001701853700001501870700001601885700001801901700001501919700002001934773010601954856008502060852000902145655001202154IND60101026020221121224657.0141105e20120430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010102602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.11.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rongsheng E.10aDevelopment of self-immolative dendrimers for drug delivery and sensing  ap. 154-163.  aTraditional dendrimers possess unique cascade-branched structural properties that allow for multivalent modifications with drug cargos, targeting/delivery agents and imaging tools. In addition to multivalency, the dendrimer's macromolecular size also brings about the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, which makes it an attracting agent for drug delivery and biosensing. Similar to other macromolecules, therapeutic application of dendrimers in the human body faces practical challenges such as target specificity and toxicity. The latter represents a substantial issue due to the dendrimer's unnatural chemical structure and relatively large size, which prohibit its in vivo degradation and excretion from the body. To date, a class of self-immolative dendrimers has been developed to overcome these obstacles, which takes advantage of its unique structural backbone to allow for cascade decompositions upon a simple triggering event. The specific drug release can be achieved through a careful design of the trigger, and as a result of the fragmentation, the generated small molecules are either biodegradable or easily excreted from the body. Though still at a preliminary stage, the development of this novel approach represents an important direction in nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery and sensor design, thereby opening up an insightful frontier of dendrimer based applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3achemical structure 3adrugs 3aexcretion 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3apermeability 3atoxicity1 aCostanza, Frankie1 aNiu, Youhong1 aWu, Haifan1 aHu, Yaogang1 aHang, Whitney1 aSun, Yiqun1 aCai, Jian-Feng,0 tJournal of controlled release.g2012 Apr. 30, v. 159, no. 2 p.154-163dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.11.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006900168300001400237520097600251592002801227650001601255650001501271650002301286650000901309650000901318650001301327650001801340650003701358700002001395700002201415700002101437700002101458700002101479700002401500700002001524773011301544856008201657852000901739655001201748IND60100680020221119212256.0141105e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010068002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2010.12.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalletta, Ester12aA tri-block copolymer templated synthesis of gold nanostructures  ap. 88-94.  aStable ultra-small gold nanoparticles have been synthesized in aqueous phase by using a tri-block copolymer (BMB) as a templating agent consisting of two PEG-methylacrylate chains (B blocks) anchored to a poly(methacrylic) moiety containing a trithiocarbonate unit (M block).

Here, we demonstrate that STING (stimulator of interferon genes), an endoplasmic reticulum translocon-associated transmembrane protein, acts to detect cytoplasmic DNA species. STING homodimers were able to complex with self- (apoptotic, necrotic) or pathogen-related ssDNA and dsDNA and were indispensible for HSV-1-mediated transcriptional activation of a wide array of innate immune and proinflammatory genes in addition to type I IFN. Our data indicate that STING instigates cytoplasmic DNA-mediated cellular defense gene transcription and facilitates adoptive responses that are required for protection of the host. In contrast, chronic STING activation may manifest inflammatory responses and possibly autoimmune disease triggered by self-DNA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3aautoimmune diseases 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agene activation 3agenes 3ainflammation 3ainterferons 3amicroorganisms 3asingle-stranded DNA 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation 3atransmembrane proteins1 aHarashima, Ai1 aXia, Tianli1 aKonno, Hiroyasu1 aKonno, Keiko1 aMorales, Alejo1 aAhn, Jeonghyun1 aGutman, Delia1 aBarber, Glen N.,0 tMolecular cell.g2013 Apr. 11, v. 50 p.5-15dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.01.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01818naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007900165300001600244520085100260592002801111650002101139650002401160650001601184700001701200700001901217700001501236700001501251700001501266773009801281856008101379990002301460852000901483655001201492IND60108515520221117034559.0141108e20110720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010851552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.01.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIadicicco, A.10aEvanescent wave sensor based on permanently bent single mode optical fiber  ap. 903-908.  aA novel refractive index sensing scheme based on evanescent wave interaction through locally and permanently bent single mode optical fibers is proposed. Local and permanent bends in single mode optical fibers enable significant power coupling between core and cladding modes. Order and number of excited cladding modes depend on bend features and determine the field profile at the output of the bent region. This in turn constitutes a simple mechanism to tailor the field distribution in single mode optical fibers useful for spatial light modulation. Moreover, since guided cladding modes are strongly influenced by the surrounding refractive index (SRI), the power transmitted at the output of the bent region as well as its dependence on the optical wavelength are strongly sensitive to the SRI opening new scenarios in sensing applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3arefractive index 3asensors (equipment) 3awavelengths1 aPaladino, D.1 aCampopiano, S.1 aBock, W.J.1 aCutolo, A.1 aCusano, A.0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 July 20, v. 155, no. 2 p.903-908dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.01.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009700168300001800265520077400283592002801057650001501085650001101100650001801111650001501129650001201144650001301156650002101169650001501190650001301205650001301218650001101231650001701242650001101259700002201270700001601292700001901308773009601327856008401423990002301507852000901530655001201539IND60103692120221122232240.0141106e20110630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010369212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.03.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ming-Xi10aPorous carbon nanofibers with narrow pore size distribution from electrospun phenolic resins  ap. 1875-1877.  aPhenolic resin-based porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) with large surface area and narrow pore size distribution have been successfully prepared using novolac-type phenolic resin as precursor.

Mammalian transposon-silencing piRNAs accumulate early in spermatogenesis, whereas pachytene piRNAs are produced later during postnatal spermatogenesis and account for >95% of all piRNAs in the adult mouse testis. Mutants defective for pachytene piRNA pathway proteins fail to produce mature sperm, but neither the piRNA precursor transcripts nor the trigger for pachytene piRNA production is known. Here, we show that the transcription factor A-MYB initiates pachytene piRNA production. A-MYB drives transcription of both pachytene piRNA precursor RNAs and the mRNAs for core piRNA biogenesis factors including MIWI, the protein through which pachytene piRNAs function. A-MYB regulation of piRNA pathway proteins and piRNA genes creates a coherent feedforward loop that ensures the robust accumulation of pachytene piRNAs. This regulatory circuit, which can be detected in rooster testes, likely predates the divergence of birds and mammals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atranscription factors 3amessenger RNA 3apachytene stage 3aspermatogenesis 3abiogenesis 3aroosters 3amice 3agenes 3amutants 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 3ameiosis 3atransposons 3aadults 0aproteins1 aRoy, Christian K.1 aDong, Xianjun1 aBolcun-Filas, Ewelina1 aWang, Jie1 aHan, Bo W.1 aXu, Jia1 aMoore, Melissa J.1 aSchimenti, John C.1 aWeng, Zhiping1 aZamore, Phillip D.0 tMolecular cell.g2013 Apr. 11, v. 50 p.67-81dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012300168300001600291500001500307520148400322592002801806650002601834650002501860650000801885650001801893650002901911650001001940650002501950650001601975650001501991650002102006653001302027700001902040700001502059700001902074700002102093773010802114856008102222990002302303852000902326655001202335IND60107618820221122111737.0141108e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010761882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pep.2011.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, William C.10aSolubility partner IF2 Domain I enables high yield synthesis of transducible transcription factors in Escherichia coli  ap. 145-151.  a2019-12-04  aSince the discovery that somatic cells could be reprogrammed back to a pluripotent state through the viral expression of a certain set of transcription factors, there has been great interest in reprogramming using a safer and more clinically relevant protein-based approach. However, the search for an efficient reprogramming approach utilizing the transcription factors in protein form requires a significant amount of protein material. Milligram quantities of transcription factors are challenging to obtain due to low yields and poor solubility. In this work, we describe enhanced production of the pluripotency transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, Nanog, and Lin28 after fusing them to a solubility partner, IF2 Domain I (IF2D1). We expressed and purified milligram quantities of the fusion proteins. Though the transcription factor passenger proteins became insoluble after removal of the IF2D1, the un-cleaved Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Nanog fusion proteins exhibited specific binding to their consensus DNA sequences. However, when we administered the un-cleaved IF2D1-Oct4-R9 and IF2D1-Sox2-R9 to fibroblasts and measured their ability to influence transcriptional activity, we found that they were not fully bioactive; IF2D1-Oct4-R9 and IF2D1-Sox2-R9 influenced only a subset of their downstream gene targets. Thus, while the IF2D1 solubility partner enabled soluble production of the fusion protein at high levels, it did not yield fully bioactive transcription factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3abioactive properties 3aDNA 3asomatic cells 3atranscription (genetics) 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3afibroblasts 3asolubility 3aEscherichia coli 0aproteins1 aWelsh, John P.1 aLee, Jieun1 aCooke, John P.1 aSwartz, James R.0 tProtein expression and purification.g2011 Nov., v. 80, no. 1 p.145-151dElsevier Inc.x1046-59287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2011.06.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012300169300001600292520155800308592002801866650002201894650001501916650001201931650001701943650001201960650001901972650001601991650001302007650001102020650001402031650002802045650002602073650001202099650001402111650001402125650001302139650001902152650000702171700001302178700001502191700001702206700001702223773010002240856008502340852000902425655001202434IND60101393420221118090515.0141106e20111030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010139342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.07.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantini, T.C.10aIn situ neutralisation of uncarbonated bauxite residue mud by cross layer leaching with carbonated bauxite residue mud  ap. 119-127.  aUnameliorated residue mud from the Bayer process generates highly alkaline leachates (pH ca. 13) after deposition in storage areas. Pre-deposition treatment of bauxite residue mud (BRM) with CO₂ gas (carbonation) lowers leachate pH to ca. 10.5. Laboratory scale leaching columns were used to investigate the potential for in situ pH reduction in existing uncarbonated BRM deposits through exposure to carbonated mud leachate. Leachates from uncarbonated and carbonated residues in single and dual-layer column configurations were analysed for pH, electrical conductivity, carbonate and bicarbonate content, and element concentrations. Air-dried solids were analysed by X-ray diffraction before and after leaching. Cross layer leaching lowers leachate pH from uncarbonated BRM. Leachate pH was significantly lower in dual layer and carbonated residue than in uncarbonated residue between one and 400 pore volumes leached. Carbonated residue porewater as well as dawsonite and calcite dissolution were identified as sources of (bi-)carbonate. Leachate concentrations of As, Cr, Cu, Ga and La were immediately reduced in dual layer treatments compared with uncarbonated residue. No element analysed exhibited a significantly higher leachate concentration in dual layer treatments than the highest observed concentration in single layer treatments. The implementation of dual layer leaching in the field therefore presents an opportunity to improve leachate quality from existing uncarbonated residue deposits and justifies further testing at field scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aair drying 3aarsenic 3abicarbonates 3acalcite 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonation 3achromium 3acopper 3adawsonite 3aelectrical conductivity 3afield experimentation 3agallium 3alanthanum 3aleachates 3aleaching 3aneutralization 3apH1 aHinz, C.1 aRate, A.W.1 aCarter, C.M.1 aGilkes, R.J.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Oct. 30, v. 194 p.119-127dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.07.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01173naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245006100171300001800232520024600250592002800496650002300524650002300547650002200570700002100592700002200613700002400635700002300659773009600682856008400778852000900862655001200871IND60109764520221120161139.0141109e20110525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010976452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.03.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishio, Yukihiro10aOne-pot synthesis of 5-amino 4-cyano pyrrole derivatives  ap. 2767-2770.  aOne-pot synthesis of 5-amino 4-cyano pyrrole derivatives is herein disclosed.

We find significant shifts (one decade) in the dissipation factor peaks of these samples upon removal and reinsertion of the amino acids used in their preparation. Control films remained unchanged, and other amino acids showed little binding. The use of the nylon polymer allows imprinting without the need for cross-linking agents.

The increasing frequency of car bapenemase enzymes among Gram-negative bacilli makes their early detection and differentiation urgent. Carbapenemases belonging to Class A are most commonly produced by members of family Enterobacteriaceae and are inhibited to various degrees by clavulanic acid. The present study is aimed to determine the occurrence and phenotypic detection of Class A carbapenemases in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae blood isolates from septicemic patients. METHODS: A total of 75 isolates of K. pneumoniae and 25 E. coli were screened for resistance to carbapenems by using meropenem and imipenem discs and meropenem E-test. Positive strains were then subjected to a modified Hodge test combined with carbapenemase inhibition tests to phenotypically detect and differentiate Class A serine carbapenemases from other classes of carbapenem hydrolyzing enzymes. RESULTS: The screening test showing the number of isolates resistant to meropenem and imipenem were 41 and 35 for K. pneumoniae and nine and four for E. coli, respectively. A total of 25 (33.3%) K. pneumoniae isolates and two (8.0%) E. coli isolates were classified as Class A carbapenemase producers. Multidrug resistance with coexistence of extended spectrum-beta-lactamases occurred in 44.4% isolates. However, all of the isolates were susceptible to colistin, polymyxin B, and tigecycline by disc diffusion test. CONCLUSION: We conclude from the present study that Class A carbapenemases appear to be the predominant cause of resistance to carbapenems in Enterobacteriaceae at our center and, thus, phenotypic detection based on simple methods should be employed routinely in clinical microbiology laboratories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3abeta-lactamase 3ablood 3aclavulanic acid 3acolistin 3aimipenem 3ameropenem 3amultiple drug resistance 3apatients 3apolymyxin B 3ascreening 3atigecycline1 aBansal, Neha1 aSingla, Nidhi1 aChander, Jagdish0 tJournal of microbiology, immunology and infection.g2013 Apr., v. 46, no. 2 p.104-108dElsevier B.V.x1684-11827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2012.01.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245015800175300001200333520166200345592002802007650000802035650001202043650001002055650001902065650002702084650001602111650001802127650001902145650001302164650002202177650001102199650001202210650002502222650001302247650003002260650000902290650003002299650001702329650002102346700001902367700001702386700001802403700001902421700002002440773007802460856008502538990002302623852000902646655001202655IND60103440420221120031942.0141106e20130227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010344042DNAL7 a10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60498-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinsler, Veronica A10aCongenital melanocytic naevus syndrome is caused by a post-zygotic mutation in codon 61 of NRAS, predisposing to melanoma development in affected tissues  ap. S58.  aCongenital melanocytic naevus (CMN) syndrome is the association of large or multiple CMN with neurological abnormalities, characteristic facial features, and an increased risk of melanoma that is not restricted to the skin. The genetic basis of the syndrome has previously been unknown, although various somatic mutations have been described in individual skin lesions. We hypothesised that one of these mutations might occur early in embryogenesis, leading to somatic mosaicism. 55 cutaneous, neurological, and blood samples were obtained from 15 accurately phenotyped patients with multiple CMN, and blood samples were taken from a further 44 patients with CMN. Site-directed mutagenesis generated restriction enzyme sites unique to the normal DNA sequence of codon 61 of NRAS (MIM 164790), allowing selective amplification of mutant alleles in mosaic tissue. Oncogenic missense mutations in codon 61 of NRAS were found in the affected neurological and cutaneous tissues of 12 of 15 patients, in a somatic mosaic pattern. In ten patients the heterozygous mutation was c.181C>A, p.Q61K, and in two c.182A>G, p.Q61R. No mutations were found in unaffected tissues or blood. Investigation of the primary melanoma samples in two patients revealed loss of heterozygosity at NRAS in one patient, and deletion of a region of chromosome 9p including CDKN2A (MIM 600160), a known melanoma gene, in both patients. CMN syndrome is therefore a mosaic RASopathy. This mosaicism underpins the associated risk of malignant melanoma and non-melanocytic central nervous system tumours by acting as a first hit in a multi-hit model of tumorigenesis.

The monolithic columns were evaluated with mixture of organic acids in capillary electrochromatography (CEC) mode and the column efficiency reaches 280, 000plates/m.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a long-term follow-up of patients in whom the common mutation was detected. RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2010, 6 cases of CPT1A deficiency were diagnosed and treated with a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. The patients experienced their first symptoms during the first years of life, provoked by viral illness and/or fasting. The clinical features included hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hepatopathy, and loss of consciousness, ranging from transient unconsciousness to prolonged hyperlipidemic coma. Five cases carried a homozygous c.1364A>C (p.K455T) mutation, whereas 1 case had a compound c.1364A>C/c.1493A>C (p.Y498S) mutation. During dietary therapy, the patients had few transient decompensations. No carriers of mutation c.1364A>C were detected by minisequencing of 150 control samples. CONCLUSION: Even though CPT1A deficiency may be life-threatening and lead to prolonged coma, the long-term prognosis is good. A genotype–phenotype correlation implies that the mutations detected are disease-causing. Despite Finland’s location close to the Arctic polar region, the carrier frequency of the c.1364A>C mutation in Finland is far lower than that of the variants found in Alaskan, Canadian, and Greenland native populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarnitine palmitoyltransferase 3acoma 3aconsciousness 3adiet therapy 3adisease course 3afasting 3ahomozygosity 3ahypoglycemia 3alow fat diet 3amutation 3apatients 3aprognosis 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBlotting, Western 2aCarnitine O-Palmitoyltransferasexdeficiencyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChild 2aChild Development 2aChild, Preschool 2aDiet Therapy 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aHeterozygote 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMutation, Missense 2aYoung Adult 3aFinland 3aGreenland 0aFinlandxepidemiology.1 aPolinati, Padmini P.1 aEuro, Liliya1 aEskelin, Petra M.1 aPaganus, Aila1 aTyni, Tiina0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2012 Mar., v. 160, no. 3 p.473-479.e1dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.08.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01670naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008500166300001400251520073100265592002800996650002201024650001601046650003301062700001501095700001401110700001601124700001601140773008401156856008401240990002301324852000901347655001201356IND60103840420221119091819.0141106e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010384042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.03.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Guihuan10aCitric acid assisted hydrothermal synthesis of microparticles of ErPO₄:Dy³⁺  ap. 55-57.  aIn this paper, different shapes and structures of ErPO₄:Dy³⁺ microcrystals were studied.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) results show that with large amount of citric acid, the microcrystals are microspheres; the decreases of citric acid modify the shape of ErPO4:Dy³⁺ microcrystals from microspheres to microrods, and even microflowers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acitric acid 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aKan, Xuyou1 aHan, Yibo1 aSun, Zhaoyu1 aGuo, Weiwei0 tMaterials letters.g2012 July 15, v. 79 p.55-57dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2012.03.0863Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245011200212300001400324506007600338520158200414592002801996506003702024650001802061650003102079650002502110650001302135650001102148650001102159650001502170650001302185700002202198773010902220856008102329852000902410655001202419IND60101638420221207124457.0141106e20110729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010163842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2011.05.0052doi7 aPMC33080162pmcid7 a216208522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartley, Matthew B.10aT cell hybridomas to study MHC-II restricted B-cell receptor-mediated antigen presentation by human B cells  ap. 35-42.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMHC-II antigen presentation by B cells is essential in order for B cells to receive optimal costimulation from helper CD4+ T cells. This process is facilitated and focused through the extremely efficient uptake, processing, and presentation of antigen recognized by an individual B cell's unique B-cell receptor (BCR). The investigation of human B-cell antigen presentation has been limited by the varied specificity of BCR found in the mixed populations of B cells in vivo. As a result, there is no readily available method to measure BCR-mediated antigen presentation in this heterogeneous population of B cells. We have overcome this limitation by developing HLA-DR-restricted T-cell lines capable of recognizing a specific antigen taken up via the BCR and presented by the mixed B-cell population through this physiologically relevant mechanism. BCR-mediated presentation was enhanced >4 logs compared to presentation by B cells taking up the antigen through nonspecific mechanisms. The studies presented here characterize T-cell hybridoma lines developed for HLA-DRB1*0101+ and HLA-DRB1*1501+ B cells, but clones could be generated for other HLA-DR types using the methods described. These hybridomas have potential applications including study of the mechanisms of BCR-mediated enhancement of presentation, determination of adjuvant effects on presentation, and optimization of vaccine antigen preparations. Therefore, these T-cell lines could significantly facilitate the study of BCR-mediated antigen presentation required by T helper cell-dependent vaccines in humans.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aantigen presentation 3aantigens 3aclones 3ahumans 3ahybridomas 3avaccines1 aCanaday, David H.0 tJournal of immunological methods.g2011 July 29, v. 370, no. 1-2 p.35-42dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2011.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01668naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011100163300001800274520060800292592002800900650001500928650002100943650001700964650001200981650001400993650001701007650001101024700002301035700002401058700002401082773009601106856008401202990002301286852000901309655001201318IND60103692220221120173856.0141106e20110630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010369222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.03.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yang10aChirality-enriched semiconducting carbon nanotubes synthesized on high surface area MgO-supported catalyst  ap. 1878-1881.  aSingle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with a narrow diameter distribution were synthesized by radio frequency-Catalytic Chemical Vapor Deposition (RF-CCVD) through the pyrolysis of CH4.

However, the well-designed fragile nanostructures could be easily destroyed during the conventional fabrication process of gas sensors. Herein, we presented a novel materials-sensor integration fabrication strategy: on basis of screen printing (SP) technology and calcination, micro-injecting (MI) was introduced into the fabrication process of sensors, which was named as SPMIC, to obtain In₂O₃ nanowire-like network directly on the surface of coplanar sensors array by structure replication from sacrificial carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The obtained In₂O₃ nanowire-like network exhibited an excellent response (electrical resistance ratio Rₐ/Rg), about 63.5, for100ppm formaldehyde at 300°C, which was about 30 times larger than that of compact In₂O₃ nanoparticles film (non-network film). The enhanced gas-sensing properties were mainly attributed to the high surface-to-volume ratio and the nanoscopic structural properties of materials. Furthermore, the SPMIC could be employed not only in the preparation of other metal oxide nanowire-like network, but also in the fabrication of coplanar gas sensors arrays on the required sites with different materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrical resistance 3aformaldehyde 3ananoparticles 3asurface area1 aTian, Shouqin1 aZeng, Dawen1 aXu, Keng1 aZhang, Shunping1 aXie, Changsheng0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Aug., v. 185 p.345-353dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2013.05.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01463naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010500164300001800269520052400287592002800811650001400839650001700853650001100870650001700881650002200898700001700920773011100937856008101048990002301129852000901152655001201161IND60104084420221119195645.0141107e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010408442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2010.12.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolbabai, A.10aAnalytical modelling of fractional advection–dispersion equation defined in a bounded space domain  ap. 1708-1718.  aThe fractional advection–dispersion equation (FADE) known as its non-local dispersion, is used in groundwater hydrology and has been proven to be a reliable tool to model the transport of passive tracers carried by fluid flow in a porous media.

The sample remains humid after supercontraction, identifying in this way the role of the softened amorphous phase. For the first time, the amount of pre-stress in the fibers can be determined by direct comparison between microscopic and macroscopic stress during humidity increase. Nanocrystal stress decreases by ∼120 MPa, even though the external stress increases at the same time. The current findings suggest that water and its interplay with pre-stress determine the relative contribution of crystals and amorphous matrix to the mechanical properties. Increased water content and release of pre-stress deteriorate the macroscopic mechanical properties, as the system becomes viscoelastic and loses its stiffness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aviscoelasticity 3asilk 3aNephila 3ananocrystals 3amechanical properties 3ahumidity 3awater content 3apolymers 3aspectroscopy 0acrystals1 aPapadopoulos, Periklis1 aKremer, Friedrich0 tPolymer.g2011 Dec. 13, v. 52, no. 26 p.6056-6060dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2011.10.0563Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010600167300001600273520074900289592002801038650004401066650002201110650002101132650001301153650003701166650001901203650001301222650001301235650003401248650000901282650002001291700001701311700001601328700001801344773008701362856008401449990002301533852000901556655001201565IND60104000420221122170756.0141107e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010400042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.03.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMou, Zhao-Li10aPreparation of silk fibroin/collagen/hydroxyapatite composite scaffold by particulate leaching method  ap. 189-191.  aA novel porous silk fibroin/collagen/hydroxyapatite (SCH) scaffold was one-step fabricated by NaCl particulate leaching method.

In this study, silver nano-particles attached onto the surface of GAC (Ag-GAC) using the sputtering method were evaluated for the simultaneous catalytic oxidation and adsorption of formaldehyde. The evolution of CO₂ from the silver nano-particles indicated that formaldehyde was catalytically oxidized to its final product, with the oxidation kinetics expressed as pseudo-first order. In addition, a packed column test showed that the mass of formaldehyde removed by the Ag-GAC was 2.4 times higher than that by the virgin GAC at a gas retention time of 0.5s. However, a BET analysis showed that the available surface area and micro-pore volume of the Ag-GAC were substantially decreased due to the deposition of the silver nano-particles. To simulate the performance of the Ag-GAC, the homogeneous surface diffusion model (HSDM), developed for the prediction of the GAC column adsorption, was modified to incorporate the catalytic oxidation taking place on the Ag-GAC surface. The modified HSDM demonstrated that numerical simulations were consistent with the experimental data collected from the Ag-GAC column tests. The model predictions implied that the silver nano-particles deposited on the GAC reduced the adsorptive capacity due to decreasing the available surface for the diffusion of formaldehyde into the GAC, but the overall mass of formaldehyde removed by the Ag-GAC was increased due to catalytic oxidation as a function of the ratio of the surface coverage by the nano-particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3aformaldehyde 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3aprediction 3asurface area1 aSong, JiHyeon0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Oct. 30, v. 194 p.385-392dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01548naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014000172300001800312520045800330592002800788650002300816650001400839650002300853650001300876650001800889650000900907650001800916650001600934650001400950700002300964700002200987773009601009856008401105852000901189655001201198IND60109764620221120161239.0141109e20110525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010976462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aS, Salprima Yudha10aGold– and gold–palladium/poly(1-vinylpyrrolidin-2-one) nanoclusters as quasi-homogeneous catalyst for aerobic oxidation of glycerol  ap. 2633-2637.  aGlycerol was oxidized catalytically under aerobic conditions in the presence of monometallic nanoclusters of gold on poly(1-vinylpyrrolidin-2-one) (PVP) to give hydroxymalonic acid (tartronic acid) as the major product, together with 2,3-dihydroxypropanoic acid (glyceric acid) and hydroxyacetic acid (glycolic acid) as minor products.

AHFS treatment led to severe non-uniform dealumination and substantial surface silicon deposition. Y samples obtained by sequential desilication and dealumination had substantially better dealumination uniformity and aluminum–silicon distribution. The mesopore formation in these zeolites is discussed in detail. The desilication creates defects in the framework of the parent NaY zeolite. These defects improve the intra-crystalline transport and induce mesopore formation during dealumination. The desilication- plus dealumination-treated zeolites showed higher initial activity and lower deactivation tendency in the case of 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene cracking, and higher conversion rate of cumene than those zeolites modified by AHFS treatment only. These catalytic data indicate that the former could be a viable catalyst in the catalytic cracking of heavy hydrocarbons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aammonium compounds 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acatalytic cracking 3acracking 3acrystal structure 3ahydrocarbons 3aporosity 3asilicon 3asodium hydroxide 3azeolites1 aShen, Baojian1 aGao, Xionghou1 aLin, Feng1 aWang, Baojie1 aXu, Chunming0 tJournal of catalysis.g2011 Mar. 7, v. 278, no. 2 p.266-275dElsevier Inc.x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2010.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012700176300001800303520163400321592002801955650002401983650001102007650001602018650001402034650001902048650001302067650002802080650002502108650001402133700002102147700003102168700002702199700003502226773008602261856008502347852000902432655001202441IND60109139820221122031345.0141109e20110930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010913982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2011.07.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMroczkiewicz, Monika10aApplication of flow-injection potentiometric system for determination of total concentration of aliphatic carboxylic acids  ap. 2047-2052.  aIn this work, flow-injection system with potentiometric detection was tested for determination of total carboxylic acid concentration. Detection part of the examined system consists of ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) with polymer membranes of different compositions. First electrode is based on Zr(IV)-tetraphenylporphyrin as ionophore selective towards carboxylic acid anions, the membrane of second one contains only liphophilic anion exchanger – tridodecylmethylammonium chloride. Final response of the system is a result of combination of EMF signals from both electrodes. Combination of two detectors enables significant decrease of differences between potentiometric signals induced by mixtures of studied anions of various concentrations as compared to results obtained only with metalloporphyrin-based ISE. The use of anion-exchanger based detector allows for elimination of the influence of aliphatic carboxylic acids lipophilicity. Proposed potentiometric flow-injection system was employed for determination of short-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (so-called VFA – volatile fatty acids) in samples originating from an anaerobic digester. Results obtained for these relatively complicated samples are in good agreement with results obtained with the use of reference colorimetric method. Linear response towards carboxylic acids was observed in the concentration range of 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻²moldm⁻³, with the slopes in the range of −110 to −150mVdec⁻¹ (for acetate⁻ and butyrate⁻, respectively). System enables for determination of about 6 samples per hour. Life time of ISEs average about 2 months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanions 3acolorimetry 3adetectors 3ahydrophobicity 3apolymers 3aspecific ion electrodes 3avolatile fatty acids 3azirconium1 aGórski, Łukasz1 aZamojska-Jaroszewicz, Anna1 aSzewczyk, Krzysztof W.1 aMalinowska-Misiąg, Elżbieta,0 tTalanta.g2011 Sept. 30, v. 85, no. 4 p.2047-2052dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2011.07.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02093naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245012400168300001600292520117000308592002801478650001001506650001101516650001701527700001801544700001901562773010201581856008801683990002301771852000901794655001201803IND60103135020221118223404.0141106e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010313502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphysparis.2013.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYaoi, Ken10aMedial prefrontal cortex dissociation between self and others in a referential task: An fMRI study based on word traits  ap. 517-525.  aA number of recent neuroimaging studies using self referential tasks have investigated whether self referential processing depends on a unique neural basis that operates specifically in the medial prefrontal cortex. However, these studies have provided contradictory results despite the use of similar methodologies. We hypothesized that these discrepancies are partially related to the task-difficulty that presents dissociations reaction times in the self- and other-referential tasks. We therefore measured brain activity during self and other referential tasks to determine if such activity can be dissociated according to the reaction times (fast versus slow) for the trait words. Activation differed across self and other only in the slow word condition. The self referential condition with slow reaction time produced greater activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, whereas the other referential condition with slow reaction time produced activation of the middle temporal gyrus. Results suggested that the task-difficulty might affect whether or not brain activities within MPFC would be dissociated between self- and other-referential processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acortex 3adissociation1 aOsaka, Mariko1 aOsaka, Naoyuki0 tJournal of Physiology - Paris.g2013 Dec., v. 107, no. 6 p.517-525dElsevier Ltdx0928-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphysparis.2013.09.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01485naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008700172300001800259520051200277592002800789650002200817650001700839650002200856700002700878700002300905700001900928700002200947773008500969856008501054990002301139852000901162655001201171IND60105676020221116144648.0141108e20111213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010567602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2011.10.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKossack, Wilhelm10aIR transition moment orientational analysis on semi-crystalline polyethylene films  ap. 6061-6065.  aThe recently developed approach of Transition Moment Orientation Analysis is employed to determine the three dimensional orientation and order of the different molecular moieties in semi-crystalline polyolefins.

Nevertheless, hypovascularity and fibrosis in some types of solid tumors have been demonstrated to reduce the penetration and accumulation of nano-scaled drug carriers. Diffuse-type scirrhous gastric cancers present such characteristics as well as frequent metastasis to the lymph nodes; therefore, it remains a great challenge to eradicate scirrhous gastric cancers based on the drug targeting using nanocarriers. Herein, we demonstrated that polymeric micelles with 30-nm diameter incorporating (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum(II) (DACHPt), the parent complex of the anticancer drug oxaliplatin, efficiently penetrated and accumulated in an orthotopic scirrhous gastric cancer model, leading to the inhibition of the tumor growth. Moreover, the elevated localization of systemically injected DACHPt-loaded micelles in metastastic lymph nodes reduced the metastatic tumor growth. These results suggest DACHPt-loaded micelles as a promising nanocarrier for the treatment of scirrhous gastric cancers and their lymphatic metastases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3afibrosis 3alymph nodes 3ametastasis 3amicelles 3amodels 3ananocarriers 3aplatinum 3astomach neoplasms1 aCabral, H.1 aKano, M.R.1 aMi, P.1 aIwata, C.1 aYashiro, M.1 aHirakawa, K.1 aMiyazono, K.1 aNishiyama, N.1 aKataoka, K.0 tJournal of controlled release.g2012 Apr. 30, v. 159, no. 2 p.189-196dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2012.01.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009000167300001600257520134300273592002801616650001601644650002501660650002201685650001001707650001201717650001401729650001801743650002001761700001801781700002201799700001901821700001901840700002001859773011901879856008301998990002302081852000902104655001202113IND60107377020221122034916.0141108e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010737702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jsbmb.2013.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Eva10aRetinoic acid receptors’ expression and function during zebrafish early development  ap. 143-151.  aRetinoic acid (RA) regulates many developmental processes through its binding to two types of nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), and the retinoid-X receptor (RXR), which preferentially binds to the 9-cis isomer. Here we analyzed the RAR/RXR regulatory system during the first 5 days of development of zebrafish. Analysis of the relative transcript abundances for the four RAR and the six RXR zebrafish genes present in the zebrafish genome indicates a transition from maternal to embryonic transcripts during the first 24h post fertilization. These changes did not affect the response to exogenous RA of the known RAR-responsive genes cyp26a1, dhrs3a, hoxb1b, hoxb5a, and hoxb5b. At the transcriptomic level, RA treatment elicited a negative feedback of genes involved in the endogenous RA synthesis and reduced levels of transcripts related to organ and anatomic development. These effects occurred at concentrations at which no morphological changes were observed. Data analysis suggests that exposure to exogenous RA results in an advance of the developing program, activating genes that should remain silent until later developmental stages and inhibiting expression of development-related genes. We conclude that zebrafish embryos are particularly sensitive to potential disruptors of the RAR/RXR regulatory system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3adevelopmental stages 3aearly development 3agenes 3aisomers 3areceptors 3aretinoic acid 3atranscriptomics1 aCasado, Marta1 aRaldúa, Demetrio1 aSoares, Amadeu1 aBarata, Carlos1 aPiña, Benjamin0 tJournal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology.g2013 Nov., v. 138 p.143-151dElsevier Ltdx0960-07607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2013.03.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01705naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008200168300001400250520077500264592002801039650001601067650001401083650002501097650002101122650002601143700002101169773010001190856008101290990002301371852000901394655001201403IND60108438120221119210504.0141108e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010843812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2012.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinh, Thien Xuan10aDesign and simulation of MEMS-based dual-axis fluidic angular velocity sensor  ap. 61-66.  aIn this paper, we present the design and simulation of a microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based fluidic angular velocity sensor that can simultaneously detect two components of angular velocity (two degrees of freedom).

The high complexity of coastal environment entails the need for new tools that can describe the spatial variability of wind. In this paper, a distribution study of offshore wind power in China using QuikSCAT Level-2 satellite measurements at a 0.5-degree horizontal resolution was performed. Based on long-term information of daily average wind field, the paper gives an overview of the spatio-temporal distribution of wind resources in China's coastal regions. The results indicate that China has significant offshore wind energy development potential. The total offshore wind energy potential at 10m in China is approximately 660GW. The coastal region along Fu Jiang Province has the best wind resource compared with other parts of China's offshore regions. An integrated analysis was made by combining the offshore wind farm plans of coastal provinces with the spatio-temporal characteristics of the wind resource, and suggestions are presented accordingly. We find that the use of wind estimates from satellite data potentially leads to a more refined wind resource analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aremote sensing 3aspatial distribution 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3awind 3awind farms 3awind power 3aChina1 aZhuang, Dafang1 aHuang, Yaohuan1 aWang, Jianhua1 aFu, Jingying0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2013 Aug., v. 24 p.142-148dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2013.03.0583Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245010800160300001600268520114600284592002801430650001401458650001501472650001101487650002401498650004101522650001301563650001301576650001501589650001601604650002701620700001601647700001401663773007601677856008201753990002301835852000901858655001201867IND60102680420221117230528.0141106e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010268042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2011.08.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, S.13aAn experimental investigation of biodiesel synthesis from waste canola oil using supercritical methanol  ap. 229-237.  aSynthesis of biodiesel from waste canola oil using supercritical methanol is investigated under relatively moderate reaction conditions (240–270°C/10MPa) with residence time of 15–45min and methanol to oil weight ratio of 1:1, 1.5:1 or 2:1. The effects of reaction conditions on the biodiesel yield were studied using design of experiments (DOE). The results showed that reaction time, temperature, and their interaction were the most significant factors on the yield. The highest biodiesel yield of 102% was achieved at 270°C, 10MPa, and methanol/oil weight ratio of 2 for 45min reaction time. The GC–MS analysis of the reaction products showed that the by-product, glycerol, further reacted with methanol, generating methyl ethers of glycerol. Further confirmation of this side reaction was obtained by reacting glycerol and methanol at 270°C/10MPa for 15, 30, and 45min. The experimental results showed these reactions could positively affect the overall biodiesel yield by providing oxygenated compounds such as 3-methoxy-1,2-propanediol, dimethoxymethane, and 2,2-dimethoxypropane as well as methyl palmitate and methyl oleate.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acanola oil 3aethers 3aexperimental design 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglycerol 3amethanol 3aoleic acid 3atemperature 3atumor necrosis factors1 aPosarac, D.1 aEllis, N.0 tFuel.g2012 Jan., v. 91, no. 1 p.229-237dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2011.08.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01297naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017500165300001600340520033100356592002800687650001600715650002300731650002300754650001300777700002000790700002100810773008600831856008100917852000900998655001201007IND60109460820221120165254.0141109e20120128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010946082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Wenhua10aOne-pot synthesis of 2,4,5-trisubstituted oxazoles from N-acyl amino acids by a combination of cyclodehydration with N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide and Wittig olefination  ap. 977-981.  aBy a combination of cyclodehydration of N-acyl amino acids with N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) and non-classical Wittig olefination of the resultant 5(4H)-oxazolones with Ph₃PCHCN and Ph₃PCHCOOEt, 5-oxazoleacetonitriles and 5-oxazoleacetates were synthesized in one-pot in 41–85% and 57–70% yields, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aoxazoles1 aDong, Guangping1 aMijiti, Zumureti0 tTetrahedron.g2012 Jan. 28, v. 68, no. 4 p.977-981dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2011.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01279naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014600163300001800309520032800327592002800655650002400683650002300707650002300730650001600753650001800769650002200787773009000809856008100899852000900980655001200989IND60109534720221122002659.0141109e20120923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010953472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.07.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaleki, Ali10aFe₃O₄/SiO₂ nanoparticles: an efficient and magnetically recoverable nanocatalyst for the one-pot multicomponent synthesis of diazepines  ap. 7827-7833.  aIn this research, a new protocol for the one-pot multicomponent synthesis of diazepine derivatives using a 1,2-diamine, a linear or cyclic ketone, and an isocyanide in the presence of a catalytic amount of silica-supported iron oxide (Fe₃O₄/SiO₂) nanoparticles at ambient temperature in excellent yields is described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3airon oxides 3ananoparticles 3aorganic compounds0 tTetrahedron.g2012 Sept. 23, v. 68, no. 38 p.7827-7833dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2012.07.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01708naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010200165300001400267520064600281592002800927650004400955650002200999650001301021650001901034650001401053650001101067650001301078650001601091650002201107650003701129700001601166773008601182856008101268852000901349655001201358IND60110246120221118060908.0141109e20120210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011024612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2011.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xinlong10aPreparation of graphite oxide (GO) and the thermal stability of silicone rubber/GO nanocomposites  ap. 25-28.  aGraphite oxide was synthesized by the oxidation of expanded graphite via a modified Hummers approach.

Levetiracetam (LEV) is a novel antiepileptic drug used to treat epilepsy, but its effects on spatial and emotional learning and memory are not yet well understood. The goal of our study was to establish the effects of LEV (17 and 54mg/kg, intraperitoneally (IP)) on spatial memory retrieval in the Morris water maze test and on acquisition and memory formation in the passive avoidance (PA) test in naive mice. MAIN METHODS: The subjects were adult male BALB/c mice. Spatial learning and memory was established with the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The ‘time spent in escape platforms quadrant’ and the ‘distance to platform’ analyses were measured using a video tracking system to determine spatial memory function. Emotional learning and memory were determined with a one-trial, step-through passive avoidance test. KEY FINDINGS: In the MWM test, LEV (17 and 54mg/kg) neither affected the time spent in the target quadrant nor altered the distance to platform. Moreover, LEV had no effect on swim speed. In the PA task, LEV (17 and 54mg/kg) significantly prolonged retention latency. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that LEV did not alter spatial memory retrieval in the MWM test, but it did show some ameliorating effects on acquisition and memory formation in the PA test in naive mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acognition 3adrugs 3aepilepsy 3amemory 3amice 3apatients 3aquality of life1 aUlak, Guner1 aMutlu, Oguz1 aAkar, Furuzan Yildiz1 aMulayim, Serap1 aErden, Faruk1 aKomsuoglu, Sezer Sener0 tLife sciences.g2012 Jan. 30, v. 90, no. 5-6 p.185-189dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2011.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013700170300001600307520126100323592002801584650003101612650002201643650001801665650000701683650001801690650002301708650001101731650002501742650001601767650001401783650001901797700002201816700001901838700002401857773008401881856008401965852000902049655001202058IND60106005420221120052553.0141108e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010600542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2012.02.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondragon, Rosa10aCharacterization of silica–water nanofluids dispersed with an ultrasound probe: A study of their physical properties and stability  ap. 138-146.  aThe stability and agglomeration state of nanofluids are key parameters for their use in different applications. Silica nanofluids were prepared by dispersing the nanoparticles in distilled water using an ultrasonic probe, which has proved to be the most effective system and gives the best results when compared with previous works. Results were obtained concerning the influence of the solid content, pH and salt concentration on the zeta potential, electrical double layer, viscosity, elastic and viscous moduli, particle size and light backscattering. Measurement of all these properties provides information about the colloidal state of nanofluids. The most important variable is the solid content. Despite the agglomeration due to high concentration, nanofluids with low viscosity and behaving like liquid were prepared at 20% of mass load thanks to the good dispersion achieved with the ultrasonic treatment. The pH of the medium can be used to control the stability, since the nanofluids are more stable under basic conditions far from the isoelectric point (IEP) and settle at pH=2.

This technique can potentially be used as well for targeting imaging. In the present study, we evaluated the potential of using LHM to detect changes in stiffness and the feasibility of using it for imaging purposes in phantoms and in vivo tumor detection. A single-element FUS transducer (80 mm focal length, 100 mm diameter, 1.485 MHz) was used for inducing a localized harmonic motion and a separate ultrasound diagnostic transducer excited by a pulser/receiver (5 kHz PRF, 5 MHz) was used to track motion. The motion was estimated using cross-correlation techniques on the acquired radio-frequency (RF) signal. Silicon phantom studies were performed to determine the size of inclusion that was possible to detect using this technique. Inclusions were discerned from the surroundings as a reduction on LHM amplitude and it was possible to depict inclusions as small as 4 mm. The amplitude of the induced LHM was always lower at the inclusions compared with the one obtained at the surroundings. Ten New Zealand rabbits had VX2 tumors implanted on their thighs and LHM was induced and measured at the tumor region. Tumors (as small as 10 mm in length and 4 mm in width) were discerned from the surroundings as a reduction on LHM amplitude.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNew Zealand White rabbit 3aimage analysis 3amonitoring 3aneoplasms 3asilicon 3asurgery 3athighs 3atissues 3aultrasonics1 aHynynen, Kullervo0 tUltrasound in medicine & biology.g2011 Aug., v. 37, no. 8 p.1230-1239dElsevier Inc.x0301-56297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2011.05.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01864naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245009500163300001600258520097300274592002801247650001101275650001401286650001101300650001601311700001701327700001801344773008401362856008401446990002301530852000901553655001201562IND60110869020221121094156.0141109e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011086902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultras.2010.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, L.10aExplicit model for ultrasonic attenuation in equiaxial hexagonal polycrystalline materials  ap. 303-309.  aAttenuation coefficients for longitudinal and transverse ultrasonic waves are obtained in explicit form for untextured hexagonal polycrystalline materials. The equations obtained are easy to use for interpretation and evaluation of experimental results for ultrasonic characterization of microstructures. The attenuation coefficients are separated into two terms, corresponding to incident wave scattering into longitudinal and transverse waves. It is shown that the general expressions for attenuation coefficients in the long wavelength (Rayleigh) and short wavelength (stochastic) regimes transit to the known classical asymptotics. Simple equations to estimate the frequency range of the transition from the Rayleigh to stochastic regimes are also given. An example of experimental measurements in Ti alloy is provided to illustrate application of the model; the results show reasonable agreement between the experiment and the model with no adjustable parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aequations 3amodels 3awavelengths1 aLobkis, O.I.1 aRokhlin, S.I.0 tUltrasonics.g2011 Apr., v. 51, no. 3 p.303-309dElsevier B.V.x0041-624X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultras.2010.10.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01590naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009700167300001400264520049600278592002800774650001400802650000900816650001800825650001100843650001700854650000900871650001400880653003400894653001700928653002600945653001400971653001700985700002301002773010101025856008101126852000901207655001201216IND60101711320221118050551.0161016e20130930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010171132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2013.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaw, Odette M.13aAn efficient single prime protocol for the induction of antigen-induced airways inflammation  ap. 79-82.  aThere are a number of mouse models of allergic airway inflammation used to delineate various aspects of asthma.

Different parameters affecting the HF-LPME recovery such as nature of organic solvent, pH of donor and acceptor phases, extraction time, stirring speed, salt addition were optimized. Under optimum conditions (1-octanol as organic solvent, pH of the donor phase=3 and pH of acceptor phase=11.5, extraction time of 75min, stirring speed of 1000rpm) limit of detection (LOD) of 0.1ng/mL, linear range of 0.5–300ng/mL and correlation of determination (R²) of 0.9956 were obtained. The relative intra and inter-day standard deviations (RSD%) based on five replicate measurement were 3.5% and 10.7% respectively. Enrichment factor of 315 and recovery 85% were achieved. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method was evaluated by extraction and determination of apigenin in urine sample after consumption of Satureja sahendica Bornm. which is a native medicinal plant from Iran.

Here, we provide an overview of the transcription factors, cytokines, chemokines, and cytokine and chemokine receptors that characterize the Th17 cell phenotype. Data relevant for human Th17 cells are emphasized, with a focus on the function of two markers that have recently been associated with human Th17 cells, CD161 and interleukin-4-induced gene 1 (IL4I1). Also considered is the basis of Th17 cell plasticity towards the Th1 lineage, and we suggest that this plasticity together with the limited expansion of Th17 cells in response to T cell receptor (TCR) triggering accounts for the rarity of human Th17 cells in inflamed tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3achemokines 3agenes 3ahumans 3aphenotype 3areceptors 3atranscription factors 2aAnimals 2aCytokinesxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aHumans 2aModels, Immunological 2aPhenotype 2aReceptors, Cytokineximmunology 2aTh17 Cellsximmunology 2aTranscription Factorsximmunology1 aCosmi, Lorenzo1 aLiotta, Francesco1 aMaggi, Enrico1 aRomagnani, S.q(Sergio),0 tTrends in immunology.g2012 Oct., v. 33, no. 10 p.505-512dElsevier Ltdx1471-49067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2012.05.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014000166300001600306520166600322592002801988650002302016650003102039650001702070650001602087650002002103650002002123650001802143650002002161650001602181650002802197650001902225650003602244650001702280650002402297650001002321650001602331650000902347650001302356650001702369650002502386650001802411650003602429650003202465700002002497700002002517700002002537700001902557700001802576700001702594700002202611700002002633773009102653856008102744852000902825655001202834IND60103529520221120092424.0141106e20120130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010352952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2011.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasakawa, Yuka10aEffects of globin digest and its active ingredient Trp-Thr-Gln-Arg on galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide-induced liver injury in ICR mice  ap. 190-199.  aAIMS: We investigated the effects of globin digest (GD) and its active ingredient Trp-Thr-Gln-Arg (WTQR) on galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide (GalN/LPS)-induced liver injury in imprinting control region (ICR) mice. MAIN METHODS: The effects of WTQR and GD on the liver injury were examined by measuring the survival rate, serum aminotransferase activities, hepatic components, antioxidant enzyme activities, histopathological analysis, serum levels and hepatic gene expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), and nitric oxide (NO) or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 content in GalN/LPS-treated ICR mice. RAW264 mouse macrophages were used to confirm the anti-inflammatory effects of WTQR and GD on the macrophages. KEY FINDINGS: WTQR and GD increased the survival rate, suppressed the serum aminotransferase activities, serum levels and hepatic gene expression of TNF-α, MIP-2, and NO or iNOS, and nuclear NF-κB p65 content in GalN/LPS-treated mice; decreased the oxidized glutathione content, increased the superoxide dismutase activity, and decreased the histopathological grade values of the hepatocyte necrosis and lobular inflammation in GalN/LPS-injured liver; and suppressed the release levels and gene expression of TNF-α, MIP-2, and NO or iNOS, and nuclear NF-κB p65 content in LPS-stimulated RAW264 macrophages. WTQR and GD may improve the antioxidant defense system and inflammatory status in GalN/LPS-injured liver. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that WTQR and GD have hepatoprotective effects on GalN/LPS-induced liver injury in ICR mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3achemokine CXCL2 3aenzyme activity 3agalactosamine 3agene expression 3aglutathione 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahistopathology 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3amacrophages 3amice 3anecrosis 3anitric oxide 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asurvival rate 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aKominami, Akari1 aYamamoto, Kaori1 aNakaoka, Fumiko1 aNakamura, Miki1 aNakao, Mayumi1 aAbe, Michiyo1 aFukuhama, Chizuko1 aKagawa, Kyoichi0 tLife sciences.g2012 Jan. 30, v. 90, no. 5-6 p.190-199dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2011.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011400165300001600279520115700295592002801452650001301480650001701493650001801510650002501528650002801553650001801581650001601599650001201615650001401627650001801641650000901659651001001668700001501678700001601693700001401709700001501723700001901738700001301757700001901770773010301789856008201892990002301974852000901997655001202006IND60108045320221119180138.0141108e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010804532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2013.03.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Zheng,14aThe economic feasibility of a crop-residue densification plant: A case study for the city of Jinzhou in China  ap. 172-180.  aThe efficient utilization of the enormous crop-residue resources in China is crucial for providing biofuel, reducing the risk of environmental pollution, and increasing farmers' income. Examining the case of a crop-residue densification plant in the city of Jinzhou, China, this study examines the economic feasibility of this plant by analyzing raw material supply, product market, energy policy, and financial reports. The results indicate that these factors, such as the raw material supply, market, and energy policy, favor the development of densified biofuel from crop residues. The typical financial indicators were estimated as being notably positive over a 10-year timeframe, and a sensitivity analysis indicated no threats to project profit stability. These aforementioned analyses suggest that the utilization of crop residues as densified biofuel in China possesses good economic viability. If the numerous historical, industrial, geographical, and energy-related similarities are taken into account, this study can also be used to provide a feasibility evaluation methodology for crop-residue densification plants in other similar regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3acase studies 3acrop residues 3aeconomic feasibility 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenergy policy 3afarm income 3amarkets 3apollution 3araw materials 3arisk 3aChina1 aYu, Xinxin1 aTan, Hanqiu1 aLiu, Tian1 aHu, Tianyu1 aZhang, Zhuoyan1 aQiu, Shi1 aChen, Longjian0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2013 Aug., v. 24 p.172-180dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2013.03.0363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01705naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002100159245006400180300001800244520057900262592002800841650004400869650004900913650004600962650001101008650001801019650002301037650001801060650002101078700001601099700001601115700001501131773010701146856009301253852000901346655001201355IND60105846220221123034144.0141108e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010584622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2011.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAymes-Chodur, C.10aRadiation effects on a linear model compound for polyethers  ap. 1225-1235.  aRadiation effects on a model polyether – poly(tetramethylene) glycol (PTMG) induced by high energy radiation were investigated.

Wind speed (V, m/s), wind direction and air temperature (T,°C) at 25m and 50m were collected from SONDA (Sistema de Organização Nacional de Dados Ambientais) meteorological station (38°N 7°E). The average wind speed and temperature for 25m and 50m were found 4.74m/s, 24.46°C and 5.31m/s 24.25°C respectively. The wind speed predominate direction found were SSE (165°) from both 25m and 50m heights. The wind speed distribution curve was obtained using the Weibull probability density function through the WAsP program, the values of Weibull shape (K), scale (A, m/s) and Weibull fit wind speed and power wind density (P, W/m²) were found 2.54, 5.4m/s, 4.76m/s and 103W/m² for 25m wind height measurements and 2.59, 6.0m/s, 5.36m/s and 145W/m² for 50m wind height measurements.

Data were collected on two blade designs tested on a wind turbine rated at 1 kW, and there also was a third blade tested on an improved version of the same wind turbine. The 1 kW wind turbines were used for off-grid water pumping. If the 1 kW wind turbines were electrically loaded, the start of blade flutter was delayed from 700 to 900 rpm when the blade length was reduced 9.2%, and no blade flutter occurred when the shorter fiberglass blades were stiffened. However, if there was no electrical load (e.g. offline), the shorter stiffer blades would start to flutter at 1050 rpm. For the 10 kW wind turbine, two blade designs were tested for off-grid water pumping, and a third blade design was tested on a utility grid-tie system. The original blades fluttered when the 10 kW off-grid wind turbine was offline at a rotor speed of 260 rpm, but the second blade design (different airfoil) appeared to never flutter at any rotor speed when offline. For the 10 kW wind turbine, the sound emission of the second blade design was approximately the same as that of the third blade design – both had lower sound emissions than the original blade design. Blade flutter increased the average sound power level on the 1 kW wind turbine 15–20 dB and on the 10 kW wind turbine 5–7 dB. A procedure was developed which allowed the best blade design for sound emission to be identified even though the microphone measurement position varied (due to different tower heights) and electrical loading was different (on-grid, off-grid, or offline). This paper should be of help to design engineers interested in designing wind turbines with a lower sound emission, and test engineers collecting and analyzing sound level data of existing wind turbines. This paper may also help in the validation of computer codes that are used to predict whether blade flutter will occur on large MW size wind turbines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3aengineers 3afiberglass 3arenewable energy sources 3awind turbines1 aBroneske, Sylvia0 tRenewable energy.g2013 Feb., v. 50 p.1044-1052dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2012.08.0573Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014500168300001500313520134300328592002801671650002101699650001901720650001101739650001301750650001501763650001601778650001101794650001401805650001301819650001701832650002201849650001801871650001101889650001401900650001101914650001901925650001601944650001401960700001701974700001801991700001802009700001802027773010402045856008502149852000902234655001202243IND60101488020221120064822.0141106e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010148802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.06.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVieira, R.B.10aSedimentation of mixed cultures using natural coagulants for the treatment of effluents generated in terrestrial fuel distribution terminals  ap. 98-104.  aThis study evaluated the use of natural coagulants (Moringa oleifera and chitosan) under different conditions with a mixed culture (C1 mixed culture). This culture was used for the biodegradation of hydrocarbons present in the effluent from fuel distribution terminals contaminated with diesel oil and gasoline. The biodegradation was evaluated by two central composite design (CCD) experiments: the first with varying concentrations of Moringa oleifera (MO), drying temperatures (TE) and seed drying times (TI); the second with varying concentrations of chitosan and the hydrochloric acid in which chitosan had been solubilized. The responses monitored in the CCD experiments included the sludge volume index (SVI), the turbidity removal (TR) and the specific rate of oxygen uptake (SOUR). Subsequently, the biodegradation was monitored in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) under the optimal conditions obtained for each CCD experiment. The results indicated that the best coagulant was chitosan solubilized in 0.25N HCl at a concentration of 50mg/L. Within five cycles with chitosan as a coagulant, the total organic carbon (TOC) removal increased from 77±1.0% to 82±0.5%, the volatile suspended solids (VSS) increased from 1.4±0.3 to 2.25±0.3g/L and the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) removal increased from 75±1.0% to 81±0.5%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoringa oleifera 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3achitosan 3acoagulants 3adiesel fuel 3adrying 3aeffluents 3agasoline 3ahydrocarbons 3ahydrochloric acid 3amixed culture 3aoxygen 3apetroleum 3asludge 3asolubilization 3atemperature 3aturbidity1 aVieira, P.A.1 aCardoso, S.L.1 aRibeiro, E.J.1 aCardoso, V.L.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 231-232 p.98-104dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.06.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013700166300001600303520117000319592002801489650001501517650002501532650001701557650001701574650001701591650002601608650002101634650001701655650001301672650002401685650001501709650001701724650001001741700002601751700003001777700001701807700002201824700002201846700002201868773009701890856008401987852000902071655001202080IND60102027420221118103249.0141106e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010202742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2013.07.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAili, David10aHeterogeneous anion conducting membranes based on linear and crosslinked KOH doped polybenzimidazole for alkaline water electrolysis  ap. 424-432.  aPolybenzimidazole is a highly hygroscopic polymer that can be doped with aqueous KOH to give a material with high ion conductivity in the 10⁻²Scm⁻¹ range, which in combination with its low gas permeability makes it an interesting electrolyte material for alkaline water electrolysis. In this study membranes based on linear and crosslinked polybenzimidazole were evaluated for this purpose. Extensive characterization with respect to spectroscopic and physicochemical properties during aging in 6molL⁻¹ KOH at 85°C for up to 176 days indicated structural stability of the high molecular weight specialty polymer, however, with limitations with respect to hydrolytic stability. The gradual decay of the average molecular weight resulted in a severe deterioration of the mechanical properties over time. Membranes based on crosslinked polybenzimidazole showed better stability than the membranes based on their linear counterpart. The technical feasibility of the membranes was evaluated by the preliminary water electrolysis tests showing performance comparable to that of commercially available cell separators with great potential of further improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3aartificial membranes 3acrosslinking 3aelectrolysis 3aelectrolytes 3amechanical properties 3amolecular weight 3apermeability 3apolymers 3apotassium hydroxide 3aseparators 3aspectroscopy 3awater1 aHansen, Martin Kalmar1 aRenzaho, Richard Fulgence1 aLi, Qingfeng1 aChristensen, Erik1 aJensen, Jens Oluf1 aBjerrum, Niels J.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 447 p.424-432dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2013.07.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010800166300001600274520148500290592002801775650002701803650001601830650001901846650001401865650001201879650001101891650001401902650001501916650002701931650003701958650002701995650002102022650001402043650001402057700001802071700002002089773012202109856008102231852000902312655001202321IND60104623320221119204411.0141107e20120428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010462332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2011.08.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzanda, Gergö10aControl mechanisms of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake – feed-forward modulation of aldosterone secretion  ap. 101-108.  aMitochondrial Ca²⁺ signal activates metabolism by boosting pyridine nucleotide reduction and ATP synthesis or, if Ca²⁺ sequestration is supraphysiological, may even lead to apoptosis. Although the molecular background of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake has recently been elucidated, the regulation of Ca²⁺ handling is still not properly clarified. In human adrenocortical H295R cells we found a regulatory mechanism involving p38 MAPK and novel-type PKC isoforms. Upon stimulation with angiotensin II (AII) these kinases are activated typically prior to the release of Ca²⁺ and – most probably by reducing the Ca²⁺ permeation through the outer mitochondrial membrane – attenuate mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake in a feed-forward manner. The biologic significance of the kinase-mediated reduction of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signal is also reflected by the attenuation of AII-mediated aldosterone secretion. As another feed-forward mechanism, we found in HEK-293T and H295R cells that Ca²⁺ signal evoked either by IP₃ or by voltage-gated influx is accompanied by a concomitant cytosolic Mg²⁺ signal. In permeabilized HEK-293T cells Mg²⁺ was found to be a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake in the physiologic [Mg²⁺] and [Ca²⁺] range. Thus, these inhibitory mechanisms may serve not only as protection against mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overload and subsequent apoptosis but also have the potential to substantially alter physiological responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aaldosterone 3aangiotensin II 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3ahumans 3amagnesium 3ametabolism 3amitochondrial membrane 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphysiological response 3aprotein kinase C 3apyridines 3asecretion1 aRajki, Anikó1 aSpät, András,0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2012 Apr. 28, v. 353, no. 1-2 p.101-108dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2011.08.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009700170300001200267520148900279592002801768650004401796650003701840650001201877650001701889650001401906650002301920650001101943650001201954650001401966650002101980650002102001700001802022700001902040700001902059700001902078700001502097700001502112773011002127856008502237990002302322852000902345655001202354IND60102263820221118092810.0141106e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010226382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcata.2012.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Kandari, H.10aSpectroscopic characterization–catalytic activity correlation of molybdena based catalysts  ap. 1-8.  aTitania-supported molybdena catalyst was prepared by calcination at 773K of ammonium heptamolybdate-impregnated TiO₂ pellets with the equivalent of 5 monolayers of MoO₃. Then, potassium-modified versions of the catalyst were prepared at 0.5–5wt%-K. The modified and unmodified catalysts were characterized, before and after H₂-reduction at 673K, by means of ISS, XPS, UPS and FT-IR spectroscopy techniques. Results obtained enabled revealing the presence of density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level and, hence, metallic properties related to the deformed rutile structure of MoO₂. On the other hand, Brønsted (MoOH) acidic function was found to form on the surface of the MoO₂ structure, thereby producing a metal-acid (bifunctional) MoO₂₋ₓ(OH)y catalyst. The presence of Brønsted acid MoOH groups was evidenced by in situ IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine molecules. On the other hand, the K-modification was found to enhance the molybdena dispersity and reducibility, but to suppress the surface acidity by transforming the bifunctional MoO₂₋ₓ(OH)y species into the monofunctional MoO₂₋ₓ(OK)y species. Subsequent catalytic measurements employing hydrotreating reactions of 1-hexene and n-hexane could confirm the exposure of bifunctional or monofunctional sites on the catalysts tested. The combination of research methods adopted in the present investigation has shown competency in unravelling the nature of active sites on heterogeneous catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacidity 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3ahexane 3apellets 3apyridines 3aresearch methods 3atitanium dioxide1 aMohamed, A.M.1 aAl-Kandari, S.1 aAl-Kharafi, F.1 aMekhemer, G.A.1 aZaki, M.I.1 aKatrib, A.0 tJournal of Molecular Catalysis.

We report a prospective clinical evaluation of the performances of SSI for liver fibrosis evaluation in 113 patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and a comparison with FibroScan (FS). Liver elasticity values using SSI and FS ranged from 4.50 kPa to 33.96 kPa and from 2.60 kPa to 46.50 kPa, respectively. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows a good agreement between fibrosis staging and elasticity assessment using SSI and FS (p < 10⁻⁵). The areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for elasticity values assessed from SSI were 0.948, 0.962 and 0.968 for patients with predicted fibrosis levels F ≥ 2, F ≥ 3 and F = 4, respectively. These values are compared with FS area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.846, 0.857 and 0.940, respectively. This comparison between ROC curves is particularly significant for mild and intermediate fibrosis levels. SSI appears to be a fast, simple and reliable method for noninvasive liver fibrosis evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis C virus 3aanalysis of variance 3afibrosis 3aimage analysis 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3apatients1 aGennisson, Jean-Luc1 aCouade, Mathieu1 aBercoff, Jeremy1 aMallet, Vincent1 aFink, Mathias1 aBadel, Anne1 aVallet-Pichard, AnaÏs1 aNalpas, Bertrand1 aTanter, Mickaël1 aPol, Stanislas0 tUltrasound in medicine & biology.g2011 Sept., v. 37, no. 9 p.1361-1373dElsevier Inc.x0301-56297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2011.05.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245015300172300001400325520083700339592002801176650001201204650001101216650002401227650001301251650000901264650001501273650002401288650001801312650000901330651001101339700002601350700002701376700002201403700002701425700002301452700002501475700001801500700001801518700002201536773007401558856008201632990002301714852000901737655001201746IND60102680820221117230559.0141106e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010268082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2011.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrindade, Jemmla M.10aAnodic stripping voltammetry coupled with design of experiments for simultaneous determination of Zn⁺², Cu⁺², Pb⁺², and Cd⁺² in gasoline  ap. 26-32.  aIn this paper a rapid method of anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) coupled with experimental design was developed for simultaneous determination of Zn²⁺, Cd²⁺, Pb²⁺, and Cu²⁺ in gasoline samples. A microwave assisted gasoline digestion procedure for sample preparation was also established. The determination limit was found to be 0.24μgL⁻¹ for Zn²⁺; 8.58×10⁻⁴μgL⁻¹ for Cd²⁺; 0.13μgL⁻¹ for Pb²⁺, and 0.87μgL⁻¹ for Cu²⁺. It was found that the interferences of concomitant metal ions were negligible. Gasoline samples collected in the city of São Luis (MA), Brazil were analyzed using this developed method, and the results demonstrated that this method was reliable and accurate. It is expected that this method can be used as a routine technique for metal ion determination in gasoline.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3acopper 3aexperimental design 3agasoline 3alead 3ametal ions 3amicrowave treatment 3arapid methods 3azinc 3aBrazil1 aMartiniano, Lorena C.1 aGonçalves, Vivia R.A.1 aSouza, Antonio G.1 aMarques, Aldaléa L.B.1 aBaugis, Guintar L.1 aFonseca, Teresa C.O.1 aSong, Chaojie1 aZhang, Jiujun1 aMarques, Edmar P.0 tFuel.g2012 Jan., v. 91, no. 1 p.26-32dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2011.06.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016000165300001600325520148700341592002801828650002301856650001701879650001601896650001701912650001401929650002601943650001001969650002101979650001902000650001802019650001102037650001502048650001402063700001502077773009102092856008102183990002302264852000902287655001202296IND60110558120221120142503.0141109e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011055812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tiv.2012.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKar, Supratik10aFirst report on predictive chemometric modeling, 3D-toxicophore mapping and in silico screening of in vitro basal cytotoxicity of diverse organic chemicals  ap. 597-608.  aClassification and regression based quantitative structure–toxicity relationship (QSTR) as well as toxicophore models were developed for the first time on basal cytotoxicity data (in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake data) of a diverse series of chemicals (including drugs and environmental pollutants) collected from the ACuteTox database (http://www.acutetox.eu/). Statistically significant QSTR models were obtained using linear discriminant analysis (classification) and partial least squares (regression) methodologies. Generated toxicophore models showed four important features responsible for basal cytotoxicity: (i) two hydrophobic aliphatic groups (HYD Aliphatic), (ii) ring aromatic group (RA) and (iii) hydrogen bond donor (HBD). The most predictive hypothesis (Hypo 1) had a correlation coefficient of 0.932 for the training set, a low rms deviation of 1.105, and an acceptable cost difference of 62.8 bits, which represents a true correlation and a good predictivity. QSTR and toxicophore models were rigorously validated internally as well as externally along with the randomization test to nullify the possibilities of chance correlation. Our in silico models enable to identify the essential structural attributes and quantify the prime molecular pre-requisites which were chiefly responsible for in vitro basal cytotoxicity. The developed models were also implemented to screen basal cytotoxicity for huge number DrugBank database (http://www.drugbank.ca/) compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3achemometrics 3acorrelation 3acytotoxicity 3adatabases 3adiscriminant analysis 3adrugs 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aleast squares 3amodels 3apollutants 3ascreening1 aRoy, Kunal0 tToxicology in vitro.g2013 Mar., v. 27, no. 2 p.597-608dElsevier Ltdx0887-23337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2012.10.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245012600159300001800285520027500303592002800578650001200606650002300618650002300641653001500664653003200679653002500711653005800736653003200794653003200826653003200858653003200890653003200922653003200954653003200986653003201018653003201050653003201082653003201114653003201146653003201178653003201210653003201242653003201274653003201306653003201338653003201370653003201402653003201434653003201466653003201498653003201530653003201562700001601594700001501610700001601625700001401641700001801655700001401673700001501687700001601702773008001718856008101798852000901879655001201888IND60109618620221121073103.0161018e20130527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010961862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2013.03.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, You13aAn efficient one-pot three-component process for the synthesis of highly substituted perfluoroalkylated cyclopentadienes  ap. 4205-4210.  aA series of highly substituted perfluoroalkylated cyclopentadiene derivatives were efficiently synthesized in moderate to excellent yields by isocyanides, methyl 2-perfluoroalkynoates and electrophilic alkenes via a one-pot three-component reaction under mild condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 0aIsocyanide 0aMethyl 2-perfluoroalkynoate 0aElectrophilic alkene 0aHighly substituted perfluoroalkylated cyclopentadiene 0aJJNZXLAFIPKXIG-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aOOAUDRNFNVGPJL-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aKMLIMEMHBGEKRH-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aPCMZYYBQKUWREH-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aUCBJKQSJASXTTB-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aHNVAUTUJXUMGPH-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aYNNLCWSNRABZNY-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aWZQWHLPLLDZKIH-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aYFBFYIMYUFBHAE-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aQEPGXJOJLHBGKG-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aQGESGQINLPXOJL-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aVZUIMBZTZJCXIV-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aMSFMFVSANHORSZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aXWTIRRMOQCCTEF-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aCIBZEUXYUFYWCH-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aSMQPFDLDHFLJHV-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aROEJJJOHJUSTGV-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aQRBDBOZAJFMECU-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aVYZPRJHRTTUOSZ-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aITROFVAHTPALBU-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aKQUXXJMMRODTQF-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aHNMRESMHSFBTHQ-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aKTRJNJOBRNNZHA-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aVUHCLMVMCWHCPB-UHFFFAOYSA-N 0aSYCZAQYJPIWPMX-UHFFFAOYSA-N1 aYan, Xufeng1 aYan, Lijun1 aWang, Zewei1 aChen, Jie1 aDeng, Hongmei1 aShao, Min1 aZhang, Hui1 aCao, Weiguo0 tTetrahedron.g2013 May 27, v. 69 p.4205-4210dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2013.03.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006700168300001400235520132500249592002801574650001501602650001501617650001401632650001601646650001901662650001801681650001101699650001501710650001501725650002401740700001701764700001701781700001701798700001501815700001801830773010501848856008401953990002302037852000902060655001202069IND60108845820221121021126.0141108e20111027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010884582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seppur.2011.08.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Jian-Gang10aPerformance evaluation on complex absorbents for CO₂ capture  ap. 87-92.  aPiperazine (PZ) and phosphates as additives were added into an aqueous N-methylmonoethanolamine (MMEA) to form complex absorbents, respectively. Performances of CO₂ capture by the complex absorbents were evaluated in a bubble column reactor. Reaction mechanisms and activations of the additives were presented theoretically. Effects of type and concentration of additives, and gas flowrates on volumetric mass transfer coefficient were investigated, and effects of orifice size of the gas sparger and stirring rates on average absorption velocity were also discussed. Results show that CO₂ loadings of MMEA–PZ and MMEA–K₃PO₄ complex absorbents were larger than that of single MMEA and MEA absorbents. The MMEA–PZ complex absorbent gave a highest CO₂ loading in all complex absorbents. The overall mass transfer coefficient increased, subsequently reached a maximum and then decreased with the increase of K₃PO₄ concentration in the complex absorbent. The overall mass transfer coefficient increased with the increase of the gas flow rates. Average absorption velocities increased with the decrease of the orifice size and with the increase of the orifice numbers. The average absorption velocities in moderate intensity of stirring rates were higher than that in the high intensity of stirring rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aabsorption 3aadditives 3abioreactors 3acarbon dioxide 3amass transfer 3amixing 3aphosphates 3apiperazine 3areaction mechanisms1 aHua, Ai-Chun1 aBao, Lan-Lan1 aLiu, Shi-Xin1 aZhang, Hui1 aXu, Zheng-Wen0 tSeparation and purification technology.g2011 Oct. 27, v. 82 p.87-92dElsevier B.V.x1383-58667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2011.08.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010500170300001600275520124500291592002801536650001401564650001401578650001401592650001601606700002001622773008301642856008401725990002301809852000901832655001201841IND60110869420221121094153.0141109e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011086942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultras.2010.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSon, Myung Seob14aThe effect of initial stress on the propagation behavior of SH waves in piezoelectric coupled plates  ap. 489-495.  aThis study analytically investigates the propagation of shear waves (SH waves) in a coupled plate consisting of a piezoelectric layer and an elastic layer with initial stress. The piezoelectric material is polarized in z-axis direction and perfectly bonded to an elastic layer. The mechanical displacement and electrical potential function are derived for the piezoelectric coupled plates by solving the electromechanical field equations. The effects of the thickness ratio and the initial stress on the dispersion relations and the phase and group velocities are obtained for electrically open and mechanically free situations. The numerical examples are provided to illustrate graphically the variations of the phase and group velocities versus the wave number for the different layers comparatively. It is seen that the phase velocity of SH waves decreases with the increase of the magnitude of the initial compression stress, while it increases with the increase of the magnitude of the initial tensile stress. The initial stress has a great effect on the propagation of SH waves with the decrease of the thickness ratio. This research is theoretically useful for the design of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices with high performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aequations 3aequipment 3aultrasonics1 aKang, Yeon June0 tUltrasonics.g2011 May, v. 51, no. 4 p.489-495dElsevier B.V.x0041-624X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultras.2010.11.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024002200136024001900158040001800177100003800195245012300233300001600356520140200372592002801774650001801802650001401820650001201834650001801846650001601864650001101880650001701891650001501908650001701923650001201940650001701952650000901969650001701978650001401995650002002009650001502029650001702044700002402061700002402085700002102109773010302130856008802233990002302321852000902344655001202353IND60105528220221118231104.0141108e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010552822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.01.0052doi7 aPMC59379402pmcid7 a212768162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Kenneth E.,d1926 July 6-10aGlutamate pharmacology and metabolism in peripheral primary afferents: Physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms  ap. 283-309.  aIn addition to using glutamate as a neurotransmitter at central synapses, many primary sensory neurons release glutamate from peripheral terminals. Primary sensory neurons with cell bodies in dorsal root or trigeminal ganglia produce glutaminase, the synthetic enzyme for glutamate, and transport the enzyme in mitochondria to peripheral terminals. Vesicular glutamate transporters fill neurotransmitter vesicles with glutamate and they are shipped to peripheral terminals. Intense noxious stimuli or tissue damage causes glutamate to be released from peripheral afferent nerve terminals and augmented release occurs during acute and chronic inflammation. The site of action for glutamate can be at the autologous or nearby nerve terminals. Peripheral nerve terminals contain both ionotropic and metabotropic excitatory amino acid receptors (EAARs) and activation of these receptors can lower the activation threshold and increase the excitability of primary afferents. Antagonism of EAARs can reduce excitability of activated afferents and produce antinociception in many animal models of acute and chronic pain. Glutamate injected into human skin and muscle causes acute pain. Trauma in humans, such as arthritis, myalgia, and tendonitis, elevates glutamate levels in affected tissues. There is evidence that EAAR antagonism at peripheral sites can provide relief in some chronic pain sufferers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aarthritis 3aganglia 3aglutamic acid 3aglutaminase 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ametabolism 3amitochondria 3amuscles 3anerve tissue 3apain 3apharmacology 3areceptors 3asensory neurons 3atendinitis 3atransporters1 aHoffman, E.

(Asteraceae) induces immunostimulatory effects in vitro and in vivo  ap. 1001-1006.  aMaturin acetate (MA) is one of main constituents in Psacalium peltatum. The cytotoxic effects of MA on tumorigenic cells were evaluated using the MTT assay. The in vitro immunostimulatory effects of maturin acetate (MA) were evaluated on the viability of murine splenocytes and macrophages, and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The effects of MA on the production of nitrous oxide, pinocytosis and lysosomal enzyme activity were assayed in murine macrophages RAW 264.7. The effects of MA on the NK cell activity were also assayed. The in vivo immunostimulatory activities of MA were evaluated on BALB/c mice immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide (CY). MA lacks cytotoxic activity against human cancer cells (IC₅₀>200μM). In the absence of LPS, MA 10μM or higher stimulated significantly (P⩽0.05), compared to untreated cells (-LPS), the viability of murine macrophages and splenocytes. In the absence of LPS, MA 10μM or higher stimulated significantly (P⩽0.05), compared to untreated cells (-LPS), the lysosomal enzyme activity and pinocytosis. In immunosuppressed mice, MA increases significantly (P⩽0.05), compared to CY-treated mice, the production of IL-2 and IL-15 and IFN-γ. In conclusion, MA exerts immunostimulatory activities in vitro and in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsacalium 3aacetates 3acyclophosphamide 3acytotoxicity 3aendocytosis 3aenzyme activity 3ahumans 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-15 3ainterleukin-2 3amacrophages 3amice 3amononuclear leukocytes 3aneoplasm cells 3anitrous oxide 3asplenocytes 3aviability1 aAlonso Castro, Angel Josabad,1 aRojano-Vilchis, Nadia1 aJiménez-Estrada, Manuel1 aGarcía-Carrancá, Alejandro0 tToxicology in vitro.g2013 Apr., v. 27, no. 3 p.1001-1006dElsevier Ltdx0887-23337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2013.01.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010300171300001600274520126500290592002801555650001901583650001101602650001201613650001101625650002201636650001201658650001101670650002901681700002001710700002101730700001901751700001801770773011001788856008201898990002301980852000902003655001202012IND60107883820221122112311.0141108e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010788382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2011.07.1392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiesenthal, Tobias12aA model-based assessment of the impact of revitalised R&D investments on the European power sector  ap. 105-112.  aThis paper presents an analysis of the effect of enhanced research and development (R&D) efforts for a set of low-carbon power technologies on the development of the European energy sector. It applies a methodology using the concept of Two-Factor-Learning, which quantitatively links trends in technology cost to both accumulated R&D investments and production volumes. The impacts of the latter on the energy sector are then simulated in a consistent manner with the POLES global energy model. On this basis, it compares the total system costs of an assumed increase in worldwide R&D investments that for the EU are in line with proposals made in its European Strategic Energy Technology Plan to a baseline development. It finds that an increase in research efforts at a global level will contribute to reducing the costs of currently less mature low-carbon technologies, thus accelerating their market entry. When comparing two scenarios that both fulfil the EU's 2020 energy and climate objectives and differing only in their R&D investment levels, the reduced technology costs allow EU support policies for renewables and carbon values to be reduced, and the cumulative (discounted) benefit of the accelerated research efforts is positive in the long term.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aenergy 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amodels 3aresearch and development1 aMercier, Arnaud1 aSchade, Burkhard1 aPetric, Hrvoje1 aDowling, Paul0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2012 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.105-112dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2011.07.1393Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01630naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015600168300001800324520049000342592002800832650002500860650002300885650001800908650001100926653002100937653001400958653002400972653002800996700001801024700001801042700002001060700001801080773008001098856008101178852000901259655001201268IND60109618720221121073013.0161018e20130527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010961872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2013.03.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshimitsu, Yuji10aSynthesis of pachastrissamine (jaspine B) and its derivatives by the late-stage introduction of the C-2 alkyl side-chains using olefin cross metathesis  ap. 4211-4220.  aAn improved divergent synthesis of the four diastereomers of pachastrissamine from Garner's aldehyde has been reported.

As co-crystallization process involves several molecular species, which are generally solid at room conditions, its control requires accurate knowledge and monitoring of the different phase that might appear during the formulation stage. In the present study the suitability of X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in quantifying mixtures of carbamazepine polymorphs (forms I and III), saccharin, and carbamazepine–saccharin cocrystals (form I) is assessed. Quaternary crystalline mixtures typically produced in the process of co-crystal production were analyzed by multivariate methods. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used for the identification of the crystal phases, while unsupervised simultaneous fitting of the spectra from pure phases, or supervised partial least squares (PLS) methods were used for their quantitative determination. The performance of data analysis was enhanced by applying peculiar pre-processing methods, such as SNIP filtering in case of FTIR and PCA filtering in case of XRPD. It was found that, for XRPD data, the automatic multi-fitting procedures and PLS models developed in this study are able to quantify single phases in mixtures to an accuracy level comparable to that obtained by the widely used Rietveld method, which, however, requires knowledge of the crystal structures. For FTIR data the results here obtained prove that this technique can be used as a fast method for polymorph characterization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aquantitative analysis 3abioactive properties 3amonitoring 3acrystal structure 3adrugs 3amodels 3aleast squares 3aprincipal component analysis 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3asolubility 3asaccharin 3aX-radiation 0amultivariate analysis1 aDi Profio, Gianluca1 aNicolotti, Orazio0 tJournal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis.g2013 May 5, v. 78-79 p.269-279dElsevier B.V.x0731-70857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2013.01.0423Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245009800209300001400307506007600321520085800397592002801255506003701283650000801320650001501328650002001343650000801363650002101371650001701392650001401409700002101423700002401444700001901468700002001487773010001507856008201607852000901689655001201698IND60110714420221207144327.0141109e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011071442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2011.10.0032doi7 aPMC33419842pmcid7 a221188112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrasby, Jane A.10aUnpairing and gating: sequence-independent substrate recognition by FEN superfamily nucleases  ap. 74-84.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStructure-specific 5′-nucleases form a superfamily of evolutionarily conserved phosphodiesterases that catalyse a precise incision of a diverse range of DNA and RNA substrates in a sequence-independent manner. Superfamily members, such as flap endonucleases, exonuclease 1, DNA repair protein XPG, endonuclease GEN1 and the 5′-3′-exoribonucleases, play key roles in many cellular processes such as DNA replication and repair, recombination, transcription, RNA turnover and RNA interference. In this review, we discuss recent results that highlight the conserved architectures and active sites of the structure-specific 5′-nucleases. Despite substrate diversity, a common gating mechanism for sequence-independent substrate recognition and incision emerges, whereby double nucleotide unpairing of substrates is required to access the active site.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aDNA replication 3aRNA 3aRNA interference 3aactive sites 3anucleases1 aFinger, L.

Three mutations substitute Leu⁵, Arg⁶, and Arg⁹ to Ser (L5S), Trp (R6W) and Cys (R9C) in dynorphin A(1–17) (Dyn A), a peptide with both opioid activities and non-opioid neurodegenerative actions. It has been reported that Dyn A administered intrathecally (i.t.) in femtomolar doses into mice produces nociceptive behaviors consisting of hindlimb scratching along with biting and licking of the hindpaw and tail (SBL responses) through a non-opioid mechanism. We here evaluated the potential of the three mutant peptides to produce similar behaviors. Compared to the wild type (WT)-peptide, the relative potency of Dyn A R6W, L5S and R9C peptides for SBL responses was 50-, 33- and 2-fold higher, and Dyn A R6W and L5S induced the SBL responses at a 10–30-fold lower doses. Dyn A R6W was the most potent peptide. The SBL responses induced by Dyn A R6W were dose dependently inhibited by morphine (i.p.; 0.1–1mg/kg) or MK-801, an NMDA ion channel blocker (i.t. co-administration; 5–7.5nmol). CP-99,994, a tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist (i.t. co-administration; 2nmol) and naloxone (i.p.; 5mg/kg) failed to block effects of Dyn A R6W. Thus, similarly to Dyn A WT, the SBL responses induced by Dyn A R6W may involve the NMDA receptor but are not mediated through the opioid and tachykinin NK1 receptors. Enhanced non-opioid excitatory activities of Dyn A mutants may underlie in part development of SCA23.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3aataxia (disorder) 3agenes 3ahumans 3aion channels 3amice 3amissense mutation 3amorphine 3amutants 3analoxone 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3apeptides 3areceptors 3atail1 aMizoguchi, Hirokazu1 aVerbeek, Dineke S.1 aKuzmin, Alexander1 aNyberg, Fred1 aKrishtal, Oleg1 aSakurada, Shinobu1 aBakalkin, Georgy0 tPeptides.g2012 June, v. 35, no. 2 p.306-310dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2012.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013300172300001400305520117200319592002801491650001701519650002101536650001601557650002201573650001701595650004301612650000701655650002001662700002401682700002301706773011701729856008201846990002301928852000901951655001201960IND60102995920221118050554.0141106e20130505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010299592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jpba.2013.01.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLocatelli, Marcello10aHigh performance liquid chromatography determination of prulifloxacin and five related impurities in pharmaceutical formulations  ap. 27-33.  aA novel HPLC method for the simultaneous determination of Prulifloxacin, Ulifloxacin, its process impurities in a tablets formulation and Enrofloxacin, used as Internal Standard, is developed.

It was found that a two-stage degradation happened due to PMMA graft chain and PDMS main chain, respectively, and the grafting ratio of PMMA can be calculated through the first-stage weight loss. The 5% weight loss temperature (T₅%) of PDMS-g-PMMA increased with increasing PDMS contents.

Practical industrial sampling constitutes the only source for gaining data for reliable process monitoring and control – but involves a high error potential if not based on unambiguous, representative samples. For the comparatively new sector of biomass combustion or co-firing of biomass in converted coal power plants, reliable quality measures are crucial to assure stable fuel quality and for being able to optimize the combustion process. All so-called “incorrect sampling errors” (incorrect delineation, – extraction and – preparation) must be identified, reduced, if not altogether eliminated, lest representativeness is impossible. For reaching this target and to ensure representative sampling, a minimum working understanding of TOS is required. Sampling standards serve the purpose to delineate the foundation and assurance for reliable, representative sampling under all circumstances for the material class(es) involved, and must for this reason be in full compliance with TOS. This critical review shows that many recommended or allowed sampling procedures for solid biofuels do not comply herewith, and neither are all the necessary rules of TOS followed for the subsequent mass reduction procedures in the analytical laboratory. We point out all such error sources in the current standards and discuss what measures are necessary to rectify this incomplete state-of-affairs. The current review is but one activity within the context of formulating an even more general, “horizontal” sampling standard intended to cover all material classes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acoal 3acombustion 3acompliance 3apower plants 3aprocess monitoring1 aEsbensen, Kim H.0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2012 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.504-517dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2011.08.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245008900176300001600265520127600281592002801557650002501585650001201610650002201622650000901644650001801653650001301671650002401684650002101708650001601729650001701745650001001762650001801772650001601790700002301806700002301829700002101852773010001873856008401973852000902057655001202066IND60101933020221121013052.0141106e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010193302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2012.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerchtold, Kathryn A.10aPolybenzimidazole composite membranes for high temperature synthesis gas separations  ap. 265-270.  aHigh temperature gas separation techniques are of great interest for reduction in green-house gas emissions from hydrocarbon fuels such as natural gas, coal or biomass used in power and chemical industry. In this work, a robust industrially viable polybenzimidazole (PBI)/stainless steel composite membrane is developed and evaluated for syngas separations at elevated temperatures for H₂ production. A single tube laboratory scale PBI membrane module is tested for H₂/CO₂ perm-selectivity in pure and simulated dry syngas environments at industrially relevant operating conditions. Additionally, the effects of pressure and temperature on membrane performance are evaluated. The PBI composite membrane demonstrated exceptional long term thermo-chemical stability in the syngas environment even in the presence of H₂S and excellent separation performance for H₂ over the other syngas components. The H₂ permeance and H₂/CO₂ selectivity for the PBI composite membrane in simulated dry syngas was recorded at 7 GPU (approximately, 88 barrer) and 47, respectively. In comparison to the other H₂-selective polymeric membranes, the PBI composite membrane's performance exceeded the 2008 Robeson upper bound for the H₂/CO₂ permeability versus selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3abiomass 3achemical industry 3acoal 3agas emissions 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrogen sulfide 3anatural gas 3apermeability 3asteel 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature1 aSingh, Rajinder P.1 aYoung, Jennifer S.1 aDudeck, Kevin W.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 415-416 p.265-270dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2012.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01898naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245006700177300001600244520106400260592002801324650001701352650001101369650001501380700001701395700001701412773009701429856008501526852000901611655001201620IND60101188820221116143709.0141106e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010118882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2013.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Cindy Shin-Huei10aForecasting a long memory process subject to structural breaks  ap. 171-184.  aWe develop an easy-to-implement method for forecasting a stationary autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) process subject to structural breaks with unknown break dates. We show that an ARFIMA process subject to a mean shift and a change in the long memory parameter can be well approximated by an autoregressive (AR) model and suggest using an information criterion (AIC or Mallows’ Cₚ) to choose the order of the approximate AR model. Our method avoids the issue of estimation inaccuracy of the long memory parameter and the issue of spurious breaks in finite sample. Insights from our theoretical analysis are confirmed by Monte Carlo experiments, through which we also find that our method provides a substantial improvement over existing prediction methods. An empirical application to the realized volatility of three exchange rates illustrates the usefulness of our forecasting procedure. The empirical success of the HAR-RV model can be explained, from an econometric perspective, by our theoretical and simulation results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometrics 3amodels 3aprediction1 aBauwens, Luc1 aXiao, Cheng,0 tJournal of econometrics.g2013 Dec., v. 177, no. 2 p.171-184dElsevier B.V.x0304-40767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2013.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011800164300001400282520168700296592002801983650002202011650001402033650002702047650002202074650002002096650002302116650001702139650001302156650002102169650000902190650000902199650001502208650001502223650001902238650001802257650001302275650001902288650001502307650003302322650001702355650001402372650001602386650002102402650001302423650003702436650001502473700001802488700001802506700001702524700001702541700001702558773011302575856008202688852000902770655001202779IND60100679120221119212441.0141105e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010067912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xing10aFlower-like porous hematite nanoarchitectures achieved by complexation–mediated oxidation–hydrolysis reaction  ap. 36-45.  aFlower-like porous hematite (α-Fe₂O₃) nanoarchitectures composed of ultra-thin nanoflakes were prepared by annealing the iron oxide precursor formed via the oxidation-hydrolysis reaction between Fe(II) ions and Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (abbreviated as Tris). The microstructure of the prepared FeOOH and hematite samples were fully characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier-transforming infrared spectra, thermogravimetric analysis, and nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm. Based on the influences of reactant concentrations, reaction time and reaction temperature on the morphologies of the resultant samples, a formation mechanism of etching was proposed, Fe(II)–Tris complexes were self-assembled via hydrogen bonds into brick-like building blocks, which then aggregated into rudimentary nanoparticles, and the synergistic effect between the crystallization of FeOOH and dissociation of Fe(II)–Tris complexes make the rudimentary nanoparticles evolve into the flower-like products. The as-prepared flower-like α-Fe₂O₃ nanostructures possessed a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface area of 191.63m²g⁻¹, hierarchical pore distribution ranging from micropores to macropores, and good crystallinity, and excellent visible photocatalysis in terms of removing chemical oxygen demand of dimethyl sulfoxide industrial wastewater. The current work provides a reliable approach for building functional hierarchical nanoarchitectures and the prepared iron oxide nanomaterials demonstrate an excellent ability to remove toxic pollutants in industrial wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aannealing 3achemical oxygen demand 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adissociation 3ahematite 3ahydrogen bonding 3aions 3airon 3amacropores 3amicropores 3amicrostructure 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3aphotocatalysis 3apollutants 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3asynergism 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastewater1 aGuan, Jianguo1 aXiao, Zhidong1 aTong, Guoxiu1 aMou, Fangzhi1 aFan, Xi’an0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 May 1, v. 357, no. 1 p.36-45dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01448naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245005200172300001800224520062300242592002800865650001400893650001100907650001000918700001800928773011100946856008101057990002301138852000901161655001201170IND60104083020221119195640.0141107e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010408302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2010.05.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChalub, Fabio A.C.C.14aThe SIR epidemic model from a PDE point of view  ap. 1568-1574.  aWe present a derivation of the classical Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) and Susceptible-Infected-Removed-Susceptible (SIRS) models through a mean-field approximation from a discrete version of SIR(S).

Instead of using large volume devices, the extraction was simply carried out in typical 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes along with the use of micropipettes for accurate transfer of liquids, vortex mixer for efficient partitioning of solutes and benchtop centrifuge for rapid phase separation. In the last step, back-extraction was performed by using the microvolume of acidic solution in order to concentrate the colored species into a confined aqueous microdrop and to keep the analyst away from unwanted contact and inhalation of organic solvents during the quantitation step which was achieved by using cuvetteless UV–vis micro-spectrophotometry without any prior dilutions. Using chlorpheniramine maleate as a representative analyte and n-butyl acetate as a less toxic and non-ozone depleting extractant, the miniaturized method was less laborious and much faster. It was accurate, precise and insensitive to the interferences from common excipients. Notably, it gave the assay results of drug in tablets and oral solution comparable to the large-scale pharmacopeial method while the consumption of organic solvents and the release of wastes were lowered by 200–400 folds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3abreathing 3adrugs 3amaleates 3aseparation 3asolutes 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy 3atoxicity 3awastes1 aSripattanaporn, Areerut1 aWaewsa-nga, Kwanrutai1 aBuacheen, Parin1 aOpanasopit, Praneet1 aNgawhirunpat, Tanasait1 aRojanarata, Theerasak0 tTalanta.g2012 Aug. 30, v. 98 p.220-225dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2012.06.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02017naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008800167300001600255520081000271592002801081650002101109650001701130650003101147650001901178650003701197650001701234650003301251650001701284650001301301700001301314700001501327700001501342700001401357700001601371700001701387773008701404856008401491990002301575852000901598655001201607IND60103998720221121231924.0141107e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010399872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.04.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Along10aCross-linked multilayer composite films and microcapsules embedded carbon nanotubes  ap. 132-135.  aThe layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) is carried out via the electrostatic interactions on planar substrates and polystyrene (PS) microsphere templates.

However, it may cause uneven thermal stress which destroys the stability of frequency split and mode shape. Though frequency splits can be reduced to the same degree by trimming at different positions of the resonator, the thermal stresses caused by varying temperatures are significantly different. In this paper, the stress effects of trimmed cupped resonators considering the influence of temperature are studied. The dynamical behavior of the cupped resonators at various temperatures is presented. The stress effects of trimmed resonators due to temperature variation are analyzed based on FE model. Simulation results show that under the same conditions, the bottom trimming gives rise to much more thermal stress than suspension trimming and ring trimming. In addition, a trimming method based on adding mass is studied. Finally, experiments were set up to validate the stress effect by using vibration measurement equipments and frequency analysis equipments. Experimental results show that with reference to the temperature variation the bottom trimming affects the frequency split and the mode deflection of the cupped resonator significantly.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3atemperature 3athermal stress 3avibration1 aWu, Yulie1 aWu, Xiaomei1 aTao, Yi1 aWu, Xuezhong0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we determined that the F-box protein FBXO11 interacts with CDT2, a DCAF protein that controls cell-cycle progression, and recruits CDT2 to the SCFFBXO11complex to promote its proteasomal degradation. In contrast to most SCF substrates, which exhibit phosphodegron-dependent binding to F-box proteins, CDK-mediated phosphorylation of Thr464 present in the CDT2 degron inhibits recognition by FBXO11. Finally, our results show that the functional interaction between FBXO11 and CDT2 is evolutionary conserved from worms to humans and plays an important role in regulating the timing of cell-cycle exit.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aF-box proteins 3acell cycle 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3aphosphorylation 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aDuan, Shanshan1 aJeong, Yeon-Tae1 aHorn, Moritz1 aSaraf, Anita1 aFlorens, Laurence1 aWashburn, Michael P.1 aAntebi, Adam1 aPagano, Michele0 tMolecular cell.g2013 Mar. 28, v. 49 p.1159-1166dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01683naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245006400174300001600238520083300254592002801087650001901115650002301134650001201157650001301169773010301182856008801285990002301373852000901396655001201405IND60103133820221118223450.0141106e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010313382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphysparis.2013.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiccone, Albert10aRhythmicity in infants’ experiences and their development  ap. 286-290.  aThis article deals with the importance of rhythm in infants’ experiences, underscoring its function in relation to sense of being and the continuity of that sense. Although some discontinuity is inevitable, and indeed necessary for development, it can expose infants to chaotic experiences if there is no underlying rhythmicity. Observations of infants have highlighted their ability to manage their experiences of discontinuity (providing these are not too disorganizing) by finding supports and manufacturing a rhythmicity that enables them to remain open to self and to the world. Rhythmicity of experience is important not just in infant development, but also - and more generally - in learning contexts and psychological care settings. In every situation, external rhythms must be attuned to the individual’s inner one.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahuman behavior 3ainfant development 3ainfants 3alearning0 tJournal of Physiology - Paris.g2013 Sept., v. 107, no. 4 p.286-290dElsevier Ltdx0928-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphysparis.2013.03.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003700148245012000185300001600305520190000321592002802221650002202249650001302271650001102284650001902295650002302314650002302337650001202360650001802372650001402390650000702404650001502411650001602426650001302442650001102455650001302466650001602479650002202495700002402517700002002541700002602561700002502587773009702612856008202709852000902791655001202800IND60100237620221121140042.0141105e20110214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010023762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2010.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPârvulescu, V.

However up to now, the porosity of gallium phosphates collapsed upon template removal or exposure to the ambient moisture. In the present work, we describe high-surface thermally stable mesoporous gallium phosphates synthesized from gallium propoxide and PCl₃ and different templating agents such as amines (dipropylamine, piperidine and aminopiperidine) and quaternary ammonium salts (C₁₆H₃₃(CH₃)3NBr and C₁₆PyCl). These highly reactive precursors have so far not been used as gallium and phosphate sources for the synthesis of gallophosphates. Conceptually, our present synthetic procedure is based on the fast formation of gallium phosphate nanoparticles via the reaction of gallium propoxide with PCl₃ and subsequent construction of the porous material with nanoparticles as building blocks. The organization of the gallophosphate nanoparticles in stable porous structures is effected by the templates. Different experimental procedures varying the molar composition of the sol–gel, pH and the pretreatment of gallium precursor were assayed, most of them leading to satisfactory materials in terms of thermal stability and porosity. In this way, a series of gallium phosphates with surface are above 200m²g⁻¹, and narrow pore size from 3 to 6nm and remarkable thermal stability (up to 550°C) have been prepared. In some cases, the structure tends to show some periodicity and regularity as determined by XRD. The remarkable stability has allowed us to test the catalytic activity of gallophosphates for the aerobic oxidation of alkylaromatics with notable good results. Our report reopens the interest for gallophosphates in heterogeneous catalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaluminum 3aamines 3aammonium salts 3aaromatic compounds 3acatalytic activity 3agallium 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphosphates 3apiperidines 3aporosity 3asolids 3asurfaces 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aParvulescu, Viorica1 aCiuparu, Dragos1 aHardacre, Christopher1 aGarcia, Hermenegildo0 tJournal of catalysis.g2011 Feb. 14, v. 278, no. 1 p.111-122dElsevier Inc.x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2010.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245010600171300001600277520144600293592002801739650002201767650001301789650001401802650001101816650001001827700002001837700002001857773010301877856008801980990002302068852000902091655001202100IND60103133920221118223551.0141106e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010313392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphysparis.2013.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXavier, Jean10aChildren’s synchrony and rhythmicity in imitation of peers: Toward a developmental model of empathy  ap. 291-297.  aThe main mechanisms of children’s imitative exchanges with peers are highlighted here through a developmental approach taking into account the importance of rhythmicity and synchrony. We focused on spontaneous motor imitation to describe a playful dynamic that is paradoxical: in the experience of play in which roles are not clearly distributed, mutual discovery of the self and others gradually arises. From an integrative perspective, this form of interaction, produced by positional reversal and turn taking, is apprehended through two axis. On the temporal plan, it can be considered as a rhythmic pattern with repetition and synchrony. Moreover, these mutual exchanges between the self and others challenge visuo-spatial abilities in children who must be able to change their reference point through an operation of mental rotation. Based on this description of the intersubjective experience produced through a succession of spatial and symbolic viewpoint changes, a developmental model of empathy is offered and discussed. According to this model, the capacity of empathy has two dimensions, emotional and cognitive, and is understood as a process involved in child development. In this article, we propose that empathy is more than the “mere” capacity of decentration corresponding to the acquisition of a theory of mind. It involves an individual in relationship with others and who has the ability to integrate perspectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3achild development 3achildren 3acognition 3amodels 3apeers1 aTilmont, Elodie1 aBonnot, Olivier0 tJournal of Physiology - Paris.g2013 Sept., v. 107, no. 4 p.291-297dElsevier Ltdx0928-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphysparis.2013.03.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245015900174300001800333520137200351592002801723650001201751650003501763650001101798650001601809650002001825650000901845650001401854650000901868650001201877650001301889650000901902700002001911700001701931773008601948856008502034852000902119655001202128IND60109138720221121232038.0141109e20110930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010913872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2011.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaratepe, Aslıhan10aSelective preconcentration of thallium species as chloro and iodo complexes on Chromosorb 105 resin prior to electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry  ap. 1974-1979.  aA selective preconcentration method was described for the determination of inorganic thallium species by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). Thallium(III) and thallium(I) as chloro and iodo complexes were selectively retained by a column containing 0.5g of Chromosorb 105 resin and quantitatively eluted by 10mL of pure acetone. The calibration graph was linear with a correlation coefficient of 0.997 at levels near the detection limit and up to at least 0.8μgL⁻¹. The detection limits for the determination of total thallium and thallium(III) employing the proposed method by ETAAS were estimated as three values of the standard deviations, 0.050μgL⁻¹ and 0.034μgL⁻¹, respectively. Verification of the accuracy was carried out by the analysis of standard reference materials (GBW 07402 soil, NIST 2710 Montana soil, GBW 07309 and GBW 07310 stream sediments). The relative errors were found to be in the range of −7.7% to +4.8%. The relative standard deviations were generally found to be below 10%. The effect of potential interfering ions on the determination was studied. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of total thallium in five different brand cements, soils around two cement plants and metallic zinc samples. The speciation of thallium(I) and thallium(III) was applied to synthetic solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acement 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3aions 3asediments 3asoil 3astreams 3athallium 3azinc1 aSoylak, Mustafa1 aElçi, Latif0 tTalanta.g2011 Sept. 30, v. 85, no. 4 p.1974-1979dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2011.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01493naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009500162300001800257520041000275592002800685650002000713650001400733650002300747650002300770650001200793650002600805650001300831650001600844700001600860700001600876700001800892700001400910700001700924773008800941856008101029852000901110655001201119IND60109372720221119165450.0141109e20110520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010937272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.03.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Ran10aGreen, efficient and practical Michael addition of arylamines to α,β-unsaturated ketones  ap. 3631-3637.  aThe aza-Michael addition of aromatic amines to α,β-unsaturated ketones was carried out effectively at room temperature in good to excellent yields without any catalyst or solvent.

For the composites with the mass ratio of carbon nanotube to silicone rubber ranging from 0.04 to 0.10, the piezoresistivities are monotonically increasing within the pressure ranging from 0 to 1MPa. The hysteresis (repeatability) error decreases with the increase of the number of the load/unload cycles. There exist the increasing and decreasing tendencies in the electrical resistance of the composite under the multi-load/unload, which are caused by the changes in the resistivity and the geometric size of the composite. The resistivity increases with the increase of the pressure. The absolute value of the deviation between the resistivities under the same pressure in the adjacent load (unload) cycles decreases with the increase of the number of the load (unload) cycles. The variations in the resistivity under the multi-load/unload are explained by analyzing the changes in the three-dimensional network composed of the contributive tunneling films (CTFs) between the adjacent carbon nanotubes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrical resistance 3ahysteresis 3arubber 3asilicone1 aXu, Chuanguo1 aLi, Yanling0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses are thought to play a major role in the control and clearance of several viral infections in mice and humans. It is therefore expected that over evolutionary time, viruses would be forced to evolve to avoid recognition by CTLs. Indeed, a number of studies have documented the accumulation of viral variants with escape mutations. These mutations allow viruses to hide from CTL responses common in the host population. CTLs recognize viruses by short protein sequences, named epitopes, derived from viral proteins. The efficiency of viral recognition by epitope-specific CTL responses depends on the expression pattern of the proteins carrying these epitopes, and the total amount of that protein (and thus epitopes) in the cell. When a virus replicates in a cell, some viral genes are expressed early in the life cycle of the virus, while other proteins are expressed late. For example, HIV infected cells first express Rev and Tat proteins, and the Gag proteins are expressed late. Here we propose a dynamical model of the viral life cycle to study how expression level of early vs. late genes may affect viral dynamics within the host and virus transmission over the course of infection. We find that for acute and chronic viral infections lower expression of early genes than that of the late genes is expected to give selective advantage and higher transmission to viruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3acytotoxicity 3adynamic models 3aepitopes 3aevolution 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmunity 3amice 3amutation 3aprotein synthesis 3aviral proteins 3avirus transmission 3aviruses 2aAcute Disease 2aAnimals 2aChronic Disease 2aComputer Simulation 2aHost-Pathogen Interactionsximmunology 2aHumans 2aImmunity, Cellularximmunology 2aMice 2aModels, Immunological 2aT-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxicximmunology 2aVirus Diseasesximmunologyxvirology. 2aVirusesxgrowth & developmentximmunology.1 aGanusov, Vitaly V.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2012 Oct. 7, v. 310 p.3-13dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.06.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013700175300001600312520153400328592002801862650001501890650002401905650001801929650002001947650001901967650001601986650002202002650001702024650001302041650001102054650002002065650001602085650002302101650001702124651001102141700002002152700002602172773007602198856008502274852000902359655001202368IND60109210320221120155434.0141109e20120830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010921032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2012.06.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandao, Geovani C.14aThe chemical generation of NO for the determination of nitrite by high-resolution continuum source molecular absorption spectrometry  ap. 231-235.  aIn the present work, we propose a method for the determination of nitrite based on the chemical generation of nitric oxide (NO) and its detection by high-resolution continuum source molecular absorption spectrometry. NO is generated by the reduction of nitrite in acidic media with ascorbic acid as the reducing agent and then transferred into a quartz cell by a stream of argon carrier gas. The conditions under which the NO is generated are as follows: 0.4molL⁻¹ hydrochloric acid, 1.5%(w/v) ascorbic acid, an argon gas pressure of 0.03MPa and an injection time of the reducing agent of 4s. All measurements of molecular absorption were performed using the NO line at 215.360nm, and the signal was measured by peak height. Under these conditions, the method described has limits of detection and quantification of 0.045 and 0.150μgmL⁻¹ of nitrite, respectively. The calibration curve is linear for nitrite concentrations in the range 0.15–15μgmL⁻¹. The precision, estimated as the relative standard deviation (RSD), was 3.5% and 4.4% for solutions with nitrite concentrations of 0.5 and 5.0μgmL⁻¹, respectively. This method was applied to the analysis of different water samples (well water, drinking water and river water) collected in Cachoeira City, Bahia State, Brazil. The results were in agreement with those obtained by a spectrophotometric method using the Griess reaction. Addition/recovery tests were also performed to check the validity of the proposed method. Recoveries of 93–106% were achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aargon (noble gases) 3aascorbic acid 3adetection limit 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3ahydrochloric acid 3anitric oxide 3anitrites 3aquartz 3areducing agents 3ariver water 3aspectrophotometers 3aspectroscopy 3aBrazil1 aLima, Daniel C.1 aFerreira, Sergio L.C.0 tTalanta.g2012 Aug. 30, v. 98 p.231-235dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2012.06.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245012000173300001600293520156400309592002801873650001101901650002501912650001401937650001401951650001601965650002101981650001802002650001402020650001102034650001002045650001002055650001202065650001102077650002002088651001002108651001302118700002202131700002102153700002202174773008902196856008702285990002302372852000902395655001202404IND60108190120221118143932.0141108e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010819012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resourpol.2013.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCareddu, Nicola10aFrom landfill to water, land and life: The creation of the Centre for stone materials aimed at secondary processing  ap. 258-265.  aThis paper focuses on the creation of a Centre for the recycling of stone materials. The Centre will be able to offer a range of activities amongst which is the improvement of the production chain of the Orosei Marble district in Sardinia, Italy. Several companies operate within the marble producing area, specializing in both quarrying and stone processing. They have formed a Consortium in order to rehabilitate an area of more than 17ha. The restoration will be carried out through an environmentally sustainable procedure. The area was previously used as a landfill for waste deriving from marble quarrying and processing. At that time unshaped blocks of various sizes (which are unsuitable to block-cutter sawing), waste deriving from both block sawing and slab/strip cutting (such as broken slabs, strips, tiles) and microfine dust from filter presses of water treatment plants were representing an environmental problem. The local administration was struggling to find new areas which could be used for landfills, resulting in an additional cost for the landfill, ultimately affecting the variable production costs. The project involves the building of a venue to be used for temporary storage, treatment of wastes produced by both quarrying and primary processing, in order to make them suitable as secondary raw materials. The project also deals with the catch basin hydrology of the area involved in the project, the building of a multifunctional centre, the landscaping and other environmental features such as vehicle traffic and slopes greening.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abusiness enterprises 3ahydrology 3alandfills 3alandscaping 3aproduction costs 3araw materials 3arecycling 3asawing 3aslabs 3atiles 3atraffic 3awastes 3awater treatment 3aItaly 3aSardinia1 aSiotto, Giampaolo1 aSiotto, Riccardo1 aTilocca, Caterina0 tResources policy.g2013 Sept., v. 38, no. 3 p.258-265dElsevier Ltdx0301-42077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2013.05.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001900188245007400207300001600281506007600297520164800373592002802021506003702049650002502086650001002111650002302121650001102144650002102155650001002176650001302186650002402199650001102223650000902234650004402243650002402287650003702311650004402348650002202392650003702414700002202451700002702473700002602500700002402526700002302550700002402573700002102597700002602618773010402644856008102748852000902829655001202838IND60102083220221207055150.0141106e20110624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010208322DNAL7 a215305412pmid7 aPMC31590282pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2011.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Meiying10aStructural Features and Chaperone Activity of the NudC Protein Family  ap. 722-741.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe NudC family consists of four conserved proteins with representatives in all eukaryotes. The archetypal nudC gene from Aspergillus nidulans is a member of the nud gene family that is involved in the maintenance of nuclear migration. This family also includes nudF, whose human orthologue, Lis1, codes for a protein essential for brain cortex development. Three paralogues of NudC are known in vertebrates: NudC, NudC-like (NudCL), and NudC-like 2 (NudCL2). The fourth distantly related member of the family, CML66, contains a NudC-like domain. The three principal NudC proteins have no catalytic activity but appear to play as yet poorly defined roles in proliferating and dividing cells. We present crystallographic and NMR studies of the human NudC protein and discuss the results in the context of structures recently deposited by structural genomics centers (i.e., NudCL and mouse NudCL2). All proteins share the same core CS domain characteristic of proteins acting either as cochaperones of Hsp90 or as independent small heat shock proteins. However, while NudC and NudCL dimerize via an N-terminally located coiled coil, the smaller NudCL2 lacks this motif and instead dimerizes as a result of unique domain swapping. We show that NudC and NudCL, but not NudCL2, inhibit the aggregation of several target proteins, consistent with an Hsp90-independent heat shock protein function. Importantly, and in contrast to several previous reports, none of the three proteins is able to form binary complexes with Lis1. The availability of structural information will be of help in further studies on the cellular functions of the NudC family.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAspergillus nidulans 3abrain 3acatalytic activity 3acortex 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3agenomics 3aheat shock proteins 3ahumans 3amice 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAspergillus nidulansxmetabolism 2aFungal Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Chaperonesxmetabolism1 aCierpicki, Tomasz1 aBurdette, Alexander J.1 aUtepbergenov, Darkhan1 aJanczyk, Paweł Ł.1 aDerewenda, Urszula1 aStukenberg, P.

During the 9-week period of vaccine availability and circulation of the A(H1N1)2009 virus, 4608 cases of medically attended influenza-like illness (MA-ILI) were registered (46 per 1000 person-years). After adjustment for sociodemographic covariables, outpatient visits and major chronic conditions, vaccination was associated with a 32% (95% CI: 8–50%) reduction in the overall incidence of MA-ILI. In a test negative case–control analysis nested in the cohort, swabs from 633 patients were included, and 123 were confirmed for A(H1N1)2009 influenza. No confirmed case had received A(H1N1)2009 vaccine versus 9.6% of controls (p<0.001). The vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza was 89% (95% CI: 36–100%) after adjusting for age, health care setting, major chronic conditions and period.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Series of steroid derivatives having pure and potent antagonistic activity on the human and rodent AR were synthesized. Assays of AR binding and activity in carcinoma mouse Shionogi and human LNCaP cells as well as in vivo bioavailability measurements and in vivo prostate weight assays in the rat were used. RESULTS: The chosen lead steroidal compound, namely EM-5854, has a 3.7-fold higher affinity than BICA for the human AR while EM-5855, an important metabolite of EM-5854, has a 94-fold higher affinity for the human AR compared to BICA. EM-5854 and EM-5855 are 14 times more potent than BICA in inhibiting androgen (R1881)-stimulated prostatic specific antigen (PSA) secretion in human prostatic carcinoma LNCaP cells in vitro. MDV3100 has a potency comparable to bicalutamide in these assays. Depending upon the oral formulation, EM-5854 is 5- to 10-times more potent than BICA to inhibit dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-stimulated ventral prostatic weight in vivo in the rat while MDV3100 has lower activity than BICA in this in vivo model. These data are supported by respective 40-fold and 105-fold higher potencies of EM-5854 and EM-5855 compared to BICA to inhibit cell proliferation in the androgen-sensitive Shionogi carcinoma cell model. CONCLUSIONS: Although the present preclinical results data need evaluation in clinical trials in men, combination of the data obtained in vitro in human LNCaP cells as indicator of potency in the human prostate and the data on metabolism evaluated in vivo on ventral prostate weight in the rat, could suggest the possibility of a 70- to 140-fold higher potency of EM-5854 compared to bicalutamide (Casodex) for the treatment of prostate cancer in men.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aandrogen receptors 3aantagonists 3aantigens 3abioavailability 3acarcinoma 3acastration 3acell proliferation 3aclinical trials 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3ahumans 3amen 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amice 3amodels 3aneutralization 3aprasterone 3aprostatic neoplasms 3arats 3asecretion1 aMartel, Céline1 aLabrie, Fernand0 tJournal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology.g2012 Oct., v. 132, no. 1-2 p.93-104dElsevier Ltdx0960-07607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2012.02.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01810naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006700164300001800231520089700249592002801146650001901174650002201193650002401215700001401239700001601253700001501269773011101284856008101395990002301476852000901499655001201508IND60104132120221116193039.0141107e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010413212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2011.10.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Bao-Qun10aModeling and analysis for the P2P-based media delivery network  ap. 1529-1539.  aWith many applications of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) techniques, the P2P-based Media Delivery Network (MDN) has been established to improve the system performance and efficiency in the process of media contents sharing. In this paper, we first propose a kind of media delivery network and particularly introduce its system design and implementation. Then, we develop a novel dynamic model to characterize the behaviors of MDN systems. States of the dynamic model are defined and used to describe the interaction among the Peer-Nodes (PNs) in systems. Based on this model, some important policies, such as peer selection policy and bandwidth allocation policy, are clearly proposed. We improve these policies and call them state-based policies. Finally, to verify the validity and reasonability of the model, some experiments are designed to compare the general policies with the state-based policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3adynamic models 3aissues and policy 3asystems engineering1 aGuo, Dong1 aHuang, Jing1 aWu, Xu-Min0 tMathematical and computer modelling.g2012 Feb., v. 55, no. 3-4 p.1529-1539dElsevier Ltdx0895-71777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2011.10.0433Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002300167245011000190300001600300520110500316592002801421650002301449650001701472650000901489650002601498650001001524650002101534650001101555650001201566650003601578650002801614650002501642650002401667650001101691650001601702650002301718650002901741650001701770700001601787700002001803773009701823856008201920990002302002852000902025655001202034IND60107435220221122003635.0141108e20120507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010743522DNAL7 a223100672pmid7 a10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarker, Heather A.12aA game theoretic model of kleptoparasitism with strategic arrivals and departures of beetles at dung pats  ap. 292-298.  aDung beetles Onthophagus taurus lay their eggs in brood balls within dung pats. The dung that is used must be sufficiently fresh, and so beetles must keep moving from pat to pat to find fresh dung. If another beetle finds a brood ball it will usually eat the egg inside and lay its own egg in the brood ball instead of constructing its own ball. Thus, beetles will often stay near their eggs to guard them. We model a population of beetles where the times of arrival and departure from pats are strategic choices, and investigate optimal strategies depending upon environmental conditions, which can be reduced to two key parameters, the cost of brood ball construction and the ease of finding balls to parasitise. We predict that beetles should follow one of three distinct behaviors; stay in patches for only short periods, arrive late and be purely parasitic, remain in pats for longer periods in order to guard their brood balls. Under different conditions populations can consist of the first of these types only, a combination of the first and second types, or a combination of all three types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOnthophagus taurus 3adung beetles 3aeggs 3aenvironmental factors 3afeces 3akleptoparasitism 3amodels 2aAnimals 2aAppetitive Behaviorxphysiology 2aColeopteraxphysiology. 2aCompetitive Behavior 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aGame Theory 2aModels, Biological 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aTime Factors1 aBroom, Mark1 aRychtář, Jan,0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2012 May 7, v. 300 p.292-298dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.01.0383Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008800176300001800264520138300282592002801665650001301693650001701706650001301723650001301736650001601749700002001765700001901785700002301804700002701827773008501854856008501939990002302024852000902047655001202056IND60105817320221119143626.0141108e20131018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010581732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2013.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrofino, Antonela B.12aA simple strategy to generate light-responsive azobenzene-containing epoxy networks  ap. 6184-6190.  aAzobenzene containing epoxy networks are a class of photosensitive materials characterized by high thermal, optical and mechanical stability, promising for reversible optical storage applications. Here, we propose an encouraging two-step method to fabricate crosslinked coatings by simply reacting an amine-functionalized azobenzene and an epoxy resin in bulk for specified times to get soluble products (network precursors). Thin films based on these precursors were prepared, and thermally crosslinked in order to obtain high-Tg materials. The optical response of the materials was determined, both before and after crosslinking. In the case of the samples as prepared, the dynamic time response of the system is fast, as well as the relaxation of the photoinduced birefringence, as expected due to the high mobility of the chromophore. On the other hand, crosslinked systems have a slightly slower response, but higher values of remnant birefringence, providing stability of the photoinduced orientation, what makes them promising materials to use in optical storage applications. Besides, further analysis on the effect of temperature on the induced birefringence of the polymeric networks was also conducted to help optimization of material design. Finally, we had presented some preliminary investigations of surface relief grating recording in the obtained new materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acrosslinking 3aepoxides 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aArenas, Gustavo1 aZucchi, Ileana1 aGalante, María J.1 aOyanguren, Patricia A.0 tPolymer.g2013 Oct. 18, v. 54, no. 22 p.6184-6190dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2013.09.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle05162naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008200167300001100249500001500260520365200275592002803927650001503955650001203970650001903982650002004001650001304021650001204034650002004046650002104066650001304087650002204100650002504122650003104147650001104178650001704189650001404206650001304220650001904233650001804252650002404270650002004294650001904314650002404333651001604357651001404373653000904387700002004396773007504416856008504491990002304576852000904599655001204608IND60103506120221121193332.0141106e20131205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010350612DNAL7 a10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62580-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaher, Suzy10aRisk factors for cerebral palsy in Palestinian children: a case-control study  ap. S8.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: Little is known about the risk factors for cerebral palsy in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). Indeed, the focus in studies so far has been on developed countries. We therefore assessed known prenatal and perinatal risk factors for cerebral palsy in Palestinian children, and three risk factors specific to Palestinian society—consanguineous marriage, delivery at private maternity homes that lack emergency facilities, and no prenatal doctor visits. METHODS: Using questionnaires for the parents of children, we gathered data for prenatal and perinatal risk factors for cerebral palsy between January and August, 2011, and checked information against medical records from the national centre for Palestinian children with cerebral palsy (Jerusalem Princess Basma Center for Disabled Children) for cases and from outpatient clinics for controls. If information differed between the two sources, medical records were favoured. Cases were children who attended the Jerusalem Princess Basma Center for Disabled Children; they were selected by use of convenient sampling. Inclusion criteria for cases were diagnosis of cerebral palsy by a doctor and age younger than 15 years, and for controls any other diagnosis and age younger than 15 years. Controls were every other child attending ten paediatric clinics (UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, private, and public) in the West Bank, matched to cases by location. We used SPSS (version 19.0) for logistic regression analyses with estimations of odds ratio and 95% CI. Ethics approval was obtained from all clinics, the Jerusalem Princess Basma Center for Disabled Children, and the Al-Quds University's institutional review board. All parents provided written informed consent. FINDINGS: 107 children were cases (mean age 3·87 years [SD 2·71]) and 223 were controls (4·17 years [3·94]). In cases, the risk of cerebral palsy was highest after caesarean delivery (48 [45%]) and after hypoxia diagnosed by a doctor (49 [46%]). Other important and significant risk factors were low birthweight (25 [23%] cases vs 25 [11%] controls; odds ratio 4·6 [95% CI 2·6–8·1]), gestational age (35 [33%] vs 32 [14%]; 2·9 [1·7–5·0]), jaundice (20 [19%] vs 17 [8%]; 2·7 [1·4–5·6]), multiple births (ten [9%] vs two [<1%]; 11·4 [2·5–53·0]), infection during pregnancy (20 [19%] vs ten [4%]; 4·8 [2·2–10·9]) and delivery (14 [13%] vs ten [4%]; 5·0 [1·5–16·7]), congenital abnormalities (ten [9%] vs one [<1%]; 2·4 [1·3–4·4]), and other children with a disability in the family (15 [14%] vs four [2%]; 8·9 [2·9–27·6]). New, previously unassessed population-specific factors of significance were consanguineous marriage (51 [48%] cases vs 54 [24%] controls; 2·9 [1·8–4·6]), no prenatal doctor visits (12 [11%] vs five [2%]; 5·5 [1·9–16·1]), and delivery at private maternity homes lacking emergency facilities (67 [63%] vs 85 [38%]; 0·6 [0·3–1·1]). Associations of some risk factors with cerebral palsy remained significant after adjustment for gestation and sex: consanguineous marriage (4·3 [2·2–8·6]) and no prenatal doctor visits (6·6 [1·7–24·9]) but not for delivery at private maternity homes lacking emergency facilities (13 [12%] cases vs 43 [19%] controls; 0·43 [0·03–5·30]). INTERPRETATION: Several of the known risk factors are preventable or modifiable. Behavioural changes might enable a reduction in the number of cases of cerebral palsy resulting from consanguinity or an absence of prenatal care and policy changes to regulate private maternity homes in the oPt.

Amid this increasing funder diversity and growing global health budgets, responsiveness to recipients’ needs is a central concern. Merging datasets on ODA flows in 2005–07, over 2,800 foundation grants, disease burden, and perceived priorities in 27 low- and middle-income countries, this study offers the first comprehensive national-level analysis of global health aid responsiveness. The analysis shows that national patterns of disease burden explain neither public nor private aid flows during this period. While ODA committed during these years was weakly yet significantly correlated with health priorities, private grants’ responsiveness was even weaker and did not achieve ODA significance levels either.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburden of disease 3adata collection 3agrants1 aKeating Bench, Kara0 tWorld development.g2011 Aug., v. 39, no. 8 p.1271-1280dElsevier Ltdx0305-750X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2010.12.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012100169300001600290500001500306520131300321592002801634650001901662650002201681650002201703650001901725650002401744650001501768650001301783650002101796653000901817653001401826700001601840700002301856700002301879700002301902700001401925700001901939773008801958856008102046990002302127852000902150655001202159IND60108663820221119072427.0141108e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010866382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.07.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakano, Michihiko10aPretreatment of cell membranes for improved electropermeabilization-assisted dielectrophoretic impedance measurement  ap. 676-681.  a2019-12-04  aWe improved our previously reported highly sensitive bacteria detection method called electropermeabilization-assisted dielectrophoretic impedance measurement (EPA-DEPIM), which counts the number of bacteria by measuring changes in impedance. EPA-DEPIM involves two processes: collection of bacteria by dielectrophoresis (DEP), followed by electropermeabilization (EP) of the cell membranes. In DEP, bacterial cells in aqueous solution are collected on microelectrodes by the dielectrophoretic force. In EP, a pulse-like rectangular wave is applied to the collected cells to disrupt their membranes. This increases the signal sensitivity because the disrupted membranes release intracellular ions that increase the change in impedance. However, the pulse-like EP wave creates a strong electric field that causes metal ions to be released from the microelectrodes, increasing the blank signal to levels comparable to that for a low-concentration Escherichia coli suspension (10²cells/ml). To address this problem, we demonstrated the efficacy of two types of pretreatment applied before the EP wave: chemical pretreatment by exposure to hydrogen peroxide, and physical pretreatment by a small pulse-like voltage. Both pretreatments successfully intensified the change in impedance even at a lower EP voltage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aaqueous solutions 3ahydrogen peroxide 3acell membranes 3amicrobial detection 3ametal ions 3abacteria 3aEscherichia coli 0aions 0aimpedance1 aHamada, Ryo1 aTakayama, Hiroyuki1 aShonishi, Yasuhiko1 aHisajima, Takafumi1 aMao, Lina1 aSuehiro, Junya0 tSensors and actuators.g2012 Oct., v. 173 p.676-681dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.07.0783Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245013000209300001400339506007600353520167000429592002802099506003702127650001302164650001602177650001202193650001002205650001102215650001602226650001502242650002402257650001502281650000902296650001102305650004302316650000902359650001502368700001602383700002402399700001802423700002102441700002102462700001902483700001702502700002302519700002402542700001902566773009402585856008102679852000902760655001202769IND60110377020221207073822.0141109e20120716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011037702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2012.03.0112doi7 aPMC35150692pmcid7 a225078822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWall, Richard J.10aNovel 2-amino-isoflavones exhibit aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist or antagonist activity in a species/cell-specific context  ap. 26-33.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) mediates the induction of a variety of xenobiotic metabolism genes. Activation of the AhR occurs through binding to a group of structurally diverse compounds, most notably dioxins, which are exogenous ligands. Isoflavones are part of a family which include some well characterised endogenous AhR ligands. This paper analysed a novel family of these compounds, based on the structure of 2-amino-isoflavone. Initially two luciferase-based cell models, mouse H1L6.1c2 and human HG2L6.1c3, were used to identify whether the compounds had AhR agonistic and/or antagonistic properties. This analysis showed that some of the compounds were weak agonists in mouse and antagonists in human. Further analysis of two of the compounds, Chr-13 and Chr-19, was conducted using quantitative real-time PCR in rat H4IIE and human MCF-7 cells. The results indicated that Chr-13 was an agonist in rat but an antagonist in human cells. Chr-19 was shown to be an agonist in rat but more interestingly, a partial agonist in human. Luciferase induction results not only revealed that subtle differences in the structure of the compound could produce species-specific differences in response but also dictated the ability of the compound to be an AhR agonist or antagonist. Substituted 2-amino-isoflavones represent a novel group of AhR ligands that must differentially interact with the AhR ligand binding domain to produce their species-specific agonist or antagonist activity and future ligand binding analysis and docking studies with these compounds may provide insights into the differential mechanisms of action of structurally similar compounds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3adioxins 3agenes 3ahumans 3aisoflavones 3aluciferase 3amechanism of action 3ametabolism 3amice 3amodels 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3atoxicology1 aHe, Guochun1 aDenison, Michael S.1 aCongiu, Cenzo1 aOnnis, Valentina1 aFernandes, Alwyn1 aBell, David R.1 aRose, Martin1 aRowlands, J.

As-prepared TiO₂/C composites were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–Vis DRS), thermal analysis (TA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that the TiO₂/C composite which has been eventually calcinated at 400°C in air possesses the highest visible-light photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) and the removal of propylene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aair 3aargon (noble gases) 3adrying 3amethyl orange 3amixing 3apolymers 3apropylene 3areflectance 3atemperature 3athermal analysis 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aXue, Xiaoxiao1 aLi, Qiuye1 aZhang, Min1 aYang, Jianjun0 tMaterials letters.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 88 p.79-81dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2012.08.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245011200162300001800274520140400292592002801696650002201724650002001746650001001766700001601776700001701792700001401809773007801823856008201901990002301983852000902006655001202015IND60102653620221120061329.0141106e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010265362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2010.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Hao10aDEM–CFD simulation of the particle dispersion in a gas–solid two-phase flow for a fuel-rich/lean burner  ap. 1584-1590.  aThe objective of this study was to numerically investigate the particle dispersion mechanisms in the gas–solid two-phase jet for a fuel-rich/lean burner by means of coupling the discrete element method (DEM) with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The DEM was employed to deal with the particle–particle and the particle–wall interaction in the computation of solid flow; while gas flow was computed by CFD based on the commercial software package Fluent. The particles with various Stokes numbers equal to 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 (corresponding to particle diameter 10.8, 24.17, 34.18, 48.38 and 59.21μm, respectively) in the gas–solid fuel-rich/lean jet were investigated in this study. The particle–particle collision was simulated and its effect on the fuel-rich/lean separating performance was evaluated. The results show that the particle–particle collision occurred more frequently with the increasing of Stokes numbers from 0.1 to 3. The particle dispersion became more uniform between the fuel-rich side and the fuel-lean side for particles with small Stokes number; while for particles at St>1, a better fuel-rich/lean separating performance was achieved. The efficiency of the DEM–CFD coupling method was validated by the corresponding experiments, and a good agreement between the simulation and experiments was achieved as a result of the particle–particle collision.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3afluid mechanics 3afuels1 aMo, Guiyuan1 aZhao, Jiapei1 aCen, Kefa0 tFuel.g2011 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.1584-1590dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2010.10.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01484naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245005100169300001800220520054500238592002800783650001900811650001600830650001500846650001500861700002300876700002200899700002300921773011200944856008201056990002301138852000901161655001201170IND60107856320221118065725.0141108e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010785632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2011.02.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeijóo, Andrés10aSimulation of correlated wind speeds: A review  ap. 2826-2832.  aThis paper presents the evolution of techniques for simulating correlated wind speeds, over the last decade.

The possible transformation process of tetragonal BiOI nanosheets to orthorhombic Bi₂S₃ nanorods was investigated to better understand the potential application of this view for constructing novel nanostructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3ananorods 3atemperature1 aFang, Jianzhang1 aXu, Weicheng1 aXu, Xiaoxin1 aWu, Shuxing1 aZhu, Ximiao0 tMaterials letters.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 88 p.82-85dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2012.07.1093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245018900164300001400353520182000367592002802187650002102215650001902236650001702255650002802272650001602300650001702316650003802333650001302371650004302384650002402427650002202451650001302473650002002486650003902506650001402545650001902559650002102578650001502599700001602614700002002630700002402650773010902674856008102783852000902864655001202873IND60101690420221116172349.0141106e20120831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010169042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2012.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiura, Keiji10aAutoantibodies directed against labile epitopes on cell surface proteins in autoimmune disease patients: Proposal of a novel ELISA for the detection of anti-endothelial cell antibodies  ap. 32-39.  aThis article describes a novel method for detecting anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECAs). Sera from patients with systemic vasculitis or inflammatory conditions have been reported to contain antibodies (Abs) that bind to endothelial cells (EC), i.e., AECAs. AECAs are known to play immunogenic effects by triggering EC activation and vascular damage, but the immunopathological role of AECAs is not clear. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting have previously been used for detecting target antigens of AECAs. However, we assumed that these methods are not appropriate for searching genuine target antigens (Ags) on cell surface, and developed a novel solubilized cell surface protein-capture ELISA (CSP-ELISA). Ags were obtained as cell surface proteins from the plasma membrane of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs); these cell surface proteins were biotinylated, solubilized with detergent, and captured on ELISA wells coated with NeutrAvidin™ biotin binding protein (NeuAvi). AECA titers in serum from 126 autoimmune disease patients and 122 healthy donors were tested. AECAs were detected in 28 of 36 (78%) of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients; in 13 of 16 (81%) of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) patients; and in 5 of 9 (56%) of systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients. Relatively weak denaturation of antigens on ELISA wells caused loss of binding of these autoantibodies (autoAbs). Thus, this newly developed CSP-ELISA method enables the detection of Abs to the labile epitopes of autoantigens (autoAgs) such as membrane proteins, and this method is generally applicable to various kinds of membrane proteins and the Abs against them. We propose CSP-ELISA for measuring AECAs in serum samples for routine laboratory testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aautoantibodies 3aautoantigens 3abiotin-binding proteins 3ablood serum 3adenaturation 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepitopes 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3alupus erythematosus 3amembrane proteins 3apatients 3aplasma membrane 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asclerosis 3asolubilization 3asurface proteins 3avasculitis1 aAoun, Keiko1 aYoshida, Shunji1 aKurosawa, Yoshikazu0 tJournal of immunological methods.g2012 Aug. 31, v. 382, no. 1-2 p.32-39dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2012.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013500170300001800305520130900323592002801632650001401660650001501674650001001689650002001699650001101719650001101730650002601741650001301767650002801780650001401808650002401822650001901846650001201865651001201877700001401889773008901903856008401992852000902076655001202085IND60111477820221119191955.0141109e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011147782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2011.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLebersorger, S.10aMunicipal solid waste generation in municipalities: Quantifying impacts of household structure, commercial waste and domestic fuel  ap. 1907-1915.  aWaste management planning requires reliable data concerning waste generation, influencing factors on waste generation and forecasts of waste quantities based on facts. This paper aims at identifying and quantifying differences between different municipalities’ municipal solid waste (MSW) collection quantities based on data from waste management and on socio-economic indicators. A large set of 116 indicators from 542 municipalities in the Province of Styria was investigated. The resulting regression model included municipal tax revenue per capita, household size and the percentage of buildings with solid fuel heating systems. The model explains 74.3% of the MSW variation and the model assumptions are met. Other factors such as tourism, home composting or age distribution of the population did not significantly improve the model. According to the model, 21% of MSW collected in Styria was commercial waste and 18% of the generated MSW was burned in domestic heating systems. While the percentage of commercial waste is consistent with literature data, practically no literature data are available for the quantity of MSW burned, which seems to be overestimated by the model. The resulting regression model was used as basis for a waste prognosis model (Beigl and Lebersorger, in preparation).  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acomposting 3afuels 3aheating systems 3aincome 3amodels 3amunicipal solid waste 3aplanning 3apopulation distribution 3aprognosis 3aregression analysis 3asocioeconomics 3atourism 3aAustria1 aBeigl, P.0 tWaste management.g2011 , v. 31, no. 9-10 p.1907-1915dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2011.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01410naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006400170300001600234520026700250592002800517650002300545650002000568650002200588653001700610653005100627653003000678653001700708653009700725700002000822700001600842700002200858773008700880856008400967852000901051655001201060IND60110056420221118124609.0161019e20130220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011005642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.11.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandra Rao, D.10aConcise and protecting group-free synthesis of botryolide-E  ap. 828-829.  aA simple highly concise protective group-free synthesis of botryolide-E from (R)-propylene oxide was developed using Hoveyda Grubbs cross metathesis, Still’s modified Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction, and Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, as key steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3adihydroxylation 3aorganic compounds 0aBotryolide-E 0aBotryotrichum sp.

Removal of extracellular Ca²⁺ by removal of Ca²⁺ from the bathing medium reduced histamine (1mM) induced responses by 34% and responses induced by electrical field stimulation by 94%. Similarly, blockade of L-type Ca²⁺ channels by nifedipine (1μM) reduced histamine (1mM) induced responses by 43% and responses induced by electrical field stimulation by 77%. Application of cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) (10μM) to inhibit Ca²⁺ reuptake to the sarcoplasmic reticulum enhanced both histamine-induced and electrical field stimulation induced responses to a small degree, while the addition of the inosotol triphosphate (IP₃) receptor antagonist, 2-aminophenoxyethane borane (2-APB) (100μM) inhibited histamine induced responses by 70% and electrical field stimulation induced responses by 57%. Ryanodine (1μM) did not affect contractile responses to either histamine or electrical field stimulation, either in the absence or presence of 2-APB (100μM). During both histamine and electrical field stimulation induced contractions, prostate smooth muscle generates IP₃ receptor mediated Ca²⁺ release in conjunction with Ca²⁺ entry from the extracellular environment. Ryanodine receptors on the other hand, appear not to play a role in this physiological mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3acalcium 3acyclopiazonic acid 3aelectric field 3aguinea pigs 3ahistamine 3amyo-inositol 3aryanodine receptors 3asarcoplasmic reticulum 3asmooth muscle1 aKerr, Karen1 aVentura, Sabatino1 aExintaris, Betty0 tPharmacological research.g2011 Sept., v. 64, no. 3 p.235-241dElsevier Ltdx1043-66187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2011.04.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009300165300001600258520155200274592002801826650001601854650001301870650002201883650002501905650001201930650001801942650003301960650002301993650001302016650003802029650002002067650002002087650002502107700001802132700001502150700001602165700001702181700001702198700001802215773011702233856008202350852000902432655001202441IND60100770620221118080040.0141105e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010077062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Ruizhi10aIn situ preparation of Al-containing PVDF ultrafiltration membrane via sol–gel process  ap. 373-378.  aRecently, inorganic nanoparticles blended within polymeric membranes have shown improved antifouling performance in wastewater treatment. However, agglomeration of nanoparticles remains as one of the major obstacles for generating a uniform surface. In this study, a new method for in situ preparation of Al-containing PVDF ultrafiltration membranes to improve the dispersion of nanoparticles is reported. The strategy of this method is to combine sol–gel process with traditional immersion precipitation process. Al sol was synthesized by the addition of anionic exchange resin in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent containing aluminum chloride. Homogeneous Al-containing PVDF casting solution was then obtained by dissolving PVDF polymer in the Al sol. The membrane formation mechanism was investigated by precipitation kinetics and morphology. Results indicate that the addition of Al species can accelerate phase inversion of casting solution. Scanning electron microscopic images show that a typical transition from sponge-like structure to finger-like structure occurred with increasing Al species content. The existence and dispersion states of Al species in the resultant membrane matrix were further examined by transmission electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The results indicate the Al species nanoparticles were well dispersed throughout PVDF matrix. Dynamic BSA fouling resistance experiments demonstrate the Al-containing PVDF membranes possess improved separation performances over the pure PVDF membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aaluminum 3aaluminum chloride 3aartificial membranes 3afouling 3ananoparticles 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asol-gel processing 3asolvents 3atransmission electron microscopes 3aultrafiltration 3avinyl compounds 3awastewater treatment1 aLi, Jiansheng1 aWei, Kajia1 aSun, Xiuyun1 aShen, Jinyou1 aHan, Weiqing1 aWang, Lianjun0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 364, no. 2 p.373-378dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02112naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003400135040001800169100002400187245005900211300001400270520073700284592002801021650001001049650001301059650001701072650001601089650001301105650001401118650001501132650003201147650001201179650002301191650002601214650005201240650001101292650002901303650002401332650003601356700002301392700002501415773009001440856008001530990002301610852000901633655001201642IND60110772920221119183604.0141109e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011077292DNAL7 a212330162pmid7 aPMC30427302pmcid7 a10.1016/j.it.2010.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaldridge, Megan T.10aInflammatory signals regulate hematopoietic stem cells  ap. 57-65.  aHematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the progenitors of all blood and immune cells, yet their role in immunity is not well understood. Most studies have focused on the ability of committed lymphoid and myeloid precursors to replenish immune cells during infection. Recent studies, however, have indicated that HSCs also proliferate in response to systemic infection and replenish effector immune cells. Inflammatory signaling molecules including interferons, tumor necrosis factor-α and Toll-like receptors are essential to the HSC response. Observing the biology of HSCs through the lens of infection and inflammation has led to the discovery of an array of immune-mediators that serve crucial roles in HSC regulation and function.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3aimmunity 3ainflammation 3ainterferons 3anecrosis 3areceptors 3astem cells 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 2aAnimals 2aCell Proliferation 2aCytokinesximmunology 2aHematopoietic Stem Cellsxcytologyximmunology. 2aHumans 2aInflammationximmunology 2aSignal Transduction 2aToll-Like Receptorsximmunology1 aKing, Katherine Y.1 aGoodell, Margaret A.0 tTrends in immunology.g2011 Feb., v. 32, no. 2 p.57-65dElsevier Ltdx1471-49067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2010.12.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006600168300001400234520129200248592002801540650000801568650002301576650002101599650001401620650001201634650002301646650002001669650001001689650001301699650001101712650001101723650001601734650002601750650002901776700002901805773011701834856008101951852000902032655001202041IND60104598120221119153649.0141107e20120102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010459812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2011.09.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStratmann, Antje10aHistone demethylation and steroid receptor function in cancer  ap. 12-20.  aSteroid receptors recruit various cofactors to form multi-protein complexes which locally alter chromatin structure and control DNA accessibility in order to regulate gene transcription. Some of these factors are enzymes that add or remove histone marks in the vicinity of regulatory regions of target genes. Numerous histone modifications added by specific writer enzymes and removed by eraser enzymes have been identified. Histone methylation is a modification with a complex outcome, as it can lead to gene activation or repression, depending on the modified residue and the context. Methylation marks are added by different enzyme families displaying exquisite substrate specificity. Lysine methylation is reversible and two different demethylase families have been identified in humans, the Jumonji C and the lysine-specific demethylase families. A regulatory role of histone demethylases in fine-tuning the function of steroid receptors, especially the androgen receptor and estrogen receptor, has emerged in recent years. This is mostly inferred from invitro studies, but more recently first invivo data have further supported this concept. This and the deregulated expression observed for several histone demethylases suggest a role in tumours such as prostate and breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aandrogen receptors 3abreast neoplasms 3achromatin 3aenzymes 3aestrogen receptors 3agene activation 3agenes 3ahistones 3ahumans 3alysine 3amethylation 3asubstrate specificity 3atranscription (genetics)1 aHaendler, B.q(Bernard),0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2012 Jan. 2, v. 348, no. 1 p.12-20dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2011.09.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245016200160300001600322520163500338592002801973650002202001650001502023650001602038650001302054650001002067650001502077650003102092650001002123650001202133650002002145650000902165650001102174650002402185650001602209650001502225650001802240650001902258650001702277650002002294650003702314700001802351700001102369700001802380700001302398700002102411700001802432773008802450856008102538990002302619852000902642655001202651IND60108664120221119072221.0141108e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010866412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.07.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhun, K.10aPotentiometric glucose sensor based on the glucose oxidase immobilized iron ferrite magnetic particle/chitosan composite modified gold coated glass electrode  ap. 698-703.  aA potentiometric glucose sensor based on the glucose oxidase immobilized on iron ferrite (Fe₃O₄) nanoparticles/chitosan composite modified gold coated glass substrate was fabricated. The electrode has advantages of both the inorganic Fe₃O₄ magnetic nanoparticles and the organic substance chitosan. The freshly prepared iron ferrite magnetic nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique was used for the analysis of dispersed iron ferrite magnetic nanoparticles in the mixture of glucose oxidase and chitosan. The electrostatic interaction of Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles with chitosan and the glucose oxidase molecules was investigated by the infra-red reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) study. The glucose oxidase enzyme was immobilized on the surface of iron ferrite/chitosan composite without the use of Nafion or cross linker molecules. The fabricated glucose sensor has shown acceptable potentiometric response for the wide range of glucose concentrations from 1.0×10⁻⁶ to 3.0×10⁻²M. The sensor electrode showed a sensitivity of 27.3±0.8mV/decade and also fast response time of 7.0s. Moreover, the present glucose sensor has demonstrated good reproducibility, repeatability, selectivity and the storage stability. All the obtained results indicated that the glucose sensor based on the glucose oxidase immobilized iron ferrite/chitosan composite modified gold coated glass electrode can be used for the monitoring of glucose concentrations in human serum, drugs and may be applicable to detect glucose in the presence of other analytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3ablood serum 3achitosan 3adrugs 3aelectrodes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aglass 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3agold 3ahumans 3aimmobilized enzymes 3airon oxides 3amonitoring 3ananoparticles 3aorganic matter 3aspectroscopy 3astorage quality 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aIbupoto, Z.H.1 aLu, J.1 aAlSalhi, M.S.1 aAtif, M.1 aAnsari, Anees A.1 aWillander, M.0 tSensors and actuators.g2012 Oct., v. 173 p.698-703dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.07.0743Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03476naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010500167300001400272520182000286592002802106650002002134650002002154650000802174650001502182650001402197650001502211650001502226650002002241650002002261650001002281650001902291650002602310650001202336650001102348650001902359650002102378650001502399650000902414650001902423650001502442700001802457700001902475700001902494700001902513700002202532700001902554700002402573700001502597700001802612700002002630700001602650700002402666773009402690856008102784852000902865655001202874IND60110377220221117044856.0141109e20120716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011037722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2012.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinowa, Yohsuke10aToxicogenomic multigene biomarker for predicting the future onset of proximal tubular injury in rats  ap. 47-56.  aDrug-induced renal tubular injury is a major concern in the preclinical safety evaluation of drug candidates. Toxicogenomics is now a generally accepted tool for identifying chemicals with potential safety problems. The specific aim of the present study was to develop a model for use in predicting the future onset of drug-induced proximal tubular injury following repeated dosing with various nephrotoxicants. In total, 41 nephrotoxic and nonnephrotoxic compounds were used for the present analysis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed orally or intravenously once daily. Animals were exposed to three different doses (low, middle, and high) of each compound, and kidney tissue was collected at 3, 6, 9, and 24h after single dosing, and on days 4, 8, 15, and 29 after repeated dosing. Gene expression profiles were generated from kidney total RNA using Affymetrix DNA microarrays. Filter-type gene selection and linear classification algorithms were employed to discriminate future onset of proximal tubular injury. We identified genomic biomarkers for use in future onset prediction using the gene expression profiles determined on day 1, when most of the nephrotoxicants had yet to produce detectable histopathological changes. The model was evaluated using a five-fold cross validation, and achieved a sensitivity of 93% and selectivity of 90% with 19 probes. We also found that the prediction accuracy of the optimized model was substantially higher than that produced by any of the single genomic biomarkers or histopathology. The genes included in our model were primarily involved in DNA replication, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and responses to oxidative stress and chemical stimuli. In summary, our toxicogenomic model is particularly useful for predicting the future onset of proximal tubular injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA microarrays 3aDNA replication 3aRNA 3aalgorithms 3aapoptosis 3abiomarkers 3acell cycle 3adrug evaluation 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahistopathology 3aintravenous injection 3akidneys 3amodels 3anephrotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3aprediction 3arats 3atoxicogenomics 3atoxicology1 aKondo, Chiaki1 aUehara, Takeki1 aMorikawa, Yuji1 aOkuno, Yasushi1 aNakatsu, Noriyuki1 aŌno, Atsushi,1 aMaruyama, Toshiyuki1 aKato, Ikuo1 aYamate, Jyoji1 aYamada, Hiroshi1 aOhno, Yasuo1 aUrushidani, Tetsuro0 tToxicology.g2012 July 16, v. 297, no. 1-3 p.47-56dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0300-483X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2012.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002100192245016700213300001800380506007600398520149100474592002801965506003701993650002902030650001802059650001102077650001302088650001902101650001102120650001402131650002002145650001602165650001302181653000702194653000802201653000902209653000802218653000802226653000802234653000802242653001902250653002902269653001902298653001102317653000902328653001702337700002302354700001902377700002202396700002502418700002202443700002602465773010002491856008602591852000902677655001202686IND60111313620221207123957.0190319e20130923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011131362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.07.0302doi7 aPMC38103152pmcid7 a239118522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeggat, David J.10aPneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination induces polysaccharide-specific B cells in adult peripheral blood expressing CD19+CD20+CD3−CD70−CD27+IgM+CD43+CD5+/−  ap. 4632-4640.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines have been used to elicit a protective anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide antibody response against Streptococcus pneumoniae in healthy individuals. Identifying human B cells which respond to T-cell independent type-2 antigens, such as pneumococcal polysaccharides, has been challenging. We employed pneumococcal polysaccharides directly conjugated to fluorophores in conjunction with flow cytometry to identify the phenotype of B cells that respond to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination. We have previously identified that the majority of pneumococcal polysaccharide-selected cells responding to vaccination are CD27+IgM+ (IgM+ memory) cells. In this study, we further characterized pneumococcal polysaccharide-selected cells in the peripheral blood to better identify how the various B cell phenotypes responded 7 and 30 days post-immunization. We show that 7 days post-immunization the majority of pneumococcal polysaccharide-selected IgM+ memory cells (PPS14+ 56.5%, PPS23F+ 63.8%) were CD19+CD20+CD27+IgM+CD43+CD5+/−CD70−, which was significantly increased compared to pre-immunization levels. This phenotype is in alignment with recent publications describing human B-1 cells. PPS-responsive B cells receded to pre-immunization levels by day-30. These findings suggest that this B-1 like cell population plays an important role in early responses to S. pneumoniae infection and possibly other T-cell independent type-2 antigens in humans  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadults 3aantigens 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3aphenotype 3apolysaccharides 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aAb 0aPPS 0aTI-2 0aMZB 0aPPV 0aOPT 0aFMO 0aFlow cytometry 0aStreptococcus pneumoniae 0aPolysaccharide 0aB cell 0aCD43 0apneumococcus1 aKhaskhely, Noor M.1 aIyer, Anita S.1 aMosakowski, Jason1 aThompson, Rebecca S.1 aWeinandy, John D.1 aWesterink, M.A. Julie0 tVaccine.g2013 Sept. 23, v. 31, no. 41 p.4632-4640dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.07.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245007600184300001600260520128800276592002801564650002001592650001001612650001201622650001501634650000901649650001001658650000901668650002401677650001201701650001001713650001001723650001201733650002701745650000901772650002701781650001101808650002301819650001101842650002401853650002201877650003001899651001001929700002301939700002001962700001901982700002102001700002102022700002002043773010902063856004802172852000902220655001202229IND4486919220221118054051.0121003e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448691922DNAL7 a204223122pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-010-8661-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkeda, Masayuki10aEstimation of Dietary Pb and Cd Intake from Pb and Cd in Blood or Urine  ap. 269-286.  aSuccessful trials were made to estimate the dietary daily intake of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) via foods from the levels of the metals in blood or urine. In practice, 14 and 15 reports were available for Pb and Cd in blood (Pb-B and Cd-B), urine (Pb-U and Cd-U) and 24-h diet duplicates (Pb-D and Cd-D), respectively, from which 68 pairs each of Pb or Cd in blood and food duplicates [each being geometric mean (GM) values for the survey sites] were obtained. Regression analysis revealed that there was a significant correlation between Pb-B and Pb-D, and also between Cd-B and Cd-D, suggesting that it should be possible to estimate both Pb-D and Cd-D from Pb-B and Cd-B, respectively. For Cd-U, the number of available cases was limited (20 pairs), but a significant correlation was detected between Cd-U (as Cd-Ucr, or Cd levels in urine as corrected for creatinine concentration) and Cd-D. Care should be taken in estimating Pb-D from Pb-B, as the ratio of Pb-D over Pb-B may decrease as a function of increasing Pb-B levels. The Pb-D (μg/day) for typical Japanese women with Pb-B of 15 μg/l was best estimated to be 13.5 μg/day. No Cd-B- or Cd-Ucr-dependent change was detected in case of Cd. The best estimate of Cd-D for Cd-B at 1.5 μg/l should be about 19.4 μg/day.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapanese people 3ablood 3acadmium 3acreatinine 3adiet 3afoods 3alead 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3aurine 3awomen 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxbloodxurine. 2aDiet 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aFemale 2aFood Contamination 2aHumans 2aLeadxbloodxurine. 2aMass Spectrometry 2aSpectrophotometry, Atomic 0aJapan1 aShimbo, Shinichiro1 aWatanabe, Takao1 aOhashi, Fumiko1 aFukui, Yoshinari1 aSakuragi, Sonoko1 aMoriguchi, Jiro0 tBiological trace element research.g2011 Mar., v. 139, no. 3 p.269-286dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-010-8661-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002900192245013800221300001800359500001500377520154700392592002801939650001901967650001901986650001402005650001402019650001602033650002402049650001302073653001302086700002302099700002202122773008602144856008502230990002302315852000902338655001202347IND60105732320221120052031.0141108e20120928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010573232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2012.08.0102doi7 aPMC34811682pmcid7 a231097332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzczepanski, Caroline R.12aA new approach to network heterogeneity: Polymerization induced phase separation in photo-initiated, free-radical methacrylic systems  ap. 4694-4701.  a2019-12-04  aNon-reactive, thermoplastic prepolymers (poly- methyl, ethyl and butyl methacrylate) were added to a model homopolymer matrix composed of triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) to form heterogeneous networks via polymerization induced phase separation (PIPS). PIPS creates networks with distinct phase structure that can partially compensate for volumetric shrinkage during polymerization through localized internal volume expansion. This investigation utilizes purely photo-initiated, free-radical systems, broadening the scope of applications for PIPS since these processing conditions have not been studied previously. The introduction of prepolymer into TEGDMA monomer resulted in stable, homogeneous monomer formulations, most of which underwent PIPS upon photo-irradiation, creating heterogeneous networks. During polymerization the presence of prepolymer enhanced autoacceleration, allowing for a more extensive ambient cure of the material. Phase separation, as characterized by dynamic changes in sample turbidity, was monitored simultaneously with monomer conversion and either preceded or was coincident with network gelation. Dynamic mechanical analysis shows a broadening of the tan delta peak and secondary peak formation, characteristic of phase-separated materials, indicating one phase rich in prepolymer and another depleted form upon phase separation. In certain cases, PIPS leads to an enhanced physical reduction of volumetric shrinkage, which is attractive for many applications including dental composite materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3apolymerization 3athermoplastics 3aturbidity 3ashrinkage 3airradiation 3acomposite materials 3agelation 0apolymers1 aPfeifer, Carmem S.1 aStansbury, J.

Further, like the Ferrier carbocyclisation, it is not sensitive to the stereochemistry of sugar molecules used as precursors: six different gabosine-type molecules have been prepared by this route starting from d-Glucose, d-Mannose, and d-Galactose derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3agalactose 3aglucose 3amannose 3aorganic compounds 3astereochemistry1 aSamineni, Ramesh1 aSattar, Abdul1 aChandrasekhar, Srivari1 aYadav, Jhillu Singh1 aGrée, René0 tTetrahedron.g2011 Dec. 2, v. 67, no. 48 p.9305-9310dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2011.09.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245022300165300001600388520163300404592002802037650001702065650002402082650002302106650001802129650001502147650004302162650001602205650001302221650000702234650002102241650002002262650001502282650001502297650001102312650001202323650001602335700001602351700001402367700001402381700001402395700001202409773011502421856008202536990002302618852000902641655001202650IND60102969720221120164043.0141106e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010296972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jpba.2012.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Pengfei10aRapid determination of thiamine, riboflavin, niacinamide, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, folic acid and ascorbic acid in Vitamins with Minerals Tablets by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector  ap. 151-157.  aA simple, isocratic, and stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has been developed for the rapid determination of thiamine (VB₁), niacinamide (VB₃), pyridoxine (VB₆), ascorbic acid (VC), pantothenic acid (VB₅), riboflavin (VB₂) and folic acid (VB₉) in Vitamins with Minerals Tablets (VMT). An Alltima C₁₈ column (250mm×4.6mm i.d., 5μm) was used for the separation at ambient temperature, with 50mM ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (adjusting with phosphoric acid to pH 3.0) and acetonitrile as the mobile phase at the flow rate of 0.5mlmin⁻¹. VB₁, VB₃, VB₆, VC and VB₅ were extracted with a solution containing 0.05% phosphoric acid (v/v) and 0.3% sodium thiosulfate (w/v), and were then simultaneously analyzed by using the mobile phase of phosphate buffer–acetonitrile (95:5, v/v), while VB₂ and VB₉ were extracted with a solution containing 0.5% ammonium hydroxide solution (v/v), and were then simultaneously analyzed by using the mobile phase of phosphate buffer–acetonitrile (85:15, v/v). The detection wavelengths were 275nm for VB₁, VB₃, VB₆, VC, 210nm for VB₅, and 282nm for VB₂ and VB₉. The method showed good system suitability, sensitivity, linearity, specificity, precision, stability and accuracy. All the seven water-soluble vitamins were well separated from other ingredients and degradation products. Method comparison indicated good concordance between the developed method and the USP method. The developed method was reliable and convenient for the rapid determination of VB₁, VB₃, VB₆, VC, VB₅, VB₂ and VB₉ in VMT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aambient temperature 3aammonium hydroxide 3aascorbic acid 3afolic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aingredients 3aminerals 3apH 3apantothenic acid 3aphosphoric acid 3apyridoxine 3ariboflavin 3asodium 3athiamin 3awavelengths1 aXia, Lufeng1 aLi, Zheng1 aChe, Ning1 aZou, Ding1 aHu, Xin0 tJournal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis.g2012 Nov., v. 70 p.151-157dElsevier B.V.x0731-70857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2012.06.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012900168300001600297520143300313592002801746650004401774650001101818650001301829650001901842650002101861650001201882650003101894650000701925650002501932650001301957650001901970650002201989700001802011700002102029700002002050700001802070773011702088856008202205852000902287655001202296IND60100770720221118080055.0141105e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010077072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.05.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmar-Yuli, Idit14aThe role of glycerol and phosphatidylcholine in solubilizing and enhancing insulin stability in reverse hexagonal mesophases  ap. 379-387.  aThe potential of reverse hexagonal mesophases based on monoolein (GMO) and glycerol (as cosolvent) to facilitate the solubilization of proteins, such as insulin was explored. HII mesophases composed of GMO/decane/water were compared to GMO/decane/glycerol/water and GMO/phosphatidylcholine (PC)/decane/glycerol/water systems. The stability of insulin was tested, applying external physical modifications such as low pH and heat treatment (up to 70°C), in which insulin is known to form ordered amyloid-like aggregates (that are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases) with a characteristic cross β-pleated sheet structure. The impact of insulin confinement within these carriers on its stability, unfolding, and aggregation pathways was studied by combining SAXS, FTIR, and AFM techniques. These techniques provided a better insight into the molecular level of the “component interplay” in solubilizing and stabilizing insulin and its conformational modifications that dictate its final aggregate morphology. PC enlarged the water channels while glycerol shrank them, yet both facilitated insulin solubilization within the channels. The presence of glycerol within the mesophase water channels led to the formation of stronger hydrogen bonds with the hosting medium that enhanced the thermal stability of the protein and remarkably affected the unfolding process even after heat treatment (at 70°C for 60min).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3adecane 3aglycerol 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen bonding 3ainsulin 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3apH 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aproteins 3asolubilization 3athermal stability1 aAzulay, Doron1 aMishraki, Tehila1 aAserin, Abraham1 aGarti, Nissim0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 364, no. 2 p.379-387dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.05.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01185naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245010600163300001800269520018700287592002800474650002300502650002300525650002300548650002200571700001700593700001800610700001500628700001300643700001400656773009600670856008400766852000900850655001200859IND60109901020221121045753.0141109e20120307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010990102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.12.1312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jin10aDirect oxidative conversion of 3-aryl propionaldehydes to 3-aryl acroleins promoted by SOMO catalysis  ap. 1207-1209.  aA new direct oxidative transformation of 3-aryl propionaldehydes to 3-aryl acroleins promoted by SOMO catalysis has been realized with high efficiency under mild reaction conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aorganic compounds1 aYu, Shunting1 aLü, Wenchao,1 aDeng, Jing1 aLi, Jian1 aWang, Wei0 tTetrahedron letters.g2012 Mar. 7, v. 53, no. 10 p.1207-1209dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.12.1313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01714naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245014300175300001800318520063300336592002800969650001400997650001401011650002301025650002301048650001801071650001401089700001901103700002501122700002001147700002801167773009101195856008101286852000901367655001201376IND60109510620221120151816.0141109e20120708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010951062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.04.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajesh, Stephen Michael10aFacile ionic liquid-mediated, three-component sequential reactions for the green, regio- and diastereoselective synthesis of furocoumarins  ap. 5631-5636.  aAn environmentally friendly approach to the diastereoselective synthesis of trans-4-oxo-3-aryl-3,4-dihydro-2H-furo[3,2-c]coumarin-2-carbonitriles, trans-2-benzoyl-3-(aryl)-2H-furo[3,2-c]chromen-4(3H)-ones and trans-ethyl-4-oxo-3-(aryl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-furo[3,2-c]chromene-2-carboxylates in good yields is described.

Prior to the cellular studies a full particle size characterisation was carried out using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Transmission Electron Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy in distilled water and cell culture media. The Zeta Potential (ZP) associated with the Ag nanoparticle was also determined in order to assess its stability in the solutions and its possible interaction with the media. The DLS and ZP study have suggested interaction of Ag nanoparticles with the media, which can lead to secondary toxicity. The toxic effects of Ag nanoparticles were then evaluated using different cytotoxic endpoints namely the lysosomal activity, mitochondrial metabolism, basic cellular metabolism, cellular protein content and cellular proliferative capacity. The cytotoxic effect of Ag nanoparticle was dependant on dose, exposure time and on the cell line tested. Further investigation was carried out on HeLa and HaCaT cell lines to elucidate the mechanism of its cytotoxicity. The Ag nanoparticle was noted to induce elevated levels of oxidative stress, glutathione depletion and damage to the cell membrane as found from the adenylate kinase assay and that leads to the apoptosis. Overall, significant differences were observed between the sensitivity of the two cell lines which can be understood in terms of their natural antioxidant levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenylate kinase 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3acell culture 3acell membranes 3aculture media 3acytotoxicity 3aexposure duration 3aglutathione 3ahumans 3alight scattering 3ametabolism 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aoxidative stress 3aparticle size 3aprotein content 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3atransmission electron microscopy 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3azeta potential1 aO’Claonadh, Niall1 aCasey, Alan1 aChambers, Gordon0 tToxicology in vitro.g2012 Mar., v. 26, no. 2 p.238-251dElsevier Ltdx0887-23337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2011.12.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01520naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007100164300001400235520066700249592002800916650001100944650002000955650001900975700001700994700001801011700001601029773009501045856008101140852000901221655001201230IND60110220720221122083601.0141109e20110610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011022072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2011.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jinming10aThermodynamic optimization of the Ge–Sb and Ge–Sb–Sn systems  ap. 38-47.  aThe thermodynamic modeling and optimization of the Ge–Sb and Ge–Sb–Sn systems were critically carried out by means of the CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagram) technique.

Because these effects could not solely be attributed to the previously identified pollen-associated lipid mediators, the pollen metabolome was analyzed for candidate immunomodulatory substances. OBJECTIVE: We sought to perform an analysis of the effect of pollen-associated adenosine on DC function and TH cell differentiation. METHODS: Fractions of aqueous pollen extracts (APEs) were generated by means of ultrafiltration and were subjected simultaneously to biological tests and metabolome analysis (ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry) and ultraperformance liquid chromatography. Effects of pollen-derived adenosine on monocyte-derived DC cAMP signaling, cytokine response, and capacity to differentiate TH cells were studied. RESULTS: The less than 3-kd fraction of APEs comprised thousands of substances, including adenosine in micromolar concentrations. Pollen-derived adenosine mediated A₂ receptor–dependent induction of cAMP and inhibition of IL-12p70 in DCs. APEs digested with adenosine deaminase failed to mediate IL-12 inhibition. DCs of nonatopic donors exposed to APEs showed an adenosine-dependent reduced capacity to differentiate TH1 cells and an enhanced capacity to induce regulatory T cells and IL-10. DCs of atopic donors failed to induce IL-10 but instead induced IL-5 and IL-13. CONCLUSION: This study identifies adenosine out of thousands of metabolites as a potent immunoregulatory substance in pollen. It acts on the level of the DC, with differential effects in atopic and nonatopic donors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadenosine 3aadenosine deaminase 3aadenosine monophosphate 3acell differentiation 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-13 3ainterleukin-5 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3apollen 3asecretion 3aultrafiltration1 aFekete, Ágnes,1 aZhang, Xin1 aBeck, Isabelle1 aBlume, Cornelia1 aRing, Johannes1 aSchmidt-Weber, Carsten1 aBehrendt, Heidrun1 aSchmitt-Kopplin, Philippe1 aTraidl-Hoffmann, Claudia0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2011 Feb., v. 127, no. 2 p.454-461.e9dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2010.12.10823Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015000167300001800317520108300335592002801418650002401446650001501470650001501485650002301500650001001523650001301533650001201546650004401558650000701602650001901609650002101628700002201649700001901671700001701690700002101707700002101728700002001749773008801769856008101857852000901938655001201947IND60109437420221119032309.0141109e20111202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010943742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.09.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerter, Susanne10aC–N coupling of 3-methylcatechol with primary amines using native and recombinant laccases from Trametes versicolor and Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  ap. 9311-9321.  aFive laccase genes from Pycnoporus cinnabarinus and Trametes versicolor encoding for different isoenzymes have been cloned, recombinantly expressed and characterized. Following C–N coupling of primary linear, branched-chained and cyclic amines to 3-methylcatechol was mediated by native and recombinant laccases yielding the corresponding secondary amines. Formation of C5-monoaminated ortho-methylquinones occurred within 1–2h; prolonged incubation led to the formation of high-molecular mass products. No difference between the use of native or recombinant isoenzymes from P. cinnabarinus or T. versicolor was observed. Optimization of the reaction conditions included variation of amine donor ratios, pH, amount and type of enzyme preparations. The formation of by-products could be suppressed at pH values corresponding to the enzymes optima (pH 4–5). A total of 10 secondary amines were synthesized with product formations of up to 80%. Furthermore, all purified secondary amines were characterized by NMR-, LC–MS- and HRMS-analysis and logP values were determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aPycnoporus 3abyproducts 3achemical reactions 3agenes 3aisozymes 3alaccase 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3aprimary amines 3asecondary amines1 aMikolasch, Annett1 aMichalik, Dirk1 aHammer, Elke1 aSchauer, Frieder1 aBornscheuer, Uwe1 aSchmidt, Marlen0 tTetrahedron.g2011 Dec. 2, v. 67, no. 48 p.9311-9321dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2011.09.1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009400165300001600259520137300275592002801648650002201676650001401698650001101712650001701723650001401740650001201754650001201766650001801778650001501796650002101811650004401832650001301876650003101889650001001920650001601930650001101946700001501957700001501972700001601987700001702003773011702020856008202137852000902219655001202228IND60100770820221118075820.0141105e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010077082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.08.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yujuan10aAggregation behavior of a model ionic liquid surfactant in monosaccharide+water solutions  ap. 388-394.  aAlkylimidazolium salts are a very important class of ionic liquids (ILs). The ILs containing long alkyl chains are a kind of model surfactants. In this paper, the aggregation behavior of 1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C₁₀mim]Cl) was investigated for the first time in aqueous monosaccharide (glucose, galactose, xylose and arabinose) solutions by conductivity, fluorescence, NMR and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Thus a series of physico-chemical parameters for the aggregation of [C₁₀mim]Cl—the critical aggregation concentration (CAC), ionization degree of the aggregates (α), the standard Gibbs energy of aggregation (ΔGₘ ⁰), and the aggregation number (N) were derived from the experimental data. The results show that addition of small amounts of monosaccharides in aqueous solution can cause a variation in aggregation properties of the IL. The CAC values decrease with increasing molality of monosaccharides. In particular for different kinds of monosaccharides, we found that the CAC values are in the order: glucose>galactose (hexoses), xylose>arabinose (pentoses); xylose>glucose (1e2e3e4e), arabinose>galactoses (1e2e3e4a). These trends may be attributed to the slight difference in the stereo-structure of monosaccharide molecules. Finally a mechanism for the interaction of these monosaccharides with [C₁₀mim]Cl was proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aarabinose 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3agalactose 3aglucose 3ahexoses 3aionic liquids 3aionization 3alight scattering 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apentoses 3aphysicochemical properties 3asalts 3asurfactants 3axylose1 aZhao, Yang1 aChen, Jing1 aZhuo, Kelei1 aWang, Jianji0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 364, no. 2 p.388-394dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.08.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245007200175300001400247520110900261592002801370650002101398650001401419650001801433650001901451650002201470650002001492650001901512653001701531653001701548653001701565653002001582653002101602653002601623773010901649856008801758852000901846655001201855IND60111629920221119235658.0190319e20130724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011162992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakanoue, Seiichi10aIntegration of logistic and kinetics equations of population growth  ap. 93-97.  aThe procedure proposed by Sakanoue [Sakanoue, S., 2007. Extended logistic model for growth of single-species populations. Ecological Modelling 205, 159–168] is used to derive the kinetics equations of population growth. It is based on three assumptions: resource availability changes with population size; resource supply to population and population demand for resources are defined as functions of resource availability and population size; and resource availability and population size shift in the supply function attracted to the demand function. These assumptions are organized into an abstract equation, which can be transformed into the Verhulst logistic equation under certain supply and demand functions. On the other hand, by setting “per capita resource availability” as an independent variable, the abstract equation can also be transformed into some existing kinetics equations and new kinetics ones involving intraspecific interactions such as facilitation and interference. The procedure provides a unified means of deriving and relating the two types of population growth equation.  aPublisher supplied data 3ademand functions 3aequations 3agrowth models 3alogit analysis 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3asupply balance 0aExploitation 0aFacilitation 0aInterference 0aPopulation size 0aRatio-dependence 0aResource availability0 tEcological modelling.g2013 July 24, v. 261-262 p.93-97dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245009500175300001600270520117000286592002801456650002201484650001701506650001201523650001001535650002101545650000701566650001401573650002101587650001001608700002001618700001801638700002101656700001801677700002301695700002401718700002301742773009101765856008101856990002301937852000901960655001201969IND60110534520221118034147.0141109e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011053452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tiv.2011.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgencementc(Musician),10aPossible mechanism of superoxide formation through redox cycling of plumbagin in pig heart  ap. 252-257.  aThe purpose of this study is to elucidate the possible mechanism of superoxide formation through redox cycling of plumbagin (PLG) in pig heart. Of four 1,4-naphthoquinones tested in this study, PLG was most efficiently reduced in the cytosolic fraction of pig heart. On the other hand, lawsone (LAS) was little reduced. Thus, whether or not PLG and LAS induce the formation of superoxide anion radical in pig heart cytosol was examined, by using the methods of cytochrome c reduction and chemiluminescence. PLG significantly induced the formation of superoxide anion radical, even though LAS had no ability to mediate superoxide formation. PLG was a significant inhibitor for the stereoselective reduction of 4-benzoylpyridine (4-BP) catalyzed by tetrameric carbonyl reductase (TCBR) in pig heart cytosol. Furthermore, PLG was confirmed to competitively inhibit the 4-BP reduction, and the optimal pH for the PLG reduction was around 6.0 similar to that for the 4-BP reduction. These results suggest that PLG mediates superoxide formation through its redox cycling involved in the two-electron reduction catalyzed by TCBR, and induces oxidative stress in pig heart.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemiluminescence 3acytochrome c 3acytosol 3aheart 3aoxidative stress 3apH 3aplumbagin 3asuperoxide anion 3aswine1 aYamaoka, Yusuke1 aMorita, Reiko1 aMizuno, Takayuki1 aGotoh, Kousei1 aHiguchi, Toshiyuki1 aShiraishi, Takayuki1 aImamura, Yorishige0 tToxicology in vitro.g2012 Mar., v. 26, no. 2 p.252-257dElsevier Ltdx0887-23337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2011.12.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009700169300001800266520192600284592002802210650001202238650001502250650000902265650002602274650002702300650002602327650001202353650001702365650000802382650002202390650001202412650001102424650001702435650001802452650000902470650001702479650001902496650001802515700002102533773007802554856008202632990002302714852000902737655001202746IND60102654020221120043815.0141106e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010265402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2011.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaykal, Gökhan,12aA new technique to reduce the radioactivity of fly ash utilized in the construction industry  ap. 1612-1617.  aHigh volume utilization of industrial wastes and by products is the solution for high disposal costs. Acceptable radioactivity levels in addition to other environmental factors is a key factor for safe utilization of wastes and byproducts of coal burning power plants. In general the radioactivity levels of most fly ashes are similar to natural materials. For higher radioactivity fly ash the radioactivity values must be reduced to acceptable limits. This can be done by mixing the fly ash with less radioactive natural materials. In this study a new technique involving the use of snow as an additive to the compaction water of fly ash is presented. Fly ash at optimum water content, and fly ash with additional 10% by weight snow are compacted, hermetically sealed to allow for equilibrium of ²²⁶Ra and ²³²Th with their decay products and cured for 28days at the curing room. Radioisotope activity analysis are conducted with a gamma analyst integrated gamma spectrometer. The activities of ²³⁵U, ²²⁶Ra, ²³⁸U, and ²³²Th of the fly ash and snow-added fly ash samples compacted at optimum moisture content are determined. The control samples revealed radioactivity values above UNIPEDE maximum allowable limits. Addition of snow caused a decrease of 31–42% in the radioisotope activity levels to that of control samples in Bqkg⁻¹. The decrease in radioactivity is linked to increased void ratio after melting of ice, increased densification of matrix around the pores due to higher level of cementitious mineral formation. The decrease in the radioisotope activity levels will allow utilization of fly ash in highway embankment construction where large surface area exposure and large volume usage makes it more critical for human health. Another advantage of the developed technology is the reduction of transportation costs by more than ten per cent by using less material for construction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3abyproducts 3acoal 3aconstruction industry 3aconstruction materials 3aenvironmental factors 3afly ash 3ahuman health 3aice 3aindustrial wastes 3amelting 3amixing 3apower plants 3aradionuclides 3asnow 3asurface area 3atransportation 3awater content1 aSaygılı, Altug0 tFuel.g2011 Apr., v. 90, no. 4 p.1612-1617dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2011.01.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009100166300001800257520150800275592002801783650001101811650001701822650001001839650001601849650001701865650001301882700001401895700002301909700002001932700002201952773008501974856008502059990002302144852000902167655001202176IND60105818020221119143549.0141108e20131018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010581802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2013.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Wulin10aGas separation performance of 6FDA-based polyimides with different chemical structures  ap. 6226-6235.  aThis work reports the gas separation performance of several 6FDA-based polyimides with different chemical structures, to correlate chemical structure with gas transport properties with a special focus on CO₂ and CH₄ transport and plasticization stability of the polyimides membranes relevant to natural gas purification. The consideration of the other gases (He, O₂ and N₂) provided additional insights regarding effects of backbone structure on detailed penetrant properties. The polyimides studied include 6FDA-DAM, 6FDA-mPDA, 6FDA-DABA, 6FDA-DAM:DABA (3:2), 6FDA-DAM:mPDA (3:2) and 6FDA-mPDA:DABA (3:2). Both pure and binary gas permeation were investigated. The packing density, which is tunable by adjusting monomer type and composition of the various samples, correlated with transport permeability and selectivity. The separation performance of the polyimides for various gas pairs were also plotted for comparison to the upper bound curves, and it was found that this family of materials shows attractive performance. The CO₂ plasticization responses for the un-cross-linked polyimides showed good plasticization resistance to CO₂/CH₄ mixed gas with 10% CO₂; however, only the cross-linked polyimides showed good plasticization resistance under aggressive gas feed conditions (CO₂/CH₄ mixed gas with 50% CO₂ or pure CO₂). For future work, asymmetric hollow fibers and carbon molecular sieve membranes based on the most attractive members of the family will be considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acrosslinking 3agases 3anatural gas 3apermeability 3apolymers1 aXu, Liren1 aChen, Chien-Chiang1 aPaul, Donald R.1 aKoros, William J.0 tPolymer.g2013 Oct. 18, v. 54, no. 22 p.6226-6235dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2013.09.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02073naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245006600161300001400227520108300241592002801324650002001352650001701372650001301389650001501402700001601417700001601433700002201449700001501471700001801486700002001504773008601524856008101610990002301691852000901714655001201723IND60108664520221120210257.0141108e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010866452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDar, G.N.10aCe-doped ZnO nanorods for the detection of hazardous chemical  ap. 72-78.  aThis paper reports a successful synthesis, characterizations and an efficient chemical sensor application of as-synthesized Ce-doped ZnO nanorods.

The as-synthesized nanorods were characterized in terms of their morphological, structural and compositional properties. The morphological and structural studies revealed that the synthesized nanorods were grown in high-density and possessed well-crystallinity. The as-synthesized nanorods were used as an effective electron mediator for the fabrication of an efficient hydroquinone chemical sensor. The fabricated sensor exhibited high and reproducible sensitivity of ∼10.218±0.01mAcm⁻²mM⁻¹ and detection limit of ∼10nM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever report on the fabrication of hydroquinone chemical sensor using Ce-doped ZnO nanostructures. This work demonstrates that simply synthesized Ce-doped ZnO nanostructures can be used as an effective electron mediator for the fabrication of chemical sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3ahydroquinone 3ananorods 3azinc oxide1 aUmar, Ahmad1 aZaidi, S.A.1 aIbrahim, Ahmed A.1 aAbaker, M.1 aBaskoutas, S.1 aAl-Assiri, M.S.0 tSensors and actuators.g2012 Oct., v. 173 p.72-78dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.06.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009800167300001600265520124400281592002801525650001401553650001101567650001101578650001501589700001501604700001801619773008401637856008401721990002301805852000901828655001201837IND60110933920221121075451.0141109e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011093392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultras.2012.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zuwei10aInvestigation of surface acoustic waves propagating in ZnO–SiO₂–Si multilayer structure  ap. 363-368.  aThe investigations of the propagation of the SAW in the multilayered structures have been of great interest since the combination of the surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology with the microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology comes true. In this paper, the recursive asymptotic method (RAM) is applied to analysis the propagation of the SAW in the ZnO–SiO₂–Si multilayered structure. The influences of the ZnO layer thickness and the SiO₂ layer thickness to the phase velocity and the electro-mechanical coupling coefficient for the Rayleigh wave and Love wave are discussed. The Love mode wave is found to be predominantly generated since the c-axis of the ZnO film is generally perpendicular to the substrate. In order to prove the theoretical results, a series of Love mode SAW devices based on the ZnO–SiO₂–Si multilayered structure is fabricated by micromachining, and their frequency responses are detected. The experimental results are found to be mainly consistent with the theoretical ones except the little larger velocities induced by the residual stresses produced in the fabrication process of the films. The deviation of the experimental results from the theoretical ones is reduced by thermal annealing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3asilica 3asounds 3azinc oxide1 aWen, Zhiyu1 aWang, Chunmei0 tUltrasonics.g2013 Feb., v. 53, no. 2 p.363-368dElsevier B.V.x0041-624X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultras.2012.07.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245015900167300001500326520184600341592002802187650002202215650002902237650001302266650001202279650002002291650002402311650001802335650002502353650000902378650001402387650003102401650002402432650001602456650001402472700001902486700002002505773011502525856008202640852000902722655001202731IND60100853520221123003645.0141105e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010085352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.06.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKundu, Kaushik10aInterfacial composition, thermodynamic properties, and structural parameters of water-in-oil microemulsions stabilized by 1-pentanol and mixed surfactants  ap. 96-110.  aThe present study is focused on the evaluation of the interfacial composition, thermodynamic properties, and structural parameters of water-in-oil mixed surfactant microemulsions [(cetylpyridinium chloride, CPC+polyoxyethylene (20) cetyl ether, Brij-58 or polyoxyethylene (20) stearyl ether, Brij-78)/1-pentanol/n-heptane, or n-decane] under various physicochemical environments by the Schulman method of cosurfactant titration of the oil/water interface. The estimation of the number of moles of 1-pentanol at the interface (nₐ ⁱ) and bulk oil (nₐ ᵒ) and its distribution between these two domains at the threshold level of stability have been emphasized. The thermodynamics of transfer of 1-pentanol from the continuous oil phase to the interface have been evaluated. nₐ ⁱ,nₐ ⁱ, standard Gibbs free energy (ΔGₜ ⁰), standard enthalpy (ΔHₜ ⁰), and standard entropy (ΔGₜ ⁰) of transfer process have been found to be dependent on the molar ratio of water to surfactant (ω), type of nonionic surfactant and its content (XBᵣᵢⱼ₋₅₈ ₒᵣ Bᵣᵢⱼ₋₇₈), oil and temperature. A correlation between (ΔHₜ ⁰) and (ΔSₜ ⁰) is examined at different experimental temperatures. Bulk surfactant composition dependent temperature insensitive microemulsions have been reported. Associated structural parameters, such as droplet dimensions and aggregation number of surfactant and cosurfactant at the droplet interface have been evaluated using a mathematical model after suitable modifications for mixed surfactant systems. In light of these parameters, the prospect of using these microemulsion systems for the synthesis of nanoparticles and the modulation of enzyme activity has been discussed. Correlations of the results in terms of the evaluated physicochemical parameters have been attempted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acetylpyridinium chloride 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aenzyme activity 3amathematical models 3ananoparticles 3anonionic surfactants 3aoils 3apentanols 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolyethylene glycol 3atemperature 3atitration1 aGuin, Gourhari1 aPaul, Bidyut K.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 385, no. 1 p.96-110dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.06.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011900165300001600284520096700300592002801267650002401295650002101319650001901340650001301359650002701372650001301399650001601412700002201428700002001450700002201470700002601492773011701518856008201635852000901717655001201726IND60100770920221118081434.0141105e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010077092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.08.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaity, Arnab10aInteraction of a new surface sensitive probe compound with anionic surfactants of varying hydrophobic chain length  ap. 395-399.  aThe amide derivative of a bis-phenylethynyl compound meta linked to 2,6-pyridine (BPEAP) poses inherent equilibrium between its neutral and zwitterionic forms in the excited state. BPEAP has been found to bind to the surface of anionic micelles instead of penetrating inside. This phenomenon has been exploited to attempt controlling the process of equilibrium using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at its pre-micellar and near-micellar aggregation concentrations. The anionic surfactant has been found to alter the equilibrium between the said forms of BPEAP depending on its concentration in solution. The process has been further verified by using sodium decyl sulfate (SDeS), which has smaller hydrophobic chain length than SDS as also varies in the critical micellar concentration (CMC) and aggregation number. The binding constant of the probe to the surfactant aggregates varies depending on the extent of surface available to the fluorophore for attachment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanionic surfactants 3afluorescent dyes 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asulfates 3azwitterions1 aGhosha, Prasūna,1 aDas, Tarasankar1 aDash, Jyotirmayee1 aPurkayastha, Pradipta0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 364, no. 2 p.395-399dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.08.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011000170300001400280520176000294592002802054650001802082650002002100650001802120650001702138650001302155650001402168650001402182650001602196650001202212700002302224700001902247700002002266700002202286773008202308856008402390852000902474655001202483IND60106050420221118025436.0141108e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010605042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2012.05.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhoroi, Chinmay10aMulti-faceted characterization of pharmaceutical powders to discern the influence of surface modification  ap. 63-74.  aThe present work is a comprehensive investigation of the flow, packing, and aeratibility behavior and discerning the rank order of several Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API), with or without surface modification, as well as excipients with different particle sizes and shapes. Surface modification of the API powders (various size grades of acetaminophen, ascorbic acid and ibuprofen) was conducted in a magnetically assisted impaction coater (MAIC), a well-established material sparing device. Powder characterization was done using various conventional and novel powder characterization techniques to measure properties such as, angle of repose, flow index, aerated, tapped and conditioned bulk densities, Housner ratio, Carr index, flow function coefficient (FFC), cohesivity and aeratibility. The comparative results show that surface modification improves flow, packing and aeratibility of powders with respect to corresponding as received powders, and in many cases, dry coated API powders exhibit properties as good as or better than similar sized excipients. The measured properties from different instruments were plotted through several illustrative phase maps with intent to develop a better visualization of the property improvements via dry coating. It was seen in the phase map of FFC vs. conditioned bulk density that it was easy to visualize a clear change in flow regimes after surface modification. For example, surface modified fine API powders show a shift from highly cohesive region (FFC<2) to easy flow region (4<FFC<10) or free flow region (FFC>10) along with an increase in conditioned bulk density (<0.4g/ml to >0.5g/ml). The use of the proposed phase map in developing manufacturing feasibility guidelines is also proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aangle of repose 3aascorbic acid 3abulk density 3acoatings 3aequipment 3aibuprofen 3aingredients 3apowders1 aGurumurthy, Lakxmi1 aMcDaniel, D.J.1 aJallo, Laila J.1 aDavé, Rajesh N.,0 tPowder technology.g2013 Feb., v. 236 p.63-74dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2012.05.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012500169300001600294520108300310592002801393650002201421650001501443650002301458650003701481650001101518650001801529650001301547650003301560650003701593650001601630650000901646650001501655700001701670773008701687856008401774990002301858852000901881655001201890IND60104057220221122031810.0141107e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010405722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.08.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDebanath, M.K.10aStudy of blueshift of optical band gap in zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles prepared by low-temperature wet chemical method  ap. 116-119.  aWe report synthesis of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles via wet chemical method using molar solutions of zinc nitrate hexahydrate [Zn(NO₃)₂·6H₂O] and ammonium hydroxide (NH₄OH) with polyvinylpyrollidone (PVP) as capping agent. The synthesized ZnO nanoparticles are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique and electron microscopy (TEM and SEM with EDX) for compositional analysis and surface morphology. The average crystallite size calculated from XRD pattern has been found to be on the order of 8.5nm. In this work, the hyperbolic band model (HBM) and UV–vis absorption spectra have been utilized to calculate the band gap and nanoparticle size which was proposed by Meulenkamp. It was Meulenkamp who correlated the particle sizes with the wavelength at which the absorption becomes half of that at the shoulder (λ₁/₂). The optical band gap value of the prepared ZnO nanoparticle is found to be on the order of 3.63eV which indicates the presence of blueshift.

CS-Fc+TiO₂ composite membrane was first modified on a bare glass carbon electrode. Then Au–Gra nanohybrid was formed on the CS-Fc+TiO₂ membrane by self-assembly strategy. Next, further immobilization of anti-CEA was constructed according to the strong interaction between Au–Gra and the amido groups of anti-CEA. Since Au–Gra nanohybrid films provided a congenial microenvironment for the immobilization of biomolecules, the surface coverage of antibody protein could be enhanced and the sensitivity of the immunosensor has been improved. The good electronic conductive characteristic might be attributed to the synergistic effect of graphene nanosheets and Au NPs. The modified process was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Under optimized conditions, the resulting biosensor displayed good amperometric response to CEA with linear range from 0.01 to 80ng/mL and a detection limit of 3.4pg/mL (signal/noise=3). The results demonstrated that the immunosensor has advantages of high conduction, sensitivity, and long life time. This assay approach showed a great potential in clinical applications and detection of low level proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3aglass 3agold 3agraphene 3aimmunosensors 3ananogold 3aproteins 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asynergism 3atitanium dioxide1 aZhuo, Ying1 aChai, Ya-Qin1 aMao, Li1 aYuan, Ya-Li1 aYuan, Ruo0 tTalanta.g2011 July 15, v. 85, no. 1 p.130-135dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2011.03.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01888naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008400170300001400254520088900268592002801157650002001185650001101205650001401216650001301230650001201243700002301255700002401278700001701302700002001319773009801339856008101437990002301518852000901541655001201550IND60108415520221119092207.0141108e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010841552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2012.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakamatsu, Seiichi10aFabric pressure sensor array fabricated with die-coating and weaving techniques  ap. 57-63.  aWe report on the fabrication and characterization of a large area (handkerchief-size, i.e., >16cm×16cm) of pressure sensor fabric.

In this paper, we isolated the cDNA encoding for estrogen receptor alpha of black rockfish (S. schlegeli) from its ovary, named as black rockfish ERα (brfERα). The cDNA sequence of brfERα consists of 2972bp with an open reading frame encoding a 624 amino acid putative protein which exhibits high identities with other teleosts’. The tissue distribution of brfERα mRNA was examined using RT-PCR. BrfERα showed generally expressions in most tissues of female black rockfish, besides, the higher degree of expressions were seen in ovary, liver, duodenum and fat, whereas it had a more restricted distribution in male fish. In ovary, the expression level of brfERα was as similar as the serum levels of E₂ and P in female. However, it was a different situation in male, where the serum concentration of E₂ showed higher levels after spermiation and Serum concentration of P did not show any significant changes during a year. Based on the present study, it is supposed that brfERα plays an important role in ovary and other target organs during the reproductive cycle, Further studies will focus on the transcriptional regulation and localization of brfERα in gonad in order to get a better understand of the physiological function of brfERα in ovoviviparous teleost. This study indicates that the black rockfish may be a good candidate for understanding the mechanism of estrogen in ovoviviparous fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSebastes melanops 3aduodenum 3amessenger RNA 3aliver 3ablood serum 3acomplementary DNA 3aestrogen receptors 3aopen reading frames 3amales 3aspermiation 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atissue distribution 3atranscription (genetics) 3aamino acids 3aSebastes schlegelii 3afish 3aanimal ovaries 3afemales 0aSebastes schlegeli1 aWen, Hai S.1 aHe, Feng1 aLi, Ji F.1 aYang, Yan P.1 aChen, Cai F.1 aZhang, Jia R.1 aChen, Xiao Y.1 aJin, Guo X.1 aShi, Bao1 aQi, Bao X.1 aLi, Na0 tSteroids.g2011 Dec. 20, v. 76, no. 14 p.1597-1608dElsevier Inc.x0039-128X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.steroids.2011.09.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245012100162300001400283520113800297592002801435650002201463650001101485650001401496650001101510650000901521650001701530700001801547700001401565700001401579773008201593856008401675990002301759852000901782655001201791IND60103810920221119212734.0141106e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010381092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.01.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Bin10aEEL-spectroscopy analysis for a metallic film covering on an as-grown diamond single crystal from Fe–Ni–C system  ap. 40-42.  aThe variation of sp³ fractions from carbon K-edge and the 3d-state occupancy on Fe–L₂–₃ edges in different layers of Fe-based metallic film covering on an as-grown diamond single crystal in diamond synthesis have been investigated by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). It shows that from the diamond/film interface to the inner, the sp³ fractions decrease from 87.33% to 78.15%, the 3d-state occupancy for Fe increase from 4.54 to 5.64 electrons/atom. Moreover, by X-ray diffraction (XRD), only γ-Fe, Fe₃C and (Fe,Ni)₂₃C₆ are found on the interface, which suggests that these carbon atoms with changed electronic configuration come from Fe₃C. Based on the valence bonding theory, formation of Fe₃C should make 3d occupancy increase, inconsistent with experimental observations. It can be concluded that, the 3d unpaired electrons of γ-Fe affect carbon atoms in Fe₃C lattice and make them transform into sp³-like state. These sp³-like carbon atoms are separated from Fe₃C and stack on the growing diamond crystal, eventually resulting in the reduction of 3d-state occupancy of Fe on the interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3airon 3aspectroscopy1 aFan, Xiaohong1 aNiu, Zhen1 aTian, Bin0 tMaterials letters.g2012 May 1, v. 74 p.40-42dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2012.01.0593Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010600172300001600278520176400294592002802058650002202086650002002108650002202128650003802150650001602188650000702204650002102211650003302232650001502265650001702280650001602297700002702313700002402340700001802364700002102382700002002403700001802423700002002441700001702461773010002478856008502578990002302663852000902686655001202695IND60100011920221121142128.0141105e20130130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010001192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2012.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarasini, Nirmal10aFabrication and evaluation of pH-modulated solid dispersion for telmisartan by spray-drying technique  ap. 424-432.  aThe present study was undertaken to overcome the problems associated with solubility, dissolution and oral bioavailability of a poorly water-soluble ionizable drug, telmisartan (TMS). For these purposes, a solubility test was carried to select the appropriate formulation composition from various carriers and alkalizers. Solid dispersions (SDs) of TMS were prepared at different drug-to-carrier ratios by the spray-drying technique, and were characterized by dissolution and aqueous solubility studies. The optimum formulation was investigated by dissolution studies at different pH and water media and its solid state characterisations were performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. In solubility and dissolution tests, all TMS-loaded pH-modulated SDs (pHM-SDs) exhibited marked improvement in the dissolution behavior when compared with crystalline TMS powder. The optimum formulation of pHM-SD consisted of TMS/PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) K30/Na₂CO₃ at a weight ratio of 2/0.5/3 and showed significant improvement in the aqueous solubility and dissolution rate by approximately 40,000- and 3-fold, respectively, compared to TMS powder. Solid-state characterization revealed the changed in crystallinity of TMS into amorphous state. Furthermore, area under the drug concentration time-curve (AUC) of TMS from the pHM-SD increased by 13.4- and 2.1-fold, compared with TMS powder and commercial product, respectively. According to these observations, taken together with dissolution and pharmacokinetic behaviors, pH-modulated SD in the presence of an alkalizer for a poorly water-soluble ionizable drug, TMS, appeared to be efficacious for enhancing its bioavailability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abioavailability 3acrystal structure 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adispersions 3apH 3apharmacokinetics 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolubility 3aspray drying 3atelmisartan1 aTrần, Tuấn Hiệp,1 aPoudel, Bijay Kumar1 aCho, Hyuk Jun1 aChoi, Young Keun1 aChi, Sang-Cheol1 aChoi, Han-Gon1 aYong, Chul Soon1 aKim, Jong Oh0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Jan. 30, v. 441, no. 1-2 p.424-432dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2012.11.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010700171300001400278520188400292592002802176650001902204650002002223650001002243650002002253650001202273650001802285650003102303650001702334650001802351650002002369650002702389650001302416650001602429650001402445700002202459700001702481773008202498856008402580852000902664655001202673IND60106050520221118025528.0141108e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010605052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2012.05.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalvi, Sameer V.10aPrecipitation and stabilization of ultrafine particles of Fenofibrate in aqueous suspensions by RESOLV  ap. 75-84.  aA method of rapid expansion of supercritical solutions into a liquid solvent (RESOLV) was used to precipitate and stabilize ultrafine particles of a poorly water soluble drug, Fenofibrate (FNB). In order to control particle size and its distribution (PSD), which are greatly affected by the inevitable growth and agglomeration, supercritical solutions of FNB prepared in SC CO₂ at 100–200bar and 333K, were expanded in water with stabilizers using fine nozzles with diameters of 127–762μm and length varying between 3 and 6cm. Stabilizers such as Tween 80, Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS), Pluronic F-68, Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), and Sodium Alginate (SA) were used. Synergistic effect of SDS with polymeric stabilizers such as HPMC and Sodium Alginate was also examined. Co-precipitation of FNB with Poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) was attempted to minimize particle growth and prevent agglomeration. Electrostatic stabilization compared to steric stabilization was found to be more effective in controlling PSD. FNB particles with sizes from 500nm to 5μm could be precipitated with the use of different stabilizers. Overall, SDS was found to be a better stabilizer resulting in almost 66% particles less than 1μm, which remained stable after 24h. Further, minor synergistic effects or PLGA co-precipitation or Sodium Alginate with SDS were observed. Finally, in order to increase practicality of this approach, multiple expansions of supercritical solutions of FNB in to a single collection sample were carried out to achieve higher particle concentrations of FNB in aqueous suspensions, albeit at the expense of increased particle size. However, even at high suspension concentration of 1.8mg/mL, average particle size was under 3μm, and stable after 24h, comparing very favorably with other approaches to produce FNB suspensions with high drug loading.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acoprecipitation 3adrugs 3amethylcellulose 3anozzles 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3apolysorbates 3arapid methods 3asodium alginate 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asolvents 3astabilizers 3asynergism1 aAzad, Mohammad A.1 aDave, Rajesh0 tPowder technology.g2013 Feb., v. 236 p.75-84dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2012.05.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01435naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011800169300001800287520047800305592002800783650002200811650002300833650002300856650004400879650002200923700002100945773008900966856008101055852000901136655001201145IND60109351620221119221347.0141109e20110311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010935162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhfusa, Toshiyuki10aReactivity and stereoselectivity of the Diels–Alder reaction using cyclic dienophiles and siloxyaminobutadienes  ap. 1893-1906.  aSeveral bicyclic compounds were synthesized by the Diels–Alder reaction using aminodiene and a cyclic dienophile.

In this study, the long-term effects of two anti-estrogens, namely 4-hydroxytamoxifen and fulvestrant (or ICI182,780), were investigated in ERα-positive BG1 epithelial ovarian cancer cells. To this aim, cells were grown in the presence of anti-estrogen concentrations that were sufficient to saturate the estrogen receptors, but were neither cytotoxic nor cytostatic as indicated by the absence of inhibition of cell proliferation. In these conditions and despite the lack of cytostatic effect of the drugs, long-term treatment (3 months) with the pure anti-estrogen fulvestrant induced a specific, reproducible and irreversible inhibition of ERα expression. This inhibition was accompanied by loss of estrogen-induced cell proliferation and gene expression as indicated by the analysis of several estrogen-responsive genes. ERα down-regulation was not linked to deregulated expression of transcription factors which drive ERα transcription and did not involve DNA methylation or histone deacetylation. Altogether, these results demonstrate that non-cytotoxic concentrations of pure anti-estrogens affect estrogen signaling and might be relevant for the treatment for ovarian cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aestrogen receptors 3ahistones 3adrugs 3acytotoxicity 3along term effects 3agene expression regulation 3agene expression 3agenes 3aneoplasm cells 3aaromatase 3acell proliferation 3aanimal ovaries 3aovarian neoplasms 0atranscription factors1 aDocquier, Aurélie1 aBusson, Muriel1 aLapierre, Marion1 aPujol, Pascal1 aBalaguer, Patrick1 aCavailles, Vincent0 tJournal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology.g2012 Oct., v. 132, no. 1-2 p.176-185dElsevier Ltdx0960-07607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsbmb.2012.05.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01835naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008100165300001800246520085900264592002801123650001301151650002601164650001601190650002101206700001901227700001601246700001701262700001801279773009601297856008401393990002301477852000901500655001201509IND60103738220221120050631.0141106e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010373822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.07.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Guiwu10aDielectric behavior of TiO₂ ceramic prepared by plasma activated sintering  ap. 3468-3471.  aRutile-phase TiO₂ ceramic was rapidly fabricated by plasma activated sintering (PAS) at 650–850°C for 3min under 30MPa. The temperature and frequency dependences of the dielectric properties (dielectric constant and dielectric loss) for the dense TiO₂ ceramic were investigated, and the dielectric behavior was briefly discussed. It was demonstrated that extraordinarily high dielectric constant (2–5×10⁴) was observed in the whole experimental ranges of −160 to 200°C and 1kHz–1MHz. Moreover, the dielectric loss kept a relatively normal level, however, its temperature and frequency dependences were markedly different with those of the rutile-phase TiO₂ preforms. The unusual dielectric behavior was related with the particular dielectric polarizations of the TiO₂ ceramic and its dominant form of loss under different conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceramics 3adielectric properties 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide1 aJian, Wenzheng1 aJin, Haiyun1 aShi, Zhongqi1 aQiao, Guanjun0 tMaterials letters.g2011 Dec., v. 65, no. 23-24 p.3468-3471dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2011.07.0753Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245012700171300001400298520105300312592002801365650002201393650000801415650001301423650002801436650002001464650001601484650001701500650001301517650001201530650003301542650002301575650001701598700001301615700002701628773010901655856008901764990002301853852000901876655001201885IND60107752720221120080851.0141108e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010775272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.radphyschem.2013.03.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaneesh, B.10aEffect of gamma radiation on the structural, dielectric and magnetoelectric properties of nanostructured hexagonal YMnO₃  ap. 28-32.  aNanocrystalline YMnO₃ ceramic powders have been synthesized by using the standard sol–gel method. The samples were irradiated with ⁶⁰Co γ-radiation at a dose rate of 4.7kGy/h for different time intervals. The effects of irradiation on surface morphology viz. grain size, porosity and also the existence of a few impurity phases have been studied by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and far-infrared reflectivity spectroscopy. Irradiation in air produced changes in the dielectric spectrum in the frequency range between 100Hz and 2MHz. Subjection of γ-radiation brings about key change on the properties as a consequence of structural transformations. The attained data shows that the electrical conductivity and dielectric constant is actually so much dependent on radiation dose. A quantitative magnetoelectric coefficient measurement in YMnO₃ nanosystem was performed by using the dynamic lock-in amplifier technique. The response of the magneto-electric coefficient shows perfect anisotropy in the irradiated samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aair 3aceramics 3aelectrical conductivity 3agamma radiation 3airradiation 3ananocrystals 3aporosity 3apowders 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asol-gel processing 3aspectroscopy1 aSaha, A.1 aKalarikkal, Nandakumar0 tRadiation physics and chemistry.g2013 Aug., v. 89 p.28-32dElsevier LtdwJournal:11985x0969-806X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.radphyschem.2013.03.0403Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100002300193245007900216300001800295520085500313592002801168650001101196650002001207650002201227650001801249650001901267651001801286700002401304700002801328773010201356856008601458990002301544852000901567655001201576IND60101618620221118023804.0141106e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010161862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhealeco.2013.09.0022doi7 aPMC38744512pmcid7 a241132412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcInerney, Melissa10aRecession depression: Mental health effects of the 2008 stock market crash  ap. 1090-1104.  aDo sudden, large wealth losses affect mental health? We use exogenous variation in the interview dates of the 2008 Health and Retirement Study to assess the impact of large wealth losses on mental health among older U.S. adults. We compare cross-wave changes in wealth and mental health for respondents interviewed before and after the October 2008 stock market crash. We find that the crash reduced wealth and increased feelings of depression and use of antidepressant drugs, and that these effects were largest among respondents with high levels of stock holdings prior to the crash. These results suggest that sudden wealth losses cause immediate declines in subjective measures of mental health. However, we find no evidence that wealth losses lead to increases in clinically-validated measures of depressive symptoms or indicators of depression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aantidepressants 3amental depression 3amental health 3astock exchange 3aUnited States1 aMellor, Jennifer M.1 aNicholas, Lauren Hersch0 tJournal of health economics.g2013 Dec., v. 32, no. 6 p.1090-1104dElsevier B.V.x0167-62967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2013.09.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011600165300001800281520124200299592002801541650001601569650001201585650001801597650001901615650004401634650001301678650001701691650001601708700001601724700001701740700001601757700001401773773008501787856008501872990002301957852000901980655001201989IND60105654520221123041408.0141108e20110818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010565452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2011.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, H.10aSolvent effect on the emulsion copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and lauryl methacrylate in aqueous media  ap. 3925-3932.  aAqueous emulsion homo- and copolymerization of lauryl methacrylate (LMA), a highly hydrophobic, almost water-insoluble monomer, is quite challenging. Due to the addition of ethanol to the aqueous phase the solvency for LMA is increased and it is possible to successfully produce LMA-methyl methacrylate (MMA) copolymer particles. The incorporation of LMA is confirmed by ¹H NMR spectroscopy. Coagulation at higher ethanol content in the continuous phase could be avoided by polymeric steric stabilizers such as poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) or poly(vinyl alcohol). The conversion–time curves exhibit, independent of the stabilizer, an initially high rate where predominantly MMA is polymerized and a second period with slower rate dominated by LMA consumption as proven by ¹H NMR spectroscopy and DSC data. The morphology of the copolymer particles changes with increasing ethanol content from solid sphere - like to porous. For medium PVP - stabilizer concentrations the particles possess a single pore and appear almost bowl-shaped. The large difference between the hydrodynamic and the hard sphere particle diameter indicates a high degree of swelling of the copolymer particles with the water–ethanol mixture of the continuous phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoagulation 3aethanol 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrophobicity 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3apyrrolidones 3astabilizers1 aHasan, M.K.1 aMiah, M.A.J.1 aAli, A.M.I.1 aTauer, K.0 tPolymer.g2011 Aug. 18, v. 52, no. 18 p.3925-3932dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2011.07.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02023naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003300113040001800146100001900164245006500183300001600248500001500264520082000279592002801099650004501127650002801172650002401200650001301224650001401237650002201251653002401273700002001297700002301317773009601340856011201436856007901548961001301627852000901640655001201649IND2198748420221118093638.0151024e199812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219874842DNAL7 a10113/106412hdl7 a10.1023/A:10186860033072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarret, R.

Fifty-one accessions representing 29 Paspalum species were analyzed for DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Fifteen random genomic probes were used in combination with restriction enzyme EcoRI to detect RFLPs, and data were analyzed phenetically. Hybridization with the 15 selected clones resulted in the detection of 261 RFLPs. Among the 261 restriction fragments scored, 204 (78.2%) were phenetically informative. Extensive RFLP variation was found between the species studied. Species affinities based on RFLP data were found to be in close agreement with previously determined relationships based on both morphological and cytological characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3ainterspecific variation 3arestriction mapping 3aPaspalum 3aphylogeny 3agenetic variation 0aspecies differences1 aLiu, Zhaowei W.1 aWebster, Robert W.0 tEuphytica.g1998 Dec., v. 104, no. 2 p.119-125dKluwer Academic Publishersx0014-23367nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/106413Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10186860033073Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01626naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011300173300001600286520063300302592002800935650002200963650001600985650004401001650001401045700002301059700002301082773010101105856008601206990002301292852000901315655001201324IND60102390020221121093757.0141106e20120613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010239002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWysocka, Waleria10aEffect of substituents and structural modification on conformational equilibrium in bis-quinolizidine system  ap. 123-134.  aOn the basis of literature interpretation of ¹³C NMR and ¹H NMR spectra of bis-quinolizidine alkaloids, the values of free enthalpy ΔG of conformational equilibria of those compounds were calculated.

In the experiment, medical students in the role of physicians decide on the provision of medical services. The experimental setup allows us to identify the influence of profits and patients’ health benefit on the choice of medical treatment. We estimate physician altruism, the weight individuals attach to patients’ health benefit, by fitting mixed logit and multinomial logit regression models to the experimental data. Estimation results provide evidence for physician altruism. We find, however, substantial variation in the degree of physician altruism. We also discuss some implications of our results for the design of physician payment schemes in the light of the theoretical literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltruism 3amedical treatment 3apatients 3aphysicians 3aprofits and margins 3aregression analysis 3astudents1 aWiesen, Daniel0 tJournal of health economics.g2013 Dec., v. 32, no. 6 p.1105-1116dElsevier B.V.x0167-62967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2013.08.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012800171300001600299500001500315520140400330592002801734650002201762650001101784650002301795650001401818650001401832650002301846653001701869700002401886700001801910700002001928773010001948856008602048990002302134852000902157655001202166IND60102470720221117192602.0141106e20130522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010247072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.02.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnga, Srinivas10aCationic copper (I) complexes with bulky 1,4-diaza-1,3-butadiene ligands – Synthesis, solid state structure and catalysis  ap. 129-138.  a2019-12-04  aWe report the full characterization of two glyoxal-based ligands N,N bis(diphenylmethyl)-1,4-diaza-1,3-butadiene ligand (DADᴾʰ², 1) and more bulky N,N bis(triphenylmethyl)-1,4-diaza-1,3-butadiene ligand (DADᴾʰ³, 2) by the condensation reaction of glyoxal and diphenylmethanamine and triphenyl-methanamine respectively. The copper (I) complex of composition [Cu(DADᴾʰ²)₂]PF₆ (3) having two neutral bidentate N,N bis(diphenyl-methyl)-1,4-diaza-1,3-butadiene ligand was prepared by the reaction of [Cu(CH₃CN)₄]PF₆ and 1 in 1:2 ratio in dichloromethane. In a similar reaction with N,N bis(triphenylmethyl)-1,4-diaza-1,3-butadiene ligand (2) and [Cu(CH₃CN)₄]PF₆ in dichloromethane yielded corresponding heteroleptic copper (I) complex [Cu(DADᴾʰ³)(CH₃CN)₂]PF₆ (4). Another copper (I) complex [Cu(DADᴾʰ²)(PPh₃)]PF₆ (5) can also be obtained by the one pot reaction involving ligand 1, [Cu(CH₃CN)₄]PF₆ and triphenylphosphine. Solid state structures of all the five compounds were established by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The solid state structures of the copper complexes 3–5 reveal a distorted tetrahedral geometry around the copper (I) centers. The copper complexes 3–5 were tested as catalysts for the coupling reaction of o-iodophenol and phenyl acetylene and it was observed that complex 4 exhibits the highest catalytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acopper 3amethylene chloride 3acatalysts 3aacetylene 3acatalytic activity 0acondensation1 aKottalanka, Ravi K.1 aPal, Tigmansu1 aPanda, Tarun K.0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2013 May 22, v. 1040 p.129-138dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.02.0373Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002000159245012100179300001600300520077200316592002801088650004401116650001501160650001301175650004301188650002201231650001201253650001801265650004401283650003201327650002401359650002301383650001101406700001701417773010501434856009301539852000901632655001201641IND60105897720221123002926.0141108e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010589772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2012.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoang, Cuong N.10aAminolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) waste with ethylenediamine and characterization of α,ω-diamine products  ap. 697-708.  aBis(2-aminoethyl) terephthalamide (BAET, or trimer) and α,ω-aminoligo(ethylene terephthalamide) (AOET, or oligomers) were obtained from the reaction of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) waste with excess amount of ethylenediamine (EDA).

The highly purified monomer exhibited an activation energy of 110 kJ/mol for auto-catalytic cure at temperatures of 210 °C–290 °C, modestly lower than the comparably measured activation energy of a commercial cyanated novolac. The overall extent of cure achievable at these temperatures was also higher for the new monomer. Many physical properties of the cured monomer, including density, thermochemical stability, moisture uptake, and the impact of hydrolytic degradation on glass transition temperature were similar to those of commercial tricyanates, with a dry glass transition temperature at full conversion of at least 340 °C. These results illustrate how careful control of the local chemical structure in the vicinity of network junction points may be utilized to improve the properties of thermosetting polymer networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3achemical structure 3aglass transition temperature 3apolymers 3apropane1 aDavis, Matthew C.1 aLamison, Kevin R.1 aYandek, Gregory R.1 aCambrea, Lee R.1 aGroshens, Thomas J.1 aBaldwin, Lawrence C.1 aMabry, Joseph M.0 tPolymer.g2011 Aug. 18, v. 52, no. 18 p.3933-3942dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2011.07.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010900172300001600281520168600297592002801983650001502011650002902026650001202055650001202067650001302079650002102092650001102113650001102124650000902135650000902144650001202153650001402165650001402179650001402193650003302207650002002240650001102260650001802271650002302289650001402312650001102326650001602337650001102353650000902364651001302373700001902386773010702405856008502512852000902597655001202606IND60101372320221116220902.0141106e20110830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010137232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.05.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIqbāl, Jāvīd,10aDistribution, correlation and risk assessment of selected metals in urban soils from Islamabad, Pakistan  ap. 887-898.  aUrban soil samples were analyzed for Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb, Sr and Zn by atomic absorption spectrophotometric method. Multivariate statistical approach was used to study the apportionment of selected metals in the soil samples during summer and winter. The degree of contamination along with the geoaccumulation index, enrichment factor and contamination factor was also evaluated. In water-extract of the soil samples, relatively higher levels were noted for Na, Ca, K, Fe, Mg, and Pb with average concentrations of 56.38, 33.82, 12.53, 7.127, 5.994, and 1.045mg/kg during summer, while the mean metal levels during winter were 76.45, 38.05, 3.928, 0.627, 8.726, and 0.878mg/kg, respectively. In case of acid-extract of the soils, Ca, Fe, Mg, Na, K, Mn and Sr were found at 27,531, 12,784, 2769, 999.9, 737.9, 393.5, and 115.1mg/kg, during summer and 23,386, 3958, 3206, 254.6, 1511, 453.6, and 53.30mg/kg, during winter, respectively. Most of the metals showed random distribution with diverse correlations in both seasons. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis revealed significant anthropogenic intrusions of Cd, Pb, Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Zn and Na in the soils. Geoaccumulation indices and contamination factors indicated moderate to heavy contamination for Pb and Cd in the soils, while enrichment factor exhibited significant enrichment (EF>5) of Cd, Pb, Ca, Co, Li, Mn and Zn by anthropogenic activities. Overall, on the average basis, considerable degree of contamination (Cdₑg>16) was observed in both seasons, although it was higher in winter. Present metal levels were also compared with those reported from other areas around the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanthropogenic activities 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achromium 3acluster analysis 3acobalt 3acopper 3airon 3alead 3alithium 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3apotassium 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk assessment 3asodium 3asoil sampling 3aspectrophotometers 3astrontium 3asummer 3aurban soils 3awinter 3azinc 3aPakistan1 aShah, Munir H.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Aug. 30, v. 192, no. 2 p.887-898dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.05.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012800170300001600298520122900314592002801543650002601571650001201597650000901609650001501618650001301633650001301646650001901659650001601678700002101694700002001715700002401735773009801759856008101857990002301938852000901961655001201970IND60108486120221120222500.0141108e20110128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010848612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2010.07.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAussawasathien, D.10aPoly(o-anisidine)–polystyrene composite fibers via electrospinning process: Surface morphology and chemical vapor sensing  ap. 341-350.  aThe electrospinning technique was utilized to produce camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) doped poly(o-anisidine) (POA)–polystyrene (PS) composite fibers in the non-woven mat form with different fiber characteristics, depending on the proportion of components in spinning solutions. CSA doped POA–PS composite fibers were fabricated onto interdigited gold substrates for use as chemical vapor sensors. The resultant composite fiber sensor responded to high polar volatile chemicals by showing a decrease in electrical resistance during the sensing measurement. The sensitivity of the composite fiber sensor when exposed to water vapor was higher than that of the composite fiber sensor subjected to ethanol vapor due to high polarity together with low vapor pressure of water compared with those of ethanol. The surface morphology of the non-woven composite fiber mat after chemical vapor sensing was unchanged. This work opens up the possibility of using the derivatives of polyaniline as a component in composite fibers for chemical sensing applications by taking advantages of their good solubility in common solvents as well as detectable electrical changes in terms of the relatively small amount of composite fibers needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical resistance 3aethanol 3agold 3asolubility 3asolvents 3aspinning 3avapor pressure 3awater vapor1 aSahasithiwat, S.1 aMenbangpung, L.1 aTeerawattananon, C.0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Jan. 28, v. 151, no. 2 p.341-350dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2010.07.0483Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245023400176300001200410520122500422592002801647650001301675650001401688650002301702650003501725650002001760650001701780650005301797650001101850650000701861650002601868650004101894700002901935700003101964700003101995700003902026700002702065773007102092856008502163852000902248655001202257IND60109190420221121061456.0141109e20120530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010919042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2012.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalmora, Sergio Luiz10aStability-indicating capillary zone electrophoresis method for the assessment of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and its correlation with reversed-phase liquid chromatography method and bioassay  ap. 1-7.  aA stability-indicating capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) method was validated for the analysis of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) using leuprorelin acetate (LA), as internal standard (IS). A fused-silica capillary (75μm i.d.; effective length, 72cm) was used at 25°C; the applied voltage was 12kV. The background electrolyte solution consisted of 50mM di-sodium hydrogen phosphate solution at pH 8.8. Injections were performed using a pressure mode at 50mbar for 9s, with detection by photodiode array detector set at 200nm. Specificity and stability-indicating capability were established in degradation studies, which also showed that there was no interference of the excipients. The method was linear over the concentration range of 2.5–200μgmL⁻¹ (r²=0.9995) and the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were 0.79μgmL⁻¹ and 2.5μgmL⁻¹, respectively. The accuracy was 99.14% with bias lower than 1.40%. The method was applied to the quantitative analysis of biopharmaceutical formulations, and the results were correlated to those of a validated reversed-phase LC method (RP-LC), and an in vitro bioassay, showing non-significant differences (p>0.05).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3abioassays 3abiopharmaceuticals 3acapillary zone electrophoresis 3adetection limit 3aelectrolytes 3agranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 3ahumans 3apH 3aquantitative analysis 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography1 ados Santos Butzge, Cairo1 aMachado, Francine Trevisan1 aWalter, Maurício Elesbão1 ade Ávila Dalmora, Maria Elisabeth1 aSouto, Ricardo Bizogne0 tTalanta.g2012 May 30, v. 94 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2012.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01124naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245003100170300001800201520031900219592002800538650002400566650002000590650002400610773011100634856008100745990002300826852000900849655001200858IND60104131020221116193120.0141107e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010413102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2011.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Sayed Ahmed, A.10aHyperholomorphic Q classes  ap. 1428-1435.  aIn this paper, we consider a definition of QT-space for quaternion-valued functions of three real variables and study some of its basic properties.

Two types of closed-path sensors – ring core and racetrack – were checked to reveal risky combination of material and construction parameters, and means to optimize the combination were tested. One-step field annealing of Co-based metallic glass was chosen to acquire low-magnetostrictive material with anisotropy required to reduce noise by favoring magnetization rotation. Locally misaligned anisotropy promoted incoherent rotation and handicapped racetrack noise performance. Despite the risk of bending stress aggravated by small – 12mm diameter, the ring cores fared better and reproducibly achieved noise 7pT/√Hz @ 1Hz when thoroughly fixed an annealed in an optimal sheath.

Constructing a political economy model in which voters face uncertainty due to the types of politicians and the risk of environmental damage, we show that there is an equilibrium in which a politician uses a weaker environmental policy rather than efficient direct transfers for redistribution. We also show that there is an equilibrium in which a stricter environmental policy can be implemented by a politician who has no incentive to make transfers. Then, we discuss which equilibrium should be more plausible. We conclude that the latter equilibrium in which a too stringent environmental policy emerges can dominate the former unless the citizen’s estimate of environmental risk is sufficiently low.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental policy 3amodels 3apolitics 3arisk 3auncertainty0 tResource and energy economics.g2011 Sept., v. 33, no. 3 p.477-495dElsevier B.V.x0928-76557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.reseneeco.2010.09.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01998naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012200169300001600291520099300307592002801300650002301328650002401351650001401375650001501389650002401404650001501428650001601443700002201459700002201481773007501503856008501578852000901663655001201672IND60109190520221121061421.0141109e20120530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010919052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2012.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliva, Alexis13aAn improved methodology for data analysis in accelerated stability studies of peptide drugs: Practical considerations  ap. 158-166.  aAlthough the basic science behind current methods for studying biopharmaceutical drug stability has not changed significantly, the techniques available for predicting stability have evolved over the years. This paper therefore describes and discusses various options of data analysis for accelerated degradation studies of peptide and protein drugs based on the Arrhenius equation. Both linear and non-linear regression analyses are also discussed. The results indicate that the simultaneous treatment of all data, as opposed to determining individual rate constants is clearly preferable, combined with the use of the reparameterized Arrhenius equation. The estimated shelf-life at 5°C varied between 2.2 and 4.0 years in function of the temperature range and procedure used, whereas the precision of the estimated parameter is reflected in the width of the 95% confidence intervals, the classic Arrhenius analysis was maxima. All these results were evaluated by the bootstrap approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopharmaceuticals 3aconfidence interval 3aequations 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3ashelf life 3atemperature1 aFariña, José B.1 aLlabrés, Matías0 tTalanta.g2012 May 30, v. 94 p.158-166dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2012.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002000168245009400188300001900282500001500301520137200316592002801688650001901716650002101735650002401756650001701780650000701797650001301804650001101817650001601828650005701844650003101901650002601932650002401958650001101982650001101993650003102004650002002035650004802055650000902103650003002112650001802142650003002160650002102190650004002211650002102251650003002272653001302302700002202315700001902337700001802356700002402374773009702398856008302495990002302578852000902601655001202610IND60102564620221118231402.0141106e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010256462DNAL7 a214814142pmid7 a10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.02.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArmangil, Didem10aInhaled Beta-2 Agonist Salbutamol for the Treatment of Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn  ap. 398-403.e1.  a2019-12-04  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of inhaled salbutamol, a beta-2 adrenergic agonist, for the treatment of transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) and to determine whether inhaled salbutamol is safe in newborn infants. STUDY DESIGN: Inhaled salbutamol or normal saline solution was administered to 54 infants with gestational ages ranging from 34 to 39 weeks and TTN. The response to salbutamol therapy was evaluated by determining respiratory rate, clinical score of TTN, level of respiratory support, and fraction of inspired oxygen before and at 30 minutes and 1 and 4 hours after salbutamol nebulization. RESULTS: Among the 54 infants with TTN, 32 received salbutamol and 22 received normal saline solution. After one dose, the salbutamol group showed significant improvements in respiratory rate, clinical score of TTN, fraction of inspired oxygen, and level of respiratory support (P < .05). After treatment, the mean pH, partial pressure of arterial oxygen, and partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide values were better in the salbutamol group when compared with the placebo group (P < .05). Duration of hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit was also shorter for the salbutamol group (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Inhaled salbutamol treatment was effective with respect to both clinical and laboratory findings of TTN and without adverse events.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3arespiratory rate 3aadrenergic agonists 3atherapeutics 3apH 3aneonates 3aoxygen 3aatomization 2aAdrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonistsxtherapeutic use 2aAlbuterolxtherapeutic use 2aCarbon Dioxidexblood 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aInfant, Newborn 2aLength of Stayxstatistics & numerical data 2aMale 2aNebulizers and Vaporizers 2aOxygenxblood 2aOxygen Inhalation Therapy 2aPartial Pressure 2aRespiration Disordersxdrug therapy 2aRespiratory Rate 2aSeverity of Illness Index 0aagonists1 aYurdakök, Murat,1 aKorkmaz, Ayşe1 aYiğit, Şule1 aTekinalp, Gülsevin0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2011 Sept., v. 159, no. 3 p.398-403.e1dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.02.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245018900166300001800355520126200373592002801635650001701663650001801680650001901698650001301717700001801730700001701748773008501765856008501850990002301935852000901958655001201967IND60105654820221120095436.0141108e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010565482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2011.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yuhong10aPhoto-induced living/controlled surface radical grafting polymerization and its application in fabricating 3-D micro-architectures on the surface of flat/particulate organic substrates  ap. 4159-4173.  aThis feature article covers the fundamental chemistry and applications of photo-induced living surface grafting polymerization. The mechanism of activation of inert alkyl C–H bonds of polymer substrates, the structures of the active free radical and reversible dormant species, the modes of the grafting chain growth (including linear, branched and cross-linked variants), and the role of spatial effect are discussed. Two technologies, i.e., 1-step and 2-step processes, their features and applications in fabricating polymer brushes with precisely controlled patterns, desired functions, branched and block grafting chains on planar substrates, and polymer lamination are presented. The fabrication of 3-dimensional covalently bonded polymer particles, such as nano-sized polymer particle monolayers (with uniform and bimodal distributions), discrete solid and hollow polymer particles of micrometer size, and multilayer polymer particles on polymeric substrates are also introduced. In the last part, the application of photo-induced living surface grafting polymerization in non-planar surface modifications, such as the preparation of core–shell polymer particles, Janus particles and cross-linked hydrogels with hairy polymer chains is summarized.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3ahydrocolloids 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aLiu, Lianying1 aYang, Wantai0 tPolymer.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 52, no. 19 p.4159-4173dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2011.07.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245010700212300001600319506007600335520096200411592002801373506003701401650001301438650001001451650001001461650001201471650002101483650001801504650001801522650002301540650001401563700002301577700002701600700002801627700002801655773008301683856008401766852000901850655001201859IND60104750120221207143217.0161023e20130207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010475012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2012.11.0252doi7 aPMC35706092pmcid7 a232739792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacob, Asha Ivy10aConserved Bacterial RNase YbeY Plays Key Roles in 70S Ribosome Quality Control and 16S rRNA Maturation  ap. 427-438.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aQuality control of ribosomes is critical for cellular function since protein mistranslation leads to severe physiological consequences. We report evidence of a previously unrecognized ribosome quality control system in bacteria that operates at the level of 70S to remove defective ribosomes. YbeY, a previously unidentified endoribonuclease, and the exonuclease RNase R act together by a process mediated specifically by the 30S ribosomal subunit, to degrade defective 70S ribosomes but not properly matured 70S ribosomes or individual subunits. Furthermore, there is essentially no fully matured 16S rRNA in a ΔybeY mutant at 45°C, making YbeY the only endoribonuclease to be implicated in the critically important processing of the 16S rRNA 3′ terminus. These key roles in ribosome quality control and maturation indicate why YbeY is a member of the minimal bacterial gene set and suggest that it could be a potential target for antibacterial drugs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteria 3adrugs 3agenes 3amutants 3aprotein subunits 3aribonucleases 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomal proteins 3aribosomes1 aKöhrer, Caroline,1 aDavies, Bryan William1 aRajBhandary, Uttam Lal1 aWalker, Graham Charles0 tMolecular cell.g2013 Feb. 07, v. 49 p.427-438dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2012.11.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01336naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245005100166300001800217520046700235592002800702650002400730650002000754650002400774700002100798773012600819856008100945990002301026852000901049655001201058IND60104131220221116193017.0141107e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010413122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2011.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeveci, Ömür14aThe kk-nacci sequences in Q2n×φZ2mQ2n×φZ2m  ap. 1450-1455.  aLet n,m≥3 be integers.

When the pH values of bulk solution were between 6.0 and 7.0, successful adsorption onto 1mL nano-sized TiO₂ colloid (0.2%) was achieved for more than 97.0% of Se (IV) while Se (VI) barely got adsorbed. Therefore, the method made it possible to preconcentrate and determine Se (IV) and Se (VI) separately. The precipitated TiO₂ with concentrated selenium was directly converted to colloid without desorption. Selenium in the resulting colloid was then determined by HG-AFS. The detection limits (3σ) and relative standard deviations (R.S.D) of this method were 24ng/L and 42ng/L, 7.8% (n=6) and 7.0% (n=6) for Se (IV) and Se (VI), respectively. This simple, sensitive, and united method was successfully applied to the separation and speciation of ultra-trace Se (IV) and Se (VI) in environmental water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3ahydrides 3apH 3aselenium 3aspectroscopy 3atitanium dioxide1 aZhang, Xu1 aQian, Shahua1 aZhang, Lin0 tTalanta.g2012 May 30, v. 94 p.167-171dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2012.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01815naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012200171300001600293520088300309592002801192650001401220650002501234650001601259700001801275700001601293700001501309773010701324856008501431852000901516655001201525IND60101302020221117235920.0141106e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010130202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.11.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReniers, G.L.L.10aEmpirical validation of a real options theory based method for optimizing evacuation decisions within chemical plants  ap. 779-787.  aThis article empirically assesses and validates a methodology to make evacuation decisions in case of major fire accidents in chemical clusters. In this paper, a number of empirical results are presented, processed and discussed with respect to the implications and management of evacuation decisions in chemical companies. It has been shown in this article that in realistic industrial settings, suboptimal interventions may result in case the prospect to obtain additional information at later stages of the decision process is ignored. Empirical results also show that implications of interventions, as well as the required time and workforce to complete particular shutdown activities, may be very different from one company to another. Therefore, to be optimal from an economic viewpoint, it is essential that precautionary evacuation decisions are tailor-made per company.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3abusiness enterprises 3alabor force1 aAudenaert, A.1 aPauwels, N.1 aSoudan, K.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Feb. 15, v. 186, no. 1 p.779-787dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.11.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015100169300002100320520184500341592002802186650001102214650001802225650001402243650001202257650001702269650001902286650001902305650002102324650001902345650001402364650001402378650002102392650001802413650001302431700002202444700001802466700002002484700001902504700001802523700002002541700001902561700002402580700002102604773012202625856008202747990002302829852000902852655001202861IND60100217820221120120316.0141105e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010021782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2012.10.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHofmann, Claudia10aCor a 1–reactive T cells and IgE are predominantly cross-reactive to Bet v 1 in patients with birch pollen–associated food allergy to hazelnut  ap. 1384-1392.e6.  aBACKGROUND: IgE- and T-cell cross-reactivity contribute to the birch pollen–food syndrome. OBJECTIVES: We performed a comprehensive analysis of T-cell cross-reactivity in primary cell cultures, facilitating the identification of allergen-specific T-cell subpopulations from individual patients. METHODS: Patients with birch pollen allergy and associated food allergy to hazelnuts, carrots, or both were analyzed for IgE cross-reactivity, T-cell responses, and T-cell cross-reactivity to recombinant Bet v 1.0101 (Bet v 1; birch), Cor a 1.0401 (Cor a 1; hazelnut), and Dau c 1.0104 (Dau c 1; carrot). A novel flow cytometry–based method using a 2-step staining process with fluorescent dyes was established to identify subpopulations of cross-reactive T cells. RESULTS: IgE-binding inhibition tests of individual sera revealed that the vast majority of Cor a 1–reactive IgE was cross-reactive to Bet v 1, whereas Bet v 1–reactive IgE was only partially inhibited by preincubation with Cor a 1. Primary stimulation of T cells with Bet v 1 or Cor a 1 resulted in a significant increase in specific responses to Cor a 1 or Bet v 1 after secondary stimulation, respectively, indicating T-cell cross-reactivity between birch and hazelnut allergens in all patients of the study cohort. Preactivation with Dau c 1 induced less pronounced effects. A novel flow cytometry–based proliferation assay identified a predominant Cor a 1/Bet v 1–cross-reactive T-cell subpopulation within highly Bet v 1/Cor a 1–responsive T cells. CONCLUSION: Analysis of primary allergen-specific T cells combined with flow cytometry–based proliferation assays facilitates investigation of allergen-specific T-cell subpopulations in subjects and might be helpful to evaluate the effect of birch-specific immunotherapy on pollen-associated food allergies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aT-lymphocytes 3aallergens 3acarrots 3acell culture 3acohort studies 3across reaction 3afluorescent dyes 3afood allergies 3ahay fever 3ahazelnuts 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmunotherapy 3apatients1 aScheurer, Stephan1 aRost, Kathrin1 aGraulich, Edith1 aJamin, Annette1 aFoetisch, Kay1 aSaloga, Joachim1 aVieths, Stefan1 aSteinbrink, Kerstin1 aAdler, Henric S.0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2013 May, v. 131, no. 5 p.1384-1392.e6dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2012.10.0373Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245007700208300001600285506007600301520110800377592002801485506003701513650000901550650001601559650001101575650001801586650000901604650002201613650001401635650002001649650002701669700002201696700002101718700001901739700002101758700002701779773008301806856008401889852000901973655001201982IND60104750220221207143200.0161023e20130207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010475022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2012.11.0282doi7 aPMC35707222pmcid7 a232909152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShalgi, Reut10aWidespread Regulation of Translation by Elongation Pausing in Heat Shock  ap. 439-452.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlobal repression of protein synthesis is a hallmark of the cellular stress response and has been attributed primarily to inhibition of translation initiation, although this mechanism may not always explain the full extent of repression. Here, using ribosome footprinting, we show that 2 hr of severe heat stress triggers global pausing of translation elongation at around codon 65 on most mRNAs in both mouse and human cells. The genome-wide nature of the phenomenon, its location, and features of protein N termini suggested the involvement of ribosome-associated chaperones. After severe heat shock, Hsp70’s interactions with the translational machinery were markedly altered and its association with ribosomes was reduced. Pretreatment with mild heat stress or overexpression of Hsp70 protected cells from heat shock-induced elongation pausing, while inhibition of Hsp70 activity triggered elongation pausing without heat stress. Our findings suggest that regulation of translation elongation in general, and by chaperones in particular, represents a major component of cellular stress responses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aheat 3aheat stress 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aprotein synthesis 3aribosomes 3astress response 3atranslation (genetics)1 aHurt, Jessica A.1 aKrykbaeva, Irina1 aTaipale, Mikko1 aLindquist, Susan1 aBurge, Christopher B.0 tMolecular cell.g2013 Feb. 07, v. 49 p.439-452dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2012.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245012100166300001600287520199000303592002802293650002202321650002602343650001202369650001302381650001002394650001702404650001202421650003102433650002002464650001302484650001602497650001402513650001202527650001302539650002202552700001502574700002402589773010702613856008302720990002302803852000902826655001202835IND60104834120221116205729.0141107e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010483412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Tiehan12aA plant cell-based system that predicts aβ42 misfolding: Potential as a drug discovery tool for Alzheimer's disease  ap. 571-579.  aAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides and the failure of mechanisms to clear toxic aggregates. The Aβ42 peptide is considered to be a causative factor that underlies the pathophysiology of AD, in part due to its propensity for misfolding and aggregation; the small oligomers that result represent toxic species. Thus agents that prevent Aβ42 misfolding/aggregation or, alternatively improve Aβ42 oligomer clearance, may have significant therapeutic value. We have developed the basis for a drug screening system based on transgenic plant cells that express Aβ42 fusion proteins to serve as the reliable indicators of the general conformational status of Aβ42. Within cells of transgenic tobacco and Nicotiana benthamiana, misfolding of Aβ42 causes the misfolding of a GFP fusion partner, and consequently there is a loss of fluorescence associated with the native GFP protein. In a similar fusion consisting of Aβ42 linked to hygromycin phosphotransferase II (Hpt II), a hygromycin-resistance marker, misfolding of Aβ42 leads to a misfolded Hpt II, and consequently the transgenic cells are unable to grow on media containing hygromycin. Importantly, substitution of the ‘aggregation-prone’ Aβ42 with a missense mutant of Aβ42 (F19S/L34F) that is not prone to misfolding/aggregation, ‘rescues’ both fusion partners. Several ‘positive control’ chemicals that represent inhibitors of Aβ42 aggregation, including curcumin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and resveratrol show efficacy in preventing the Aβ42-fusion proteins from misfolding/aggregating in the transgenic plant cells. We discuss the potential of the two fusion protein systems to serve as the basis for an inexpensive, selective, and efficient screening system in which a plant cell can fluoresce or survive only in the presence of drug candidates that are able to prevent Aβ42 misfolding/aggregation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aamyloid 3acurcumin 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3amutants 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3apathophysiology 3apeptides 3aresveratrol 3ascreening 3atobacco 3atoxicity 3atransgenic plants1 aZeng, Ying1 aKermode, Allison R.0 tMolecular genetics and metabolism.g2012 Nov., v. 107, no. 3 p.571-579dElsevier Inc.x1096-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.08.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01424naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008200167300001600249520054800265592002800813650001500841650001800856650001200874700002800886700001700914773008700931856008401018990002301102852000901125655001201134IND60104058020221121234250.0141107e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010405802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.08.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGan, Yong X.10aThermoelectric effect of silicon nanofibers capped with Bi–Te nanoparticles  ap. 126-129.  aIn this work, silicon single crystal nanofibers were prepared first via self-catalyzed chemical etching.

These RIF/lactose microparticle composites are prepared by dissolving RIF in a liquid solvent and spraying the solution into a high pressure vessel containing supercritical CO₂ and suspended lactose particles. As the CO₂ extracts the liquid solvent, RIF microparticles precipitate to form a microparticle composite mixture with the lactose particles. The effects of solvent, RIF concentration, and RIF to lactose loading are examined. The RIF/lactose microparticle composites are characterized for composition, particle size and surface morphology, crystallinity, thermal behavior, and physicochemical properties. By placing 1000mg of lactose microfine in the vessel and varying the spraying time of 1mg/mL and 5mg/mL RIF in methanol solutions, RIF/lactose microparticle composites of 1.2%, 7.2%, 14.0%, and 25.7% RIF with relative standard deviations of 5.7%, 4.5%, 5.2%, and 2.3%, respectively, are prepared. Based on scanning electron microscopy, homogeneous RIF/lactose composites consisting of spherical particles less than 8μm in diameter are produced. X-ray diffraction reveals that the SAS precipitation of RIF form I from methanol produces a polymorphic mixture of RIF form I and RIF dihydrate, due to trace water content in the solvent, while both RIF and lactose retain their individual crystalline structures during SAS-DEM processing. Based on differential scanning calorimetry RIF dihydrate converts to amorphous RIF upon heating. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrates the absence of chemical interactions between the RIF and lactose proving a physical composite of the two is produced by the SAS-DEM process, and indicating that the therapeutic effectiveness of the drug should be unaffected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abreathing 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical interactions 3acrystal structure 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adrugs 3aheat 3alactose 3amethanol 3amixing 3aparticle size 3aphysicochemical properties 3arifampicin 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3aspraying 3athermal properties 3atuberculosis 3awater content1 aKalombo, Lonji1 aSwai, Hulda1 aGupta, Ram B.0 tPowder technology.g2013 Feb., v. 236 p.132-138dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2012.04.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013500168300001600303520161500319592002801934650001401962650002501976650002502001650001702026650001402043650001802057650001902075650001902094650001702113650002402130700002702154700002402181700002102205700003202226700002302258773010002281856008402381852000902465655001202474IND60101913620221117173015.0141106e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010191362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2012.02.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLa, Young-Hye10aEnhancing water permeability of fouling-resistant POSS–PEGM hydrogels using ‘addition–extraction’ of sacrificial additives  ap. 306-312.  aA POSS derivative containing UV-curable methacrylate groups (methacryl-POSS) was used as a multi-functional cross-linker to form thin and durable hydrogel films with a hydrophilic comonomer, poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGM), in the presence of photoinitiator. The water uptake of the crosslinked POSS–PEGM films was easily controlled from 8% to 90% by manipulating the weight ratio of methacryl-POSS and PEGM from 1:1 to 1:20. Further improvement in the water uptake was demonstrated by adding a sacrificial additive into the prepolymerization mixture of methacryl-POSS and PEGM. The addition of water soluble, non-crosslinkable polyethylene glycol (PEG) into a prepolymerization mixture and subsequent extraction of the PEG additive after UV-curing creates molecular-scale pores within the crosslinked film, resulting in significant increase in water uptake as well as water permeability of the film. The free standing film prepared from the prepolymerization mixture containing 1:20 weight ratio of methacryl-POSS and PEGM with 50wt% PEG additive showed the highest water uptake (280%) and water permeability (130Lμmm⁻²h⁻¹atm⁻¹) among tested samples. PSF UF membranes coated with the highly water permeable, nanoporous POSS–PEGM materials showed excellent anti-fouling efficiency when tested in a cross-flow filtration system using an oil–water emulsion or a bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution as the feed. Molecular dye filtration studies conducted with a relatively dense POSS–PEGM material (MWCO<1kDa) showed the potential of this material as a nanofiltration membrane as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aartificial membranes 3abovine serum albumin 3acrosslinking 3aemulsions 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrophilicity 3ananofiltration 3apermeability 3apolyethylene glycol1 aSooriyakumaran, Ratnam1 aMcCloskey, Bryan D.1 aAllen, Robert D.1 aFreeman, B.

The chip was fabricated by micro-machining technology and consists of eight individual circular sensors with a diameter of 800μm. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis C core antigen (HBcAg) and AFP as the probe molecules were immobilized on different sensing spots on the chip. A solution containing anti-HBsAg and anti-AFP was applied into the reaction chambers in all sensors of the chip, and significant frequency shifts were only observed in the sensors with HBsAg and AFP for immunoassay detection. The fluorescence image further confirmed the successful detection of anti-HBsAg and anti-AFP. The total assay time was less than 2h. The frequency shift-based calibration curves show a detection limit of 0.1ng/ml and a dynamic detection range of 0.1–10,000ng/ml for both anti-HBsAg and anti-AFP, respectively, thus demonstrating that the developed piezoelectric immunoassay chip has potential applications for rapid, specific, sensitive, and multiple detections of HBV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3ahepatitis B antigens 3ahepatitis C 3ahepatitis C antigens 3aimmunoassays 3aviruses1 aMiao, Jianmin1 aWang, Zhihong1 aYu, Ling1 aLi, Chang Ming0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Jan. 28, v. 151, no. 2 p.370-376dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2010.08.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245006500165300001800230520142200248592002801670650002401698650002301722650002301745650001301768650002601781650002101807650001101828650001701839650001301856700001401869700001501883700001301898700001801911700001601929700002001945700001201965773008401977856008502061990002302146852000902169655001202178IND60105816520221119143819.0141108e20131004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010581652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2013.08.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMekap, D.10aLiquid chromatography at critical conditions of polyethylene  ap. 5518-5524.  aOlefin copolymers are of increasing scientific interest due to their important application potential. Liquid chromatography can deliver important information, especially on their molecular structure. In particular, liquid chromatography at critical conditions (LCCC) is of interest because, in this chromatographic mode, the elution is molar mass independent for a given repeat unit. LCCC is conducted at conditions where the entropic effect of size exclusion is equal to the enthalpic effect of interaction between the macromolecules and the stationary phase and can be used to separate copolymers as well as some homopolymers containing one single repeat unit but having different end groups. For the first time, critical conditions for linear PE were experimentally identified by using porous graphite (Hypercarb™) as the stationary phase, and either 1-decanol/ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), 1-decanol/1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB), n-decane/ODCB, or n-decane/TCB as the mobile phase at 160 °C. The identified critical conditions for PE using the above approach in the above solvents have been verified to be correct, barring slight deviations, by two different techniques which were previously used to determine critical conditions for polymers soluble at ambient temperature. The critical conditions for polyethylene were applied to separate statistical copolymers of ethylene/1-octene with similar molar mass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3achemical structure 3acomposite polymers 3agraphene 3aliquid chromatography 3amolecular weight 3aolefin 3apolyethylene 3asolvents1 aMacko, T.1 aBrüll, R.1 aCong, R.1 adeGroot, A.W.1 aParrott, A.1 aCools, P.J.C.H.1 aYau, W.0 tPolymer.g2013 Oct. 4, v. 54, no. 21 p.5518-5524dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2013.08.0403Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01665naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010700170300001800277520050000295592002800795650002300823650002300846650001800869650001000887650001000897650001600907650004400923650002200967700002200989700002301011700002301034700002001057700002401077773009701101856008401198852000901282655001201291IND60109983720221118023512.0141109e20120905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010998372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.06.1282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsaka, Masahiko10aPoronitins A and B, 4-pyrone and 4-pyridone derivatives from the elephant dung fungus Poronia gigantea  ap. 4848-4851.  aNew 4-pyrone and 4-pyridone derivatives, poronitins A (1) and B (2), and a new isocoumarin, 3,4-dihydro-6,8-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-4-methyl-3-methyleneisochromen-1-one (3), were isolated from cultures of the elephant dung fungus, Poronia gigantea.

To our knowledge, we are the first to report the distribution of KRAS and BRAF mutations in Moroccan patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) in order to introduce targeted therapy in the arsenal of therapeutic modalities for management of this cancer in Morocco. In this study, 92 samples obtained from patients with CRC were tested for the presence of the nine most common mutations in the KRAS gene and BRAF gene. Among the tested patients, 76.09% of patients had wt-KRAS genotype and 23.91% were KRAS mutants and the majority of mutations would result in an amino acid substitution of glycine by aspartic acid (68.2%) The predominant mutations are G>A transitions and G>T transversions. Around 5% (5.43%) of the tested patients bore the V600E mutation in BRAF gene. Only one patient showing to have the V600E mutation in BRAF was also mutated-KRAS. Summing up the results about the KRAS and the BRAF mutation carriers from our study, the portion of potentially non responsive patients for the anti-EGFR treatment is 28.26%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid substitution 3aaspartic acid 3acolorectal neoplasms 3agenes 3agenotype 3amutants 3apatients 3atherapeutics 3aMorocco1 aAmrani Hassani Joutei, H.1 aJouali, F.1 aFekkak, J.1 aRhaissi, H.0 tPathologie biologie.g2013 Dec., v. 61, no. 6 p.273-276dElsevier SASx0369-81147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.patbio.2013.05.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009600166300001600262520135100278592002801629650001501657650002301672650002201695650002001717650000901737650000901746650000701755650001601762650001601778650001401794650002301808650001701831650001601848700001901864700001901883773008801902856008101990990002302071852000902094655001202103IND60108662820221119070733.0141108e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010866282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.07.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Ling Ling10aReflectance based optical fibre sensor for ammonium ion using solid-state Riegler's reagent  ap. 614-619.  aA new optical sensor for fast screening of ammonium (NH₄ ⁺) ion was developed based on immobilisation of p-nitrobenzene-diazonium chloride (Riegler's reagent) onto XAD-7 microbeads. In aqueous solution, the diazonium salt is unstable and will spontaneously decompose at room temperature but we have successfully stabilised this compound via immobilisation using physical adsorption to create a solid-state Riegler's reagent for NH₄ ⁺ ion determination with a storage period of one month. The quantification of NH₄ ⁺ ion concentration was possible by using reflectance spectrophotometry method with an optical fibre probe. The solid-state Riegler's reagent based optical sensor yielded a wide linear response range for NH₄ ⁺ ion of 10–60ppm and a fast response time of 2min when compared with many commonly used coloured reagents. The limit of detection (LOD) of the optical NH₄ ⁺ ion sensor was 7.9ppm NH₄ ⁺ ion with optimum response at pH 7. The response of the sensor was reproducible (4.2–5.7% relative standard deviation, n=3) and can be regenerated using buffer pH 1. Except for Fe³⁺ ions, most common ions showed no serious interference. The sensor was also used for the determination of NH₄ ⁺ ion in river water and the results obtained were comparable to those obtained by a standard titrimetric method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aammonium compounds 3aaqueous solutions 3adetection limit 3aions 3airon 3apH 3areflectance 3ariver water 3ascreening 3aspectrophotometers 3astorage time 3atemperature1 aMoussa, Ahmed,1 aLee Yook Heng,0 tSensors and actuators.g2012 Oct., v. 173 p.614-619dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.07.0663Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245007200172300001400244520200900258592002802267650001902295650002002314650001802334650002802352650001202380650002602392650001802418650001402436700002102450700002002471773009402491856008202585990002302667852000902690655001202699IND60105498620221118154958.0141108e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010549862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phrs.2011.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimeone, Timothy A.10aTopiramate modulation of β₁- and β₃-homomeric GABAA receptors  ap. 44-52.  aThe broad spectrum anticonvulsant topiramate modulates multiple voltage-gated and ligand-gated channels, including γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors. Previously, we found a strong β-subunit influence on the effects of topiramate on heteromeric GABAA receptors. Here, we tested the hypothesis that homomeric GABAA receptors comprised of either β₁- or β₃-subunits will contain a functional binding site for topiramate. For comparison, we also examined the effects of pentobarbital and loreclezole which exhibit β-subunit dependence as well. We expressed β₁- and β₃-homomeric receptors in Xenopus laevis oocytes and acquired electrophysiological responses using two-electrode voltage clamp techniques. Oocytes expressing β-homomers were insensitive to GABA and had hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials, decreased input resistances, increased holding currents and picrotoxin-induced outward currents consistent with the expression of non-ligand-mediated, spontaneous channel openings of β-homomers. Similar to picrotoxin, application of topiramate, pentobarbital and loreclezole inhibited β₁-homomers. In contrast, these compounds activated β₃-homomers. As with heteromeric receptors, topiramate and pentobarbital modulation of β₁- and β₃-homomers exhibited rebound currents indicating an open channel block or stabilization of desensitization. Interaction studies suggested competition between topiramate, loreclezole and pentobarbital for activation of β₃-homomers, whereas topiramate inhibitory actions were non-competitive with pentobarbital but competitive with loreclezole. In summary, β₁- and β₃-subunits have binding site(s) for topiramate that elicit functional effects with similarities to heteromeric receptor responses. From this foundation, contributions of residues and other subunits in binary and ternary heteromeric receptors can be explored to gain a complete understanding of topiramate actions on complex heteromeric GABAA receptors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXenopus laevis 3aanticonvulsants 3abinding sites 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aoocytes 3apatch-clamp technique 3apentobarbital 3areceptors1 aWilcox, Karen S.1 aWhite, H.

Being a persistent environmental pollutant, it can accumulate in human tissues via various exposure routes. PFOA may interfere in a toxic fashion on the immune system, liver, development, and endocrine systems. In utero human exposure had been associated with cord serum global DNA hypomethylation. In light of this, we investigated possible PFOA-induced DNA methylation alterations in L02 cells in order to shed light into its epigenetic-mediated mechanisms of toxicity in human liver. L02 cells were exposed to 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100mg/L PFOA for 72h. Global DNA methylation levels were determined by LC/ESI-MS, glutathione-S-transferase Pi (GSTP) gene promoter DNA methylation was investigated by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with bisulfite sequencing, and consequent mRNA expression levels were measured with quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. A dose-related increase of GSTP promoter methylation at the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (SP1) binding site was observed. However, PFOA did not significantly influence global DNA methylation; nor did it markedly alter the promoter gene methylation of p16 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A), ERα (estrogen receptor α) or PRB (progesterone receptor B). In addition, PFOA significantly elevated mRNA transcript levels of DNMT3A (which mediates de novo DNA methylation), Acox (lipid metabolism) and p16 (cell apoptosis). Considering the role of GSTP in detoxification, aberrant methylation may be pivotal in PFOA-mediated toxicity response via the inhibition of SP1 binding to GSTP promoter.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3aglutathione transferase 3aDNA 3agene expression 3atoxicology 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3aapoptosis 3amessenger RNA 3ablood serum 3aestrogen receptors 3ahumans 3apollutants 3aperfluorocarbons 3aimmune system 3atoxicity 3alipid metabolism 3aprogesterone receptors 3aliver 3aDNA methylation 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3abinding sites 3aexposure pathways 0atranscription factors1 aPeng, Siyuan1 aMartin, Francis L.1 aZhang, Jie1 aLiu, Liangpo1 aWang, Zhanlin1 aDong, Sijun1 aShen, Heqing0 tToxicology.g2012 June 14, v. 296, no. 1-3 p.48-55dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0300-483X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2012.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245006900166300001600235520133200251592002801583650002501611650001601636650002201652650001701674650001501691650001401706650001101720650001501731650002801746650001001774773009101784856008401875990002301959852000901982655001201991IND60105422720221120053758.0141108e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010542272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.patbio.2013.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aL., Robert,10aSerum haptoglobin in clinical biochemistry: Change of a paradigm  ap. 277-279.  aSerum haptoglobin (Hp) was discovered by Max Fernand Jayle as a young assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry of the Paris Medical Faculty, headed by Professor Michel Polonovski. Jayle showed that Hp was an acute phase glycoprotein and worked out its routine determination in the blood-serum, based on its complex formation with hemoglobin, using the increased peroxidase activity of the hemoglobin–haptoglobin (Hb–Hp) complex, for routine determination in clinical biochemistry for the characterisation of inflammatory processes, together with other acute phase glycoproteins as orosomucoide. Later Smithies described the genetic control of human Hp-isoforms and quite recently Andersen et al. reported the elucidation of the crystal structure of the porcine Hb–Hp complex. In that article there was no mention of the discovery of Hp, neither of its determination in clinical biochemistry as an inflammatory marker. The only biologically significant role assigned to Hp by Andersen et al. is its (hypothetical) role to prevent or minimize the harmful effects of Hb during intravascular hemolysis, by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and complexing it. This shift of paradigm, not at all exceptional in medical biochemistry, will be described and discussed with its pitfalls and consequences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute phase proteins 3ablood serum 3acrystal structure 3ahaptoglobins 3ahemoglobin 3ahemolysis 3ahumans 3aperoxidase 3areactive oxygen species 3aswine0 tPathologie biologie.g2013 Dec., v. 61, no. 6 p.277-279dElsevier SASx0369-81147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.patbio.2013.07.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01797naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009200165300001800257520058500275592002800860650001100888650002300899650002300922650002300945700002200968700001900990700001901009700001601028700002101044700001801065700002201083700001901105700002201124700001801146700002401164700001801188773009101206856008101297852000901378655001201387IND60109509620221122055914.0141109e20120708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010950962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.04.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkamoto, Iwao10aRedox-responsive conformational alteration of aromatic amides bearing N-quinonyl system  ap. 5346-5355.  aRedox-induced conformational alteration of N-aryl-N-phenylamides, in which the N-aryl group consists of a hydroquinone–p-quinone system, was examined.

In the MALDI mass spectrum, PS with a terminal bromine was not detected but the species with a terminal double bond (U series), and −22 m/z (T series) and +18 m/z (W series) peaks relative to U series appeared as major peaks. While the U species was reported as a result of the elimination reaction of HBr, but the origin and the structure of the other species have not been elucidated. We found that the −22 m/z peak of Uₙ is in fact Tₙ₋₂, which is the adduct of THF and the anion of the Ag salt, TFA⁻ (+186 m/z) to Uₙ₋₂. The +18 m/z peak was confirmed to be the species with a terminal OH.

In this study, a multi-layered microfluidic device was developed and quantified for size-based separation of a heterogeneous population of mouse islets. The device was fabricated using standard soft lithography and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Size-based separation was first demonstrated via injection of a heterogeneous population of glass beads between 50-300 µm in diameter which were separated into five sub-populations based on their diameter. Next, a heterogeneous population of mouse pancreatic islets, between 50-250 µm in diameter was separated into four sub-populations. Throughout this process the islets remained intact without any signs of damage, as indicated by cell viability staining. Islet glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of each sub-population of islets was also evaluated demonstrating that islets smaller than 150 µm have superior stimulation indexes (SI) compared to islets larger than 150 µm. In this study, we found that islets between 100 µm and 150 µm in diameter had the greatest SI value in a heterogeneous population of islets. 3aislets of Langerhans 2aAnimals 2aCell Survival 2aGlassxchemistry 2aGlucosexpharmacology 2aGravitation 2aHumans 2aInsulinxsecretion. 2aIslets of Langerhansxcytologyxdrug effectsxphysiologyxsecretion. 2aMice 2aMicrofluidic Analytical Techniques 2aMicrospheres 2aOrgan Size 2aReproducibility of Results 0aMultilayered microfluidic device 0aParticle separation1 aYong, Wang 1 aHarvat, Tricia 1 aAdewola, Adeola 1 aWang, Shesun 1 aOberholzer, Jose 1 aEddington, David T. 0 tBiomedical microdevices.g2010 Oct., v. 12, no. 5 p.865-874dBoston : Springer USx1387-21767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10544-010-9441-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03339naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245011400167300001800281520194100299650001802240650001102258650003002269650002002299650001302319650001402332650002202346650001802368650001402386650001502400650003202415650002002447650002102467650001302488650001102501653002302512653002802535653003002563653002002593700002102613773009502634852000902729856008502738930003302823946001302856655001202869IND4445382220221121071702.0101119e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444538222DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-010-0548-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFai, Patricia Bi 13aAn assessment of the potential of the microbial assay for risk assessment (MARA) for ecotoxicological testing  ap. 1626-1633.  aRapid microscale toxicity tests make it possible to screen large numbers of compounds and greatly simplify toxicity identification evaluation and other effect directed chemical analyses of effluents or environmental samples. Tests using Vibrio fischeri (such as Microtox®) detect toxicants that cause non-specific narcosis, but are insensitive to other important classes of contaminants. The microbial assay for risk assessment (MARA) is a 24 h multi-species test that seeks to address this problem by using a battery of ten bacteria and a fungus. But there has been little independent evaluation of this test, and there is no published information on its sensitivity to pesticides. Here, we assess the performance of MARA using a range of toxicants including reference chemicals, fungicides and environmental samples. Mean MARA microbial toxic concentrations and IC₂₀s (20% Inhibitory concentrations) indicate the toxicant concentrations affecting the more sensitive micro-organisms, while the mean IC₅₀ (50% Inhibitory concentration) was found to be the concentration that was toxic to most MARA species. For the two fungicides tested, the yeast (Pichia anomalia) was the most sensitive of the ten MARA species, and was more sensitive than the nine other yeasts tested. The test may be particularly valuable for work with fungicides. Mean MARA IC₅₀s were comparable to values for nine other yeast species and the lowest individual IC₅₀s for each toxicant were comparable to reported IC₅₀s for Daphnia magna, Selenastrum capricornutum and Microtox® bioassays. MARA organisms exhibited more variable sensitivities, with the most sensitive organism being different for different samples, enhancing the likelihood of toxicity detection and giving a toxicity “fingerprint” that may help identify toxicants. The test, therefore, has great potential and would be valuable for ecotoxicological testing of pollutants. 3aDaphnia magna 3aPichia 3aSelenastrum capricornutum 3aVibrio fischeri 3abacteria 3abioassays 3achemical analysis 3aecotoxicology 3aeffluents 3afungicides 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3arisk assessment 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3ayeasts 0aBacteria bioassays 0aYeast growth inhibition 0aMicroscale toxicity tests 0aTetrazolium red1 aGrant, Alastair 0 tEcotoxicology.g2010 Nov., v. 19, no. 8 p.1626-1633dBoston : Springer USx0963-92927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-010-0548-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20101119b20101204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02453naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009100129300001400220500002400234520102300258650002101281650001301302650001601315650000901331650001901340650001201359650001601371650001101387650004101398650002701439650002201466650001401488650001101502650001901513650001001532650001101542650005801553650001301611650001001624651001001634651001001644700002201654700002201676700001901698700001601717700002001733700001601753700002301769773012201792852000901914655001201923IND4458339920221121071720.0110522s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445833992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDugo, Giovanni10aCharacterization of Oils from the Fruits, Leaves and Flowers of the Bitter Orange Tree  ap. 45-59.  aIncludes references  aThe bitter orange tree is used to obtain different products: essential oil cold pressed from the peel of the fruit, the neroli distilled from the flowers, the petitgrain distilled from the leaves and twigs, and different other products obtained by solvent extraction or by hydrodistillation.

Their analytical characterization is important for the identification of quality parameters, and considering their commercial value, it is important to determine their composition. This study is meant to determine differences between Italian and Egyptian cold-pressed, neroli and petitgrain oils, and gives useful information on the composition of the essential oil obtained from the whole crushed fruits. The composition of all the samples was studied by different analytical techniques to determine the volatile fraction, the enantiomeric distribution of some volatiles (by GC, GC/ MS and esGC, respectively) and the oxygen heterocyclic fraction by RP-HPLC. 3aCitrus aurantium 3abranches 3acitrus oils 3acold 3aessential oils 3aflowers 3afruit peels 3afruits 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ageographical variation 3ahydrodistillation 3aleaf oils 3aleaves 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aoxygen 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asolvents 3atrees 3aEgypt 3aItaly1 aBonaccorsi, Ivana1 aSciarrone, Danilo1 aCosta, Rosaria1 aDugo, Paola1 aMondello, Luigi1 aSanti, Luca1 aFakhry, Hussein A.0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2011 , v. 23, no. 2 p.45-59dAllured Pub.

To shed light on the patterns and causes of human influences on protected forest ecosystems, comparisons of different study areas regarding land cover dynamics and potential drivers are needed. We analyze the development of land cover since the early 1970s for three protected East African rainforests and their surrounding farmlands and assess the relationship between the observed changes in the context of the protection status of the forests. Processing of Landsat satellite imagery of eight or seven time steps in regular intervals results in 12 land cover classes for the Kakamega-Nandi forests (Kenya) and Budongo Forest (Uganda) whereas ten are distinguished for Mabira Forest (Uganda). The overall classification accuracy assessed for the year 2001 or 2003 is similarly high for all three study areas (81% to 85%). The time series reveal that, despite their protection status, Kakamega-Nandi forests and Mabira Forest experienced major forest decrease, the first a continuous forest loss of 31% between 1972/1973 and 2001, the latter an abrupt loss of 24% in the late 1970s/early 1980s. For both forests, the temporally dense time series show short-term fluctuations in forest classes (e.g., areas of forest regrowth since the 1980s or exotic secondary bushland species from the 1990s onwards). Although selectively logged, Budongo Forest shows a much more stable forest cover extent. A visual overlay with population distribution for all three regions clearly indicates a relationship between forest loss and areas of high population density, suggesting population pressure as a main driver of deforestation. The revealed forest losses due to local and commercial exploitation further demonstrate that weak management impedes effective forest protection in East Africa. 3aLandsat 3abiodiversity 3adeforestation 3aforest ecosystems 3ahumans 3aland cover 3aland use 3alogging 3apopulation density 3apopulation distribution 3arain forests 3areforestation 3aremote sensing 3ashrublands 3atime series analysis 3atropical forests 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeography 2aTrees 2aTropical Climate 3aKenya 3aUganda 0aAfrica, Eastern 0aBudongo Forest 0aForest protection 0aKakamega-Nandi forests 0aLand cover change analysis 0aMabira Forest1 aSchaab, Gertrud 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 Feb., v. 161, no. 1-4 p.531-548dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0766-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20100108b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02792naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245012500179300001600304520079500320650001101115650001301126650001201139650002301151650001001174650001201184650001301196650001101209650001101220650001301231650000901244650000901253650001401262650001201276650001101288650001101299650001201310650000901322650000901331650002501340650001201365650002401377650002201401650002401423650002501447650002301472650002501495650001401520650002101534650002101555650002301576650001101599650002301610650002101633651001301654653002001667700001801687700002401705700002401729700001601753700001701769773013401786852000901920856008501929930003302014946001102047655001202058IND4430997020221121050724.0100108e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443099702DNAL7 a191844792pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-008-0741-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes, I. 10aEuropean bee-eater (Merops apiaster) populations under arsenic and metal stress: evaluation of exposure at a mining site  ap. 237-245.  aTwo populations of the European bee-eater were studied, one living at a reference site and the other at a metal mining site.

Cadmium, chromium, mercury, nickel, and lead were at least twofold higher in feathers of birds from the contaminated site than in the reference site, suggesting that this population was exposed to higher metal levels. Similarly, levels of aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, iron, and lead were also at least twofold higher in pellets from the contaminated area.

This study was designed to verify the antihypertensive and hypolipidemic effects of A americana as physiological actions. In male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) fed a diet containing 5% Apios powder for 3 weeks, blood pressure was lowered by 10%, and plasma triacylglycerol, and hepatic total cholesterol were decreased. In a diet with additional 1% cholesterol, ingestion of A americana decreased blood pressure and showed a tendency to decrease plasma total cholesterol in SHR. At 0.5 and 1 hours after a single oral administration of water extract of Apios at 200 mg/kg, which was rich in proline, blood pressure was lowered by 10% in male SHR. Therefore, it was expected that proline-rich peptide, which was derived from protein of A americana during digestion, contributed to the antihypertensive action. It is suggested that A americana is a healthy food material for prevention of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. 3aindigenous species 3aApios americana 3acultivars 3aperennials 3alegumes 3anutritive value 3aantihypertensive effect 3acholesteremic effect 3arats 3aanimal disease models 3anutrient intake 3acholesterol metabolism 3adiastolic blood pressure 3asystolic blood pressure 3ablood lipids 3atriacylglycerols 3atubers 3aplant extracts 3ahealth promotion 3aFlorida 3aTexas 3aJapan1 aMatsue, H.0 tNutrition research.g2007 Apr., v. 27, no. 4 p. 218-224dElsevier Science Incx0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2007.01.0123Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070525b20070602c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/05/25  aOther US 7aarticle03243naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184100001900193245011500212300001600327500002400343520166000367650000902027650002302036650002002059650001702079650002502096650001702121650003102138650002502169650002702194650001702221650001602238650002802254650002902282650002002311650001802331700002002349700002402369700002402393700001702417773009802434852000902532856008902541930003302630945002502663946001302688655001202701IND4390684820140723000000.0070427e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439068482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2007.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ101 0aQ501 0aT300 0aT200 0aX3801 aGonçalves, S.10aMilk enriched with phytosterols reduces plasma cholesterol levels in healthy and hypercholesterolemic subjects  ap. 200-205.  aIncludes references  aThe consumption of plant sterols has been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of cholesterol without adverse effects in human subjects. To evaluate if milk would be a good vehicle for phytosterols to lower plasma levels of cholesterol, we performed a randomized blind study with healthy subjects (n = 22) and hypercholesterolemic patients (n = 19), both groups treated with phytosterol-enriched milk (2 g/d). Another hypercholesterolemic group (n = 15) was used as a control group. Lipid profile and biochemical, hematologic, and hemorheological parameters were determined at the beginning and after 15 and 30 days of milk beverage intake. After 15 days of treatment, healthy individuals showed lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels, by 8.31% (P = .05) and 11% (P < .05), respectively. After 30 days of the trial, these values did not change significantly. Hypercholesterolemic patients treated with phytosterol-enriched milk demonstrated significantly diminished levels of total cholesterol and LDL-C concentrations, by 9.62% (P < .05) and 12.20 % (P < .05), respectively. After 30 days, an increase in the total cholesterol and LDL-C levels was observed for hypercholesterolemic subjects, 6.69% (P < .05) and 8.68% (P < .05), respectively. In the hypercholesterolemic control subjects, no difference was found between plasma levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and LDL-C. Only healthy subjects showed significant changes during the intake of phytosterol-enriched milk. The results obtained indicate that phytosterol-enriched milk is a good vehicle for reducing plasma cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic subjects. 3amilk 3afood fortification 3afortified foods 3aphytosterols 3acholesteremic effect 3ahealth foods 3arandomized clinical trials 3ahypercholesterolemia 3acholesterol metabolism 3ablood lipids 3acholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ablood viscosity 3areticulocytes1 aVasco Maria, A.1 aSilva-Herdade, A.S.1 aMartins e Silva, J.1 aSaldanha, C.0 tNutrition research.g2007 Apr., v. 27, no. 4 p.200-205dElsevier Science Incx0271-53177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2007.03.0033Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070525b20070602c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/05/25  aOther US 7aarticle03305naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072000900157072000900166072000900175100001900184245013800203300001400341500002400355520150000379650002301879650001601902650002001918650001101938650002201949650001601971650001601987650002002003650001802023650001402041650002902055650001602084650001202100650005502112650005302167650004202220650001502262650002802277650003302305650003502338650004102373651001002414700001502424700001902439773011502458852000902573856006202582930003302644945002502677946001302702655001202715IND4390671920140723000000.0070427e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439067192DNAL7 a174279352pmid7 a10.1002/arch.201722doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL600 0aL0011 aSan Andres, V.10aEffects of gamma-irradiation on midgut proteolytic activity of the mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae)  ap. 11-19.  aIncludes references  aThe Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), is a key pest of citrus in Spain because of significant yield losses and to quarantine restrictions. Biologically based control methods, such as the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), which relies on the sterilization by irradiation of large numbers of insects, is gaining an increasing role in the control of medfly in Mediterranean areas. However, gamma-irradiation might damage the midgut epithelium cells, causing a lowering of nutritive assimilation that can negatively affect adult performance. Irradiation effects on digestive physiology are well established for a number of insect pests, but there is no information on medfly. Our aim was to determine the effects of gamma-irradiation on C. capitata digestive protease activity. Both larvae and adults were found to use a similar proteolytic system based on aspartyl-, trypsin-, chymotrypsin-, amino peptidase-, and carboxypeptidase A- and B-like activities. Pupae of the Vienna-7 (tsl) strain were irradiated at 70 or 140 Gy, two days before emergence, and the adults fed during 5 days on sugar-protein (4:1) diets. Protease activity was measured in midgut extracts and compared with males non-irradiated reared in the same conditions. The results showed that the irradiation doses tested had no effect on the digestive proteolytic activities of medfly adults. Moreover, the longevity of irradiated medflies at the highest dose (140 Gy) was similar to that of controls. 3aCeratitis capitata 3airradiation 3agamma radiation 3amidgut 3adigestive enzymes 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3aenzyme activity 3adose response 3alongevity 3asterile insect technique 3afruit flies 2aAnimals 2aCeratitis capitataxenzymologyxradiation effects. 2aDigestive Systemxenzymologyxradiation effects. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Radiation 2aGamma Rays 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aLongevityxradiation effects 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aPupaxenzymologyxradiation effects. 0aSpain1 aOrtego, F.1 aCastañera, P.0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2007 May, v. 65, no. 1 p.11-19dAlan R.

In general, it was found that a cultivation temperature of 37 °C proved optimal for both growth and β-galactosidase production by the test organism. Although the growth of the test organism was the highest in the culture with pH controlled at 4.5-6.5, the culture with pH controlled at 6.5 resulted in the highest production of β-galactosidase. Further, agitation at 100 rpm or more was found to enhance both the growth and production of β-galactosidase. Fermentation conducted in a jar fermenter having the pH of the culture medium, the cultivation temperature, and the agitation speed controlled at 6.5, 37 °C, and 100 rpm, respectively, a maximum β-galactosidase activity of 36.7 U/ml and a maximum transgalactosylation activity of 0.49 U/ml was achieved in 10 h of fermentation.

Lesions associated with simian agent 8 infections usually involve the genitalia of sexually mature baboons. In females, secondary bacterial infections may lead to scarring of the vulva and perineum, with resulting vaginal obstruction. Affected baboons are poor breeders and often develop urinary tract infections due to retention of urine in the vagina. Reconstructive vaginal surgery was performed on seven baboons with vaginal obstruction. Four weeks before surgery, 50 mg of Depo-Provera was administered intramuscularly to each animal to arrest the estrous cycle, reduce swelling, and allow adequate surgical exposure of the vagina. Ventral and circular incisions were made around the constricted vagina. The peripheral skin was excised to break down the underlying connective tissue, allowing access to the vaginal mucosa. Healthy vaginal tissue was then opposed to the incised skin edges with 3-0 Vicryl in an interrupted pattern. Once healed, the vaginas remained patent, allowing normal mating and urination. Nine months after surgery, five baboons had healthy infants, and pregnancy was confirmed in the other two animals. The described procedure may allow female baboons previously infertile and at risk of urinary tract infections to be returned to a healthy reproductive state. 3aPapio 3aHerpesviridae 3avagina 3asurgery 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aHerpesviridae Infectionsxcomplicationsxveterinary. 2aHerpesvirus 1, Cercopithecine 2aMonkey Diseasesxpathologyxsurgery. 2aPapio 2aPerineumxpathology 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Outcome 2aSurgery, Veterinary 2aUrethraxpathology 2aVaginaxpathologyxsurgery. 2aVaginal Diseasesxcomplicationsxsurgeryxveterinary. 0astenosis 0aalphaherpes virus1 aSmikle, C.B.1 aHankins, G.D.V.1 aHubbard, G.B.1 aEhler, W.J.1 aBrasky, K.B.0 tComparative medicine.g1995 Dec., v. 45, no. 6 p.628-630x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03514naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100001900178245015000197300001800347500002400365506007600389520152200465506003701987650001902024650001702043650001302060650001302073650001102086650001202097650001202109650004002121650002902161650004802190650000902238650003302247650002702280650004002307650002102347650006502368650003702433650001202470650001102482650001102493650001602504650003702520650001902557650001702576650003402593700002002627700002002647700002002667700002302687773010402710852000902814856007702823655001202900IND4458433920221207135226.0110527s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445843392DNAL7 a215158392pmid7 aPMC31143502pmcid7 a10.2337/dc10-24562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHummel, Sandra10aPrimary Dietary Intervention Study to Reduce the Risk of Islet Autoimmunity in Children at Increased Risk for Type 1 Diabetes: The BABYDIET study  ap. 1301-1305.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To determine whether delaying the introduction of gluten in infants with a genetic risk of islet autoimmunity is feasible, safe, and may reduce the risk of type 1 diabetes-associated islet autoimmunity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 150 infants with a first-degree family history of type 1 diabetes and a risk HLA genotype were randomly assigned to a first gluten exposure at age 6 months (control group) or 12 months (late-exposure group) and were followed 3 monthly until the age of 3 years and yearly thereafter for safety (for growth and autoantibodies to transglutaminase C [TGCAs]), islet autoantibodies to insulin, GAD, insulinoma-associated protein 2, and type 1 diabetes. RESULTS: Adherence to the dietary-intervention protocol was reported from 70% of families. During the first 3 years, weight and height were similar in children in the control and late-exposure groups, as was the probability of developing TGCAs (14 vs. 4%; P = 0.1). Eleven children in the control group and 13 children in the late-exposure group developed islet autoantibodies (3-year risk: 12 vs. 13%; P = 0.6). Seven children developed diabetes, including four in the late-exposure group. No significant differences were observed when children were analyzed as per protocol on the basis of the reported first gluten exposure of the children. CONCLUSIONS: Delaying gluten exposure until the age of 12 months is safe but does not substantially reduce the risk for islet autoimmunity in genetically at-risk children.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautoantibodies 3aautoimmunity 3achildren 3agenotype 3agluten 3ainfants 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutritional intervention 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3arisk 2aAutoantibodiesxbiosynthesis 2aAutoimmunityxgenetics 2aCeliac Diseasexetiologyxgenetics. 2aChild, Preschool 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xdiet therapyxetiologyxgenetics. 2aGTP-Binding Proteinsximmunology 2aGlutens 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Food 2aIslets of Langerhansximmunology 2aPilot Projects 2aRisk Factors 2aTransglutaminasesximmunology1 aPflüger, Maren1 aHummel, Michael1 aBonifacio, Ezio1 aZiegler, Anette-G.0 tDiabetes care.g2011 June, v. 34, no. 6 p.1301-1305dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc10-24563Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01935naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002700133245004200160300001600202500002300218520071100241650001000952650001400962650002000976650001700996650002301013650001401036650000901050650001401059650003301073650004001106650001801146650001101164650002601175650001601201650003401217653001901251653002901270700001901299773009601318852000901414939003301423945000801456946001301464655001201477991608647380742620221120124913.0841002e198403  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840056042DNAL7 a63647772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeissler, Catherine A.14aThe Nutritional effects of tooth loss  ap. 478-489.  aLiterature review.  aExtract: In view of the high prevalence of edentulousness in developed countries, the evidence is reviewed for the effects of tooth loss on nutrition and health in the following categories of effects: mortality; food choice and nutrient intake; gastrointestinal irritation; digestion and nutrient absorption; nutritional status. The evidence indicates reduced consumption of meat, fresh fruit, and vegetables, and total energy resulting in lower Hb and vitamin C levels, increased gastrointestinal irritation and increased mortality from choking but no striking differences in digestion or nutritional status. However, most studies are not carefully controlled for other social and health factors.

Bone mass is affected more by genetics, muscular activity, age, sex, race and hormonal state than by nutritional deficiencies. Other less important variables include use of medication, smoking, sun exposure, and exercise. Relevant topics discussed are: calcium metabolism; the cycle of bone remodelling and skeletal mineral reverses; accumulation and loss of bone with age; and dietary risk factors (calcium, vitamin D, phosphate, protein, calories, sodium, fluoride, ascorbic acid and trace elements). There is little epidemiological evidence of any nutrient deficiency related to bone fractures except for calcium.

Extensive clinical and non-clinical uses of this class of antibiotic over the years have combined to select for a large number of resistant determinants, collectively termed the tetracycline resistome. In order to impart resistance, microbes use different molecular mechanisms including target protection, active efflux, and enzymatic degradation. A deeper understanding of the structure, mechanism, and regulation of the genes and proteins associated with tetracycline resistance will contribute to the development of tetracycline derivatives that overcome resistance. Newer generations of tetracyclines derived from engineering of biosynthetic genetic programs, semi-synthesis, and in particular recent developments in their chemical synthesis, together with a growing understanding of resistance, will serve to retain this class of antibiotic to combat pathogens. 3abioprocess engineering 3agenes 3amicroorganisms 3apathogens 3aproteins 3asynthesis 3atetracycline1 aSpanogiannopoulos, Peter 1 aWright, Gerard D. 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2010 Feb., v. 67, no. 3 p.419-431dBasel : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-009-0172-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100108b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01963naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001600144245010400160300001600264500002400280520089000304650001501194650001501209650001301224650001401237650001501251650001401266650002301280650002301303650002201326650001201348650001401360650003201374700002001406773007001426852000901496856008401505655001201589IND4458340520221120085910.0110522s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445834052DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM-07-10-01012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Tai-Ti10aEffects of an Industrial Milling Process on Change of Headspace Volatiles in Yihchuan Aromatic Rice  ap. 137-141.  aIncludes references  aHeadspace volatiles of Yihchuan aromatic rice, a japonica rice cultivar, were extracted by a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) method and analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Effects of fiber types and an industrial milling process on the change of headspace volatiles were studied. Of the fiber types, divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS), polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB), and carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS) were suggested for use in the analysis headspace volatiles in terms of absorption or adsorption ability. Regarding the milling effect, the amount of total headspace volatiles from brown rice to white rice decreased ≈30%, and that of aldehydes and alcohols, the two largest groups of volatiles, decreased ≈20 and 15%, respectively. Comparatively, rice bran contained higher amounts of total headspace volatiles than milled rice grains. 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3abrown rice 3acultivars 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3amass spectrometry 3amilling 3arice bran 3asolid phase microextraction1 aYang, Tsung-Shi0 tCereal chemistry.g2011 , v. 88, no. 2 p.137-141x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM-07-10-01013Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02281naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245013500146300001400281520093300295650000901228650003001237650001301267650001501280650002101295650001501316650001901331650002301350650001501373650001201388650003801400650004001438650003401478650001301512650000901525650003301534650000901567650003701576650003501613650001701648700001501665773007601680852000901756939003301765946001301798655001201811IND9203723620221120085900.0920611e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920372362DNAL7 a18495932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJauchem, J.R.10aCardiovascular changes in unanesthetized and ketamine-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to 2.8-GHz radiofrequency radiation  ap. 70-75.  aSprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 2.8-GHz radiofrequency radiation, first while unanesthetized and then while anesthetized with ketamine (150 mg/kg, I.M.). Irradiation at a power density of 60 mW/cm2 (whole-body average specific absorption rate of approximately 14 W/kg) was conducted for sufficient duration to increase colonic temperature from 38.5 to 39.5 degrees C. The time required for the temperature increase was significantly longer in the anesthetized state. During irradition, heart rate increased significantly both with and without anesthesia, while mean arterial blood pressure increased only when the rats were unanesthetized. The heart rate increase in the anesthetized state contrasts with a lack of change in a previous study of Fischer rats. This difference between anesthetized Sprague-Dawley and Fischer rats should be considered when comparing cardiovascular data obtained from these two strains of rats. 3arats 3aelectromagnetic radiation 3aketamine 3aanesthesia 3abody temperature 3aheart rate 3ablood pressure 3astrain differences 2aAnesthesia 2aAnimals 2aBlood Pressurexradiation effects 2aBody Temperaturexradiation effects 2aHeart Ratexradiation effects 2aKetamine 2aMale 2aRadio Wavesxadverse effects 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strainsxphysiology 2aRespirationxradiation effects 2aTime Factors1 aFrei, M.R.0 tComparative medicine.g1991 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.70-75x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02876naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002100128245017400149300001800323520125500341650002001596650001401616650001701630650001201647650001301659650001701672650001501689650001001704650001601714650002301730650005001753650006301803650001901866650004701885650002901932650001301961650002501974650001001999650002802009650002702037650003002064650003502094650003502129700002102164773010702185852000902292930003302301945001302334946001102347655001202358IND2053070920221120063157.0960917e199605  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205307092DNAL7 a87390472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSreenagesh, M.V.10aLight- and cytokinin-induced changes in the levels of leucine and tyrosine isoaccepting tRNA species and modified nucleotide contents of total tRNA in cucumber seedlings  ap. 1255-1264.  aWe have determined relative levels of chloroplast leucine and tyrosine isoaccepting tRNAs and modified nucleotide contents from total tRNAs isolated from dark-grown, light-grown, N6-isopentenyladenine (i.6A)-treated dark-grown and i.6A-treated light-grown cucumber seedlings.

On the other hand, i.6A-treated light-grown seedlings tRNA(Tyr1) increased to 85% of total tRNAs(Tyr) from about 9% in light-grown seedlings and tRNA(Tyr2) decreased to 15% compared with 91% in light-grown seedlings. Analysis of modified nucleotide of total tRNAs indicated that pT, pI, pm1A, pm5C, pGm, pm1G, pm2G and pm7G contents were significantly higher in the total tRNA of i.6A-treated dark-grown seedlings than those from untreated dark-grown seedlings. Illumination of 8-day-old dark-grown seedlings for 12 h increased the contents of pT, pI, pGm and pm1G when compared to 8-day-old dark-grown seedlings with extended growth for 12 h in dark. On the contrary, i.6A had no stimulatory effect in the contents of modified nucleotide in the light-grown seedlings. 3aCucumis sativus 3aseedlings 3achloroplasts 3aleucine 3atyrosine 3atransfer RNA 3acytokinins 3alight 3anucleotides 3aisopentenyladenine 2aAdeninexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aChloroplastsxdrug effectsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aChromatography 2aCucumis sativusxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCytokininsxpharmacology 2aDarkness 2aIsopentenyladenosine 2aLight 2aNucleotidesxmetabolism 2aRNA, Plantxmetabolism 2aRNA, Transferxmetabolism 2aRNA, Transfer, Leuxmetabolism 2aRNA, Transfer, Tyrxmetabolism1 aJayabaskaran, C.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1996 May, v. 38, no. 6 p.1255-1264x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02227naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245013000147300001600277500001500293520065900308650001900967650002500986650002501011650001001036650002501046650001201071650002401083650001801107650002301125650003301148650001701181650002201198650002501220650002801245650003001273650002701303650003401330650003501364650001001399653002801409653001601437653001401453700001501467700001701482700001401499773010601513852000901619930003301628945001301661946001101674655001201685IND2048710420221120054103.0951113e199510  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204871042DNAL7 a85953792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThygesen, P.W.14aThe isolation and characterisation of a gene encoding superoxide dismutase from Bradyrhizobium sp.

A 500 bp sod-homologous sequence was amplified from genomic DNA of strain ANU289 using PCR. A 1.3 kb SalI fragment was subsequently cloned which contained an ORF, sodA, encoding a 23 Kd protein. This putative SOD shares considerable homology with other Mn-SODs and analysis of the sodA sequence predicts that it is expressed. A lacZ-sodA fusion complemented the SOD-deficiency of E. coli QC779 and resulted in the expression of SOD activity in both mutant and wild type E. coli. We conclude that sodA encodes the Mn-SOD of strain ANU289. 3aBradyrhizobium 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aamino acid sequences 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3astrains 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aGenetic Code 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aIsoenzymesxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRhizobiaceaexgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexgenetics 2aTrees 0amolecular sequence data 0aembl/031572 0aisolation1 aWhelan, J.1 aMorell, M.K.1 aDay, D.A.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1995 Oct., v. 37, no. 3 p.401-412x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19951204b19951207c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03110naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245012300123300001600246500002400262520151900286650002001805650002201825650001701847650001701864650001701881650001001898650001501908650001001923650001101933650001201944650001301956650001201969650001301981650002501994650001302019650002302032650003502055650001302090650001502103650001402118650001002132650001102142650002502153650001102178650002202189650001702211650002402228650002202252650001702274650001702291650000802308651001002316700001602326700001702342700001702359700001802376773008102394852000902475655001202484IND4458370920221120041949.0110527s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445837092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, R.10aCan agroforestry be a resource conservation tool to maintain soil health in the fragile ecosystem of north-east India?  ap. 191-196.  aIncludes references  aIn the north-eastern regions of India, shifting cultivation is traditional and a dominant land use practice, leading to heavy soil erosion and severe degradation of biodiversity. Agroforestry systems (AFS), which have great potential for crop and livestock production, are the best alternative to overcome the adverse effects of shifting cultivation. Agroforestry is an ecologically based, natural resource management system that sustains production and benefits all those who use the land by integrating trees on farms and in the agricultural landscape. In addition to timber, fodder, fuelwood, medicines, etc, it conserves natural resources. In this paper, the authors discuss the role of promising agroforestry systems and various multipurpose trees (MPTs) in the conservation of natural resources. These systems improved soil physical health through checking soil erosion and run-off, maintained soil organic matter, enhanced soil chemical and biological properties, added nitrogen input by trees and shrubs, and helped in the mining of minerals from lower horizons by roots and their recycling through litter fall on the ground. Of the systems studied, multistoreyed AFS [alder + tea + black pepper + annual agricultural crops], silvi-horti-pastoral [alder + pineapple + fodder grasses] and natural forest systems with suitable soil conservation measures are the most viable alternatives for natural resource management and could sustain long-term soil productivity in the highly degraded soil of this region. 3aadverse effects 3aagricultural land 3aagroforestry 3abiodiversity 3ablack pepper 3acrops 3aecosystems 3afarms 3aforage 3aforests 3afuelwood 3agrasses 3aland use 3alivestock production 3aminerals 3amultipurpose trees 3anatural resources conservation 3anitrogen 3apineapples 3arecycling 3aroots 3arunoff 3ashifting cultivation 3ashrubs 3asoil conservation 3asoil erosion 3asoil organic matter 3asoil productivity 3asoil quality 3asoil texture 3atea 3aIndia1 aGhosh, P.K.1 aMishra, V.K.1 aMajumdar, B.1 aTomar, J.M.S.0 tOutlook on agriculture.g2010 Sept., v. 39, no. 3 p.191-196x0030-72707nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04032naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245014600145300001600291520219900307650002402506650002002530650002002550650001602570650001202586650004302598650001602641650005202657650002802709650001902737650002702756650006002783650002802843650002902871650000902900650003102909650000902940650002502949650003902974650003003013650006003043700001403103700001303117700001403130700002003144700001703164700001603181700001403197700001303211700001403224700002003238773010603258852000903364930003303373945001303406946001103419655001203430IND2059143720221120042018.0970825e199706  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205914372DNAL7 a92385202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathur, P.P.10aDifferential expression of multiple cathepsin mRNAs in the rat testis during maturation and following lonidamine induced tissue restructuring  ap. 217-233.  aIn the seminiferous epithelium, germ cell development behind the blood-testis barrier involves continual degradation and renewal of inter-testicular cell junctions. This allows: (i) the translocation of developing germ cells the from the basal lamina to the adluminal compartment during spermatogenesis, and (ii) the eventual release of mature spermatids into the tubular lumen during spermiation. Throughout spermatogenesis, cellular debris must also be removed from the epithelium. Thus, it is conceivable that proteases, protease inhibitors, and cell junctional components are involved in these events. The present study sought to examine whether testicular cells can express multiple cathepsin mRNAs given that these proteases are involved in the degradation and processing of proteins as well as in tissue regeneration. By using total RNA isolated from primary cultures of Sertoli, Leydig, and germ cells for reverse-transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the mRNAs of cathepsin B, C, D, H, L, and S were shown to be expressed by Sertoli and Leydig cells, whereas germ cells isolated from adult rats expressed all of the above cathepsin mRNAs except cathepsin D. Throughout postnatal development and maturation, the testicular staedy-state mRNA levels of cathepsin B, C, D, L, and S remain relatively unchanged with the exception of cathepsin H whose mRNA level increased during maturation and peaked at 45-60 of age. Using lonidamine, an anti-spermatogenic drug which is known to induce premature release of germ cells without affecting Leydig cell function by disrupting the inter-Sertoli-germ cell junctions, we have examined the differential expression of these cathepsin mRNAs in the testis at the time of extensive tissue restructuring. It was noted that the expression of cathepsin L and S in the testis increased significantly concomitant with the disappearance of elongate spermatids whereas the expression of cathepsin B, C, D, and H increased significantly when most of the round spermatids and spermatocytes were depleted. These results illustrate the intricate inter-relationship between these proteases in the testis during maturation and tissue restructuring. 3aanimal reproduction 3aanimal genetics 3aanimal breeding 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aAntispermatogenic Agentsxpharmacology 2aCathepsin L 2aCathepsinsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCysteine Endopeptidases 2aEndopeptidases 2aEpitheliumxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxdrug effects 2aIndazolesxpharmacology 2aLeydig Cellsxmetabolism 2aMale 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSeminiferous Tubulesxdrug effects 2aSertoli Cellsxmetabolism 2aTestisxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aGrima, J.1 aMo, M.Y.1 aZhu, L.J.1 aAravindan, G.R.1 aCalcagno, K.1 aO'Bryan, M.1 aChung, S.1 aMruk, D.1 aLee, W.M.1 aSilvestrini, B.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1997 June, v. 42, no. 2 p.217-233x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02469naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245007200144300001600216520102300232650001601255650001201271650002501283650002401308650004301332650003301375650001101408650003601419650002901455650002601484650002601510650000901536650002901545650006001574650002401634650003701658650002801695650003201723700002301755700002001778700001701798773010601815852000901921930003301930945001301963946001101976655001201987IND2059380820221120041953.0970904e199704  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205938082DNAL7 a91119342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordoba, M.10aIntracellular calcium variation in heparin-capacitated bovine sperm  ap. 725-733.  aThis report investigates the mechanisms by which heparin induces capacitation of sperm. Capacitation was determined with chlortetracycline and intracellular calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i., with FURA 2-AM. After 15 minutes incubation with heparin, [Ca2+]i was increased 60% over basal, reaching a plateau thereafter. Sixty percent of calcium entry was inhibited by methoxy-verapamil, suggesting that activation of voltage dependent calcium channels (VDCC) may be involved in the process. A significant correlation (R2 =0.88, p<0.006) was found between the percentage of capacitated spermatozoa and the [Ca2+]i increase. The effects of heparin on both processes were blocked by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors staurosporine (100%) and GF-109203x (90%). It is concluded that heparin may induce sperm capacitation and calcium influx mainly through VDCC (approx. 60%), and also through other membrane systems (40%). Both systems of calcium entry as well as the capacitation process appear to involve on PKC activity. 3aspermatozoa 2aAnimals 2aBiological Transport 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCalcium Channel Blockersxpharmacology 2aCalcium Channelsxphysiology 2aCattle 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aGallopamilxpharmacology 2aHeparinxpharmacology 2aIndolesxpharmacology 2aMale 2aMaleimidesxpharmacology 2aProtein Kinase Cxantagonists & inhibitorsxphysiology. 2aSignal Transduction 2aSperm Capacitationxdrug effects 2aSpermatozoaxmetabolism 2aStaurosporinexpharmacology1 aSanta-Coloma, T.A.1 aBeorlegui, N.B.1 aBeconi, M.T.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1997 Apr., v. 41, no. 4 p.725-733x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02155naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245007500145300001600220500001500236520068800251650001100939650002100950650002100971650002200992650002201014650000701036650002001043650001301063650002801076650001901104650002401123650004601147650003101193650004101224650001301265650003301278650003901311650003301350650004801383653001401431700001701445700001501462773010601477852000901583930003301592945001301625946001101638655001201649IND2045921220221120041902.0950505e199504  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204592122DNAL7 a76271312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTobias, R.B.10aPolygalacturonase produced in apple tissue decayed by Botrytis cinerea  ap. 813-823.  a2019-12-05  aAn exo-polygalacturonase with an isoelectric point of 4.6 and an apparent molecular weight of 45 kDa was isolated from apple tissue decayed by Botrytis cinerea.

The enzyme produced in the decayed tissue was less sensitive to lower pH and less inhibited by CaCl2, MgCl2, or NaCl than the enzyme produced in culture. Such changes in the properties of the enzyme produced in infected tissue could have been essential for the pathogen's successful colonization of the host tissue.

Expression of the mRNA represented by the cDNA clone pSR12 has previously been shown to be transcriptionally activated by ethylene specifically in senescing flowers. We report in this paper the structural analysis of this cDNA and its corresponding gene. One cloned genomic DNA fragment, SR12-B, contained the entire transcription unit in 17 exons, interrupted by 16 introns. A second gene, SR12-A, was highly homologous to SR12-B with several nucleotide substitutions and a 489 bp deletion in the 5' flanking DNA sequence. The SR12 transcript has an open reading frame of 2193 bp sufficient to encode a protein of 82.8 kDa. No significant homology at the DNA or protein levels was found with other known genes. We have identified a DNA-binding factor which specifically interacts with two upstream fragments (-149 to -337 and -688 to -1055) of SR12-B. Both fragments apparently compete for the same binding factor. The DNA-binding activity was present in nuclear extracts from both presenescent and senescing carnation petals. The upstream DNA fragments that bind this factor have sequence homology with promoter sequences of other ethylene-regulated genes. 3aethylene 3amessenger RNA 3arestriction mapping 3acorolla 3aDNA 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aDianthus caryophyllus 3aexons 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aintrons 3apromoter regions 2aAgingxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNAxisolation & purification 2aEthylenes 2aExons 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGenomic Library 2aIntrons 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aOligonucleotides 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSingle-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases 0acloning 0agenes 0addbj/x57171 0aembl/x57171 0acdna 0amolecular sequence data 0asenescence 0agenetic regulation 0agenbank/x57171 0asr12 gene 0anucleotide sequences1 aLawton, K.A.1 aGoldsbrough, P.B.1 aWoodson, W.R.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1991 July, v. 17, no. 1 p.61-71x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02255naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245011300143300001400256500001500270520080300285650002701088650003601115650002001151650001001171650002001181650002001201650002201221650002101243650002301264650003101287650008501318650002001403650001301423650003501436650002801471653001701499653001201516700001501528700001501543700001401558700001701572700001401589700001401603773007901617852000901696939003301705946001101738655001201749IND9103739420221120033549.0910924e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910373942DNAL7 a18682242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCretin, C.10aProduction in Escherichia coli of active Sorghum phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase which can be phosphorylated  ap. 83-88.  a2019-12-04  aPhosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC)-deficient mutants of Escherichia coli have been complemented with a plasmid bearing a full-length cDNA encoding the C4-type form of Sorghum leaf PEPC.

The transcription of this gene is regulated by nitrate as well as a variety of other environmental and developmental factors. Genomic clones containing the entire nitrite reductase gene have been isolated from a spinach genomic library and sequenced. The sequence is identical in the transcribed region to a previously isolated spinach NiR cDNA clone (Back et al., 1988) except for the presence of three introns. The analysis of the genomic clones and DNA blot hybridization demonstrates that there is a single NiR gene per haploid genome in spinach. This is in contrast to what has been found for other plant species. The transcription initiation site has been determined by S1 mapping and the 5' upstream region has been used to regulate the GUS reporter gene in transgenic tobacco plants. This gene was found to be regulated by the addition of nitrate in the transgenic plants. 3agenetic transformation 3agenetically modified organisms 3arestriction mapping 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3areporter genes 3apromoter regions 3abeta-glucuronidase 3anitrates 3anitrite reductase 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGenomic Library 2aGlucuronidasexgenetics 2aHaploidy 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNitratesxmetabolism 2aNitrite Reductasesxgenetics 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRestriction Mapping 2aRhizobiumxgenetics 2aSingle-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTransformation, Genetic 0acloning 0agenes 0agenbank/x17031 0addbj/x17031 0amolecular sequence data 0atranscription initiation site 0aembl/x17031 0agenetic regulation 0anucleotide sequences 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aDunne, W.1 aSchneiderbauer, A.1 aFramond, A. de.1 aRastogi, R.1 aRothstein, S.J.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1991 July, v. 17, no. 1 p.9-18x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01292naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007500127300001600202500002400218520053100242650001900773650002000792650002500812650001200837650001500849650001800864650001500882700001600897773008000913852000900993655001201002IND4458368820221120033529.0110527s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445836882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWheeler, Tim10aFood crop production, water and climate change in the developing world  ap. 239-243.  aIncludes references  aAgriculture is central to the food security and economic growth of developing countries, providing the main source of livelihood for three out of four of the world's poor.

Excluding lines in which one or both of the enzyme activities was essentially zero, the activities of the reporter genes varied by as much as a factor of 136 (CAT) and 175 (GUS) between individual transformants. Superimposed upon the high degree of inter-clonal expression variability was an intra-clonal variability of 3-4-fold. The observed degree of intra-clonal reporter gene activity may be more extreme because of the regulatory characteristics of the mannopine promoters, but must still be addressed when considering the limitations of reporter gene-based analysis of transgene function and structure. There was no consistent correlation between the expression levels of the introduced CAT and GUS genes since the ratio of GUS to CAT activities (nmol min-1 mg-1) within individual lines varied from 0.05 to 49. Even divergent transcription from two directly adjacent promoter regions (both contained within a 479 bp TR-DNA fragment) is insufficient to guarantee concurrent expression of two linked transgenes. Our quantitative data were compared to published data of transgene expression variability to examine the overall distribution of expression levels in individual transformants. The resulting frequency distribution indicates that most transformants express introduced transgenes at relatively low levels, suggesting that a potentially large number of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation events may result in silent transgenes. 3agenetic transformation 3agenetically modified organisms 3abeta-glucuronidase 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aamino acid derivatives 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3areporter genes 3aenzyme activity 3apromoter regions 3achloramphenicol acetyltransferase 2aChloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferasexgenetics 2aClone Cells 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGlucuronidasexgenetics 2aMannitolxanalogs & derivatives 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aRhizobiumxgenetics 2aTobaccoxgenetics 2aTransformation, Genetic 0agenetic regulation 0amas promoters 0amannopine 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0aposition effect 0asilent reporter genes1 aVelten, J.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1991 July, v. 17, no. 1 p.49-60x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01485naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006300125300001600188500002400204520060400228650002500832650001900857650001000876650002300886650001300909650001800922650001200940650002600952650002600978650001501004651001901019700002001038773008001058852000901138655001201147IND4458369320221120025106.0110527s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445836932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElse, Mark10aClimate change impacts on UK top and soft fruit production  ap. 257-262.  aIncludes references  aThe impacts of climate change for UK fruit growing regions requiring winter chill dormancy are discussed and insights are drawn from subtropical regions where chilling requirements for these perennial crops have been overcome.

Nucleotide analysis indicated that porcine hormone-sensitive lipase cDNA was 86% homologous with the rat. In agreement with the rat, a 3.3 kb mRNA transcript was detected in adipose tissue but not in skeletal muscle of pigs by Northern hybridization. With more sensitive PCR method, hormone-sensitive lipase mRNA was found in adipose tissue, liver, heart, skeletal muscle, testis, and spleen. The gene expression in adipose tissue and liver was elevated after 2 days of fasting, and refeeding for another 2 days decreased the mRNA abundance. In contrast, the levels in skeletal muscle were not altered during identical nutritional transition. Combined evidences suggest that differential control may occur in porcine hormone-sensitive lipase gene in a tissue-specific fashion. 3aswine 3aadipose tissue 3aliver 3askeletal muscle 3aheart 3atestes 3aspleen 3ahormones 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3acomplementary DNA 3afasting 3arepletion 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3arats 2aAdipose Tissuexenzymology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDiet 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aLiverxenzymology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMuscle, Skeletalxenzymology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aSterol Esterasexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aSwine 0acomparisons 0amolecular sequence data1 aLiang, L.C.1 aChang, L.C.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1995 July, v. 36, no. 3 p.689-694x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01952naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009900126300001600225500002400241520104700265650001901312650002001331650001001351650001201361650000901373650000901382650002801391650001601419650001201435650001701447651001901464700001601483700001401499773008001513852000901593655001201602IND4458369220221120025105.0110527s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445836922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnox, Jerry10aIdentifying future risks to UK agricultural crop production: Putting climate change in context  ap. 249-256.  aIncludes references  aInternationally, agriculture is widely regarded as one of the sectors at most risk from a changing climate. This is due to the impact of increased temperatures, reduced rainfall and increased frequency of extreme events, not only in the tropics but also in temperate environments. In the UK, growers also face a range of 'non-climate' risks, which, it is often argued, present a potentially greater and more immediate threat to sustainable food production than climate change. This paper highlights the climate and non-climate impacts on crop production, the adaptation options and the institutional and regulatory barriers to their uptake by farmers. It concludes that there are likely to be both positive impacts (for example, yield gains) and negative impacts (for example, increased water stress). Either way, there will be a need for new investments in adaptive management and technology, including new collaborations between the public and private sectors, to enable UK agriculture to respond to the potential effects of climate change. 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3acrops 3agrowers 3arain 3arisk 3asustainable agriculture 3atemperature 3atropics 3awater stress 3aUnited Kingdom1 aMorris, Joe1 aHess, Tim0 tOutlook on agriculture.g2010 Dec., v. 39, no. 4 p.249-256x0030-72707nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245007300145300001600218500001500234520155100249650002501800650001801825650001301843650000901856650001901865650001401884650001901898650001201917650003201929650002101961650002101982650002002003650000902023650003402032650002002066651001802086653001902104653002302123700001702146700001502163773007802178852000902256939003302265946001302298655001202311IND8906303120221120025007.0891127e198907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890630312DNAL7 a27612342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, H.C.14aThe effects of cage size and pair housing on exercise of beagle dogs  ap. 302-305.  a2019-12-05  aOne of the requirements of the 1985 amendments to the Animal Welfare Act is the establishment of an exercise program for dogs. Assumptions have been made by some that larger cages or the presence of a companion animal will motivate exercise. To examine how cage size, pair housing and human contact affect exercise, a study was conducted using a computerized video-data acquisition system that measured distance traveled and time spent moving in 1 X 1 m, (single only) and 1 X 2 m (single and paired) and 1 X 1.5 m cage (paired only) cages. Male beagle dogs (n = 6) housed singly in the 1 m2 cage traveled an average of 55m/hr spending only 8% (57 min) of the 12 h photo period in motion. When the cage size was doubled, the average distance traveled decreased to 13m/hr and the time spent moving increased to 11% (77 min/day). When dogs were pair housed in a regulation size cage, the average distance traveled decreased to 8.6 m/hr and they spent less than 6% of the day in exercising (42 min/12hrs.). The greatest amount of exercise was seen when dogs were housed as a pair in a cage less than recommended size (an average of 109 m/hr and 8.8 min/hr). Therefore, these data indicate that larger cages or pair housing in regulation size cages have little or no effect on the activity of purpose bred male beagle dogs. There was, however, a direct correlation between activity, time and distance, and the presence of humans in the animal room. When people were in the room, dog activity increased. When people were absent, dogs were less active. 3alaws and regulations 3astocking rate 3aexercise 3adogs 3aanimal welfare 3acage size 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aElectronic Data Processing. 2aBehavior, Animal 2aDogsxphysiology 2aHousing, Animal 2aMale 2aPhysical Conditioning, Animal 2aVideo Recording 3aUnited States 0aanimal housing 0aanimal welfare act1 aCampbell, S.1 aKenney, C.0 tComparative medicine.g1989 July, v. 39, no. 4 p.302-305x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01938naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245008100146300001600227520077000243650002001013650002601033650001201059650001101071650002701082650002601109650002401135650004001159650002501199650000901224650001701233650003601250700003401286700001701320700001901337773010601356852000901462930003301471945001301504946001101517655001201528IND2058371220221120024926.0970714e199703  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205837122DNAL7 a90904652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinambres, C.10aFailure of D-fructose to stimulate protein biosynthesis in pancreatic islets  ap. 571-574.  aRat pancreatic islets were incubated for 90 min with L-[4-3H]phenylalanine in either the absence or presence of D-glucose and D-fructose. Relative to basal value, D-glucose (16.7 mM) increased the incorporation of the tritiated amino acid into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. However, when D-fructose was tested in the 80 to 240 mM concentration range, it failed to stimulate islet biosynthetic activity. Since D-fructose causes, in the same concentration range, a dose-related stimulation of insulin release, the dissociation between the biosynthetic and secretory responses to D-fructose supports the view that the insulinotropic action of the ketohexose does not entail the same metabolic determinants as those operative in glucose-stimulated islets. 3ahuman nutrition 3adiet-related diseases 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aFructosexpharmacology 2aGlucosexpharmacology 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aPancreasxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aTrichloroacetic Acidxchemistry1 aVillanueva-Penacarrillo, M.L.1 aValverde, I.1 aMalaisse, W.J.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1997 Mar., v. 41, no. 3 p.571-574x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle01681naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245007400147300001600221520075700237650001000994650001601004650001601020650002001036650001001056650001201066650002001078650002201098650001001120653002001130653002501150700001701175773007201192852000901264939003301273946001301306655001201319IND9103734520221122175057.0910924e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910373452DNAL7 a167269372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReichle, J.K.10aUltrasonic biparietal diameter of second trimester Pygmy goat fetuses  ap. 689-694.  aFour does pregnant with seven Pygmy goat fetuses were scanned transabdominally from Day 36 to Day 102 of gestation using a real-time ultrasound 5 MHz linear-array scanhead.

Rollover protective structures (ROPS) and seatbelts are 99% effective in reducing the risk of an overturn fatality. However, kits are not available for 20% of tractors currently lacking ROPS. For these tractor owners, two potential solutions have been discussed: (1) technology for reinforcing tractor axles to accommodate ROPS and (2) a pre-ROPS tractor removal program. The purpose of this study was to conduct preliminary research to assess the feasibility of a tractor trade-in program. Focus groups were conducted with pre-ROPS tractor owners and tractor dealers. The data were analyzed using a concept development analytical approach and results were reviewed in an industry stakeholder's workgroup session. Data from the research indicates that tractor owners and dealers would need persuasive financial incentives to participate in a trade-in program. The workgroup session also indicated that it would be difficult to fund or support a large-scale initiative, and the economics of removing a large group of older tractors from the marketplace may exacerbate financial roadblocks. However, the data from this study could be used to pilot test a small-scale, focused, tractor buy-back program. 3aagromedicine 3aaxles 3adeath 3aeconomic incentives 3afocus groups 3aindustry 3amarkets 3amortality 3aoccupational health and safety 3arisk 3astakeholders 3atractors1 aConway, George A.1 aDeSpain, Michael S.1 aWyckoff, Sherry1 aBayes, Barbara1 aMay, John J.0 tJournal of agromedicine.g2011 , v. 16, no. 1 p.30-39dHaworth Medical Press, Incx1059-924X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2011.5336133Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02067naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245006200142300001600204520082700220650002501047650003401072650001201106650002601118650002301144650002401167650003001191650002201221650000901243650002401252650006301276650003001339650000901369650001701378650002801395653002201423700001601445773010601461852000901567930003301576945001301609946001101622655001201633IND2059381120221122175028.0970904e199704  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205938112DNAL7 a91119392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadma, P.10aProtective effect of vitamin E against ethionine toxicity  ap. 785-795.  aThe effect of administration of ethionine on rat liver mitochondrial functions and the protective effect of vitamin E on ethionine induced damage was studied. Ethionine treatment decreased the rate of respiration, respiratory control ratio and P/O ratio. There was a significant decrease in the activities of NADH dehydrogenase, succinate cytochrome C reductase and cytochrome oxidase. A significant decrease was seen on membrane potential and on the levels of ATP. Among the mitochondrial phospholipids only cardiolipin decreased significantly. The lipid peroxide level increased significantly in ethionine treated rats. Administration of vitamin E prior to ethionine treatment relieved the effects (induced by ethionine) on all the parameters studied.

The objectives of this study were to (1) perform a retrospective review of animal-related NSIs treated at a tertiary medical center of a rural state; and (2) review the risks of NSI and measures to decrease their occurrence. Medical records of patients with NSI related to animal injection were identified from the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics database from 2002 to 2008 and reviewed. Nine patients received medical care for NSI that occurred while vaccinating farm animals. Most common NSI site was the nondominant hand and most occurred while attempting to inject the animal. Soft tissue infection was common and all nine received oral and/or intravenous antibiotics. Two thirds required hospital admission. Three required surgery and one had a bedside incision and drainage procedure. One patient had a serious inflammatory reaction with necrosis in the leg due to the oil adjuvant in the animal vaccine. Another case had a probable mycetoma with osteomyelitis and soft tissue infection due to the bacteria Streptomyces, which is a NSI complication not previously reported. Although medical complications from farm-related NSIs do not appear to be common, this case series illustrates how these injuries can be debilitating, costly, and lead to loss of work time and productivity. Producers and employees who inject livestock need to be aware of the risks and utilize measures to decrease unintentional NSI. 3aStreptomyces 3aagromedicine 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3adatabases 3ahospitals 3ahuman resources 3aintravenous injection 3alivestock 3alivestock production 3anecrosis 3aoccupational exposure 3aoils 3aosteomyelitis 3apatients 3arisk 3asurgery 3asyringes 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aIowa1 aWallace, Jamie1 aDonham, Kelley1 aRendell, David1 aBrumby, Susan0 tJournal of agromedicine.g2011 , v. 16, no. 1 p.58-71dHaworth Medical Press, Incx1059-924X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2011.5340453Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02565naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245009000145300001600235500001500251520137000266650003301636650000901669650000801678650003501686650001501721650001101736650001501747650000901762650002001771650001801791650001101809650001801820650001901838653002101857653001001878653001501888653002001903700001701923700001401940700001401954773007201968852000902040939003302049946001302082655001202095IND9103735320221122175047.0910924e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910373532DNAL7 a167269452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPosadas, E.10aEvaluation of the incorporation of GnRH into a superovulatory regimen for Zebu cattle  ap. 761-767.  a2019-12-04  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the utilization of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) as part of a superovulatory regimen for Zebu cattle. Forty Zebu cows were superovulated with 40 mg of follicle stimulating hormone-pituitary (FSH-P) divided in eight fractions of 5 mg injected at 12-h intervals. Luteolysis was induced with 15 mg of luprostiol injected at 48 h after the first injection of FSH-P. Half of the animals were injected with 200 micrograms of GnRH 3 h after the onset of standing estrus. The other 20 animals were not injected with GnRH. All the cows were inseminated three times at 12-h intervals, starting at the time of standing estrus. Embryos were recovered nonsurgically 7 d after the last insemination. Palpation per rectum performed immediately after collection of the embryos did not show differences in the number of corpora lutea between groups (P > 0.05). Likewise, there were no significant differences between treatments with respect to the total number of embryos plus ova, total number of embryos, or the number of transferable embryos recovered (P > 0.05). The number of blastocysts, morulae, degenerated morulae and unfertilized ova was similar for the two groups. It is concluded that the incorporation of GnRH into a part of the superovulatory treatment for Zebu cattle does not improve the results of such treatment. 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3azebu 3aova 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aluteolysis 3amorula 3ablastocyst 3acows 3aembryo transfer 3aembryogenesis 3aestrus 3acorpus luteum 3asuperovulation 0arectal palpation 0afsh-p 0acollection 0aembryo (animal)1 aValencia, J.1 aZarco, L.1 aAvila, J.0 tTheriogenology.g1991 Apr., v. 35, no. 4 p.761-767x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02918naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245015500142300001600297520160100313650001101914650001301925650001801938650001401956650000801970650001801978650003801996650001202034650003602046650003002082650005302112650003802165650002502203650001102228650002402239650003102263700001402294700001702308700001402325773007802339852000902417939003302426946001302459655001202472IND8901252920221122154000.0890303e198812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890125292DNAL7 a32216622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohno, A.14aThe serodiagnosis of Campylobacter infection in infant cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) 2 to 18 weeks old by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  ap. 715-721.  aWe established the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting antibodies to Campylobacter and applied it in defining the period of the primary infection of Campylobacter in infant cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). The antibody to Campylobacter spp. could be detected with only 0.25 microl of serum by using commercially available antigens and anti-cynomolgus monkey IgG antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. The inhibition experiments using extracts of C. jejuni, C. fetus and Yersinia enterocolitica demonstrated that the established ELISA system could detect species-specific anti-C. jejuni and anti-C. fetus antibodies. The levels of antibodies to both C. jejuni and C. fetus were high in 2 weeks old infant cynomolgus monkeys, rapidly decreasing until 6 to 14 weeks of age. This result indicates that the antibodies detected in 2 week old infants were IgG antibodies of maternal origin transferred through placenta. The C. jejuni was isolated from infants when the level of maternal antibody became the lowest. Infant cynomolgus monkeys obviously developed IgG antibodies to C. jejuni within 4 weeks after infection. On the other hand, no antibody response to C. jejuni was found in two infants from which it could not be isolated throughout the observation period. As regards C. fetus infection, infants showed a poor antibody response although it was more frequently isolated than C. jejuni. In conclusion, the ELISA system established in the present study is useful for the serological diagnosis of C. jejuni infection during infancy in the cynomolgus monkey. 3aMacaca 3aneonates 3aCampylobacter 3ainfection 3aage 3aserodiagnosis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxanalysis 2aCampylobacterximmunology 2aCampylobacter Infectionsxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMacaca 2aMacaca fascicularis 2aMonkey Diseasesxdiagnosis1 aTerao, K.1 aTakasaka, M.1 aHonjo, S.0 tComparative medicine.g1988 Dec., v. 38, no. 6 p.715-721x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03053naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245009500143300001600238520130800254650000901562650002901571650001401600650001701614650002301631650002101654650001601675650001201691650002301703650001501726650002001741650001301761650002601774650002801800650001201828650002701840650002701867650003601894650002701930650000901957650003301966650002801999650000902027650000902036650001902045650002402064650002102088650002302109650002202132653002302154653001902177700001502196700001302211700001702224700001602241773007802257852000902335930003302344945001302377946001302390655001202403IND2196840220221122153942.0990204e199808  tnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219684022DNAL7 a100900412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasue, M.10aComparison of sensitization to crude and purified house dust mite allergens in inbred mice  ap. 346-352.  aTo establish a murine model for house dust mite allergy to purified mite allergens, we studied the immune response to two major mite allergens, native Dermatophagoides farinae 1 (nDer f 1) and recombinant Der f 2 (rDer f 2), and crude mite extract in four mouse strains, A/J, BALB/c, C57BL/6, and C3H/He. Mice were immunized with mite extract, nDer f 1 or rDer f 2, three times at 2-week intervals. Then mice were examined to determine status of sensitization to the antigen. Anti-mite extract IgE production was induced in all strains, and plasma IgE concentration did not differ much among the four strains. In contrast, IgE response to nDer f 1 and rDer f 2 indicated an intra-strain difference. The A/J mice had high responses to both antigens, whereas BALB/c did not respond to rDer f 2. The C57BL/6 and C3H/He mice had moderate to low IgE responses to nDer f 1 and rDer f 2. Immediate airway constriction was provoked by inhalation of mite estract or rDer f 2 in sensitized mice, and the degree of the immediate response was almost proportional to antigen-specific IgE concentration. We concluded that immunization of inbred mice with nDer f 1 and rDer f 2 achieved sensitization to mite allergens. Among the four strains, A/J mice with H-2a haplotype were the highest responder to mite allergens. 3amice 3aDermatophagoides farinae 3aallergens 3aimmunization 3aantibody formation 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aanaphylaxis 3abronchi 3astrain differences 3ahaplotypes 3aleukocyte count 2aAerosols 2aAllergensximmunology 2aAnaphylaxisximmunology 2aAnimals 2aBronchitisximmunology 2aBronchoalveolar Lavage 2aBronchoconstrictionximmunology 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aDust 2aHypersensitivityximmunology 2aImmunoglobulin Exblood 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred A 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C3H 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMitesximmunology 0aallergic reactions 0ainbred strains1 aYokota, T.1 aSuko, M.1 aOkudaira, H.1 aOkumura, Y.0 tComparative medicine.g1998 Aug., v. 48, no. 4 p.346-352x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02337naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002100128245010100149300001600250500001500266520098000281650000901261650001601270650002401286650002801310650001201338650004101350650003101391650000901422650000901431650002101440650002001461650001601481650010701497650004401604653000901648653002201657653001101679700001701690773010601707852000901813930003301822945001301855946001101868655001201879IND2039059920221122113425.0940425e199312  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203905992DNAL7 a81367052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrevithick, J.R.10aTopical application and uptake of vitamin E acetate by the skin and conversion to free vitamin E  ap. 869-878.  a2019-12-05  aRadioactive tocopherol acetate was diluted with either (1) unlabelled tocopherol acetate or (2) Delios S (Henkel, a medium chain triglyceride prepared from fractionated coconut oil), a cosmetic base.

After cleavage from the fusion protein with CNBr the biological activity of recombinant cecropin CMIV was obtained. 3aBombyx mori 3aplasmid vectors 3aanimal proteins 3asynthetic genes 3agene expression 3abioassays 3aantibacterial properties 3aEscherichia coli 3abiopharmaceuticals 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aBlotting, Western 2aBombyxxchemistry 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCyanogen Bromidexpharmacology 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulationxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aProtein Sorting Signalsxgenetics 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 0acloning 0amolecular sequence data 0afusion expression 0aantibacterial peptides1 aQiu, Q.1 aWu, H.1 aXu, X.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1996 June, v. 39, no. 3 p.487-492x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03388naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245009700143300001600240520178500256650000902041650001502050650001502065650001002080650001102090650001502101650001002116650001902126650001202145650002202157650002502179650002302204650001102227650002002238650000902258650004102267650002302308650000902331650002902340650003102369650003702400650002602437650003402463650002202497653003102519653001302550653001502563653001702578700001502595700001502610700001502625773007802640852000902718930003302727945001302760946001302773655001202786IND2198287520221122060910.0990422e199810  tnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219828752DNAL7 a100900682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, K.M.10aEffects of water dilution, housing, and food on rat urine collected from the metabolism cage  ap. 520-525.  aThe objective of the study reported here was to investigate three factors that may affect the amounts of water consumed and urine excreted by a rat in the metabolism cage: water dilution, housing, and food. Young F344/N rats (eight per group) were used for all experiments. Food was withheld from rats before each 16-h urine collection, then rats were transferred into a metabolism cage. For trial A (water dilution), urine was collected from rats supplied with dyed water (0.05%,vol/vol). This was repeated three times over a 2-week period. Dye in water or urine was quantified, using a spectrophotometer. For trial B (housing), rats were individually housed in wire cages for 3 weeks before the first urine collection. Then they were group housed in the solid-bottom cage (four per cage). After 2 weeks of acclimation, urine collection was repeated. For trial C (food), one group of rats was provided with food, the other was not, during urine collection. About 8% of urine samples of small volume (less than or equal to 3 ml) from trial A were contaminated with drinking water up to 13% of volume. The average urine volume associated with individual housing was approximately twice as large as that associated with group housing. When food was provided during urine collection, rats consumed similar amounts of water but excreted significantly smaller amounts of urine than did rats without food. It was concluded that water dilution of a urine sample from a sipper bottle is relatively small; rats individually housed in wire caging before urine collection can consumed and excrete a larger quantity of water, compared with rats group housed in solid-bottom cages: and highly variable urine volumes are, in part, associated with lack of access to food during urine collection. 3arats 3ametabolism 3astarvation 3aurine 3avolume 3agroup size 3acages 3arenal function 2aAnimals 2aCreatininexurine 2aDrinkingxphysiology 2aEatingxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHousing, Animal 2aMale 2aMetabolic Clearance Ratexphysiology 2aProteinsxanalysis 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F344xurine 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSpecific Pathogen-Free Organisms 2aUrinationxphysiology 2aUrinexchemistryxphysiology. 2aWaterxmetabolism 0aindividual characteristics 0adilution 0afloor type 0awater intake1 aReed, L.L.1 aBove, D.L.1 aDill, J.A.0 tComparative medicine.g1998 Oct., v. 48, no. 5 p.520-525x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle04251naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245015300142300001600295500001500311520208700326650001302413650001602426650001802442650002702460650001502487650001402502650001502516650001202531650004302543650001602586650003302602650003602635650004302671650002702714650001102741650001602752650003002768650006302798650005702861650003002918650006502948650002403013650002903037650003403066650001703100650003203117650002803149653001603177653002203193653001603215653001403231653001103245653001703256653001803273700001203291700001403303700001603317700001703333700001603350700001703366773007803383852000903461930003303470945001303503946001303516655001203529IND2063155620221122052040.0980415e199712  tnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206315562DNAL7 a94336982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLouie, A.10aPredictive value of several signs of infection as surrogate markers for mortality in a neutropenic guinea pig model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis  ap. 617-623.  a2019-12-05  aInfected, neutropenic animals are used as experimental models to evaluate the relative efficacies of antimicrobial agents and host-pathogen-antibiotic interactions. In the past, these models used death as the study end point. Because of the concern about use of death as an end point, we evaluated the accuracy with which various signs of infection predicted mortality in a neutropenic guinea pig model of treated and untreated Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis. The potential surrogate markers studied included ruffled fur, respiratory distress, diarrhea, hunched posture, lethargy, abnormal neurologic movements (twitching, paralysis of a limb), inappetence for > 48 h, the inability to ambulate, and the inability of a supine animal to stand. In addition, we evaluated whether percentage of weight loss or change in daily food and water consumption were predictive of mortality. Animals were inspected for these signs at least every 4 h during the day and every 8 h in the evening. In treated and untreated animals, 100% of subjects that were unable to ambulate or to rise from the supine position died (positive predictive value for death was 100% for either sign). Guinea pigs that could not rise from a supine position expired between 1 and 8 h after this sign was observed. Those that could not ambulate died between 4 and 40 h after that sign was observed. In treated, and untreated animals, none of the survivors manifested either sign of disease (100% specificity for each sign). However, 59% of untreated and 69% of treated animals that were ambulatory were found dead at the next observation period, underscoring the rapidity with which this infection progresses to death when it enters its final stage. No other signs of infection distinguished animals that survived or died. Thus, the inability of neutropenic, infected guinea pigs to rise from a supine position and the inability to ambulate were the only signs that accurately predicted death and, therefore, are the only signs that can be used as surrogates for death in this experimental model of P. aeruginosa sepsis. 3aimipenem 3afood intake 3aanimal models 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3atobramycin 3amortality 3aprediction 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aBiomarkers. 2aCeftazidimextherapeutic use 2aCephalosporinsxtherapeutic use 2aDiarrheaxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFemale 2aGuinea Pigs 2aImipenemxtherapeutic use 2aMovement Disordersxetiologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aNeutropeniaxmortalityxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aPseudomonas Infectionsxdrug therapyxmortalityxveterinary. 2aRegression Analysis 2aRespirationxphysiology. 2aThienamycinsxtherapeutic use 2aTime Factors 2aTobramycinxtherapeutic use 2aWeight Lossxphysiology 0aantibiotics 0asurrogate markers 0aceftazidime 0ameropenem 0asepsis 0awater intake 0aweight losses1 aLiu, W.1 aLiu, Q.F.1 aSucke, A.C.1 aMiller, D.A.1 aBattles, A.1 aMiller, M.H.0 tComparative medicine.g1997 Dec., v. 47, no. 6 p.617-623x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02298naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009400127300001600221500003200237520132200269650001601591650002001607650001401627650002201641651001901663653002501682653001101707653001901718653001401737653001801751653001901769773008201788852000901870930003301879945001301912946001101925655001201936IND2198913320221122035819.0990525e199810  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219891332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, M.10aInvestigations of the British rural middle classes. 1. From legislation to interpretation  ap. 411-425.  aFirst in a two-part series.  aThis is the first of two papers concerned with understanding the causes and consequences of middle class presence in rural areas. This paper explores debates over the future of class analysis and in particular whether it is possible to avoid a dualistic choice between a 'modernist class analysis' or a 'postmodernism' where class has completely receded from view. Attention is drawn to notions of an 'interpretative approach' to class, which while accepting many of the claims of postmodernism still sees value in the notion of class and in conducting class analysis. Drawing on a number of recent discussions of class within and beyond rural studies it is argued that class analysis should be seen as an 'interpretative accomplishment' and that attention needs to be paid within it to at least four issues: (i) the processes of knowledge construction and communication; (ii) differences in conceptualisations of power and related concepts such as domination and exploitation, (iii) differences within the processes of class formation; and (iv) the impact of identity recognition on class analysis, class relations and classes practices. In a later paper these issues will be explored in a more substantive manner through consideration of some of the results of research conducted in five locations in rural Britain. 3arural areas 3arural sociology 3aknowledge 3aresearch projects 3aUnited Kingdom 0acultural development 0atheory 0amiddle classes 0amodernism 0apostmodernism 0aclassformation0 tJournal of rural studies.g1998 Oct., v. 14, no. 4 p.411-425x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02183naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245003000125300001600155500001500171520138900186650002201575650001601597650001601613651001201629653001901641653002101660653001301681700001501694773008201709852000901791930003301800945001301833946001101846655001201857IND2202188920221122035850.0000111e199604  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220218892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLittle, J.10aWomen and the rural idyll  ap. 101-111.  a2019-12-05  aThe existence of a 'rural idyll' has been widely accepted by social scientists working within the rural field. Yet the term itself has received relatively little critical attention. In particular, the variable characteristics and impacts of the rural idyll amongst different groups within the rural population has been largely overlooked. The cultural turn in rural geography and the emphasis which has recently been placed on identifying and studying the rural 'other' provides an important opportunity for the notion of a rural idyll to be unpacked from the perspective of different rural dwellers. This paper investigates the role of the rural idyll in maintaining rural gender relations. It examines women's attitudes towards and experiences of two key elements of the rural idyll; the family and the community. Drawing on material from interviews with women in rural Avon in the south west of England, the paper shows how women's identity as 'rural women' is closely tied in to their images and understanding of rural society. It is argued, in particular, that the opportunities available and acceptable to women are built on very strong assumptions and expectations about motherhood and belonging within a rural community. Some of the more practical implications of these expectations are explored in the context of women's involvement in the community and in the labour market. 3arural communities 3arural areas 3arural women 3aEngland 0awoman's status 0agender relations 0afamilies1 aAustin, P.0 tJournal of rural studies.g1996 Apr., v. 12, no. 2 p.101-111x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02396naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245008700123300001600210520147900226650002501705650001001730650001701740650002101757651001301778653001801791653001601809653001601825653001501841653001701856653002501873773008201898852000901980930003301989945001302022946001102035655001202046IND2197911020221122030603.0990401e199807  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219791102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGray, J.10aFamily farms in the Scottish borders: a practical definition by hill sheep farmers  ap. 341-356.  aThe theme of this paper is the family farm and the problems of defining it. The approach taken is to recognize the difference between theoretical definitional practices of sociologists and anthropologists, on the one hand, and everyday definitional practices of family farmers on the other. The former focus upon observable behaviour and/or quantitative measures that are used to construct an analytical concept with precise boundaries; the latter are not interested in defining the boundaries of the concept of the family farm but in understanding the nature and operations of their family farms so that they can reproduce them in their everyday activities. They attend to what is most central and ideal to the family farm and this is the basis of their concept of the family farm. Through an ethnographic account of hill sheep farms in the Scottish borderlands, the paper argues that the essence of family farms is a consubstantial relation between family and farm such that the distinct existence and form of both partake of or become united in a common substance that is transmitted over generations. The analysis highlights the economic and social interdependence of family and farm, the process by which the farm becomes embodied through family labour, the strategies adopted by the family to ensure the transfer of the farm to the following generation, and the use of a genetic metaphor to transpose a legal relation between family and farm into a consubstantial one. 3alivestock production 3asheep 3afamily farms 3afamily structure 3aScotland 0arelationships 0aethnography 0agenerations 0asuccession 0afamily labor 0ateviothead, scotland0 tJournal of rural studies.g1998 July, v. 14, no. 3 p.341-356x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a19990503b19990512c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02461naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245015300125300001600278500001500294520129500309650002601604650002201630650001601652650002901668650001301697650002401710651002101734653002601755653001301781653002901794653002001823653002601843653002601869653002001895773008201915852000901997930003302006945001302039946001102052655001202063IND2163675120221122030550.0980827e199704  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216367512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReed, M.G.14aThe provision of environmental goods and services by local non-governmental organizations: an illustration from the Squamish Forest District, Canada  ap. 177-196.  a2019-12-05  aIn rapidly-growing rural areas, new demands for provision of environmental and recreational goods and services have been accompanied by governmental policies and programs designed to involve non-governmental organizations (NGOs) directly in environmental decision-making and day-to-day management. In this paper, it is argued that certain local-level NGOs have become increasingly influential in the provision of environmental goods and services locally by combining their understanding of policy-making, with an awareness of local environmental issues and opportunities for specific projects. By developing a four-part framework, the term 'exchange agents' presented by Lowe et al. (1993) is adapted and developed to explain the means by which NGOs gain influence in environmental management. The framework focuses attention on the changing character of rural areas, NGO roles and orientations, networking among NGOs and funding partnerships between NGOs and public agencies. The framework is used to explain the differential influence of local-level NGOs in the Squamish Forest District, located near Vancouver, Canada From this analysis some cautions are raised about 'community stewardship', the rubric by which local-level environmental policies and programs are currently implemented. 3acitizen participation 3arural development 3arural areas 3aenvironmental protection 3aland use 3agovernment agencies 3aBritish Columbia 0alocal authority areas 0aservices 0aenvironmental management 0aexchange agents 0aprivate organizations 0acommunity stewardship 0aland management0 tJournal of rural studies.g1997 Apr., v. 13, no. 2 p.177-196x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle01999naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009300124300001600217520083100233650002901064650001101093650001101104650001301115650001301128650002401141650002401165650001401189650002301203651001601226653002101242653002501263653002201288653002801310653002901338700001701367700001801384700001501402773008201417852000901499930003301508945001301541946001101554655001201565IND2163764420221122030622.0980831e199707  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216376442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerry, M.10aGrowing discipline through total quality management in a New Zealand horticulture region  ap. 289-304.  aHorticultural activity in New Zealand is changing through an intensified search for higher value, customer-oriented production.

The paper identifies specific initiatives in each sector, explores the nature of the context in which growers operate and examines strategies growers have followed in response to structural pressures and an emerging understanding of quality management in the region. The paper concludes that the quality management initiatives represent a new governance dimension in the horticultural scene which has the potential to completely refashion the organisation of sectoral production systems. 3aAsparagus (Asparagaceae) 3aapples 3agrapes 3asquashes 3atomatoes 3ahorticultural crops 3ainnovation adoption 3amarketing 3afarmers' attitudes 3aNew Zealand 0aquality controls 0aagricultural regions 0asectoral analysis 0amanagement philosophies 0ahawke's bay, new zealand1 aLe Heron, R.1 aHayward, D.J.1 aCooper, I.0 tJournal of rural studies.g1997 July, v. 13, no. 3 p.289-304x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02148naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006400127300001600191520135800207650002001565650001301585650002101598650002201619650001301641653002301654653002101677773008201698852000901780930003301789945001301822946001101835655001201846IND2181447920221122030548.0981201e199804  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218144792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, M.14aThe restructuring of social imaginations in rural geography  ap. 121-153.  aThis paper reviews the development of rural social geography. It argues that there has been a restructuring in the dominant social imagination expressed within rural social geography away from a 'restricted social imagination' which shied away from considering phenomena which were immaterial and clearly politicized. The prevalence of this social imagination within geographical studies of rural settlement, population change, access to resources and services and rural communal life is highlighted. It is argued that there have been two important directions of critique of this social geography. First, the politization of rural geography through Marxism is discussed with particular reference being paid to the analysis of class relations in the countryside. Second, the rise of postmodernism and the cultural turn of rural geography is discussed. Attention is drawn to the explicit politicization of this social geography and the emphasis placed within it on the immaterial. The paper outlines some of the key arguments and texts of these two lines of restructuring, and also how some earlier work trepassed beyond the dominant restrictions placed on social imaginations of the rural. The paper ends by raising the issue of whether the immaterial and the politicized have been reconciled together within the current work of rural social geographers. 3arural sociology 3aresearch 3arural population 3arural communities 3apolitics 0aliterature reviews 0asocial geography0 tJournal of rural studies.g1998 Apr., v. 14, no. 2 p.121-153x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02304naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245014400124300001600268500001500284520119100299650002601490650002401516650002201540650001601562650002301578651001001601651001101611653001601622653002501638653001901663653002201682653001401704653002501718700001501743773008201758852000901840930003301849945001301882946001101895655001201906IND2163764720221122030545.0980831e199707  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216376472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarke, M.14aThe EU LEADER Initiative and endogenous rural development: the application of the programme in two rural areas of Andalusia, Southern Spain  ap. 319-341.  a2019-12-05  aThe European Union's LEADER Initiative represents an attempt to generate rural development at the 'grass-roots' level. The paper examines the application of the Initiative within Spain and, in particular, two contrasting rural areas of Andalusia. It is argued that some of the features of the way in which LEADER was initially established may have acted against the successful achievement of endogenous rural development and it is demonstrated that the relationships between local areas and the regional, national and European levels have been problematic. More specifically, it is shown that the characteristics of the two selected rural areas of Andalusia significantly influenced the nature of the local programmes proposed, with--in one case--a failure to comprehend the essential nature of the scheme. However, in neither case can it be argued that a truly 'grass-roots' level of development has been stimulated as there is little evidence of significant change in the process of social mobilisation with the objective of promoting self-reliant development. Instead, the Initiative has led to considerable emphasis being placed on the development of tangible products and projects. 3acommunity development 3ainnovation adoption 3arural development 3arural areas 3aprogram evaluation 3aSpain 0aEurope 0acomparisons 0adevelopment programs 0ala loma, spain 0adevelopment plans 0aalpujarra 0aeconomic development1 aNewton, M.0 tJournal of rural studies.g1997 July, v. 13, no. 3 p.319-341x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02418naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005800128300001600186500001500202520149400217650001701711650001401728650002301742650001301765651001701778653001801795653002601813653001801839653001301857653002101870700001701891773008201908852000901990930003301999945001302032946001102045655001202056IND2163634620221122030705.0980826e199710  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216363462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFennell, D.A.10aVacation farms and ecotourism in Saskatchewan, Canada  ap. 467-475.  a2019-12-05  aVacation farms represent an increasingly significant rural diversification option for chronically unstable agriculture-based economies such as Saskatchewan. Concurrently, ecotourism is a rapidly expanding form of tourism which could serve to enhance the recreation product of such rural enterprises. Accordingly, a self-administered questionnaire was sent to all listed vacation farm operators in the province to obtain information on the provision of ecotourism opportunities. Just over one-half (n = 40) of all operations returned a completed questionnaire. Of 23 listed recreation options, wildlife viewing was cited as the activity most frequently undertaken by vacation farm visitors, followed by hunting, casual photography and touring. Wildlife viewing occurred most commonly during the spring and summer, with access to the resource occurring mainly on foot, and less so by horse and vehicle. Birds were the most important category of wildlife viewed, followed by mammals and plants, reptiles/amphibians, insects and fish were of only minor significance. It was evident that the sampled vacation farm operators possessed very little training in the area of ecotourism; few barriers or opportunities related to the latter were indicated. Appropriate recommendations include the provision of ecotourism training opportunities, stronger linkages between vacation farms and public spaces, and further investigation into the relationship between wildlife viewing and hunting activities. 3afarm surveys 3avacations 3aseasonal variation 3awildlife 3aSaskatchewan 0aentertainment 0aancillary enterprises 0arural tourism 0avisitors 0aregional surveys1 aWeaver, D.B.0 tJournal of rural studies.g1997 Oct., v. 13, no. 4 p.467-475x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle01775naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008600126300001400212520084700226650001901073650001601092650001601108650002101124650002401145650001801169650002201187651001001209653002301219653001801242653001901260773008001279852000901359930003301368945001301401946001101414655001201425IND2124211520221122030558.0980723e199701  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212421152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallent, N.14aThe alternative route to affordable housing provision: experiences in rural Wales  ap. 43-56.  aA significant number of recent papers and research reports in the U.K. have focused attention on the 'alternative way' of reducing the pressures borne by social housing providers in the face of public spending cuts. By exploiting aspects of the land-use planning system, it is possible to lower land prices in certain circumstances and therefore reduce producer costs. As well as exploring the strategy in general terms, this paper considers the operation of this 'alternative way' in rural Wales and asks the following questions: is this strategy numerically significant (in terms of the number of units added to the rural housing stock); how has the strategy helped shape the relationship between voluntary and public sector housing agencies and, is the strategy sustainable, particularly in the context of the Government's new Housing Act? 3apublic housing 3arural areas 3aland values 3aproduction costs 3agovernment agencies 3apublic sector 3aland use planning 3aWales 0apublic expenditure 0ahousing costs 0asocial housing0 tJournal of rural studies.g1997 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.43-56x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02010naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009500126300001600221520109100237650002901328650001601357650001301373651001101386653001901397653001101416653001601427653002601443653001301469653001401482700001601496773008201512852000901594930003301603945001301636946001101649655001201660IND2163675020221122030528.0980827e199704  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216367502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, M.B.13aAn overview of commuting in Canada with special emphasis on rural community and employment  ap. 163-175.  aDue to changes in employment opportunities in many rural settings, it is important to understand the characteristics of all types of commuting that occur between rural and urban environments (and not just the case of rural to urban journey to work patterns). However, no Canada-wide study exists that considers all commuting types. With the use of customized tabulations from the 1991 Canadian census we examine all directional commuting flows for all areas of Canada (at the census subdivision level) and emphasize the commuting patterns and employment opportunities inherent to the rural component of the population. While only slight differences are detected between commuters based on demographic biographies, substantial contrasts in commuting tendencies are reported when the Canadian population is categorized by commuting type, industry, and region. The volume of commuting in Canada is poorly predicted by a gravity model regression application (using independent variables measuring distance and population), but the results do provide some valuable insights for future study. 3aemployment opportunities 3arural areas 3aindustry 3aCanada 0alabor mobility 0atrends 0acomparisons 0arural urban relations 0apatterns 0acommuting1 aMeyer, S.P.0 tJournal of rural studies.g1997 Apr., v. 13, no. 2 p.163-175x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02157naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245004700124300001400171520122500185650002701410650001601437650002101453650001901474650001901493651002101512651001901533651001101552653002801563653003101591700001301622700001401635773008001649852000901729930003301738945001301771946001101784655001201795IND2124211620221122030543.0980723e199701  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212421162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, J.10aNew perspectives on farm household incomes  ap. 57-64.  aTraditional farm classification schemes in the European Union are strongly oriented towards the role of the farm business in generating income for the farm household. This is increasingly being viewed as too partial a view of farm households, especially by those concerned with the study of rural household adjustment and survival strategies. The paper presents an approach to the construction of a household income typology. A total of 2200 broadly defined agricultural households in three peripheral regions of the European Union --Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Greece--are classified into policy relevant typology groups based on the composition of household income and on their total income relative to a Minimum Income Requirement. Associations are made between the typology groups, farm business types and household lifecycles. Although there was significant variation between the three regions, only 28% of the total sample were classified as 'farm-based', i.e. generated a household income above the Minimum Income Requirement based mainly on farming. Poor households, i.e. those below the Minimum Income Requirement, represented 44% of the total, or about 50% if the 'retired' group is excluded. 3alife cycle (organisms) 3afarm income 3ahousehold income 3aclassification 3aEuropean Union 3aNorthern Ireland 3aIrish Republic 3aGreece 0aagricultural households 0aminimum income requirement1 aMack, N.1 aKirke, A.0 tJournal of rural studies.g1997 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.57-64x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02531naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245011300145300001400258520123400272650002201506650001501528650001501543650002401558650001401582650003201596650001401628650001501642650002401657650002201681650002101703650002001724650002601744651001901770651001101789651001801800653002301818653002501841653002601866653002301892773008001915852000901995930003302004945001302037946001102050655001202061IND2124211820221122005030.0980723e199701  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212421182DNAL7 a123482732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpencer, D.10aCounterurbanisation and rural depopulation revisited: landowners, planners and the rural development process  ap. 75-92.  aThis paper reopens the debate between Weekley (1988) and Rowsell (1989) over why pockets of depopulation have persisted within parts of rural Britain which have experienced net growth through counterurbanisation. It argues that Weekley has not fully appreciated the context for local population losses, namely the emergence of a new structural relationship between people, households, and dwellings, and the growing tension between production and consumption interests in rural locales. Moreover, the paper disputes claims that depopulation is triggered by the actions of either the landowner or the planner. Drawing on case study material informed by critical realism, it argues that planners and landowners have been drawn into an asymmetrical power relationship. This has tended to buttress landed interests and, in so doing, reproduce mechanisms which protect the less populous communities from growth and change. Intensive enquiries have unravelled a number of ways in which landowner strategic conduct can set causal chains in motion which culminate in a localised population downturn. These cannot be recovered through a positivist methodology which presupposes that cause, catalyst and outcome will coexist in time-space. 3arural development 3alandowners 2aDemography 2aDeveloped Countries 2aEconomics 2aEvaluation Studies as Topic 2aGeography 2aPopulation 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aPopulation Growth 2aRural Population 2aSocial Planning 2aSocioeconomic Factors 3aUnited Kingdom 0aEurope 0aGreat Britain 0aliterature reviews 0adevelopment planning 0aurban rural migration 0arural depopulation0 tJournal of rural studies.g1997 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.75-92x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02973naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002600128245016900154300001400323520136200337650002001699650002501719650001601744650002001760650003701780650002401817650001801841650004301859650001201902650003401914650002601948650002801974650002702002650001102029650001902040650001302059650003102072650003302103650002502136650000902161650003202170650001302202650002102215700001702236700001702253700001702270773007602287852000902363930003302372945001302405946001302418655001202431IND2061263120221121235042.0980114e199602  tnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206126312DNAL7 a86998152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams-Blangero, S.10aGenetic analysis of serum alanine transaminase activity in normal and hepatitis C virus-infected chimpanzees: an application of research-oriented genetic management  ap. 26-30.  aThe hepatic enzyme alanine transaminase (ALT) is a diagnostic marker for liver damage but has a considerable degree of normal variation. We used complex segregation analysis to determine whether evidence exists for major genic determination of normal ALT values in an important animal model, the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). Normal ALT values were available for 212 chimpanzees. Available genealogical data allowed assignment of 165 animals to a total of 19 pedigrees; 47 animals were treated as independents. A major gene explaining 60% of the phenotypic variance in normal alanine transaminase (ALT) activity was detected by complex segregation analysis. The allele for high ALT activity had a frequency of 0.20. Polygenes accounted for an additional 20% of the variation. The observation that 80% of the total phenotypic variance is attributable to genetic factors has important implications for studies that use ALT activity in assessments. Genetic analysis of change in ALT activity after inoculation with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in a subset of animals indicated that approximately 30% of the variation in response may also be attributable to genetic factors and that the estimated major locus genotypes differ in their responses. This suggests that genetic components can exert substantial influences on experimental parameters in hepatitis research. 3aPan troglodytes 3aalanine transaminase 3ablood serum 3aviral hepatitis 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3abiomedical research 3aanimal models 2aAlanine Transaminasexbloodxgenetics. 2aAnimals 2aApe Diseasesxphysiopathology 2aBiomarkersxanalysis. 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFemale 2aGene Frequency 2aGenotype 2aHepacivirusxpathogenicity 2aHepatitis Cxphysiopathology 2aLikelihood Functions 2aMale 2aPan troglodytesxphysiology 2aPedigree 2aReference Values1 aBlangero, J.1 aMurthy, K.K.1 aLanfod, R.E.0 tComparative medicine.g1996 Feb., v. 46, no. 1 p.26-30x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle03342naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245009200145300001600237520194600253650001602199650001402215650001502229650001402244650001802258650002602276650004602302650004902348650001202397650004102409650004202450650001102492650001602503650001402519653002602533653002002559653001602579653002902595700002202624700001902646700001602665700002102681773007802702852000902780930003302789945001302822946001302835655001202848IND2047150920221121235230.0950807e199410  tnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204715092DNAL7 a78449582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEisele, P.H.10aEpidural catheter placement for testing of obstetrical analgesics in female guinea pigs  ap. 486-490.  aThe pregnant guinea pig may be a useful model for the study of drug effects in the newborn. A reliable technique for epidural catheterization in the guinea pig was developed to allow use of this model to evaluate the effects of epidural labor analgesics on neonates. Catheters were implanted in two open pilot animals and 19 time-dated pregnant animals on days 59 to 62 of gestation. After establishing a surgical plane of isoflurane-induced anesthesia, an incision was made over the dorsal lumbar part of the spine. The L3-4 intervertebral space was exposed to allow introduction of a caudally directed 27-gauge catheter into the epidural space. The catheter was capped and implanted subcutaneously, then the animal was allowed to recover from anesthesia. Catheter placement was evaluated, using a bupivacaine test dose in 17 animals and postmortem histologic examination in 20 animals. One animal died immediately after surgery. Epidural placement was confirmed histologically in 16 of 20 animals. Failed catheters were either subdural, with one catheter found to be penetrating the spinal cord (intraspinal), or intramuscular. Response to epidurally administered bupivacaine was variable but was typically characterized by normal alertness and ability to use the forelimbs; depression of the panniculus reflex in the dorsal lumbar region; and hind limb motor impairment, with ataxia, loss of the placing reflex, and a tendency to drag the hind limbs. Subdural placement was associated with CNS depression, recumbency, shallow breathing, and sensory block ascending to the level of the ears. Administration of the test dose was fatal in the one animal that had intraspinal catheter placement. Using the afore-described technique, epidural catheterization can be performed reliably in the guinea pig. Correct catheter placement can be confirmed by use of an antemortem test dose of local anesthetic and by postmortem histologic examination. 3aguinea pigs 3acatheters 3aanalgesics 3apregnancy 3aanimal models 3adrug delivery systems 2aAnalgesia, Epiduralxmethodsxveterinary. 2aAnalgesia, Obstetricalxmethodsxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aBupivacainexadministration & dosage 2aCatheterizationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aGuinea Pigs 2aPregnancy 0aconduction anesthesia 0acatheterization 0abupivacaine 0aepidural catheterization1 aKaaekuahiwi, M.A.1 aCanfield, D.R.1 aGolub, M.S.1 aEisele, J.H.

Interest in the use and management of this land--the defence estate--has grown in the 1990s following changes in land use as a consequence of the restructuring of the armed forces. This paper examines the portrayal of military land use by the MoD, using a conceptual framework informed by theories of discourse and the social construction of rurality. Empirical evidence is drawn from a 1997 public inquiry into developments proposed by the MoD to the Otterburn Training Area in the Northumberland National Park. The paper examines how military training in a national park is constructed as a legitimate use of this space, with reference to discourses of conservation and environmental protection. The paper goes on to examine the ways in which the landscape of the training area is portrayed with reference to discourses about the appearance and consumption of the countryside. The paper concludes by looking at the effect of discourses of defence and national security in shaping the Otterburn debate, and in shaping the claims of the armed forces as defenders of the natural environment. 3aland use 3anational parks 3apolitics 3acase studies 3aland ownership 3alandscapes 3aEngland 0amilitary areas0 tJournal of rural studies.g1999 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.17-33x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02231naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011300128300001600241520127800257650001601535650001701551650002001568650001701588650001501605650002001620651001101640653002001651653002101671653002201692653001901714773008201733852000901815930003301824945001301857946001101870655001201881IND2202190920221121223609.0000111e199904  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220219092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGidarakou, I.10aYoung women's attitudes towards agriculture and women's new roles in the Greek countryside: a first approach  ap. 147-158.  aIn recent years the employment situation in urban areas has deteriorated, particularly for women, while in countryside new kinds of work are being promoted in the framework of endogenous development. The purpose of the present article in the light of these conditions is to examine the attitude of young women to employment in farming and the prospect of living in a farming household, as well as their attitude to the new roles that are emerging for farm women. The data are derived from field research in four communities, having been obtained by means of a personal questionnaire addressed to all the unmarried women between 18 and 30 who live in them. The findings indicate that the girls' attitude to farm employment remains extremely negative. Their orientations in relation to work and place of residence are characterized by strong inclinations to emigrate to urban or semi-urban areas. Their attitude to the prospect of having a farmer for a husband is more flexible, but only on certain conditions. The new roles that are promoted for women in the agricultural sector are perceived as low income occupations, which can be seen only as a temporary expedient, acceptable as an answer to the employment problem only until such time as a better solution can be found. 3arural women 3ayoung adults 3afarming systems 3acase studies 3aemployment 3acareer planning 3aGreece 0arole perception 0agender relations 0aattitudes to work 0awoman's status0 tJournal of rural studies.g1999 Apr., v. 15, no. 2 p.147-158x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle01951naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009300127300001600220520111000236650002501346650002201371650002001393650002601413651001201439653002001451653003001471773008201501852000901583930003301592945001301625946001101638655001201649IND2202191420221121223619.0000111e199904  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220219142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZekeri, A.A.10aCommunity-ness of a major economic development effort in a biracial community of Alabama  ap. 159-169.  aThis paper uses case study data from a rural biracial community in Alabama to examine the community-ness of a major economic development effort and selected aspect of the 'growth machine' hypothesis. Results of the study suggest that the major economic development effort in the community was not a community-related action. In general, the findings provide support for some of the contentions of the growth machine model. Indeed, community can be an arena of action rather than a cohesive acting unit as posited by the 'growth machine' hypothesis and political economy models of community power put forth in the last two decades. The local elites utilized the community as a tool for the pursuit of personal gain at the expense of a majority of local residents. Capitalist development is divisive and the community, as (Molotch (1976) American Journal of Sociology 82(2), 309-332, 10) says, can be a 'growth machine' serving not the common good but the interests of those who manipulate that machine for profit. The implications of the findings for the future of biracial rural communities are discussed. 3aeconomic development 3arural communities 3aeconomic theory 3acommunity development 3aAlabama 0ainterest groups 0agrowth machine hypothesis0 tJournal of rural studies.g1999 Apr., v. 15, no. 2 p.159-169x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02084naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245008200148300001600230300002100246520068100267650001900948650002100967650001800988650002501006650001101031650001001042650004901052650001601101650004701117650001201164650002801176650006501204650001101269650001901280650000901299650004401308650001201352653002101364700001701385700002001402700001701422700001801439773007801457852000901535939003301544946001301577655001201590IND9101617120221121200947.0910329e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910161712DNAL7 a21570962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRatterree, M.S.10aVitamin C deficiency in captive nonhuman primates fed commercial primate diet  ap. 165-168.  ap. 165-168. ill.  aScurvy was diagnosed in 19 rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and four squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) from a colony of nonhuman primates maintained on a commercial diet.

MAC was then determined in each rat by the tail clamp method and a group MAC calculated. 3arats 3aanesthetics 3aanesthesia 3ahypertension 2aAnesthesiaxveterinary 2aAnimals 2aBlood Pressure 2aBody Weight 2aIsofluranexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred SHRxphysiology 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aRats, Inbred WKYxphysiology 2aTime Factors1 aMarcantonio, S.1 aDrummond, J.C.0 tComparative medicine.g1990 Sept., v. 40, no. 5 p.506-509x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03149naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245012600143300001600269500001500285520142400300650001801724650002201742650001801764650002001782650000901802650001301811650002901824650001801853650001401871650003101885650002501916650001201941650002001953650003301973650001102006650001302017650003202030650003202062650002602094650000902120650001902129650002402148650002102172650002302193650003902216650002302255650004702278653003802325653001302363700001902376700001902395773007802414852000902492939003302501946001302534655001202547IND9204233120221121135319.0920707e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920423312DNAL7 a16584362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Al.10aIn vitro splenic T cell responses of diverse mouse genotypes after oronasal exposure to mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM  ap. 106-111.  a2019-12-05  aMortality rates among BALB/cByJ, A/JCr, C3H/HeSnJ, and C57BL/6NCr mice inoculated oronasally with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), strain JHM, ranged from 25 to 67%. Spleen cells harvested from the first three genotypes at 5 days postinoculation proliferated poorly in response to concanavalin A stimulation and produced significantly less interleukin (IL) 2 than cells from uninfected control mice. The function of spleen cells harvested at 14 days postinoculation varied and was host genotype-dependent. Despite clinical signs among some infected C57BL/6NCr mice, spleen cell function was relatively unaffected. C57BL/10ScNCr,B10.A, and SJL/JCr mice remained clinically normal after MHV inoculation. Proliferation and IL2 production by cells from inoculated C57BL/10ScNCr and B10.A mice were similar to responses of their respective controls. In contrast, cells from inoculated SJL/JCr mice were hyper-responsive and produced peak levels of IL2 earlier than control cells. Among the seven genotypes tested, only BALB/cByJ and C3H/HeSnJ spleen cells produced detectable IL4 after primary stimulation with concanavalin A or after priming and restimulation. Primary IL4 production by cells from these two genotypes was significantly reduced if donors were inoculated with MHV 5 days prior to spleen harvest. IL4 production by cells from acutely infected BALB/cByJ mice was considerably enhanced by priming and restimulation. 3aT-lymphocytes 3aimmunosuppression 3ainterleukin-2 3aviral hepatitis 3amice 3agenotype 3alymphocyte proliferation 3ainterleukin-4 3amortality 2aAdministration, Intranasal 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aCells, Cultured 2aConcanavalin Axpharmacology 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aInterleukin-2xbiosynthesis 2aInterleukin-4xbiosynthesis 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred A 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C3H 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMurine hepatitis virusximmunology 2aSpleenximmunology 2aT-Lymphocytesxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 0aimmunosuppression (physiological) 0ain vitro1 aWinograd, D.F.1 aDe Souza, M.S.0 tComparative medicine.g1991 Apr., v. 41, no. 2 p.106-111x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02433naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245006800188300001200256520101600268650002101284650001701305650001401322650001301336650007701349650007701426650001701503650002501520650003101545650002301576651001101599651001101610653001901621653002001640653002501660653002701685653002101712773011601733852000901849856008501858930003301943946001101976655001201987IND4398172920221121135236.0071125e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439817292DNAL7 a176681862pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-007-0294-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSikorski, Johannes 10aPopulations under microevolutionary scrutiny: what will we gain  ap. 1-5.  aUnderstanding the evolution of biodiversity and the function of biological systems are burning and linked questions in biology. Evolution of biodiversity begins at the level of microevolution, with the differentiation of individuals in populations. The study of this process splits into two conceptually different approaches (1) the concept of functional biology of testing hypothesis by precisely controlled and forward-directed experiments (digital and experimental evolution), and (2) the concept of a theory-based historical narrative (testing hypothesis on events in the past for their suitability to best explain the present). Here, I discuss and emphasize the benefits of the study of natural bacterial populations for a deeper understanding of prokaryotic biology. Also, I adress current problems in taxonomy at the 'species' level which obviously need discussion and clarification. I exemplify this with a natural model population for such studies, Bacillus simplex from “Evolution Canyon”, Israel. 3aBacillus simplex 3abiodiversity 3aevolution 3ataxonomy 2aBacillusxchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBacteriaxchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBiodiversity 2aBiological Evolution 2aEnvironmental Microbiology 2aModels, Biological 3aIsrael 0aIsrael 0aMicroevolution 0aSpecies concept 0aEvolutionary lineage 0aIntraspecies diversity 0aEvolution Canyon0 tArchives of microbiology.g2008 Jan., v. 189, no. 1 p.1-5dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-007-0294-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071125b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03115naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245014200187300001600329520136600345650002101711650002701732650001701759650002301776650001901799650002101818650002101839650001801860650008801878650004001966650004202006650002802048650002102076650002702097650007402124650003202198653004602230700002102276700002402297700002102321700002002342773012002362852000902482856008602491930003302577946001102610655001202621IND4391516020221121100608.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439151602DNAL7 a173752852pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-007-0212-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulsawat, Nattika 10aIdentification of the bkdAB gene cluster, a plausible source of the starter-unit for virginiamycin M production in Streptomyces virginiae  ap. 459-466.  aThe bkdAB gene cluster, which encodes plausible E1 and E2 components of the branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCDH) complex, was isolated from Streptomyces virginiae in the vicinity of a regulatory island for virginiamycin production. Gene disruption of bkdA completely abolished the production of virginiamycin M (a polyketide-peptide antibiotic), while the production of virginiamycin S (a cyclodepsipeptide antibiotic) was unaffected. Complementation of the bkdA disruptant by genome-integration of intact bkdA completely restored the virginiamycin M production, indicating that the bkdAB cluster is essential for virginiamycin M biosynthesis, plausibly via the provision of isobutyryl-CoA as a primer unit. In contrast to a feature usually seen in the Streptomyces E1 component, namely, the separate encoding of the α and β subunits, S. virginiae bkdA seemed to encode the fused form of the α and β subunits, which was verified by the actual catalytic activity of the fused protein in vitro using recombinant BkdA overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Supply of an additional bkdA gene under the strong and constitutive promoter ermE* in the wild-type strain of S. virginiae resulted in enhanced production of virginiamycin M, suggesting that the supply of isobutyryl-CoA is one of the rate-limiting factors in the biosynthesis of virginiamycin M. 3aEscherichia coli 3aStreptomyces virginiae 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3agene targeting 3amultigene family 3apromoter regions 3avirginiamycin 2a3-Methyl-2-Oxobutanoate Dehydrogenase (Lipoamide)xchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxbiosynthesis 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aStreptomycesxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aVirginiamycinxbiosynthesis 0aBranched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase1 aKitani, Shigeru 1 aKinoshita, Hiroshi 1 aLee, Chang Kwon 1 aNihira, Takuya 0 tArchives of microbiology.g2007 June, v. 187, no. 6 p.459-466dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-007-0212-23Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03267naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245012400186300001600310520121500326650001701541650001301558650001301571650002501584650002401609650001201633650001201645650002501657650003901682650003001721650001901751650001301770650002901783650003401812650007801846650003401924650005101958650007702009650003402086650005502120650006102175650002502236650003102261653001902292653002802311653001102339700002202350700002502372700002102397773012102418852000902539856008502548930003302633946001102666655001202677IND4393742920221121100630.0070805e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439374292DNAL7 a175228472pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-007-0247-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez, Paula.10aChlorobenzoate inhibits growth and induces stress proteins in the PCB-degrading bacterium Burkholderia xenovorans LB400  ap. 289-297.  aAerobic bacteria, such as Burkholderia xenovorans LB400, are able to degrade a wide range of polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs). Generally, these bacteria are not able to transform chlorobenzoates (CBAs), which accumulate during PCB degradation. In this study, the effects of CBAs on the growth, the morphology and the proteome of Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 were analysed. 4-CBA and 2-CBA were observed to inhibit the growth of strain LB400 on glucose. Strain LB400 exposed to 4-CBA exhibited increased number and size of electron-dense granules in the cytoplasm, which could be polyphosphates. Two-dimensional (2-D) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to characterise the molecular response of strain LB400 to 4-CBA. This compound induced the enzymes BenD and CatA of benzoate and catechol catabolic pathways. The induction of molecular chaperones DnaK and HtpG by 4-CBA indicated that the exposure to this compound constitutes a stressful condition for this bacterium. Additionally, the induction of some Krebs cycle enzymes was observed, probably as response to cellular energy requirements. This study contributes to the knowledge on the effects of CBA on the PCB-degrader Burkholderia xenovorans LB400. 3aBurkholderia 3abacteria 3acatechol 3acytoplasmic granules 3aenergy requirements 3aenzymes 3aglucose 3amolecular chaperones 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolyphosphates 3aproteome 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBurkholderiaxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aChlorobenzoatesxpharmacology 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensionalxmethods 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aMicroscopy, Electronxmethods 2aPeptide Elongation Factor Gxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aProteomexmetabolism 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 0aChlorobenzoate 0aBurkholderia xenovorans 0aStress1 aAgulló, Loreine 1 aHernández, Marcela 1 aSeeger, Michael 0 tArchives of microbiology.g2007 Sept., v. 188, no. 3 p.289-297dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-007-0247-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20070805b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04051naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245012600183300001300309520133600322650001801658650001901676650001701695650002301712650001801735650001801753650001401771650001801785650002501803650001301828650001001841650001201851650001901863650003101882650002301913650003901936650001301975650004501988650001802033650001702051650001502068650001202083650005202095650003502147650001702182650005802199650005602257650002902313650005302342650004002395650002702435650002202462650002502484650002802509650001402537650003002551650003002581650004602611650003402657650005302691650002702744650005702771650002802828651001002856651001002866653001402876653001302890700001802903700001402921700001902935773011702954852000903071856008503080930003303165946001103198655001203209IND4393272720221121065807.0070722e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439327272DNAL7 a174971342pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-007-0209-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiao Yun 10aDiverse bacteria isolated from root nodules of Trifolium, Crotalaria and Mimosa grown in the subtropical regions of China  ap. 1-14.  aTo analyze the diversity and relationships of rhizobia in the subtropical and tropical zones of China, we characterized 67 bacterial strains isolated from root nodules of five legume species in the genera Trifolium, Crotalaria and Mimosa . PCR-amplified 16S rDNA RFLP, numerical taxonomy, SDS-PAGE of whole cell proteins, sequencing of 16S rDNA and DNA-DNA hybridization grouped the isolates into 17 lineages belonging to Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium and Burkholderia, as well as a non-symbiotic group of Agrobacterium. The Rhizobium group contained twenty strains isolated from Mimosa pudica, Crotalaria pallida and two species of Trifolium. Fifteen of them were R. leguminosarum. Twenty-one strains isolated from four species of Trifolium, Crotalaria and Mimosa were classified into five groups of Bradyrhizobium, including B. japonicum. Agrobacterium group composed of 20 isolates from Mimosa pudica, C. pallida and Trifolium fragiferum. In addition, several strains of Sinorhizobium and Mesorhizobium associated with Trifolium and Burkholderia associated with Mimosa pudica were also identified. The predominance of Bradyrhizobium in the nodules of Trifolium was a novel finding and it demonstrated that the nodule microsymbionts might be selected by both the geographic factors and the legume hosts. 3aAgrobacterium 3aBradyrhizobium 3aBurkholderia 3aCrotalaria pallida 3aMesorhizobium 3aMimosa pudica 3aRhizobium 3aSinorhizobium 3aTrifolium fragiferum 3abacteria 3ahosts 3alegumes 3amicrosymbionts 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anumerical taxonomy 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal DNA 3aroot nodules 3asubtropics 3atropics 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aBiodiversity 2aBradyrhizobiumxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBurkholderiaxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCrotalariaxmicrobiology 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFabaceaexmicrobiology 2aGenetic Variation 2aMimosaxmicrobiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRhizobiumxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSinorhizobiumxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTrifoliumxmicrobiology 3aChina 0aChina 0aDiversity 0aRhizobia1 aWang, En Tao 1 aLi, Ying 1 aChen, Wen Xin 0 tArchives of microbiology.g2007 July, v. 188, no. 1 p.1-14dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-007-0209-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070722b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04329naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245016400185300001600349520148200365650003101847650002001878650001801898650001901916650002101935650001801956650004601974650001602020650001002036650004302046650001202089650001702101650006602118650001302184650001502197650002502212650002702237650001202264650001802276650001502294650000902309650001102318650006302329650006702392650002702459650002402486650004102510650002502551650003802576650004102614650006402655650002602719650002402745650005802769650002102827650002602848650003402874650003102908650002202939650004802961650006803009651001003077653001403087653001403101653001603115653001803131700002003149700001803169700002103187700002103208773012003229852000903349856008503358930003303443946001103476655001203487IND4395037320221121065836.0070916e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439503732DNAL7 a175302282pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-007-0250-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Sang-ch'ŏl.10aIsolation and structural analysis of bamylocin A, novel lipopeptide from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LP03 having antagonistic and crude oil-emulsifying activity  ap. 307-312.  aBacillus amyloliquefaciens strain LP03 isolated from soil, produced an antagonistic compound that strongly inhibited the growth of plant-pathogenic fungi and a lipopeptide biosurfactant. Also, isolated strain LP03 had a marked crude oil-emulsifying activity as it developed a clear zone around the colony after incubation for 24 h at 37°C. LP03 was identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens by analysis of partial 16 S rRNA gene and partial gyrA gene sequence. The lipopeptide was purified by acid precipitation of cell-free culture broth, extraction of the precipitates with methanol, silica gel column chromatography, and reverse-phase, high-pressure liquid chromatography. The purified biosurfactant was analyzed biochemical structure by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). The masses of the two peaks were observed by HPLC chromatography. Their masses were determined to be 1,044 and 1,058 m/z with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. As constituents of the peptide and lipophilic part of the m/z 1,022.6, seven amino acids (Glu-Leu-Met-Leu-Pro-Leu-Leu) and β-hydroxy-C13 fatty acid were determined by ESI-MS/MS. The lipopeptide of 1,022.6 Da differed from surfactins in the substitution of leucine, valine and aspartic acid in positions 3, 4, and 5 by methionine, leucine, and proline, respectively. Novel lipopeptide was designated as bamylocin A. 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aacid deposition 3aaspartic acid 3abiosurfactants 3acell free system 3aculture media 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afatty acids 3agenes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleucine 3alipopeptides 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amethanol 3amethionine 3anucleotide sequences 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aproline 3aribosomal RNA 3asilica gel 3asoil 3avaline 2aAntifungal Agentsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aBacillusxchemistryxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aChemical Fractionation 2aChromatography, Gel 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDNA Gyrasexgenetics 2aDNA, Fungalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEmulsifying Agentsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFungixdrug effects 2aLipoproteinsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aMolecular Weight 2aPetroleumxmetabolism 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 0aKorea 0aSurfactin 0aBamylocin 0aLipopeptide 0aBiosurfactant1 aKim, Sŏn-hŭi.1 aPark, In-Hye 1 aChung, Soo-Yeol 1 aChoi, Yong-Lark 0 tArchives of microbiology.g2007 Oct., v. 188, no. 4 p.307-312dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-007-0250-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20070916b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02645naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245014000211300001600351520150300367650001701870650001601887650001201903653002501915653003101940700002401971700002401995700002302019773011502042852000902157856008502166930003302251946001102284655001202295IND4451490720221121061338.0110326e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445149072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10552-011-9734-72doi7 aPMC31135212pmcid7 a213274602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuder, Elizabeth H. 10aBirth characteristics and female sex hormone concentrations during adolescence: results from the Dietary Intervention Study in Children  ap. 611-621.  aBackground Birth characteristics and adult hormone concentrations influence breast cancer risk, but little is known about the influence of birth characteristics on hormone concentrations, particularly during adolescence. Methods We evaluated the association of birth characteristics (birth weight, birth length, and gestational age) with serum sex hormone concentrations during late childhood and adolescence in 278 female participants of the Dietary Intervention Study in Children. Repeated measures analysis of variance models were used to assess the relationships of birth characteristics and serum estrogens and androgens at five different time points over a mean period of 7 years. Results In analyses that did not take into account time from blood draw until menarche, birth weight was inversely associated with pre-menarche concentrations of estradiol, estrone sulfate, androstenedione, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). In the post-menarche analyses, birth weight was not significantly associated with concentration of any of the hormones under investigation. Birth length and gestational age were not associated with hormone concentrations before or after menarche. Conclusion Birth weight is inversely associated with sex hormone concentrations before menarche in the model unadjusted for time from blood draw until menarche. Impact The in utero environment has long-term influences on the hormonal milieu, which could potentially contribute to breast cancer risk. 3abirth weight 3aadolescence 3apuberty 0aSex steroid hormones 0aBreast cancer risk factors1 aHartman, Terryl J. 1 aRovine, Michael J. 1 aDorgan, Joanne F. 0 tCancer causes & control.g2011 Apr., v. 22, no. 4 p.611-621dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-011-9734-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20110327b20110402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03836naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245016600183300001600349500001500365520127800380650002301658650002201681650002101703650003101724650001801755650001501773650001501788650002301803650002801826650004301854650001201897650001801909650001201927650001101939650002001950650001401970650001001984650002001994650001702014650002002031650001002051650002002061650001602081650002502097650001402122650002102136650000702157650001802164650001302182650002902195650002902224650004002253650003102293650003002324650003402354650008202388650002202470650001402492651001002506651001002516651001002526653002602536653001302562653001402575653002702589700001902616700001702635700001902652700001702671700001802688773013802706852000902844856008502853930003302938946001102971655001202982IND4393271520221121061402.0070722e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439327152DNAL7 a175415552pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-007-0211-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKan, Feng Ling10aCharacterization of symbiotic and endophytic bacteria isolated from root nodules of herbaceous legumes grown in Qinghai-Tibet plateau and in other zones of China  ap. 103-115.  a2019-12-05  aQinghai-Tibet plateau is the highest place in the world and the environment in that plateau is hard for animals and plants, with low temperature, low concentration of oxygen and high solar radiation. In this study, 61 root nodule isolates from Vicia, Oxytropis, Medicago, Melilotus and Onobrychis species grown in Qinghai-Tibet plateau and in loess plateau were comparatively characterized. Based upon the results of numerical taxonomy, ARDRA, AFLP, DNA-DNA hybridization and 16S rDNA sequencing, the isolates were classified as Rhizobium leguminosarum, Sinorhizobium meliloti, Sinorhizobium fredii, Mesorhizobium sp., Phyllobacterium sp., Stenotrophomonas sp. and two non-symbiotic groups related to Agrobacterium and Enterobacteriaceae. The strains isolated from Qinghai-Tibet plateau and from the loess plateau were mixed in these species or groups. Oxytropis spp. and Medicago archiducis-nicolai grown in Qinghai-Tibet plateau were recorded as new hosts for R. leguminosarum, as well as Oxytropis glabra and Medicago lupulina for S. fredii. In addition, strains resistant to high alkaline (pH 11) and high concentration of NaCl (3-5%, w/v) were found in each of the rhizobial species. This was the first systematic study of rhizobia isolated from Qinghai-Tibet plateau. 3anumerical taxonomy 3aMedicago lupulina 3aStenotrophomonas 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aAgrobacterium 3aendophytes 3aOnobrychis 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aanimals 3aribosomal DNA 3alegumes 3aoxygen 3asolar radiation 3aOxytropis 3ahosts 3aPhyllobacterium 3aroot nodules 3aplants (botany) 3aVicia 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 3aSinorhizobium fredii 3aMelilotus 3aEnsifer meliloti 3apH 3aMesorhizobium 3abacteria 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aFabaceaexmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRhizobiaceaexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSymbiosis 3aChina 0aChina 0aTibet 0aQinghai-Tibet plateau 0aRhizobia 0aEndophyte 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aChen, Zhong Yi1 aWang, En Tao1 aTian, Chang Fu1 aSui, Xin Hua1 aChen, Wen Xin0 tArchives of microbiology.g2007 Aug., v. 188, no. 2 p.103-115dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-VerlagwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-007-0211-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20070722b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02076naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245014100164300001600305520082600321650001501147650001701162650001501179650002301194650002501217650001001242651001001252651002101262653002701283653001901310653001001329700002101339700002001360700002401380700002001404773010201424852000901526856008501535930003301620946001301653655001201666IND4450661120221121061454.0110316e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445066112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10528-010-9395-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoh, Hung Sun 10aGenetic Distinctiveness of the Korean Red-Backed Vole (Myodes regulus) from Korea, Revealed by Mitochondrial Cytochrome b Gene Sequences  ap. 153-160.  aTo examine the taxonomic status of the Korean red-backed vole (Myodes regulus), the full cytochrome b sequences of 21 red-backed voles from Korea and northeast China were compared with the corresponding haplotypes from 12 species of Myodes and Eothenomys from GenBank. We identified five red-backed voles from Mount Changbai and Harbin as Myodes rufocanus and three from Harbin as M. rutilus, and we confirmed that the red-backed voles from Korea are M. regulus and not Eothenomys regulus. We found that M. regulus from Korea differed from the other five species of Myodes and that the interspecific distances between M. regulus and each of the two species from northeast China were 4.55% (M. rufocanus) and 11.1% (M. rutilus).

The optimum activity of Ac1 is at pH 7.0 and 53.2°C (over 20 min). Ac1 can degrade a broad range of substrates including casein, gelatin, bovine serum albumin, collagen, and nematode cuticles. Moreover, the enzyme can immobilize the free-living nematode Panagrellus redivivus and the pine wood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, indicating Ac1 may be involved in infection against nematodes. The encoding gene of Ac1 contains one intron of 60-bp and two exons encoding a polypeptide of 411 amino acid residues. The deduced polypeptide sequence of Ac1 showed a high degree of similarity to two previously reported serine proteases PII and Mlx from other nematode-trapping fungi (81% aa sequence identity). However, three proteases Ac1, Aoz1 and Mlx showed optimum temperatures at 53.2, 45 and 65°C, respectively. Compared to PII, Ac1 appears to have a significantly higher activity against gelatin, bovine serum albumin, and non-denatured collagen. Moreover, our bioassay experiments showed that Ac1 is more effective at immobilizing P. redivivus than B. xylophilus. 3apolypeptides 3asequence analysis 3aPanagrellus redivivus 3aserine proteinases 3amolecular weight 3afree-living nematodes 3acollagen 3abioassays 3aamino acids 3abovine serum albumin 3acasein 3apH 3anematophagous fungi 3agelatin 3atemperature 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3aexons 3aArthrobotrys 3aintrons 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAscomycotaxenzymologyxpathogenicity. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNematodaxchemistryxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Alignment 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aTemperature 0aProtease purification 0aNematicidal activity 0agenes 0aArthrobotrys conoides1 aLi, Juan 1 aLiang, Lianming 1 aTian, Baoyu 1 aZhang, Ying 1 aCheng, Chunmei 1 aZhang, Ke-Qin 0 tArchives of microbiology.g2007 Aug., v. 188, no. 2 p.167-174dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-007-0233-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070722b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02324naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245007800184300001600262520063400278650002100912650002000933650001100953650001300964650002000977650001500997650002101012650002401033650002901057650004601086650002501132650003801157650004101195650004001236650004201276650001101318650004701329650004601376650005501422653001501477653001501492700002001507700002001527773012001547852000901667856008601676930003301762946001101795655001201806IND4391515720221121061311.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439151572DNAL7 a172779492pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-006-0207-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerg, Thorsten 10aRegulation of the chitobiose-phosphotransferase system in Vibrio cholerae  ap. 433-439.  aVibrio cholerae harbours a phosphotransferase system (PTS) enabling the organism to utilise chitosan oligosaccharide, e.g. derived from deacetylated chitin. As shown recently, this utilization system is encoded by the ORFs VC1281-1283 (Meibom et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 101:2524-2529, 2004). By using a transcriptional reporter fusion technique, we identified the regulator of the system and characterised gene expression. Furthermore, we found that gene expression of this PTS system is influenced by catabolite regulation and also by an Mlc homologue (VC2007), which in E. coli is a global regulator of sugar metabolism. 3aEscherichia coli 3aVibrio cholerae 3achitin 3achitosan 3agene expression 3ametabolism 3aoligosaccharides 3aopen reading frames 3atranscription (genetics) 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChitosanxmetabolism 2aCyclic AMPxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDisaccharidesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aOperon 2aPhosphotransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRepressor Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aVibrio choleraexenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aChitobiose 0achs operon1 aSchild, Stefan 1 aReidl, Joachim 0 tArchives of microbiology.g2007 June, v. 187, no. 6 p.433-439dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-006-0207-43Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03421naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245013500187300001600322500001500338520132200353650002701675650002601702650002101728650002101749650002901770650001101799650001801810650002401828650002101852650003301873650004101906650004101947650004201988650005302030650002202083650002102105650003002126650006102156650003602217650002702253653001302280653003802293653000902331653003202340653000902372653000802381700001902389700002402408700002102432700002102453700002902474700002202503773012002525852000902645856008502654930003302739946001102772655001202783IND4398530120221121061318.0071209e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439853012DNAL7 a176393482pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-007-0281-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Daniela 10aTranscription and regulation of the hydrogenase(s) accessory genes, hypFCDEAB, in the cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula CCAP 1446/4  ap. 609-617.  a2019-12-05  aLyngbya majuscula CCAP 1446/4 is a filamentous cyanobacterium possessing both an uptake and a bi-directional hydrogenase. The presence of a single copy of the hyp operon in the cyanobacterial genomes suggests that these accessory genes might be responsible for the maturation of both hydrogenases. We investigated the concomitant transcription of hypFCDEAB with the hydrogenases structural genes--hup and hox. RT-PCRs performed with L. majuscula cells grown under different physiological conditions showed a substantial decrease in the relative amount of hupL transcript under non-N₂-fixing conditions. In contrast, no significant differences were observed for the transcript levels of hypFCDEAB in all conditions tested, while minor fluctuations could be discerned for hoxH. Previously, it was demonstrated that the transcriptional regulators NtcA and LexA interact with the promoter regions of hup and hox, respectively, and that putative binding sites for both proteins are present in the hyp promoter of L. majuscula. Therefore, a putative involvement of NtcA and LexA in the regulation of the hyp transcription was investigated. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays resulted in NtcA or LexA-bound retarded fragments, suggesting the involvement of these proteins in the transcriptional regulation of hypFCDEAB. 3aferredoxin hydrogenase 3atranscription factors 3aMoorea producens 3astructural genes 3atranscription (genetics) 3aoperon 3abinding sites 3agel electrophoresis 3apromoter regions 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aCyanobacteriaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aElectrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aHydrogenasexbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNitrogen Fixation 2aOperonxgenetics 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxgenetics 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aproteins 0aTranscriptional regulator factors 0aNtcA 0aHydrogenase accessory genes 0aLexA 0ahyp1 aLeitão, Elsa 1 aSjöholm, Johannes 1 aOliveira, Paulo 1 aLindblad, Peter 1 aMoradas-Ferreira, Pedro 1 aTamagnini, Paula 0 tArchives of microbiology.g2007 Dec., v. 188, no. 6 p.609-617dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-007-0281-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20071209b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02897naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245016200190300001600352520082000368650002501188650000801213650002101221650002201242650001701264650002401281650001001305650001401315650002601329650001001355650006101365650001201426650006201438650002701500650002301527650004101550650003101591650003101622650002001653650001401673650001101687650001601698650002201714650002801736650002701764650001001791650003301801651001301834653002801847653002001875653001901895653002301914653002201937700003001959773012001989852000902109856008502118930003302203946001102236655001202247IND4399887920221121044741.0080113e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439988792DNAL7 a178467492pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-007-0302-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPowthongchin, Busaba 10aHigh level of soluble expression in Escherichia coli and characterisation of the CyaA pore-forming fragment from a Bordetella pertussis Thai clinical isolate  ap. 169-174.  aBordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin-haemolysin (CyaA) can permeabilise erythrocytes by forming lytic pores. Here, a gene segment encoding CyaA pore-forming (CyaA-PF) domain cloned from genomic DNA of B. pertussis Thai isolate was over-expressed in Escherichia coli as a 126-kDa soluble protein which cross-reacted with anti-RTX monoclonal antibody. By co-expressing with acyltransferase CyaC, the CyaA-PF protein was found palmitoylated at Lys⁹⁸³. Unlike E. coli lysate with the non-acylated form, the lysate containing acylated CyaA-PF exhibited high haemolytic activity against sheep erythrocytes. This study presents that the recombinant CyaA-PF protein comprising pore-forming domain can be expressed separately as soluble native-folded precursor that conserves at least part of its functionality. 3aBordetella pertussis 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aadenylate cyclase 3aerythrocytes 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahemolysis 3amonoclonal antibodies 3asheep 2aAdenylate Cyclase Toxinxgeneticsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aAnimals 2aBordetella pertussisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aErythrocytesxdrug effects 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aHemolysis 2aHumans 2aLipoylation 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSheep 2aWhooping Coughxmicrobiology 0aThailand 0aAdenylate cyclase toxin 0aAcyltransferase 0aPalmitoylation 0aPore-forming toxin 0aSheep erythrocyte1 aAngsuthanasombat, Chanan 0 tArchives of microbiology.g2008 Feb., v. 189, no. 2 p.169-174dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-007-0302-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03386naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002900164245015800193300001600351520144700367650001701814650001001831650001301841650001901854650002201873650001701895650001501912650001901927650001401946650001701960650001301977650001601990650001602006650001302022650008702035650004102122650001202163650001802175650001402193650003502207650003002242650001102272650002502283650003502308650001402343653002402357653002402381653003002405653002202435653002202457700003502479773012002514852000902634856008502643930003302728946001102761655001202772IND4396225220221121044853.0071021e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439622522DNAL7 a175690302pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-007-0264-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Rocha-Azevedo, Bruno 10aBiological characterization of a clinical and an environmental isolate of Acanthamoeba polyphaga: analysis of relevant parameters to decode pathogenicity  ap. 441-449.  aAcanthamoeba spp. consists of free-living amoebae, widespread in nature, which occasionally can cause human infections including granulomatous amoebic encephalitis and amoebic keratitis. Acanthamoeba pathogenesis is not entirely known and correlations between pathogenic potential and taxonomy are complex issues. In order to decipher the definition of a pathogenic amoeba, the objective of this work was to decipher the definition of pathogenic amoeba by characterizing two isolates of Acanthamoeba polyphaga obtained from different origins (a keratitis patient and freshwater), looking for differences among them. The clinical isolate grew faster in Peptone-yeast extract-glucose (PYG) medium, transformed more rapidly from a trophozoite to cyst and exhibited increased cytopathic effect on cultured cells. Morphological differences were also noted, since freshwater amoebae presented more acanthopodia than the clinical isolate. Moreover, actin labeling demonstrated that microfilament organization varies between isolates, with the presence of locomotory structures as lobopodia and lamellipodia in the keratitis isolate, which were less adherent on plastic. Zymography demonstrated that the keratitis isolates presented higher proteolytic activity and also were more able to invade collagen matrices.

CPT I activity (i.e. activity per g of liver tissue), was elevated in animals fed the the OO, SO or MO diets compared with those fed the LF or HCO diets. Feeding the HCO diet did not result in elevation of CPT I activity compared with feeding the LF diet. CPT I specific activity (i.e. activity per mg mitochondrial protein) was elevated in animals fed SO diet, but not in animals fed any of the other high fat diets. These observations suggest that an elevated fat load is not solely responsible for increasing CPT I activity, but that the fatty acid composition of the diet also plays a role. Hepatic CPT I activity of rats fed the LF diet was most sensitive to inhibition by malonyl CoA ([I50]= 0.53 micromolar). Each of the high fat diets decreased the sensitivity of CPT I to inhibition by malonyl CoA, CPT I activity in the livers from animals fed the MO diet was the least sensitive to malonyl CoA inhibition ([I50]= 1.8 micromolar). The fatty acid compositions of the major mitochondrial membrane phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin were modified according to the fatty acid composition of the diet. Each of these phospholipids had a distinct fatty acid composition and similar effects of dietary lipid manipulation on the fatty acid compositions were observed. Feeding the SO diet resulted in fatty acid compositions which were most similar to those found after feeding the LF diet. Feeding the HCO and OO diets increased the proportions of stearic and oleic acids, respectively, while decreasing the proportion of linoleic acid. Feeding the MO diet resulted in increased proportions of palmitic, palmitoleic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids and decreased proportions of linoleic and arachidonic acids in each of the phospholipids. It is proposed that the effects of dietary lipid manipulation upon CPT I activity and sensitivity to inhibition by malonyl CoA are due to alterations in the fatty acid composition of the phospholipids in the mitochondrial membrane where CPT I resides. 3adietary fat 3acoconut oil 3aolive oil 3asafflower oil 3amenhaden oil 3acarnitine palmitoyltransferase 3aphospholipids 3apalmitic acid 3apalmitoleic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3amitochondria 3aliver 3arats 2aAnimals 2aArachidonic Acidxmetabolism 2aCardiolipinsxmetabolism 2aCarnitine O-Palmitoyltransferasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDocosahexaenoic Acidsxpharmacology 2aEicosapentaenoic Acidxpharmacology 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aFatty Acids, Monounsaturatedxpharmacology 2aFish Oilsxadministration & dosage 2aLinoleic Acid 2aLinoleic Acidsxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMalonyl Coenzyme Axpharmacology 2aMitochondria, Liverxmetabolism 2aPalmitic Acid 2aPalmitic Acidsxmetabolism 2aPhosphatidylcholinesxmetabolism 2aPhosphatidylethanolaminesxmetabolism 2aPhospholipidsxmetabolism 2aPlant Oilsxadministration & dosage 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Lew 2aSafflower Oilxadministration & dosage1 aYaqoob, P.1 aHarvey, D.J.1 aNewsholme, E.A.1 aCalder, P.C.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1994 Oct., v. 34, no. 4 p.671-684x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19950203b19950222c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03111naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008700125300001600212500011900228520177400347650001702121650001302138650001702151650001202168650001302180650001402193650001802207650001902225650001202244650001402256650001202270650000902282650001902291650001402310650001002324651001802334700002202352700001802374700001902392700001502411773007402426852000902500856008802509939003302597946001102630655001202641IND4480468820221121023807.0140429e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448046882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaiser, C.10aEffects of soluble potassium silicate soil drenching on sweet cherry fruit quality  ap. 339-346.  aPaper presented at the Six International Cherry Symposium, held November 15-19, 2009, Renaca, Vina del Mar, Chile.  aFruit firmness (g mm-1) and stem-pull force (g) (retention force between the pedicel and the fruit) are important factors affecting marketability of fresh sweet cherry fruit; USA export minima are >700 g mm-1 and >250 g, respectively. Up to 3 soil applications of soluble 1% potassium silicate (28% Si) applied to the drip area, every 3 weeks from flowering, had an effect on both parameters. In 2007, at harvest, treated ‘Bing’ fruit were firmer (P<0.001) than untreated control fruit (409 v. 386 g mm-1). In 2008, treatments had no effect on ‘Bing’ fruit firmness at harvest; however, after 2 weeks of regular atmosphere storage at 2°C, treated fruit were firmer (329 g mm-1) than untreated control fruit (320 g mm-1) (P<0.001). Treated ‘Royal Rainier’ fruit were firmer at harvest (291 g mm-1) than untreated control fruit (274 g mm-1) as well as after 2 weeks cold storage (289 v. 269 g mm-1). Treated ‘Sandra Rose’ fruit also were firmer at harvest (289 g mm-1) than untreated control fruit (282 g mm-1) (P<0.001). In 2008, stem pull force of all untreated fruit decreased between the day of harvest and 2 weeks of cold storage (‘Bing’ = 1008 g to 816 g; ‘Royal Rainier’ = 1213 g to 1097 g; and ‘Sandra Rose’ = 992 g to 815 g, respectively) (P<0.001). In contrast, stem pull force of all treated fruit decreased less after two weeks cold storage (‘Bing’ = 1,026 g to 890 g; ‘Royal Rainier’ = 1,165 g to 1,159 g; and ‘Sandra Rose’ = 1,052 g to 1,002 g) (P<0.001). Our preliminary findings suggest that regular soil-drenching of cherry trees with soluble potassium silicate during the growing season has the potential to increase cherry fruit firmness and stem pull force without affecting fruit size or sweetness negatively. 3aPrunus avium 3acherries 3acold storage 3aexports 3afirmness 3aflowering 3afruit quality 3agrowing season 3apedicel 3apotassium 3asilicon 3asoil 3asoil drenching 3asweetness 3atrees 3aUnited States1 aChristensen, J.M.1 aWhiting, M.D.1 aAzarenko, A.N.1 aLong, L.E.0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 Feb., , no. 1020 p.339-346x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1020/1020_47.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140429  aNon-US 7aarticle02498naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010200128300001600230500011900246520142000365650001701785650001301802650000901815650001201824650001101836650002601847650000901873650001001882650002201892700001901914773007401933852000902007856008802016939003302104946001102137655001202148IND4480465020221121023748.0140429e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448046502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZoffoli, J.P.10aFruit temperature affects physical injury sensitivity of sweet cherry during postharvest handling  ap. 111-114.  aPaper presented at the Six International Cherry Symposium, held November 15-19, 2009, Renaca, Vina del Mar, Chile.  aSweet cherry fruit is considered very sensitive to physical injury produced during harvest and postharvest handling. Surface depression (pitting and bruising) appears on the injured fruit area after a week of storage at 0°C. Two trials were conducted on ‘Van’, ‘Royal Dawn’, or ‘Sweetheart’ sweet cherry to test the hypothesis that fruit becomes more sensitive to physical injury at lower temperatures. In the laboratory trial, the incidence of impact damage was evaluated by dropping a steel ball at ten cm height on fruits with 2, 7, 10 or 15°C pulp temperature. A significant reduction in pitting incidence was obtained when the fruit temperature was increased from 2°C to 7°C or 10°C for ‘Van’ and ‘Royal Dawn’. In the packing line trial, ‘Sweetheart’ fruit were placed on a commercial packing line using cold water to achieve a 2.5-3.8°C or 5.3-6.3°C fruit temperature. The incidence of pitting and bruising from fruit handling at 5.3-6.3°C was 30.9% compared with 70.8% when the fruit temperature was in the range of 2.5-3.8°C. Evaluations comparing the different sectors of the packing line demonstrated that fruit at low temperature was more sensitive to develop small pit symptoms and these were mainly induced at the stem cutting sector. Therefore, water temperature management along the cherry processing line is required to reduce surface pitting symptoms after storage. 3aPrunus avium 3acherries 3acold 3acutting 3afruits 3apostharvest treatment 3apulp 3asteel 3awater temperature1 aRodríguez, J.0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 Feb., , no. 1020 p.111-114x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1020/1020_13.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140429  aNon-US 7aarticle02510naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006900127300001600196500011900212520140100331650001701732650001301749650001701762650001001779650001601789650002301805650001401828650001201842650001101854650002601865650001001891700002001901773007401921852000901995856008802004939003302092946001102125655001202136IND4480465820221121013111.0140429e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448046582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomano, G.S.10aPostharvest colour dynamics of 'Bing' and 'Newstar' sweet cherry  ap. 153-156.  aPaper presented at the Six International Cherry Symposium, held November 15-19, 2009, Renaca, Vina del Mar, Chile.  aIn sweet cherry, exocarp colour is important to consumer perception of quality. Besides the intrinsic quality of each cherry, batch homogeneity (size and colour) is recognized as a parameter of commercial quality. During the packing process, homogeneity is improved by grading and selection. However, fruit heterogeneity in the orchard might result in differential quality dynamics during postharvest. The objective of this study was to analyse the dynamics of ‘Bing’ and ‘Newstar’ sweet cherry fruit colour during postharvest as affected by between-trees variability. Fruits of colour 4 (CTIFL colour chart) were collected for objective colour parameters and indices from harvest through multiple postharvest samplings from cold storage. Colour was measured with a colorimeter Minolta® Cr 400 and the HUE angle, Colour Difference, Colour Index and Chroma were calculated. There were no clear patterns in the changes of HUE angle and Colour Index during postharvest. In both cultivars, there were significant differences between trees in Chroma and Colour Difference at harvest. Chroma decreased and Colour Difference increased linearly in time, but there were differences in the models fitted for each tree. Between-tree colour variability at harvest and variable colour dynamics during postharvest handling may constitute a restriction for obtaining homogeneous batches at sale points. 3aPrunus avium 3acherries 3acold storage 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3aconsumer attitudes 3acultivars 3aexocarp 3amodels 3apostharvest treatment 3atrees1 aCittadini, E.D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 Feb., , no. 1020 p.153-156x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1020/1020_21.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140429  aNon-US 7aarticle02402naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002200128245008500150300001600235520108500251650001801336650000901354650002601363650002201389650001601411650000801427650003101435650002701466650004201493650002901535650003001564650001101594650000901605650002801614650004101642650002701683700001701710700002101727700002401748773010601772852000901878930003301887945001301920946001101933655001201944IND2048188320221121012949.0951010e199508  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204818832DNAL7 a75810132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBandyopadhyay, B.10aSerum zinc level : a possible index in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer syndrome  ap. 965-972.  aThe present investigation shows a possible correlation between serum zinc level and peptic ulcer disease/syndrome and a plausible mechanism for the finding.

A significant increased value (P < 0.01) of zinc content in gastric mucosa of patients with peptic ulcer diathesis was noted. Carbonic anhydrase, a major zinc containing enzyme was also determined in erythrocytes. However, no change of erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase content was noted. To assess the nutritional status of the patients in relation to the low serum zinc value, serum albumin level was also determined. The low serum zinc level of the peptic ulcer patients is possibly due to the positive shift for the zinc from serum to the gastric mucosa. 3apeptic ulcers 3azinc 3acarbonate dehydratase 3aintestinal mucosa 3ablood serum 3amen 2aCarbonic Anhydrasesxblood 2aDisease Susceptibility 2aDuodenal Ulcerxbloodxcomplications. 2aErythrocytesxenzymology 2aGastric Mucosaxchemistry 2aHumans 2aMale 2aSerum Albuminxanalysis 2aStomach Ulcerxbloodxcomplications. 2aZincxanalysisxblood.1 aBanerjee, P.1 aBhattacharya, B.1 aBandyopadhyay, S.K.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1995 Aug., v. 36, no. 5 p.965-972x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02760naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002100128245004700149300001800196500001500214520110300229650002001332650001901352650001201371650000901383650000901392650001701401650001201418650001601430650001701446650001801463650001801481650001601499650001501515650001801530650002301548650001101571650002701582650002001609650002301629650002501652650002501677650003101702650001901733650002001752653002201772653001401794653002501808653002201833653001201855653001901867700002001886700002301906700001901929773010801948852000902056930003302065945001302098946001102111655001202122IND2053782420221121012918.0961029e199608  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205378242DNAL7 a88769802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeprintsev, D.B.10aPb2+ and Hg2+ binding to alpha-lactalbumin  ap. 1255-1265.  a2019-12-05  aInteractions of human alpha-lactalbumin with Pb2+ and Hg2+ were studied by intrinsic protein fluorescence. Lead ions bind to the strong Ca2+ binding site of alpha-lactalbumin (association constant K(ass) approximately = 2 X 10(6) M-1) with concomitant spectral changes which are similar to those induced by the binding of Ca2+. Pb2+ also binds to the strong Zn2+ site with K(ass) 10(5) M-1 and some secondary binding site(s) (which probably contain histidine residues) with apparent K(ass) 10(4) M-1, causing pronounced aggregation of the protein. Mercury ions bind to alpha-lactalbumin at the primary Zn2+ sites with K(ass) approximately (1-4) X 10(4) M-1, although the stoichiometry of the binding depends on the conformational state of the protein. Secondary Hg2+ binding sites were suggested to contain histidines, while the strong Hg2+ site contains carboxylates in the coordination sphere and scans to coincide with the strong Zn2+ site. The binding of both Pb2+ and Hg2+ decreases the thermal stability of the Ca2+-loaded protein and in some conditions causes pronounced protein aggregation. 3aprotein folding 3aheat stability 3amercury 3azinc 3alead 3afluorescence 3acalcium 3alactalbumin 3adenaturation 3abinding sites 3astoichiometry 3atemperature 3ametal ions 2aBinding Sites 2aCalciumxchemistry 2aHumans 2aLactalbuminxchemistry 2aLeadxchemistry 2aMercuryxchemistry 2aProtein Conformation 2aProtein Denaturation 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aThermodynamics 2aZincxchemistry 0aprotein structure 0astructure 0aprotein conformation 0abinding constants 0abinding 0ainorganic ions1 aPermyakov, E.A.1 aKalinichenko, L.P.1 aBerliner, L.J.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1996 Aug., v. 39, no. 6 p.1255-1265x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02803naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001200128245010100140300001600241520101100257650001801268650002101286650001001307650001101317650001901328650001701347650001201364650002801376650002701404650001701431650003601448650002201484650003601506650003901542650003801581650004501619650001801664650002301682650004901705650002501754650003601779650004001815650004201855653001701897653001501914700001401929700001301943700001201956700001401968700001201982700001201994700001102006773010602017852000902123930003302132945001302165946001102178655001202189IND2047424420221121012748.0950821e199507  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204742442DNAL7 a85281522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Q.10aFluorescence spectroscopic study of the interaction of adenine and nucleotide with trichosanthin  ap. 889-895.  aTrichosanthin (TCS) is an N-glycosidase that can attack the 28s rRNA of the ribosome at a highly conserved adenine residue. The interactions of adenine and its derivative nucleotides with TCS are reported. The fluorescence of Trp 192 of TCS is sensitive to the proximity of adenine, and produces a marked red shift indicative of tryptophan in a more hydrophilic environment. By contrast AMP and ATP quench the maximal emission at 328 nm. The binding of the adenine and ATP with TCS result in lower tryptophan accessibility to the quencher acrylamide, but higher tryptophan accessibility to the quencher iodide, while AMP causes higher tryptophan accessibility to acrylamide, and lower tryptophan accessibility to iodide. Also, the binding of nucleotides induces tryptophan heterogeneity in the protein. These findings lead us to propose that binding of nucleotides and adenine base cause different microenvironmental changes of the tryptophan residue, and Trp 192 may be involved in the active site of TCS. 3aCucurbitaceae 3amedicinal plants 3aroots 3atubers 3aplant proteins 3aglycosidases 3aadenine 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3afluorescence 3achemical constituents of plants 3aspectral analysis 2aAdeninexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aAdenosine Monophosphatexchemistry 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexchemistry 2aAntiviral Agentsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aConserved Sequence 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProtein Conformation 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 28Sxmetabolism 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescencexmethods 2aTrichosanthinxchemistryxmetabolism. 0ainteractions 0atianhuafen1 aZhang, Y.1 aYang, H.1 aLiu, G.1 aHuang, Z.1 aLiu, B.1 aYao, Q.1 aLi, Q.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1995 July, v. 36, no. 4 p.889-895x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02789naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245009000146300001600236520131900252650001001571650001001581650001501591650001601606650002301622650002801645650002701673650002201700650001801722650002001740650001201760650005401772650002601826650001101852650003701863650003201900650004901932650000901981650001001990650002602000653001702026700002302043700001702066700001602083773010602099852000902205930003302214945001302247946001102260655001202271IND2052416420221120223645.0960802e199603  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205241642DNAL7 a88296162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGumpricht, E.10aGlutathione-dependent protection against lipid peroxidation in sheep liver microsomes  ap. 559-567.  aIn the present studies we have described a glutathione-dependent system in sheep liver microsomes that protects against membrane lipid peroxidation initiated by either Fe+2/NADPH or Fe+2/ascorbate. Glutathione protected against lipid peroxidation in microsomes containing a wide range of alpha-tocopherol levels (0.02-0.11 micrograms/mg protein). The addition of glutathione disulfide alone had no effect on microsomal lipid peroxidation; however, it prolonged the protection afforded by glutathione, particularly in assays containing Fe+2/NADPH. Whereas the glutathione-dependent protection was very labile, with loss of activity demonstrated in microsomes stored at 4 degrees C for 24 hours, the combined effect of glutathione and glutathione disulfide was not affected by storage. The glutathione S-transferase inhibitors, bromosulphothalein and S-hexylglutathione, reversed the protection observed with glutathione, indicating a possible role for microsomal glutathione S-transferases in this protection, but not that observed by the combination of glutathione and glutathione disulfide. In general, our findings support previous results observed with rat liver microsomes and suggest that microsomal glutathione S-transferases may be involved in the glutathione-dependent protection in sheep liver microsomes. 3asheep 3aliver 3amicrosomes 3aglutathione 3alipid peroxidation 3aglutathione transferase 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aascorbic acid 3aNADP (coenzyme) 2aAnimals 2aGlutathionexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aGlutathione Disulfide 2aHumans 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aMembrane Lipidsxmetabolism 2aMicrosomes, Liverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aSheep 2aVitamin Exmetabolism 0aferrous ions1 aHildenbrandt, G.R.1 aScholz, R.W.1 aReddy, C.C.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1996 Mar., v. 38, no. 3 p.559-567x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01939naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245014700146300001600293520045900309650001700768650002300785650002900808650001700837650002300854650002000877650001200897650001700909650003100926650004000957650002400997650002601021650002901047650003501076650002701111650004101138653001501179653002801194700001901222700002301241700002001264773010701284852000901391930003301400945001301433946001101446655001201457IND2054139220221120223606.0961121e199609  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205413922DNAL7 a88862802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShankar, C.S.10aMitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activity and ability to tolerate acetaldehyde determine faster ethanol production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 145-150.  aIn rapidly fermenting yeast, the rotenone insensitive mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase was not completely repressed by high glucose.

To evaluate its adaptability in Hawaii Islands, we reported the growth performances of 213 F1 Angus Plus calve grazing on pasture. Least-square means of pre-weaning ADG ranged from 1,087 to 1,167 g in bull calves and from 1,030 to 1,048 g in heifer calves. The 205 d-adjusted weaning weight were 226 to 285 kg in bulls and 214 to 252 kg in heifers. The birth weight and hip height at birth were significantly correlated with weaning weight, 205 d-adjusted weaning weight, hip height at weaning and pre-weaning ADG (P < 0.01). Sire group significantly influenced pre-weaning growth performances through interaction with sex of calf. Bull calves from sire group of high growth were 1.0-3.8 kg heavier in birth weight than the bull calves from other sires (P < 0.001). Sire group x sex interaction was significant (P < 0.05) for calf birth weight, 205-d adjusted weaning weight and pre-weaning ADG.

The effects of AIP treatment on cell growth, PAL activity, contents and yields of total phenolic compound, salidroside and four phenylethanoid glycosides (PheGs) are investigated. The results demonstrated that, 0.5 and 2.0 μM AIP treatments had similar effects on the measurements investigated in this study. AIP treatment resulted in significant decreases in PAL activity, total phenolic compounds content, and PheGs content. Linear regression analysis showed that PAL activity had a high correlation coefficient with the total phenolic compound content and the four PheGs contents. Total PAL activity-time area under curve (AUC) had a high correlation coefficient with the total phenolic compound yield and the yields of five tested compounds in untreated cell samples. In AIP-treated cells, total PAL activity-time AUC retained a high correlation with the total phenolic compound yield and the yields of three tested compounds, echinacoside, acteoside, and tubuloside A, but not salidroside and cistanoside A. The difference could be caused by the different biosynthetic origins of each of the tested compounds. These results demonstrate the important role of PAL in the biosynthesis of PheGs in the suspension cell culture of C. deserticola. 3aCistanche 3aacid treatment 3abiosynthesis 3acell growth 3acell suspension culture 3acorrelation 3aglycosides 3alinear models 3aphenolic compounds 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aregression analysis 0aCistanche deserticola 0aSuspension cell culture 0aPhenylethanoid glycosides 0a2-Aminoindan-2-phosphonic acid (AIP) 0aPAL activity 0aSalidroside1 aHur, Yeon Jae 1 aJia, Jing Ming 1 aLee, Jai Heon 1 aChung, Y.

However, bone development in children has not been fully documented by longitudinal studies in Japanese children. The purpose of this study is to determine the degree of tracking of areal bone mineral density (aBMD) from pre-puberty to 6-year follow-up, and to determine the target period to achieve maximal peak aBMD. This study was conducted as the pediatric part of a larger cohort study, the Japanese Population-based Osteoporosis (JPOS) study. Of 448 children aged 9-12 years who completed the baseline survey, 225 participated in the follow-up study 6 years later (follow-up rate: 50.2%). aBMD at the forearm was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. aBMD values in pre-pubertal children at baseline showed a significant tracking correlation with aBMD obtained at 6-year follow-up in both genders (boys r = 0.655, girls r = 0.759). Although boys and girls in the lowest quartile of aBMD pre-pubertally had greater annual increases in aBMD from pre-puberty to 6-year follow-up than those in other aBMD quartiles, they still showed the lowest mean aBMD at 6-year follow-up. Children with lower pre-pubertal aBMD showed greater increases in BMD up until 6-year follow-up, but the increase was not great enough to catch up with other children. About 50% of the variance in aBMD at 6-year follow-up was determined by the aBMD achieved during the pre-pubertal period. Activities that increase aBMD are important not only for children during puberty, but also for younger pre-pubertal children. 3abiomarkers 3abone density 3askeletal development 3apuberty1 aIki, Masayuki 1 aIkeda, Yukihiro 1 aMorita, Akemi 1 aMatsukura, Tomoharu 1 aNishino, Harumi 1 aYamagami, Takashi 1 aKagamimori, Sadanobu 1 aKagawa, Yoshiko 1 aYoneshima, Hideo 0 tJournal of bone and mineral metabolism JBMM.g2011 Mar., v. 29, no. 2 p.208-216dJapan : Springer Japanx0914-87797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00774-010-0213-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20110316b20110402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03035naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245012600181300001600307520114800323650001501471650001601486650003801502650001001540650003101550650001901581650001001600650001301610650001201623650001201635650002901647650004801676650001001724650006101734650004901795650001001844650004901854650003101903651001301934651002801947653002101975653001901996653001102015653003002026700001802056700002302074700001802097700001602115700001902131700001602150773012902166852000902295856008502304930003302389946001102422655001202433IND4418051620221120201255.0090320e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441805162DNAL7 a187589872pmid7 a10.1007/s11250-008-9222-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, H.

It is difficult to raise strawberry plantlets at the main rain season. In this paper we describe a useful technology to raise strawberry plantlets in high temperature and humidity environments. (1) Use of disease-free planting material. Disinfectants like Cabrio and Mancozeb also can be used to sterilize the mother plants. (2) Soil disinfection and sterilization. Solar soil disinfection technology is a cost-effective method. Soil disinfectants such as chlorine dioxide and trichloroisocyanuric acid can also be used in the course of solarization. (3) Rain-shelter and shading cultivation. This measure can keep the plantlets free of rain. The most suitable sunshade net provides 80% shade. Under this cultivation, anthracnose disease incidence was reduced to 6.2% while the control was 61.7%. (4) Use of fungicide combinations. The intensified fungicides reduced the disease incidence to 8.7%, significantly lower than those of a single fungicide treatment. It's better to use plant growth retardants in order to grow fine plantlets by early July. Plantlet quality was increased significantly compared with the control. 3aanthracnose 3achlorine dioxide 3acost effectiveness 3adisease incidence 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3afungi 3afungicides 3ahumidity 3amancozeb 3aplant growth substances 3aplanting 3aplantlets 3arain 3ashade 3asoil 3asterilizing 3astrawberries 3atemperature 3aChina1 aMiao, L.

The clinical development of the tridentate chelator deferitrin (1, Table 1) was halted due to nephrotoxicity. It was then shown by replacing the 4′-(HO) of 1 with a 3,6,9-trioxadecyloxy group, the nephrotoxicity could be ameliorated. Further structure-activity relationship studies have established that the length and the position of the polyether backbone controlled: (1) the ligand's iron clearing efficiency (ICE), (2) chelator tissue distribution, (3) biliary ferrokinetics, and (4) tissue iron reduction. The current investigation compares the ICE and tissue distribution of a series of (S)-4,5-dihydro-2-[2-hydroxy-4-(polyether)phenyl]-4-methyl-4-thiazolecarboxylic acids (Table 1, 3-5) and the (S)-4,5-dihydro-2-[2-hydroxy-3-(polyether)phenyl]-4-methyl-4-thiazolecarboxylic acids (Table 1, 8-10). The three most effective polyether analogues, in terms of performance ratio (PR), defined as mean ICEprimate/ICErodent, are 3 (PR 1.1), 8, (PR 1.5), and 9, now in human trials, (PR 2.2). At the onset of the clinical trial on 9, no data were available for ligand 3 or 8. This is unfortunate, as 3 has many advantages over 9, e.g., the ICE of 3 in rats is 2.5-fold greater than that of 9 and analogue 3 achieves very high levels in the liver, pancreas, and heart, the organs most affected by iron overload. Finally, the impact of 3 on the urinary excretion of kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1), an early diagnostic biomarker for monitoring acute kidney toxicity, has been carried out in rats; no evidence of nephrotoxicity was found. Overall, the results suggest that 3 would be a far superior clinical candidate to 9. 3atissue distribution 3anephrotoxicity 0aIron chelator 0aDesazadesferrithiocin polyether analogues 0aUrinary biomarker 0aKidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1)1 aWiegand, Jan 1 aBharti, Neelam 1 aMcManis, James S. 1 aSingh, Shailendra 0 tBioMetals.g2011 Apr., v. 24, no. 2 p.239-258dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0966-08447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10534-010-9389-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110316b20110402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03130naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245008100186300001600267520123200283650002001515650001301535650001301548650001301561650001601574650002001590650001001610650001201620650002301632650001801655650001501673650000701688650002401695650003301719650003001752650004201782650003101824650005301855650002601908650003601934650004101970650002402011653001302035653001202048653002102060653001802081700002602099700002402125700002202149700003502171700002302206700001702229773012002246852000902366856008502375930003302460946001102493655001202504IND4393271920221120130414.0070722e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439327192DNAL7 a174068562pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-007-0230-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAugagneur, Yoann 10aDual effect of organic acids as a function of external pH in Oenococcus oeni  ap. 147-157.  aIn this study we analyzed under various pH conditions including low pH, the effects of l-malic acid and citric acid, combined or not, on the growth, the proton motive force components and the transcription level of selected genes of the heterolactic bacterium Oenococcus oeni. It is shown here that l-malate enhanced the growth yield at pH equal or below 4.5 while the presence of citrate in media led to a complete and unexpected inhibition of the growth at pH 3.2. Nevertheless, whatever the growth conditions, both l-malate and citrate participated in the enhancement of the transmembrane pH gradient, whereas the membrane potential decreased with the pH. These results suggested that it was not citrate that was directly responsible for the inhibition observed in cultures done at low pH, but probably its end products. This was confirmed since, in media containing l-malate, the addition of acetate substantially impaired the growth rate of the bacterium and slightly the membrane potential and pH gradient. Finally, study of the expression of genes involved in the metabolism of organic acids showed that at pH 4.5 and 3.2 the presence of l-malate led to an increased amount of mRNA of mleP encoding a malate transporter. 3aOenococcus oeni 3aacetates 3abacteria 3acitrates 3acitric acid 3agene expression 3agenes 3amalates 3amembrane potential 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3apH 3aproton-motive force 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aCitric Acidxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLeuconostocxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMalatesxpharmacology 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathways 2aOrganic Anion Transportersxgenetics 2aProton-Motive Force 0al-malate 0aCitrate 0aIntracellular pH 0aReal-time PCR1 aRitt, Jean-François 1 aLinares, Daniel M. 1 aRemize, Fabienne 1 aTourdot-Maréchal, Raphaëlle 1 aGarmyn, Dominique 1 aGuzzo, Jean 0 tArchives of microbiology.g2007 Aug., v. 188, no. 2 p.147-157dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-007-0230-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20070722b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02804naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245015100163300001400314520152600328650000801854650001601862650001401878650001701892650001001909650003501919650001301954650001501967650002001982650001802002650001602020653001302036653002102049653002302070653002302093773013802116852000902254856008502263930003302348946001302381655001202394IND4451498820221120130516.0110326e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445149882DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623604080200212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorzh, V. P. 10aSearch for tissue-specific regulatory elements using Tol2 transposon as an example of evolutionary synthesis of genomics and developmental biology  ap. 73-77.  aThe GFP gene controlled by a mini-promoter of the keratin-8 gene was cloned into a modified nonautonomous transposon Tol2 from the medaka genome. Such transposon cannot itself transpose, but external transposase allows it to integrate into the germ cell genome, where it remains after transposase is depleted. This gives rise to a transgenic zebrafish line stably maintained for many generations. This approach was used to obtain several tens of transgenic zebrafish lines, each of which demonstrates stably inherited pattern of GFP expression. This pattern depends on the enhancer activity in the vicinity of the transposon integration site. These lines can be used for the analysis of DNA sequences of enhancers, in vivo studies of complex cell morphogenesis, description of organs whose development has not been described in zebrafish, and analysis of activity of genes controlled by the identified promoters during development. Current data on the transgenic lines were integrated into the dedicated ZETRAP database. At the second stage of this project, the transposon was mobilized by a short-term exposure of two transgenic lines to transposase and left the initial chromosomal location. This allowed us to isolate about 20 transgenic lines with new expression patterns. This approach can be successfully used to study the zebrafish biology and anatomy, activity of the regulatory part of the genome, and development of new promising techniques in developmental biology and, in the foreseeable future, gene therapy. 3aDNA 3aDanio rerio 3adatabases 3agene therapy 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenomics 3agerm cells 3ain vivo studies 3amorphogenesis 3atransposons 0aenhancer 0atransgenic lines 0aexpression pattern 0ain vivo bioimaging0 tRussian journal of developmental biology.g2008 Mar., v. 39, no. 2 p.73-77dDordrecht : SP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodicax1062-36047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10623604080200213Available from publisher's Web site  a20110327b20110402c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02508naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001700211245013300228300001600361500001500377520103700392650002901429650001301458650001401471650001001485650001701495650002401512650003001536650002501566650001801591650002701609650002301636650002201659650002001681653002001701700001601721700001601737700001601753773007201769852000901841856008101850930003301931945002501964946001301989655001202002IND4370491420221119051611.0050526e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437049142DNAL7 a189431232pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-95-02922doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The disease in common bean and pea is referred to as white mold. We examined the relationship between oxalate, an established virulence factor of S. sclerotiorum, and partial white mold resistance of scarlet runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus). P. coccineus genotypes PI 255956 ('Mayan White Runner') and PI 535278 (Tars-046A) were more resistant than susceptible 'Wolven Pole'. Sensitivity to oxalate ranked highest for Wolven Pole, lowest for PI 255956, and intermediate for PI 535278. Oxalate concentrations were similar in infected stem tissues of the partially resistant lines and lower than Wolven Pole. Moreover, oxalate oxidase and superoxide dismutase activities were absent in the more resistant lines but induced in Wolven Pole. Collectively, these results suggest that genetic differences in susceptibility to S. sclerotiorum among different P. coccineus lines are partially dependent on oxalic acid. 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aoxalates 3acultivars 3abeans 3abiosynthesis 3aPhaseolus coccineus 3afungal diseases of plants 3asuperoxide dismutase 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3agenetic variation 3aenzyme activity 0aoxidoreductases1 aGilmore, B.1 aMyers, J.R.1 aStotz, H.U.0 tPhytopathology.g2005 Mar., v. 95, no. 3 p.292-299x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-95-02923Available from publisher's Web site  a20070809b20070902c00000000  aINDdMKSe2005/06/16  aOther US 7aarticle03126naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001700194245015300211300001600364500001500380520147700395650001501872650001701887650003001904650001301934650001801947650001501965650002501980650002702005650001102032650001002043650002202053650001502075650001702090650001102107650001902118651001202137653001302149653002702162700001502189700001702204700001702221700001402238700001702252700001702269700001702286773007202303852000902375856008102384930003302465945002502498946001302523655001202536IND4370486820221119051700.0050526e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437048682DNAL7 a189431162pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-95-02412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMasunaka, A.13aAn isolate of Alternaria alternata that is pathogenic to both tangerines and rough lemon and produces two host-selective toxins, ACT- and ACR-toxins  ap. 241-247.  a2019-12-04  aTwo different pathotypes of Alternaria alternata cause Alternaria brown spot of tangerines and Alternaria leaf spot of rough lemon. The former produces the host-selective ACT-toxin and the latter produces ACR-toxin. Both pathogens induce similar symptoms on leaves or young fruits of their respective hosts, but the host ranges of these pathogens are distinct and one pathogen can be easily distinguished from another by comparing host ranges. We isolated strain BC3-5-1-OS2A from a leaf spot on rough lemon in Florida, and this isolate is pathogenic on both cv. Iyokan tangor and rough lemon and also produces both ACT-toxin and ACR-toxin. Isolate BC3-5-1-OS2A carries both genomic regions, one of which was known only to be present in ACT-toxin producers and the other was known to exist only in ACR-toxin producers. Each of the genomic regions is present on distinct small chromosomes, one of 1.05 Mb and the other of 2.0 Mb. Alternaria species have no known sexual or parasexual cycle in nature and populations of A. alternata on citrus are clonal. Therefore, the ability to produce both toxins was not likely acquired through meiotic or mitotic recombination. We hypothesize that a dispensable chromosome carrying the gene cluster controlling biosynthesis of one of the host-selective toxins was transferred horizontally and rearranged by duplication or translocation in another isolate of the fungus carrying genes for biosynthesis of the other host-selective toxin. 3ahost range 3abiosynthesis 3afungal diseases of plants 3atangelos 3apathogenicity 3amycotoxins 3aAlternaria alternata 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aleaves 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3apathotypes 3aCitrus limon 3alemons 3aCitrus tangelo 3aFlorida 0asymptoms 0afruits (plant anatomy)1 aOhtani, K.1 aPeever, T.L.1 aTimmer, L.W.1 aTsuge, T.1 aYamamoto, M.1 aYamamoto, H.1 aAkimitsu, K.0 tPhytopathology.g2005 Mar., v. 95, no. 3 p.241-247x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-95-02413Available from publisher's Web site  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aINDdMKSe2005/06/15  aOther US 7aarticle02694naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245012100162300001400283500002400297520146600321650001201787650001601799650001101815650002201826650002101848650001001869650001301879650001201892650001501904650001801919650003301937650001001970650001201980650001401992650001002006650001402016700001702030700001902047700001702066773010802083852000902191856004802200655001202248IND4419321520090522000000.0090417e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441932152DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-009-1025-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaros, Doris10aSingle-cultivar cloudy juice made from table apples: an attempt to identify the driving force for sensory preference  ap. 51-61.  aIncludes references  aFive single-cultivar cloudy juices made from table apples and an industrially manufactured cloudy apple juice were subjected to chemical and physical analysis, and flash profiling and preference testing by untrained panelists. The fruit juices mainly varied with respect to total dry matter, soluble extract and acid content, giving a sugar/acid ratio (fructose, glucose plus sucrose related to malic acid equivalents) between 15.8 and 27.7; cluster analysis was used to calculate similarity values. There was also a large difference in cloud particle size and stability, with diameters (d ₉₀) ranging between 3.9 μm (industrially produced juice) and 160 μm (single-cultivar juice from Elstar apples). Flash profiling performed in two repeated sessions by 19 untrained panelists elicited 31 descriptors (appearance: 17; smell, flavour and taste: 14). The most frequently used descriptors were cloudiness and colour, and sweetness and acidity. Hedonic ranking by 110 untrained panelists revealed that the less sweet and more acidic products were significantly preferred; however, there was a subfraction of approximately one-third of the panel who preferred the samples with a higher sugar/acid ratio. The comparison of principal component analysis of analytical data and generalised procrustes analysis of flash profiling data reveals that the main driving source for sensory preference is the sugar/acid ratio in line with turbidity and colour intensity. 3aacidity 3aapple juice 3aapples 3achemical analysis 3acluster analysis 3acolor 3afructose 3aglucose 3amalic acid 3aparticle size 3aprincipal component analysis 3asmell 3asucrose 3asweetness 3ataste 3aturbidity1 aThamke, Ines1 aRaddatz, Heike1 aRohm, Harald0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2009 May, v. 229, no. 1 p.51-61dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-009-1025-0 7aarticle02667naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001300184245015100197300001800348506007600366520113200442506003701574650001601611650001701627650003101644650002901675650001101704650000901715650001301724650002101737650001301758700001801771700001901789700002101808700002301829700002401852700002101876773017401897852000902071856008302080939003302163946001302196655001202209IND4451312520221207044900.0110325e20110322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445131252DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11005511082doi7 aPMC30643282pmcid7 a213831932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJan, Max10aProspective separation of normal and leukemic stem cells based on differential expression of TIM3, a human acute myeloid leukemia stem cell marker  ap. 5009-5014.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHematopoietic tissues in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients contain both leukemia stem cells (LSC) and residual normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). The ability to prospectively separate residual HSC from LSC would enable important scientific and clinical investigation including the possibility of purged autologous hematopoietic cell transplants. We report here the identification of TIM3 as an AML stem cell surface marker more highly expressed on multiple specimens of AML LSC than on normal bone marrow HSC. TIM3 expression was detected in all cytogenetic subgroups of AML, but was significantly higher in AML-associated with core binding factor translocations or mutations in CEBPA. By assessing engraftment in NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ-null mice, we determined that HSC function resides predominantly in the TIM3-negative fraction of normal bone marrow, whereas LSC function from multiple AML specimens resides predominantly in the TIM3-positive compartment.

Reduced physical activity and changes in diet have been proposed as contributing factors to the growth in childhood overweight and obesity. The aim of this study was to assess trends in the food-related behaviour and markers of activity/inactivity in French 9-11 year old children. METHODS: Three successive surveys (1993, 1995, 1997) were carried out in samples of 1,000 French children, aged 9-11 years. Socio-demographic, anthropometric and food-related parameters were obtained for each child, using standardized questionnaire administered by trained interviewers. RESULTS: previous-day reports of food intake by the child revealed a strong persistence of the traditional French meal structure. Breakfast was eaten by 97% of children. Over the three surveys, an increasing percentage of reported breakfasts contained at least one dairy food, one cereal food, and one fruit or juice (from 11% to 17%). Almost all children had lunch, which occurred at the school cafeteria for one-third of the subjects. The afternoon snack, a traditional meal for French children, was consumed by 86-88% of the samples. Almost all children had dinner (99%), most often at home and in the company of all family members (73-87%). Lunches and dinners were composed of several courses presented in succession, as is usual in France. The foods most preferred by the children were often rich in sugar and/or fat (fried potatoes, ice cream, nut spread, chocolate, cake, etc). The children could list 'healthy foods'competently. They also demonstrated knowledge of terms used in nutrition (e.g. calories, fats) and were aware of possible links between intake of certain substances and disease. In families of higher socio-economic strata (income, education of parents) more time was devoted to sports by the children. Over the three surveys, linear trends indicated more exercise time per week and less television viewing. A high risk of obesity was likely in very sedentary children whose proportion (33%) was stable over the 1993-1997 period. CONCLUSIONS: In general the traditional French pattern of eating persisted among these children. Although there were signs of movement towards a more complete breakfast, less television and more exercise in active children, a substantial proportion of children engaged in no sports activity outside school hours. Maintaining appropriate weight is therefore difficult in view of the plentiful supply of food available to children. Inactive children are at high risk of obesity and should be encouraged to adopt a more active lifestyle. 3aattitudes and opinions 3abreakfast 3acakes 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3achocolate 3adietary surveys 3adinner 3aeating habits 3aeducation 3aexercise 3afood availability 3afood intake 3afruit juices 3agrain foods 3aice cream 3aincome 3alifestyle 3alipids 3alunch 3anutritional status 3aparents 3apotatoes 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3asports 3asugars 3atelevision 3aFrance1 aRolland-Cachera, M.

At intra-specific level, the authors found mast seeding of both C. mandshurica and C. heterophylla significantly reduced seed removal, seed consumption, but increased seed dispersal distance and seed dispersal fitness of the released seeds. Mast seeding of C. mandshurica increased seed caching of C. mandshurica. At inter-specific level, the authors found mast seeding of C. mandshurica reduced seed removal of C. heterophylla, but mast seeding of C. heterophylla did not significantly reduce seed removal of C. mandshurica. Mast seeding of C. mandshurica reduced seed consumption of C. heterophylla, while mast seeding of C. heterophylla reduced seed consumption of C. mandshurica. We found mast seeding of C. mandshurica significantly reduced seed dispersal distance of C. heterophylla, while mast seeding of C. heterophylla significantly increased seed dispersal distance of C. mandshurica. We found that mast seeding of C. mandshurica significantly increased seed dispersal fitness of C. heterophylla, while mast seeding of C. heterophylla did not significantly increase seed dispersal fitness of C. mandshurica. More studies are needed to reveal the ecological consequences of mast seeding at inter-specific or community-level. Seed traits may attribute the differences of mast seeding at inter-specific level. Because seeds with thinner seed hull and higher nutrition were more harvested and eaten by rodents, mast seeding of C. mandshurica might have reduced seed removal and seed consumption, but increased dispersal fitness of C. heterophylla (seeds with thicker seed hull, lower nutrition). Therefore, synchrony among species is, or is not, selectively beneficial to the focus species depends on seed traits which determine gains from mast seeding at inter-specific level. 3aCorylus 3ahulls 3anutrition 3arodents 3aseed dispersal 3aseeds 3asowing 3atrees1 aYang, Y.

Barley (Hordeum vulgare) genotypes differ considerably in their ability to grow in soils with low Mn²⁺ availability. Differential genotypic Mn efficiency can be attributed to differences in Mn²⁺ uptake kinetics in the low nanomolar concentration range. However, the molecular basis for these differences has not yet been clarified. We present here the identification and characterization of the first barley gene encoding a plasma membrane-localized metal transport protein able to transport Mn²⁺. The gene is designated HvIRT1 (for IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER1) because it belongs to the ZIP gene family and has a high similarity to rice (Oryza sativa) OsIRT1. A novel yeast uptake assay based on inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analysis of 31 different metal and metalloid ions showed that the HvIRT1 protein, in addition to Mn²⁺, also transported Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺, Zn²⁺, and Cd²⁺. Both Mn and iron deficiency induced an up-regulation of HvIRT1 in two barley genotypes differing in Mn efficiency, but the expression levels in all cases were highest (up to 40%) in the Mn-efficient genotype. The higher expression of HvIRT1 correlated with an increased Mn²⁺ uptake rate. We conclude that HvIRT1 is an important component controlling Mn²⁺ uptake in barley roots and contributes to genotypic differences in Mn²⁺ uptake kinetics.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHordeum vulgare 3aOryza sativa 3abarley 3agenes 3agenotype 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aroots 3aspectroscopy 3atransporters 3ayeasts 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCation Transport Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aConserved Sequence 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGenotype 2aHordeumxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aManganesexmetabolism 2aMetals, Heavyxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxchemistry. 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTrace Elementsxmetabolism1 aYtting, Cecilie K.1 aFuglsang, Anja T.1 aJahn, Thomas P.1 aSchjoerring, Jan K.1 aHusted, Søren0 tPlant physiology.g2008 Sept., v. 148, no. 1 p.455-466dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.108.1188513Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02284naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245008600189300001600275500002400291520097100315650001001286650000901296650001701305650002101322650002401343650001001367650001201377650001201389650003901401650002601440650000901466650005501475650000901530700001901539700002401558700002001582700002001602700002101622700001701643773010201660852000901762856005501771655001201826IND4458664120221119051609.0110603e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445866412DNAL7 a214665642pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2011.00798.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUechi, Masami10aSurgical Closure of an Atrial Septal Defect Using Cardiopulmonary Bypass in a Cat  ap. 413-417.  aIncludes references  aObjective: To describe surgical repair of a large atrial septal defect (ASD) in a cat. Study Design: Clinical report. Animal: A 3-year-old, 3.3 kg, intact male Japanese domestic short-haired cat. Methods: A 10.2-mm-diameter ASD detected by echocardiography was surgically corrected because pulmonary vascular resistance-to-systemic vascular resistance ratio (Qp/Qs) was 3.2. Using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), open surgical repair was achieved with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) graft. The priming volume of the CPB circuit was minimized by cutting the CPB tubing, and partially replacing the priming fluid with whole cat blood. To prevent hemodilution associated with use of cardioprotective agents, surgery was performed on the beating heart. Results: At 1-year echocardiographic evaluation, the repair was intact, and at 3 years, the cat was alive without need of medication.

Reservoirs in northern Patagonia are the main location for rainbow trout cage aquaculture activities in Argentina and here, surface water temperature shows an increment that despite leading towards better growth rates, also provokes lack of ovulation, atresia and a partial or total absence of spawning during the breeding season. During the early life history, low survival rates at hatching and first feeding are also observed. The increase in market size (>2 kg) has changed management practices, minimizing the difference between brood stock and individuals destined for consumption. Thus, the present situation differs deeply from carrying capacities forecasted few years ago and this analysis attempts to contribute to management policies including the idea of adaptation to climate change in the making of decisions. 3afish culture 3alife history 3asurvival rate 3acage culture 3adecision making 3amarkets 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3awater reservoirs 3aspawning 3aclimate change 3ahatching 3asurface temperature 3acarrying capacity 3aovulation 3aissues and policy 3abreeding season 3aArgentina 0aadaptation1 aAigo, Juana del Carmen1 aCussac, Víctor Enrique0 tAquaculture research.g2011 May, v. 42, no. 6 p.787-796dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2011.02804.x 7aarticle04339naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001700211245014800228300001600376520243600392650002402828650001702852650004502869650001402914650002702928650001402955650001502969650002802984650002103012650002503033650001203058650002203070650002303092650002203115650003203137650001103169650004103180650001403221650001403235650005003249650002203299700002003321700001703341700001903358700001503377700001703392700002003409700001603429700001303445773008203458852000903540856008103549930003303630945002503663946001303688655001203701IND4433694920221119051923.0100308e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443369492DNAL7 a201722122pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2009-23012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aChebel, R.C.10aSupplementation of progesterone via controlled internal drug release inserts during ovulation synchronization protocols in lactating dairy cows  ap. 922-931.  aOur objective was to determine the effect of exogenous progesterone (P4) during a timed artificial insemination (TAI) protocol on pregnancies per AI (P/AI) in dairy cows not previously detected in estrus. Lactating cows (n = 3,248) from 7 commercial dairy herds were submitted to a presynchronization protocol (2 injections of PGF2α 14 d apart; Presynch), and cows in estrus after the second PGF2α received AI (EDAI; n = 1,583). Cows not inseminated by 12 to 14 d after the second PGF2α injection were submitted to a TAI protocol (GnRH on d 0, PGF2α on d 7, and GnRH + TAI 72 h after PGF2α). At onset of the TAI protocol, cows were balanced by parity and days in milk and assigned randomly to receive no exogenous P4 (control, n = 803) or a controlled internal drug release (CIDR) insert containing 1.38 g of P4 from d 0 to 7 (CIDR, n = 862). Blood samples were collected at the second PGF2α injection of the Presynch and on the day of the first GnRH injection of the TAI protocol for P4 determination. When P4 in both samples was <1 ng/mL, cows were classified as anovular, whereas cows having at least 1 sample >or= 1 ng/mL were classified as cyclic. Concentration of P4 at 11 to 14 d after AI was determined in a subgroup of cows (n = 453) from 2 herds. Pregnancy was diagnosed at 40 ± 5 and 65 ± 5 d after AI. Proportion of cows inseminated on estrus after the second PGF2α injection of the Presynch protocol differed among herds (range = 26.7 to 59.8%). Overall P/AI for EDAI cows at 40 ± 5 and 65 ± 5 d were 36.2 and 33.7%, respectively, and pregnancy loss was 8.8%. Proportion of cyclic cows at the onset of the TAI protocol differed among herds (range from 66.5 to 86.3%), but did not differ between treatments (control = 72.4%, CIDR = 74.1%). Treatment affected P/AI at 40 ± 5 (control = 33.3%, CIDR = 38.1%) and 65 ± 5 (control = 30.0%, CIDR = 35.1%) d after AI but did not affect pregnancy loss (8.6%). Cyclic cows had greater P/AI at 40 ± 5 (38.2 vs. 29.3%) and 65 ± 5 d (35.1 vs. 26.1%) after AI, but cyclic status had no effect on pregnancy loss. Treatment affected P4 concentration after AI, with more CIDR cows having P4 >or= 1 ng/mL (94.4 vs. 86.9%) and P4 >or= 3.2 ng/mL (81.8 vs. 68.0%) at 11 to 14 d after AI compared with control cows. Treatment of cows not previously detected in estrus with a CIDR insert during a TAI protocol increased proportion of cows with functional CL after AI and P/AI. 3ahormone supplements 3aprogesterone 3acontrolled internal drug release devices 3aovulation 3aestrus synchronization 3alactation 3adairy cows 3aartificial insemination 3aestrus detection 2aAbortion, Veterinary 2aAnimals 2aBreedingxmethods 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDairyingxmethods 2aDelayed-Action Preparations 2aFemale 2aInsemination, Artificialxveterinary 2aOvulation 2aPregnancy 2aProgesteronexadministration & dosagexblood. 2aRandom Allocation1 aAl-Hassan, M.J.1 aFricke, P.M.1 aSantos, J.E.P.1 aLima, J.R.1 aMartel, C.A.1 aStevenson, J.S.1 aGarcía, R.1 aAx, R.L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2010 Mar., v. 93, no. 3 p.922-931x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-23013Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/04/06  aOther US 7aarticle03197naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007700125300001800202520201900220650001202239650001202251650002802263650002102291650001202312650002202324650001302346650001602359650001602375650001602391650001002407650002302417653002002440700001602460700001302476700001702489700001402506700001802520700001602538700002102554773009602575852000902671930003302680945001302713946001302726655001202739IND2047526120221119051854.0950829e199507  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204752612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaprio, S.10aCentral adiposity and its metabolic correlates in obese adolescent girls  ap. E118-E126.  aTo establish whether alterations in insulin action and secretion and their relationship to body fat distribution occur early in the course of developing obesity, we studied 14 obese adolescent girls [13.2 +/- 0.7 yr, body mass index (BMI) 32 +/- 1.4], 16 nonobese adolescent girls (12.5 +/- 0.6 yr, BMI 21.0 +/- 0.8), and 14 nonobese young women (24.0 +/- 0.6 yr, BMI 21.0 +/- 0.9). Insulin action was assessed by a sequential two-step (8 and 40 mU.m-2.min-1) euglycemic insulin clamp in combination with [1-l3C]glucose and indirect calonmetry. Insulin secretion was determined by the hyperglycemic clamp technique (6.9 mmol/l). Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat depots. In obese girls, an impairment in glucose disposal was present with both insulin doses; at the higher dose, rates of glucose uptake were reduced by 30% in nonobese girls (240 +/- 30 vs. 340 +/- 19 mg m-2.min-1, P < 0.05) and by an additional 29% (170 +/- 17 mg.m-2 min-1, P < 0.05) in obese girls. Insulin infusion failed to stimulate glucose oxidation and to suppress lipid oxidation only in obese girls. Suppression of free fatty acid levels, but not hepatic glucose production, was decreased in obese girls compared with controls. Fasting and glucose-stimulated insulin responses were greater in obese than in nonobese adolescents, who, in turn, had greater responses than lean women. In obese girls, visceral fat, but neither waist-to-hip circumference ratio nor subcutaneous fat. was highly correlated with basal insulin secretion (r = 0.89, P < 0.001), stimulated insulin secretion (r = 0.61,P < 0.05), and insulin resistance (r = -0.87, P < 0.02). Increased visceral fat, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance (involving glucose and lipid metabolism) are closely linked abnormalities that are expressed early in the natural history of obesity. Adolescents with central adiposity should be targeted for weight reduction and health surveillance to reduce morbidity of adult obesity. 3aobesity 3aglucose 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3alipid metabolism 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3abody fat 3afatty acids 3acorrelation 3aadolescents 3agirls 3ainsulin resistance 0alipid oxidation1 aHyman, L.D.1 aLimb, C.1 aMcCarthy, S.1 aLange, R.1 aSherwin, R.S.1 aShulman, G.1 aTamborlane, W.V.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1995 July, v. 269, no. 1:pt.1 p.E118-E126x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01945naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002000144245015100164300001600315500001500331520061500346650002500961650001600986650001901002650002801021650002001049650001801069650001901087650001101106650001401117650002401131650002201155653002701177653001801204653002301222700001501245700001901260700001501279700001501294773008801309852000901397930003301406945002501439946001101464655001201475IND4369255920221119051833.0050426s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436925592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Larvae were exposed to different gamma irradiation doses ranging from 300 to 900 Gy. Feeding, pupation, adult emergence and survival were very sensitive to ionizing irradiation. When irradiated at a dose of 300 Gy and higher, food consumption and weight gain were significantly affected, in a dose-dependent manner. Twenty days after irradiation, the weight loss at doses of 300, 450 and 600 Gy was 42%, 47% and 49%, respectively. At doses of 750 and 900 Gy, the weight of larvae diminished by 51% and 54%, respectively. In contrast, the controls gained 20% in weight. Development of larvae to the pupal stage was not prevented completely but none of the pupae emerged as adults. At 300 Gy, 21% of larvae survived 44 d after irradiation and successfully pupated. An absorbed dose of 450, 600, 750 or 900 Gy applied to larvae caused 100% mortality by 44, 38, 38 and 22 d post-treatment, respectively. The minimum dose required to prevent damage from feeding and adult emergence was 300 Gy while doses required to cause death were greater than or equal to 450 Gy. 3aPlodia interpunctella 3airradiation 3agamma radiation 3ainstars 3afood intake 3alarval development 3apupation 3abody weight 3aeclosion 3amortality 3adose response 3adisinfestation 3ainsect control1 aSayah, F.1 aMouhib, M.1 aGhailani, N.1 aElGarrouj, D.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2005, v. 41, no. 4 p.423-431x0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL  a20080312b20080404c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/05/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02098naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110242007300128245010100201300001400302500002400316500002500340520106000365650001701425650001501442650002001457650002301477650001601500650001701516650001801533650001001551650001501561651001301576700002101589773012901610852000901739655001201748IND4458517320221119051837.0110601s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||slv||7 aIND445851732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBohinc, Tanja10aStink bugs (Pentatomidae) as crop pests and methods of their control10aŠčitaste stenice (Pentatomidae) kot škodljivci gojenih rastlin in načini njihovega zatiranja  ap. 63-72.  aIncludes references  a Summary in English.  aSixty percent of all known true bugs (Heteroptera) are phytophagous. Economically the most important species belong to Cimicomorpha and Pentatomomorpha groups. The representatives of the latter are specially important, since they are harmful on cultivated plants. The Pentatomidae family is the 3rd largest from the Heteroptera (sub)order, and its the most harmful representative in Slovenia and in neighbouring countries is Eurydema ventrale. It is specially important because of the lack of insecticides registered against this pest in Brassica crops, where it occur most numerously. Beside this the species does not have any efficient natural enemy. Notwithstanding it is possible to reduce the number of E. ventrale below the economic threshold with the use of some environmentally acceptable control measures. In this context the choice of suitable host plants is very important, especially with the aim of use their natural resistance as well as for the purposes of other environmentally acceptable control measures (intercropping, trap crops etc.). 3aPentatomidae 3acole crops 3acontrol methods 3aeconomic threshold 3ahost plants 3ainsecticides 3aintercropping 3apests 3atrap crops 3aSlovenia1 aTrdan, Stanislav0 tActa agriculturae slovenica.g2011 Mar., v. 97, no. 1 p.63-72dBiotehnisÌke fakultete Univerze v Ljubljanix1854-19417nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245010800132300001600240500002400256520168600280650002201966650001701988650001102005650001602016650001302032650001102045650000702056650001302063650003702076650002202113650002202135650001702157650002802174651001002202700001502212700001602227700001602243773011102259852000902370655001202379IND4458546220221119051507.0110603s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445854622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhattacharyya, P.12aA quantitative methodology for estimating soil loss tolerance limits for three states of northern India  ap. 276-292.  aIncludes references  aSoil loss tolerance limit (SLTL) is the maximum amount of soil which can be removed annually before the long-term soil productivity is adversely affected. In many situations, the establishment of a SLTL is intended to provide basic information for the maintenance of soil productivity, which becomes one of the foci of the sustainability of agricultural land use. In India a default soil loss tolerance limit of 11.2 Mg ha-1 yr -1 is followed for planning soil conservation activities. The objective of this study is to provide a methodology to estimate quantitative SLTLs for suggesting suitable soil conservation measures. The assessment framework used follows three basic steps; viz. indicator selection, indicator interpretation and integration into a soil quality (SQ) index value. A quantitative model was used to integrate potential soil indicators such as saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, soil erodibility, organic carbon and pH to assess soil resistibility to erosion. Scaling functions were used to convert soil parameters to a unitless 0 to 1 scale. Normalized values of all these soil parameters were then multiplied by assigned weights based on relative importance and sensitivity analysis. Soils were grouped into 1, 2, and 3 depending on overall additive score. A general guideline developed by the USDA-Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) was followed, with certain modifications in depth categories, for estimation of SLTLs. The model was tested on 14.86 Mha of land in northern India comprising of the states of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. SLTLs varied from 2.5 to 12.5 Mg ha-1 yr -1 compared to the single value applied earlier. 3aagricultural land 3abulk density 3acarbon 3aerodibility 3aland use 3amodels 3apH 3aplanning 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil conservation 3asoil productivity 3asoil quality 3asustainable agriculture 3aIndia1 aMandal, D.1 aBhatt, V.K.1 aYadav, R.P.0 tJournal of sustainable agriculture.g2011 , v. 35, no. 3-4 p.276-292dFood Products Pressx1044-00467nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01722naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002300115245006400138300001200202300001900214500003400233520087900267650001201146650001801158650001201176653002201188653002301210653002101233773009301254852000901347939003301356945000801389946001101397655001201408991584951080742620221119050436.0810813e198105  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810015552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurrant, Merril L.10aEstimates of energy intake by obese women on reducing diets  ap. 53A.  ap. 53A. chart.  aOriginal is an abstract only.  aThirty-five obese women fed reducing diets that did or did not change their energy intake over a 3-week period were able to detect further decreases in energy intake.

As far back as the early Greeks, diet prescriptions indicated cereals, fruits and sweet wine, but rediscovery of this treatment is credited to Thomas Willis in the 17th century. The first systematic diabetic diet was used in 2 cases in 1797, and included plain blood pudding and "fat and rancid old meats". Even with the introduction of insulin, diet continued to be an important part of therapy: high-carbohydrate diets were recognized as contributing to the patient's well-being. The amount of energy from carbohydrate or animal sources seems to affect the development of atherosclerosis. The effects of fiber on diabetic control are under investigation, since they seem to influence many aspects of fat absorption, glucose transport, and glucose tolerance. 3adiabetes mellitus 3ahistory 3adiet therapy 3aglucose tolerance 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aDiabetes Mellitusxdrug therapyxhistory. 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxdiet therapy 2aDiet, Diabetic. 2aDietary Fiber 2aDogs 2aHistory, 17th Century 2aHistory, 18th Century 2aHistory, 19th Century 2aHistory, 20th Century 2aHumans 2aInsulinxtherapeutic use 0aEngland 0adiabetic diets 0aFat modifications2 aDietary Management of Disease (1979 : London)0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g1979 Dec., v. 38, no. 3 p.365-371x0029-66517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810529c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02255naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100001700132245004100149300001600190300002100206520099900227650002601226650002201252650002101274650002601295650000901321650002001330650002301350650002401373650001101397650006701408650001101475650003201486650004001518650001601558650001501574653001501589711005001604773009401654852000901748939003301757945000801790946001101798655001201809991584950400742620221119050245.0810529e197912  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810011232DNAL7 a1610232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenman, A.M.10aNature and diagnosis of food allergy  ap. 391-402.  ap. 391-402. ill.  aThe relationship of food allergy to organic disease has been demonstrated in many cases, for example gluten hypersensitivity as the cause of coeliac disease. Other possible relationships exist for hypersensitivity and Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, pulmonary haemosiderosis, etc. However, it is crucial to define food allergy and make positive diagnoses, recognizing that the pathogenesis of food allergy is complex and varies with the individual and the disease manifestation. Clinical assessment and laboratory analysis, when used in conjunction, can identify the mechanisms by which absorbed food proteins could stimulate an immune response with pathological consequences. Cases in point include chronic urticaria, in which 40% of patients responded to exclusion diets, or milk intolerance which produced swollen lymph nodes and nervous symptoms in a young girl. A critical attitude is needed in assessing test results, to ensure that subjective factors do not obscure the real issues. 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease diagnosis 3ahypersensitivity 3adiet-related diseases 3adiet 3aclinical trials 2aAntibody Formation 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aFood Hypersensitivityxdiagnosisximmunologyxphysiopathology. 2aHumans 2aHypersensitivity, Immediate 2aImmune Complex Diseasesximmunology 2aMiddle Aged 2aSkin Tests 0aTest diets2 aDietary Management of Disease (1979 : London)0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g1979 Dec., v. 38, no. 3 p.391-402x0029-66517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810529c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01953naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245011900171300001600290520094800306650001101254650002001265650001701285650001701302650001201319650001301331650001601344700001701360700001301377700002201390773015101412856005501563852000901618655001201627IND4491826120221119050101.0141110e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449182612DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.2007.00771.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Busty,10aControlled clinical trial of two weight reducing diets in a NHS hospital dietetic outpatient clinic: a pilot study  ap. 270-272.  aBACKGROUND: Outpatient dietary weight reduction for obesity is unsatisfactory. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of an energy prescription diet with usual care (a healthy eating diet) in adult overweight patients referred to a NHS hospital dietetic outpatient clinic, in terms of weight change over 12 weeks. METHODS: Controlled clinical trial (systematic allocation). RESULTS: Of the 53 patients who attended their first appointment, 27 completed the trial. Mean weight loss (kg) after 12 weeks was 4.2 (sd 3.8) on the energy prescription diet (n = 16) and 6.0 (sd 2.8) on the healthy eating diet (n = 11). CONCLUSIONS: Patients on a weight reducing diet based on energy prescription or healthy eating lost, on average, clinically significant amounts of body weight by 12 weeks. Mean weight loss was greater by about 50% in the healthy eating group and supports the development of a larger trial to estimate true effect. 3aadults 3aclinical trials 3adiet therapy 3ahealthy diet 3aobesity 3apatients 3aweight loss1 aIrons, L.

How then does one integrate the diseases of affluence such as obesity and heart disease? A first step might be in establishing criteria for malnutrition based on dietary rather than clinical evidence to allow for geographic and cultural variation. Once the range of acceptable intakes is formulated, the distribution of food within the population could be analyzed by requirements. The process could lead to the development of new nutritional standards. A table of the prevalence rates of various diseases illustrates the problems affecting research decisions; is dental caries more significant because it affects 1235 million people while malnutrition affects 462 million?

We have explored a simplified parametric model for the soil shrinkage characteristic curve, which is a measure for the magnitude of soil shrinkage, and tested it against experimental data for a Vertisol and a Lixisol under sugar cane in the Havana province, Cuba. We then applied the model to determine soil consistency limits, including the shrinkage, plastic and structural limits, using the model's third and fourth derivative. We further demonstrated how the model can be used to assess the geometry of shrinkage in terms of the relative crack area and the relative surface subsidence. Excellent matches were obtained between the observations and the fitted model. The shrinkage and structural limits corresponded to distinct changes in the soil shrinkage characteristic curve and were as such considered to be correctly estimated. The accuracy of the estimated plastic limit could, however, not been verified, since data were lacking. Linear regressions with R² > 0.88 were established relating the shrinkage and plastic limits to the soil's COLE index and the cation exchange capacity. The model could be easily applied to determine the crack area and the surface subsidence. We finally demonstrated how a geometry factor r[subscript s] plays a crucial role in determining the shrinkage geometry, particularly for r[subscript s] values ranging from 1 to 3. 3aagricultural engineering 3aagricultural soils 3acation exchange capacity 3alinear models 3ashrinkage 3asugarcane 3asurface area1 aCorluy, J.1 aMedina, H.1 aHartmann, R.1 aMeirvenne, M.

Some of them, neglected as a result of the conquest history, others little known so far in this XXIst century. Some neotropical cereals, seeds, tubers and roots that were the food base of indigenous communities before the European conquest, were abandoned as a result of conquerors' dispositions and religious issues, and not before the end of the XXth century, they were re-discovered. Quinoa, amaranth, cassava or yams were totally useless during a long time and their potential benefits wasted. Similarly, forest tropical species remained unknown for a long time. New tendencies in health care and environmental sensibility changed this situation and promote little known and/or neglected species to be re used for food and many others industries that are flourishing now. Today, it is possible to find in menu restaurants, as well as in specialized magazines, a great offer of derivate from the tropical diversity and demand for them increases in a fast way. More and more, people are interested in new products which improve life quality, and lead also to environmental sustainability maintenance. As consequence, strategies to improve neglected and little used species involve the creation of a technological platform which combined with innovation can support development and improvement of value chains in tropical regions. Although these little used species represent many challenges for the tropical people, value chains examples increase every day and some advances are remarkable. The tropical region and its diversity is undoubtedly a source of well-being not only for growers but also for consumers. 3acassava 3aenvironmental sustainability 3agrains 3agrowers 3ahealth services 3anew products 3aquality of life 3arestaurants 3aroots 3aseeds 3atropical forests 3atropics 3atubers 3ayams0 tActa horticulturae.g2014, , no. 1047 p.275-280dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1047/1047_34.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245012500184300001600309500002400325520164400349650001701993650002302010650001002033650002302043650001402066650001602080650002602096650001702122650001902139650001602158650001402174650003002188650001202218650002902230650001102259650000902270650002602279650001402305650002102319650001202340650003202352651001302384651001302397700001702410700001902427700001702446700001802463700001802481773011702499852000902616856004802625655001202673IND4433922320221119050156.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443392232DNAL7 a198767542pmid7 a10.1007/s11250-009-9473-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaye, Mengistie10aGrowth performances of Washera sheep under smallholder management systems in Yilmanadensa and Quarit districts, Ethiopia  ap. 659-667.  aIncludes references  aA study was conducted to evaluate growth performances of Washera sheep under smallholder production systems in the Yilmanadensa and Quarit districts of the Amhara National Regional State, Ethiopia. Data were collected and analysed on the growth of 690 lambs owned by 110 households from October 2004 to September 2007. Weight (kilograms) of Washera lambs at birth, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age was 2.69 ± 0.02, 7.10 ± 0.16, 12.42 ± 0.11, 16.12 ± 0.91, 20.05 ± 0.55 and 23.47 ± 0.68, respectively. Birth weight was significantly (P < 0.05) affected by district, year of birth, parity of the dam, birth type and sex of lamb and by the interaction effect of parity by birth type and parity by sex of lamb. Weaning weight was also affected by year of birth, type of birth and sex of lamb. Yearling weight was affected by only year of birth and sex of birth. The average daily weight gain (ADG; grams) from birth to 30 days, birth to 90 days, 90 to 180 days and birth to 1 year of age was 143.37 ± 13.46, 107.09 ± 2.67, 39.78 ± 9.73 and 60.13 ± 1.89, respectively. Growth rates from birth to 30 and 90 days of age were significantly (P < 0.05) affected by birth year, birth type and sex. ADG from birth to 1 year of age was affected by lamb sex and district. The indigenous Washera sheep had faster growth rate than those sheep breeds of Ethiopia extensively studied thus far. Integrated efforts combining improved nutrition, health and participatory community-based breeding would help the smallholder farmers to utilise and conserve this immense sheep genetic resource of Ethiopia. 3abirth weight 3agrowth performance 3alambs 3amanagement systems 3anutrition 3aparturition 3aproduction technology 3asheep breeds 3aweaning weight 3aweight gain 3ayearlings 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aBirth Weightxphysiology 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aPregnancy 2aRural Population 2aSeasons 2aSheepxgrowth & development 3aEthiopia 0aEthiopia1 aAbebe, Girma1 aSolomon Gizaw.1 aLemma, Sisay1 aMekoya, Abebe1 aTibbo, Markos0 tTropical animal health and production.g2010 Apr., v. 42, no. 4 p.659-667dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-47477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-009-9473-x 7aarticle02639naa a2200565 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245007400152300001300226300002700239520097700266650002301243650001801266650001401284650002401298650002101322650002301343650001701366650001201383650001701395650002101412650001601433650002001449650004601469650001801515650001101533650003901544650002201583650001101605650002001616650001401636650003901650650001401689650004001703650003501743650002501778653002801803653002401831711005401855773009101909852000902000939003302009945000802042946001102050655001202061991584948070742620221119045756.0810529e198002  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810011142DNAL7 a69888322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaismith, D.J.10aMaternal nutrition and the outcome of pregnancy--a critical appraisal  ap. 1-11.  ap. 1-11. ill., charts.  aFetal growth and development and infant birth weight are affected by chronic maternal undernutrition. The degree to which undernutrition contributes to low birth weight has been clarified by dietary intervention studies. These studies indicate that initial nutritional status of the mothers is a determinant in whether supplementation is or is not associated with increased birthweight. The energy, rather than the protein content of the dietary supplement is significant in improving birth weight of infants born to malnourished mothers. During pregnancy, physiological changes in fat, amino acid and glucose metabolism brought about by the endocrine secretions of the foeto-placental unit ensure energy supply to the fetus despite low energy intakes by the mother. These changes distribute the energy costs of pregnancy over the 9 months of gestation and moderate the effects of chronic malnutrition on the fetus and on the undernourished woman's capacity to breastfeed. 3amaternal nutrition 3aenergy intake 3alactation 3adietary supplements 3alow birth weight 3anutritional status 3amalnutrition 2aAnimals 2aBirth Weight 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weight 2aDietxstandards 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aFetal Growth Retardationxetiology 2aFetusxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aInfant, Newborn 2aLactation 2aNutrition Disordersxcomplications 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complicationsxmetabolism 2aProtein Deficiencyxmetabolism 2aProteinsxmetabolism 0aPregnancy and nutrition 0aPrenatal influences2 aNutrition of the Mother and Child (1979 : London)0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g1980 Feb., v. 39, no. 1 p.1-11x0029-66517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810529c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle03578naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013400127300001600261500021600277520182200493650001902315650001202334650000902346650001202355650001302367650001002380650001802390650001102408650001802419650001302437650001602450650000902466650002102475650001302496650001402509650002002523650001002543650000702553650001202560650001502572650001402587650002402601650000902625650002302634650001602657650001102673650001102684650001702695650001002712650001202722650000902734700001902743700001702762773013702779856005102916852000902967655001202976IND4491232420221119045812.0141110e20140816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449123242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnfry, S.

Accordingly, this research investigation was undertaken to develop three snack bars utilizing tropical commodities such as dehydrated pineapples, papayas, bananas, macerated sorrel calyces and sour cherry pulp, and coconut. The aforementioned and all other ingredients remained constant while the amount of coconut used varied at 0% (snack bar 1), 10% (snack bar 2) and 20% (snack bar 3). Snack bars 1, 2 and 3 were analyzed to determine some of their physico-chemical, microbiological and nutritional properties. A series of sensory evaluation sessions was also conducted. As such, there were varying amounts of protein, fat, dietary fiber and minerals such as calcium, iron, zinc, sodium and potassium, present in snack bars 1, 2 and 3; with snack bars 2 and 3 having a higher amount of dietary fiber and protein than snack bar 1. There were also significant differences between snack bars 1, 2 and 3 with respect to colour (snack bar 2 was darker in colour than snack bars 1 and 3), pH and degrees Brix. However, all snack bars had an acidic pH. There was also variability in the hardness of the snack bars during the storage period. Microbial growth was less than 10 cfu/g in all of the snack bars evaluated during this investigation. Sensory panelists found snack bars 1 and 2 to be more acceptable than snack bar 3 with respect to appearance, colour, flavour, aroma, taste and texture. The snack bars containing the least amount of coconut may be a lucrative product development venture and thus presents great potential for the development of snack bars, utilizing readily available tropical commodities. 3aPrunus cerasus 3abananas 3abrix 3acalcium 3acoconuts 3acolor 3adietary fiber 3aflavor 3afood industry 3ahardness 3aingredients 3airon 3amicrobial growth 3aminerals 3anutrients 3anutritive value 3aodors 3apH 3apapayas 3apineapples 3apotassium 3aproduct development 3apulp 3asensory evaluation 3asnack foods 3asodium 3asorrel 3astorage time 3ataste 3atexture 3azinc1 aWickham, L.

Four novel ACE inhibitory peptides (P(I), P(K), P(M), and P(P)) were purified using ultrafiltration and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The classification study showed that these 4 peptides were of the true inhibitor type. The amino acid sequences of these peptides are YQDPRLGPTGELDPATQPIVAVHNPVIV, PKDLREN, LLLAHLL, and NHRNRMMDHVH, respectively. Their individual IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) values were as follows: 14.53 ± 0.21 μM, 9.82 ± 0.37 μM, 5.19 ± 0.18 μM, and 13.42 ± 0.17 μM. From sequence analysis, we determined that P(I) was part of β-casein in mare's milk. The 3 peptides P(K), P(M), and P(P) did not correspond with any known milk protein. The results suggest that koumiss is rich in ACE inhibitory peptides, and the ACE inhibitors in koumiss are of the pro-drug type or a mixture of the pro-drug type and the true inhibitor type.

In 1987, one moth per tree was released twice during the season in two apple orchards and total season fruit injury in untreated plots ranged from 7.0 to 21.2%. Levels of fruit injury in the pheromone treated plots were 1.0-4.0%. In 1988, either one moth was released per five trees three times during the season or no moths were released in replicated apple plots. Seasonal fruit injury ranges in untreated plots were 1.41-1.65% and 0.39-1.21% with and without moth releases, respectively. Correspondingly, levels of fruit injury in the pheromone-treated plots were 0.09-0.27% and 0.05-0.07% with and without moth releases, respectively. In 1988, fruit injury in the pheromone-treated and untreated pear plots with moth releases were 0.05 and 0.16%, respectively. Average emission levels of (E,E)-8,10-dodecadien-1-ol at dusk for a 14-d period after releases were 8.4-40.9 mg/ha per h each year. Spatial analysis of fruit injury showed that fruit injury was aggregated and moth movement within orchards was limited and not influenced by the presence of pheromone. Our data suggested that more fruit injury occurred on 'Golden Delicious' than 'Red Delicious'. 3aorchards 3aPyrus 3asex pheromones 3acrop damage 3apheromone traps 3aMalus domestica 3amating disruption 3aCydia pomonella 0aWashington1 aKnight, A.L.1 aUnruh, T.R.1 aBrown, D.F.1 aKrysan, J.L.1 aSell, C.R.1 aKirsch, P.A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1992 June, v. 85, no. 3 p.918-925x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/85.3.9183Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03524naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245007300202300001800275506007600293520178000369506003702149650002202186650002402208650001702232650001302249650001002262650001102272650001102283650002502294650001702319650001402336650001202350650002002362650001302382650001402395650001402409650000902423650001402432650001602446650001802462650001902480650001202499651001102511651001402522651001302536700002102549700001902570700002102589773017402610852000902784856008302793939003302876946001302909655001202922IND4451314520221207073641.0110325e20110322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445131452DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10187761082doi7 aPMC30643772pmcid7 a213831612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoh, Lian Pin10aRemotely sensed evidence of tropical peatland conversion to oil palm  ap. 5127-5132.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRising global demands for food and biofuels are driving forest clearance in the tropics. Oil-palm expansion contributes to biodiversity declines and carbon emissions in Southeast Asia. However, the magnitudes of these impacts remain largely unquantified until now. We produce a 250-m spatial resolution map of closed canopy oil-palm plantations in the lowlands of Peninsular Malaysia (2 million ha), Borneo (2.4 million ha), and Sumatra (3.9 million ha). We demonstrate that 6% (or [almost equal to]880,000 ha) of tropical peatlands in the region had been converted to oil-palm plantations by the early 2000s. Conversion of peatswamp forests to oil palm led to biodiversity declines of 1% in Borneo (equivalent to four species of forest-dwelling birds), 3.4% in Sumatra (16 species), and 12.1% in Peninsular Malaysia (46 species). This land-use change also contributed to the loss of [almost equal to]140 million Mg of aboveground biomass carbon, and annual emissions of [almost equal to]4.6 million Mg of belowground carbon from peat oxidation. Additionally, the loss of peatswamp forests implies the loss of carbon sequestration service through peat accumulation, which amounts to [almost equal to]660,000 Mg of carbon annually. By 2010, 2.3 million ha of peatswamp forests were clear-felled, and currently occur as degraded lands. Reforestation of these clearings could enhance biodiversity by up to [almost equal to]20%, whereas oil-palm establishment would exacerbate species losses by up to [almost equal to]12%. To safeguard the region's biodiversity and carbon stocks, conservation and reforestation efforts should target Central Kalimantan, Riau, and West Kalimantan, which retain three-quarters (3.9 million ha) of the remaining peatswamp forests in Southeast Asia.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aElaeis guineensis 3aaboveground biomass 3abiodiversity 3abiofuels 3abirds 3acanopy 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aemissions 3aforests 3aland use change 3alowlands 3amagnesium 3aoxidation 3apeat 3apeatlands 3aplantations 3areforestation 3aremote sensing 3atropics 3aBorneo 3aIndonesia 3aMalaysia1 aMiettinen, Jukka1 aLiew, Soo Chin1 aGhazoul, Jaboury0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Mar. 22, v. 108, no. 12 p.5127-5132dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10187761083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110325  aOther US 7aarticle01865naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002100133245004300154300001600197520100600213650001401219650002101233650001401254650003501268651001301303653002001316653001901336653001901355773010201374852000901476939003301485945000801518946001301526655001201539991584944970742620221119050107.0830531e198302  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830018222DNAL7 a68227032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDowney, Ethel A.10aPlanning for a department of dietetics  ap. 174-177.  aPractical steps of which dietitians should be aware in planning a new dietetics department are discussed. At the outset, department responsibilities should be identified, including: inpatient and outpatient nutritional care services directed toward preventive, maintenance, and therapeutic aspects; education for nutrition and foodservice staff and patients; and foodservice administration and operation. A number of pitfalls in foodservice planning are identified and discussed. Aspects of the selection of a foodservice consultant and factors to be considered in projecting trends into the future are described in detail. A replacement hospital project is described for illustration purposes. Planning, defined as projecting management, often is both irregular and non-linear. Hence it is important to identify aspects of high predictability. Sound planning must take place before design decisions are made. Most importantly, the dietitian should be prepared to play a key role in the planning.

Among the many heteromers reported in the opioid receptor family are μ/κ, κ/δ, and μ/δ. However, the in vivo physiological and behavioral relevance for the proposed heteromers have not yet been established. Here we report a unique example of a ligand, N-naphthoyl-β-naltrexamine (NNTA) that selectively activates heteromeric μ/κ-opioid receptors in HEK-293 cells and induces potent antinociception in mice. NNTA was an exceptionally potent agonist in cells expressing μ/κ-opioid receptors. Intriguingly, it was found to be a potent antagonist in cells expressing only μ-receptors. In the mouse tail-flick assay, intrathecal (i.t.) NNTA produced antinociception that was approximately 100-fold greater than by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration. The κ-antagonist, norBNI, decreased the i.t. potency, and the activity was virtually abolished in μ-opioid receptor knockout mice. No tolerance was induced i.t., but marginal tolerance (3-fold) was observed via the i.c.v. route. Moreover, NNTA produced neither significant physical dependence nor place preference in the ED₅₀ dose range. Taken together, this work provides an important pharmacologic tool for investigating the in vivo functional relevance of heteromeric μ/κ-opioid receptors and suggests an approach to potent analgesics with fewer deleterious side effects.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aadverse effects 3aagonists 3aanalgesics 3aantagonists 3aknockout mutants 3amice1 aLunzer, Mary M.1 aMcCurdy, Christopher R.1 aPowers, Michael D.1 aKalyuzhny, Alexander E.1 aRoerig, Sandra C.1 aPortoghese, Philip S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Mar. 22, v. 108, no. 12 p.5098-5103dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10162771083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110325  aOther US 7aarticle03273naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002500181245014100206300001800347500002400365506007600389520157000465506003702035650004302072650001202115650002202127650002802149650001902177650001002196650003002206650001902236650001702255650001102272650001402283650003002297650003702327650002002364650001402384650001402398700002902412700002502441700002202466700002202488700002102510773013502531852000902666856008002675655001202755IND4451324120221207062853.0110325e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445132412DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02322-102doi7 aPMC30674432pmcid7 a212969392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandt, Stephanie M.10aMolecular Risk Assessment and Epidemiological Typing of Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli by Using a Novel PCR Binary Typing System  ap. 2458-2470.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is a zoonotic pathogen that causes diarrheal disease in humans and is of public health concern because of its ability to cause outbreaks and severe disease such as hemorrhagic colitis or hemolytic-uremic syndrome. More than 400 serotypes of STEC have been implicated in outbreaks and sporadic human disease. The aim of this study was to develop a PCR binary typing (P-BIT) system that could be used to aid in risk assessment and epidemiological studies of STEC by using gene targets that would represent a broad range of STEC virulence genes. We investigated the distribution of 41 gene targets in 75 O157 and non-O157 STEC isolates and found that P-BIT provided 100% typeability for isolates, gave a diversity index of 97.33% (compared with 99.28% for XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] typing), and produced 100% discrimination for non-O157 STEC isolates. We identified 24 gene targets that conferred the same level of discrimination and produced the same cluster dendrogram as the 41 gene targets initially examined. P-BIT clustering identified O157 from non-O157 isolates and identified seropathotypes associated with outbreaks and severe disease. Numerical analysis of the P-BIT data identified several genes associated with human or nonhuman sources as well as high-risk seropathotypes. We conclude that P-BIT is a useful approach for subtyping, offering the advantage of speed, low cost, and potential for strain risk assessment that can be used in tandem with current molecular typing schema for STEC.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3acolitis 3adisease outbreaks 3aepidemiological studies 3agene targeting 3agenes 3ahemolytic uremic syndrome 3ahuman diseases 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3arisk assessment 3aserotypes 3avirulence1 aKing, N.

However, few quantitative examples exist of the interrelationship of globalization, socioeconomics, and ecological patterns. We present a striking illustration of a cascade in which bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; "mad cow disease") outbreaks in Europe exerted pressure on global beef markets, subsequently affecting North American hayfields and grassland bird populations. We examined competing models, which linked the prevalence of BSE in five focal countries, volume of beef exports to those countries from North America, and the amount of hayfield harvested and the abundance of grassland birds in North America. We found that (i) imports from North America increased 1 y after BSE outbreaks; (ii) probably because fewer cattle remained, the hay harvest in North America was reduced 2 y after the outbreak; (iii) the reduced hay harvest yielded a positive response in grassland bird populations 3 y after the outbreak.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeef 3abirds 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 3acattle 3aepizootic diseases 3aexports 3aglobalization 3ahay 3aimports 3amarkets 3ameadows 3amodels 3asocioeconomics 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aKoslowsky, Hannah M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Mar. 22, v. 108, no. 12 p.5122-5126dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10189041083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110325  aOther US 7aarticle03297naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002000141245023800161300001800399500001500417520210900432650002702541650002402568650002702592650003002619650001702649650002702666650001402693653002602707773009002733852000902823856008102832939003302913946001302946655001202959IND9207449520221119045935.0921209e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920744952DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/85.5.15512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabashnik, B.E.10aResistance risk assessment: realized heritability of resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis in diamondback moth (Lepidoptera: Plutellida), tobacco budworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and Colorado Potato beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)  ap. 1551-1559.  a2019-12-04  aA new method for estimating realized heritability (h2) of resistance to insecticides from laboratory selection experiments is described. A major advantage of this method for estimating h2, the proportion of total phenotypic variation attributable to additive genetic variation, is that it requires only data that are collected routinely in selection studies (i.e., LC50 and slope before and after selection, and average mortality caused by selection each generation). Estimates of h2 of resistance calculated with this method were virtually identical to two previously reported estimates calculated by a regression method that requires estimates of LC50 for every generation. Estimates of h2 of resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis in Plutella xylostella (L.) were 0.14, 0.17, and 0.18 in three strains initiated from a moderately resistant field population in Hawaii compared with 0.047 in a laboratory strain from France. Estimated h2 of resistance to B. thuringiensis was 0.17 in Helicoverpa virescens (F.) and 0.09 in Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say). Extrapolation to field populations is problematic. However, assuming that these h2 estimates can be extrapolated to the field and that populations receive prolonged and uniform exposure to B. thuringiensis causing greater than 90% mortality each generation, substantially increased resistance would be expected after less than 10 generations for H. virescens and less than 15 generations for L. decemlineata. In six cases examined here, h2 was higher in the first half of selection experiments (mean = 0.38) than in the second half (mean = 0.15). This suggests that brief selection experiments (4-6 generations) may most efficiently detect the potential for resistance development. Estimation of h2 of resistance based on the method described here provides a means for systematic, quantitative analysis of selection experiments, including many of the greater than 150 previously reported studies. This approach can improve evaluation of results from selection experiments and may enhance their integration into systems of resistance risk assessment. 3abacterial insecticides 3aPlutella xylostella 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aLeptinotarsa decemlineata 3aheritability 3ainsecticide resistance 3amortality 0abiological resistance0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1992 Oct., v. 85, no. 5 p.1551-1559x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/85.5.15513Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01554naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007000125300002000195520082800215650002001043650002601063700001501089700001801104773009801122852000901220930003301229945001301262946001301275655001201288IND2056636120221119045936.0970421e199611  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205663612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, B.M.10aHyperinsulinemia in rats with obesity-inducing amygdaloid lesions  ap.

In the present study, the effects of such lesions on plasma insulin, glucose, corticosterone, and adrenocorticotropic hormone were assessed during a period of food restriction and again after a 15-day period of food ad libitum. Compared with control animals, the rats with amygdaloid lesions were hyperinsulinemic under both conditions and gained substantially more weight when fed ad libitum. No difference between groups was observed for the other hormones. It is concluded that damage to the posterodorsal aspects of the medial amygdala results in a primary metabolic dysfunction that accounts, at least in part, for the overeating and excessive weight gain. 3ahuman nutrition 3adiet-related diseases1 aCook, J.T.1 aDallman, M.F.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1996 Nov., v. 271, no. 5:pt.2 p.R1156-R1159x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02849naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245009000207300002000297506007600317520130500393506003701698650001801735650001201753650001401765650001801779650000901797650001501806650001501821650001701836650001501853650002301868700002601891700002201917700001901939700001901958700003001977700002602007700002002033773017602053852000902229856008302238939003302321946001302354655001202367IND4459534220221207064820.0110701e20110628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445953422DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10193521082doi7 aPMC31279292pmcid7 a216702772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerrerio, Pamela.10aPerturbation of thymocyte development in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)-deficient mice  ap. 10638-10643.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe random nature of T-cell receptor-β (TCR-β) recombination needed to generate immunological diversity dictates that two-thirds of alleles will be out-of-frame. Transcripts derived from nonproductive rearrangements are cleared by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, the process by which cells selectively degrade transcripts harboring premature termination codons. Here, we demonstrate that the fetal thymus in transgenic mice that ubiquitously express a dominant-negative form of Rent1/hUpf1, an essential trans-effector of NMD, shows decreased cell number, reduced CD4CD8 double-positive thymocytes, diminished expression of TCR-β, and increased expression of CD25, suggesting a defect in pre-TCR signaling. Transgenic fetal thymocytes also demonstrated diminished endogenous Vβ-to-DβJβ rearrangements, whereas Dβ-to-Jβ rearrangements were unperturbed, suggesting that inhibition of NMD induces premature shut-off of TCR-β rearrangement. Developmental arrest of thymocytes is prevented by the introduction of a fully rearranged TCR-β transgene that precludes generation of out-of-frame transcripts, suggesting direct mRNA-mediated trans-dominant effects. These data document that NMD has been functionally incorporated into developmental programs during eukaryotic evolution.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aalleles 3aevolution 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3astop codon 3athymocytes 3athymus gland 3atransgenes 3atransgenic animals1 aMontgomery, Robert A.1 aWarren, Daniel S.1 aCooke, Sara K.1 aLutz, Johannes1 aSonnenday, Christopher J.1 aGuerrerio, Anthony L.1 aDietz, Harry C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 28, v. 108, no. 26 p.10638-10643dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10193521083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110701  aOther US 7aarticle02598naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001700141245006300158300001800221500001500239520164200254650001001896650001001906650001601916650001501932653001701947653001301964653001601977653001001993700001902003773009002022852000902112856008102121939003302202946001302235655001202248IND9207453220221119050030.0921210e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920745322DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/85.5.18182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPowell, P.K.10aPenetration and permanence of permethrin in four softwoods  ap. 1818-1821.  a2019-12-04  aWe evaluated the 24-h penetration and 6-mo permanence of a 0.5% (AI) dilution of permethrin into southern yellow pine (SYP) (Pinus spp.), northern hard pine (Pinus spp.), spruce (Picea abies), and fir (Abies spp.) after surface application. Three- to 12-mo permanence was evaluated only with SYP. Penetration with xylene and nonxylene solvents was evaluated at 24 h. Insecticide (220 microliters) was applied to the surface of wood blocks (4 by 5 by 1 cm). After 24 h in the laboratory, or 3 or 6 mo in an attic or crawl space, the center cubic centimeter was removed and sectioned (50 micrometers per slice) from the treated surface to a depth of 2 mm. Permethrin concentration in each slice was measured by gas chromatography. Penetration of permethrin to 950 micrometers was not significantly different in SYP than in the other softwoods. At 1600 micrometers penetration was not significantly different in SYP, northern hard pine, and fir, but was significantly less in spruce. At depths in wood below 1,200 micrometers, only the cis isomer of permethrin was detected. At 1,200-, 1,600-, and 2,000-micrometers depths, more permethrin was present in SYP blocks stored in the attic than in blocks stored in the crawl space. The amount of permethrin at the surface in SYP decreased after 3 mo, but no further decrease after 6 mo in the attic and crawl space was apparent. After 12 mo, a significant decrease in the amount of permethrin at the surface of SYP occurred. Penetration of permethrin in SYP did not differ among solvents; at 950 micrometers, a significant difference between one nonxylene and a xylene formulation was observed. 3aPinus 3aAbies 3aPicea abies 3apermethrin 0aformulations 0aresidues 0apenetration 0aPicea1 aRobinson, W.H.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1992 Oct., v. 85, no. 5 p.1818-1821x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/85.5.18183Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02521naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245011500157300001800272520146600290650002301756650001401779650001601793650001701809650001501826650001401841650001701855651001401872653001501886700001601901700001601917773009001933852000902023856008102032939003302113946001302146655001202159IND9205902820221119050103.0920923e199208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920590282DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/85.4.13682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrook, K.D.10aResponse of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., to damage by insect pests in Australia: manual simulation of damage  ap. 1368-1377.  aThree experiments were done between 1984 and 1987 in manually simulated pest damage with up to 14 damage treatments in any year, involving different types and levels of damage at three stages of the season applied to three varieties, two plant populations, and two irrigation regimes. In these experiments, the cotton plant has again shown a considerable ability to compensate in terms of total lint yield for early damage, involving either the loss of the growing point or squares. Although severe damage or combinations of tip and square removal sometimes caused considerable delay in maturity, light and moderate damage had little effect. Damage treatments did not affect fiber attributes sufficiently to have incurred price penalties commercially, despite extreme delay in some cases. Damage treatments did not interact with plant populations and irrigation regimes but the locally bred okra leaf variety 'Siokra' was more responsive to damage than the normal leaf variety 'Deltapine 90', with increased yield at light to moderate levels of early damage and decreased yield at severe levels. Evidence was found in the data from these experiments for the occurrence of three out of four previously identified physiological mechanisms involved in compensation by the crop plant for damage: damage substituting for physiological shedding, increased boll weight and increased rate of flowering. There was no evidence of the fourth mechanism, increased boll set. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acultivars 3acrop damage 3acrop quality 3acrop yield 3aHeliothis 3ainsect pests 3aAustralia 0asimulation1 aHearn, A.B.1 aKelly, C.F.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1992 Aug., v. 85, no. 4 p.1368-1377x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/85.4.13683Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01901naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245011800157300001800275520088800293650001901181650002001200650001501220650001401235650001301249650001701262650002101279651002101300653001601321773009001337852000901427856008101436939003301517946001301550655001201563IND9207452420221119045955.0921209e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920745242DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/85.5.17542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergh, J.C.10aMonitoring the emergence and behavior of pear rust mite (Acarina: Eriophyidae) deutogynes using sticky-band traps  ap. 1754-1761.  aDeutogynes of pear rust mite, Epitrimerus pyri (Nalepa), emerging from overwintering sites on branches of pear, Pyrus communis L., were captured in the laboratory and field using sticky-band traps. On branches in the laboratory, mite emergence was stimulated by light, and active mites were positively phototactic. Emergence was not affected by bud development. The rate of mite emergence at 15 degrees C was significantly less than at 20 degrees C. In the orchard, the same trends of emergence and activity were recorded from traps on fruit spurs and on 2-yr-old branches. In 1991, emergence began slowly in late March, peaked sharply in mid-April, then declined to near zero by early May. The results are discussed in relation to the potential for the development of a predictive model of pear rust mite emergence upon which growers could base the timing of acaricide applications. 3aPyrus communis 3aanimal behavior 3amonitoring 3amortality 3aorchards 3asticky traps 3aEpitrimerus pyri 3aBritish Columbia 0afield tests0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1992 Oct., v. 85, no. 5 p.1754-1761x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/85.5.17543Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02671naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245011300203300002000316506007600336520106200412506003701474650001801511650001201529650001801541650002501559650001801584650003201602650000901634650001801643650001701661650002101678700002501699700001601724700002301740700002101763700001901784700001901803700001801822700002301840773017601863852000902039856008302048939003302131946001302164655001202177IND4459534320221207050901.0110701e20110628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445953432DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10192241082doi7 aPMC31279272pmcid7 a216702792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLutz, Johannes10aPro-B cells sense productive immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement irrespective of polypeptide production  ap. 10644-10649.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aB-lymphocyte development is dictated by the protein products of functionally rearranged Ig heavy (H) and light (L) chain genes. Ig rearrangement begins in pro-B cells at the IgH locus. If pro-B cells generate a productive allele, they assemble a pre-B cell receptor complex, which signals their differentiation into pre-B cells and their clonal expansion. Pre-B cell receptor signals are also thought to contribute to allelic exclusion by preventing further IgH rearrangements. Here we show in two independent mouse models that the accumulation of a stabilized μH mRNA that does not encode μH chain protein specifically impairs pro-B cell differentiation and reduces the frequency of rearranged IgH genes in a dose-dependent manner. Because noncoding IgH mRNA is usually rapidly degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay machinery, we propose that the difference in mRNA stability allows pro-B cells to distinguish between productive and nonproductive Ig gene rearrangements and that μH mRNA may thus contribute to efficient H chain allelic exclusion.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aalleles 3aanimal models 3acell differentiation 3adose response 3aimmunoglobulin heavy chains 3aloci 3amessenger RNA 3apolypeptides 3aprotein products1 aHeideman, Marinus R.1 aRoth, Edith1 avan den Berk, Paul1 aMüller, Werner.1 aRaman, Chander1 aWabl, Matthias1 aJacobs, Heinz1 aJäck, Hans-Martin0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 28, v. 108, no. 26 p.10644-10649dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10192241083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110701  aOther US 7aarticle02377naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245009000205300002000295506007600315520105500391506003701446650002501483650001401508650001401522650001901536650000901555650002101564650001601585700002101601700002401622700001901646773017601665852000901841856008301850939003301933946001301966655001201979IND4459534120221207070408.0110701e20110628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445953412DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11029851082doi7 aPMC31279222pmcid7 a216702812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTschopp, Patrick10aReshuffling genomic landscapes to study the regulatory evolution of Hox gene clusters  ap. 10632-10637.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe emergence of Vertebrata was accompanied by two rounds of whole-genome duplications. This enabled paralogous genes to acquire novel functions with high evolutionary potential, a process suggested to occur mostly by changes in gene regulation, rather than in protein sequences. In the case of Hox gene clusters, such duplications favored the appearance of distinct global regulations. To assess the impact of such "regulatory evolution" upon neo-functionalization, we developed PANTHERE (PAN-genomic Translocation for Heterologous Enhancer RE-shuffling) to bring the entire megabase-scale HoxD regulatory landscape in front of the HoxC gene cluster via a targeted translocation in vivo. At this chimeric locus, Hoxc genes could both interpret this foreign regulation and functionally substitute for their Hoxd counterparts. Our results emphasize the importance of evolving regulatory modules rather than their target genes in the process of neo-functionalization and offer a genetic tool to study the complexity of the vertebrate regulatory genome.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acid sequences 3achimerism 3aevolution 3ahomeotic genes 3aloci 3amultigene family 3avertebrates1 aFraudeau, Nadine1 aBéna, Frédérique1 aDuboule, Denis0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 28, v. 108, no. 26 p.10632-10637dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11029851083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110701  aOther US 7aarticle02845naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245013500202300002000337506007600357520137100433506003701804650001601841650001001857650001801867650001201885650002101897650002201918650002501940700002401965700002201989700002302011700002002034700002002054700002302074773017602097852000902273856008302282939003302365946001302398655001202411IND4459533820221207070350.0110701e20110628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445953382DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11072721082doi7 aPMC31279142pmcid7 a216660972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEspagne, Eric10aSme4 coiled-coil protein mediates synaptonemal complex assembly, recombinosome relocalization, and spindle pole body morphogenesis  ap. 10614-10619.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe identify a large coiled-coil protein, Sme4/PaMe4, that is highly conserved among the large group of Sordariales and plays central roles in two temporally and functionally distinct aspects of the fungal sexual cycle: first as a component of the meiotic synaptonemal complex (SC) and then, after disappearing and reappearing, as a component of the spindle pole body (SPB). In both cases, the protein mediates spatial juxtaposition of two major structures: linkage of homolog axes through the SC and a change in the SPB from a planar to a bent conformation. Corresponding mutants exhibit defects, respectively, in SC and SPB morphogenesis, with downstream consequences for recombination and astral-microtubule nucleation plus postmeiotic nuclear migration. Sme4 is also required for reorganization of recombination complexes in which Rad51, Mer3, and Msh4 foci relocalize from an on-axis position to a between-axis (on-SC) position concomitant with SC installation. Because involved recombinosome foci represent total recombinational interactions, these dynamics are irrespective of their designation for maturation into cross-overs or noncross-overs. The defined dual roles for Sme4 in two different structures that function at distinct phases of the sexual cycle also provide more functional links and evolutionary dynamics among the nuclear envelope, SPB, and SC.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSordariales 3afungi 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3anuclear membrane 3aspindle pole body 3asynaptonemal complex1 aVasnier, Christelle1 aStorlazzi, Aurora1 aKleckner, Nancy E.1 aSilar, Philippe1 aZickler, Denise1 aMalagnac, Fabienne0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 28, v. 108, no. 26 p.10614-10619dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11072721083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110701  aOther US 7aarticle01991naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245013800163300001400301500001500315520077900330650001301109650001301122650002601135650002301161650002001184650002001204650001501224650003001239650001401269650002001283653002001303653001701323700002201340700001701362700001401379773008601393852000901479930003301488945002501521946001101546655001201557IND4375730520221119045857.0051103s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437573052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The sampling plan used 26 pheromone traps. As the adult population follows the negative binomial distribution, a sequential sampling plan was developed using the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). Iwao's confidence interval method was also employed to analyse results. The sampling plan was implemented to assist management decision-making based on the economic threshold of 5 insects/trap/week. The results show that, using SPRT or Iwao's methods, managers can make decisions using only seven and six traps, respectively, with a minimum risk of incorrect assessment. 3asampling 3atrapping 3aLasioderma serricorne 3aeconomic threshold 3astorage insects 3apheromone traps 3acigarettes 3astored product protection 3afactories 3adecision making 0apest management 0apest stautus1 aCarvalho, J.P. de1 aTorres, L.M.1 aMexia, A.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2006, v. 42, no. 1 p.42-50x0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/12/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03091naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245011100169300001600280520177300296650002102069650001402090650001802104650002802122650002502150650002102175650001302196650001502209650002002224650001302244650001502257650002702272650001802299650001802317651001202335700002302347700002702370700002602397700002602423700002102449773011802470856004802588852000902636655001202645IND4494083520221119045758.0141110e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449408352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-010-9393-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObour, Augustine K.10aAgronomic and environmental impacts of phosphorus fertilization of low input bahiagrass systems in Florida  ap. 281-290.  aPhosphorus management in low input bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) systems represents a major challenge of agronomic and environmental importance. Concerns over agricultural P transport to surface waters have prompted several revisions in the P fertilizer recommendations for bahiagrass in Florida. This study evaluated the effects of revised P fertilizer recommendations on forage dry matter yield (DMY) and nutritive value and the potential impacts on water quality in bahiagrass pastures growing on a Spodosol. Treatments consisted of the factorial combination of three N rates (0, 56, and 112 kg N ha−1) and four P rates (0, 5, 10, and 20 kg P ha−1), replicated three times and applied annually in May of 2007 and 2008. Forage was harvested at 28-d intervals and DMY, tissue P and crude protein concentration, and P uptake were measured. To monitor P leaching potential, suction cup lysimeters were installed at 15-, 30-, 60-, 90-, and 150-cm depths. In 2007, bahiagrass DMY was not affected by P; however, in 2008 there was a linear increase in DMY from 6.9 to 8.2 Mg ha−1 as P rate increased. In both years, tissue P increased linearly from 2.1 to 2.5 g kg−1 as P rates increased from 0 to 20 kg P ha−1. Similarly, P uptake increased from 14 kg P ha−1 for the control to 19 kg P ha−1 for the treatment receiving 20 kg P ha−1. During the 2-year study, P fertilization had no impact on soil Mehlich-1, water-extractable P, and leachate P concentrations. Leachate P concentrations at the 15- and 30-cm depths varied seasonally (from 0.05 to 0.85 mg P l−1), with greater spikes occurring during periods of high water table conditions. Current P fertilization recommendation can increase bahiagrass DMY with no adverse impacts on water quality. 3aPaspalum notatum 3aSpodosols 3acrude protein 3adry matter accumulation 3aenvironmental impact 3ahigh water table 3aleaching 3alysimeters 3anutritive value 3apastures 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3asurface water 3awater quality 3aFlorida1 aSilveira, Maria L.1 aVendramini, Joao M.

The effects of geographic origin, time under laboratory conditions, laboratory diet, stage of development, age within stage, and season on P. interpunctella SCP were examined. Overall, SCPs ranged from -28.6 to -2.4°C. At the times of collection, differences in SCP between field-collected individuals and individuals from laboratory sources were negligible. The minimum observed SCP for most of the cultures tested soon after collection was below -20°C. After 7 months under laboratory conditions, the mean SCP of field-collected and laboratory-reared cultures remained unchanged. No particular trend in SCP was observed when comparing cultures from northern and southern regions. Differences in laboratory diets did not affect mean SCP. Mean SCP for 1- and 4-d-old eggs was similar. Eggs (-24.4°C), first instars (-23.5°C), pupae (-22.2°C), and adults (-22.4°C) had lower mean SCPs than later instar larvae (-14.4 to -11.6°C). When confined in the laboratory for 8 months under conditions which were not controlled, monthly mean SCP for the same culture varied by as much as 5.7°C. Plodia interpunctella appeared to regulate its SCP as the season changed, with a relatively high mean SCP during summer and a marked decline of more than 10°C in fall. The SCPs obtained in this study suggest that very low temperatures may be needed for disinfestation of P. interpunctella at all stages of development. 3aPlodia interpunctella 3astorage insects 3acold tolerance 3asupercooling point 3ageographical variation 3ainsect rearing 3aduration 3aartificial diets 3adevelopmental stages 3aage 3aseasonal variation 3alaboratory rearing 3aMinnesota 3aTexas 3aOklahoma 0afreeze intolerance1 aCannon, C.A.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2005, v. 41, no. 5 p.556-564x0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL  a20050907b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/09/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02551naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001700178245008600195300001600281520110200297650002501399650002001424650001601444650002301460650001001483650001001493650002801503650001001531650001601541650002301557650002801580650002701608650002501635653002501660653001401685653002701699653002101726700001501747700001801762700001801780700001401798700001401812700001701826773008801843852000901931930003301940945002501973946001101998655001202009IND4373802820221119045851.0050829s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437380282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNiewiada, A.10aSome factors affecting egg-laying of the granary weevil (Sitophilus granarius L.)  ap. 544-555.  aThe effect of some factors affecting egg laying of the granary weevil Sitophilus granarius was studied. In choice-tests, females laid less eggs in grains previously infested, but in no-choice tests, there was no statistical difference between the number of eggs in sound grain (59 per female) and previously infested grain (66 per female). There was a negative correlation between the number of egg plugs deposited previously and the additional number of plugs: the greater the number of plugs initially, the fewer were added. Chemical analyses of plugs and female abdomens showed a compound appearing in both extracts. It was tentatively identified as a glycosidic derivative of hexose. The kernels from which cuticular waxes had been washed with n-hexane were less attractive for egg-laying females than the sound ones. Chemical analyses of grain cuticular lipids revealed alkanes, wax esters, triacylglycerols, free fatty acids, alcohols, sterols and unknown compounds. Grain fungal volatile metabolites such as 1-octanol and 2-methyl-1-butanol added to sterilized kernels increased egg laying. 3aSitophilus granarius 3astorage insects 3aoviposition 3apopulation density 3awheat 3aseeds 3amicrobial contamination 3afungi 3ametabolites 3avolatile compounds 3aoviposition attractants 3aoviposition deterrents 3achemical composition 0aoviposition behavior 0aegg plugs 0agrain cuticular lipids 0afungal volatiles1 aNawrot, J.1 aSzafranek, J.1 aSzafranek, B.1 aSynak, E.1 aJelen, H.1 aWasowicz, E.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2005, v. 41, no. 5 p.544-555x0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL  a20050907b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/09/06  aNon-US 7aarticle05803naa a2200925 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100002300198245017600221300001400397500001500411520290700426650002403333650002403357650002403381650002303405650001403428650001903442650001303461650002303474650001903497650001603516650001303532650001803545650002203563650001403585650002003599650002003619650002503639650002603664650001703690650001103707650002703718650004403745650001003789650000903799650002203808650002703830650003303857650002703890650001903917650004903936650002403985650004304009650003704052650003004089650004304119650002604162650004204188650001104230650002504241650001104266650003404277650000904311650002704320650001604347650003404363650002304397650003104420650003404451650001304485650003004498653002504528653003904553700002004592700001704612773007104629852000904700856008504709930003304794945002504827946001304852655001204865IND4397305320221119045841.0071029s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439730532DNAL7 a179274972pmid7 a10.1080/016355807013650682doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCerchietti, L.C.A.10aEffects of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic n-3 fatty acids from fish oil and preferential Cox-2 inhibition on systemic syndromes in patients with advanced lung cancer  ap. 14-20.  a2019-12-04  aUnder the common denomination of Systemic Immune-Metabolic Syndrome (SIMS), we grouped many symptoms that share a similar pathophysiologic background. SIMS is the result of the dysfunctional interaction of tumor cells, stroma cells, and the immune system, leading to the release of cytokines and other systemic mediators such as eicosanoids. SIMS includes systemic syndromes such as paraneoplastic hemopathies, hypercalcemia, coagulopathies, fatigue, weakness, cachexia, chronic nausea, anorexia, and early satiety among others. Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic n-3 fatty acids from fish oil can help in the management of persistent chronic inflammatory states, but treatment's compliance is generally poor. Preferentially, Cox-2 inhibition can create a favorable pattern of cytokines by decreasing the production of certain eicosanoids, although their role in SIMS is unknown. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that by modulating systemic inflammation through an eicosanoid-targeted approach, some of the symptoms of the SIMS could be controlled. We exclusively evaluated 12 patients for compliance. Patients were assigned 1 of the 4 treatment groups (15-, 12-, 9-, or 6-g dose, fractionated every 8 h). For patients assigned to 15 and 12 doses, the overall compliance was very poor and unsatisfactory for patients receiving the 9-g dose. The maximum tolerable dose was calculated to be around 2 capsules tid (6 g of fish oil per day). A second cohort of 22 patients with advanced lung cancer and SIMS were randomly assigned to receive either fish oil, 2 g tid, plus placebo capsules bid (n = 12) or fish oil, 2 g tid, plus celecoxib 200 mg bid (n = 10). All patients in both groups received oral food supplementation. After 6 wk of treatment, patients receiving fish oil + placebo or fish oil + celecoxib showed significantly more appetite, less fatigue, and lower C-reactive protein (C-RP) values than their respective baselines values (P < 0.02 for all the comparisons). Additionally, patients in the fish oil + celecoxib group also improved their body weight and muscle strength compared to baseline values (P < 0.02 for all the comparisons). Comparing both groups, patients receiving fish oil + celecoxib showed significantly lower C-RP levels (P = 0.005, t-test), higher muscle strength (P = 0.002, t-test) and body weight (P = 0.05, t-test) than patients receiving fish oil + placebo. The addition of celecoxib improved the control of the acute phase protein response, total body weight, and muscle strength. Additionally, the consistent nutritional support used in our patients could have helped to maximize the pharmacological effects of fish oil and/or celecoxib. This study shows that by modulating the eicosanoid metabolism using a combination of n-3 fatty acids and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, some of the signs and symptoms associated with a SIMS could be ameliorated. 3anutritional support 3adietary supplements 3aoral administration 3aC-reactive protein 3acytokines 3amuscle tissues 3apatients 3apatient compliance 3alung neoplasms 3abody weight 3aappetite 3ahealth status 3aenzyme inhibitors 3afish oils 3aclinical trials 3apathophysiology 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3ainflammation 3adosage 3aprostaglandin synthase 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAppetitexdrug effects 2aC-Reactive Proteinxanalysis 2aCachexiaxdrug therapy 2aCohort Studies 2aCyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitorsxtherapeutic use 2aDietary Supplements 2aDocosahexaenoic Acidsxtherapeutic use 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Therapy, Combination 2aEicosapentaenoic Acidxtherapeutic use 2aFatiguexdrug therapy 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xtherapeutic use 2aFemale 2aFish Oilsxchemistry 2aHumans 2aLung Neoplasmsxcomplications 2aMale 2aMaximum Tolerated Dose 2aMiddle Aged 2aMuscle Strengthxdrug effects 2aPatient Compliance 2aPyrazolesxtherapeutic use 2aSulfonamidesxtherapeutic use 2aSyndrome 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects 0aacute phase proteins 0aSystemic Immune-Metabolic Syndrome1 aNavigante, A.H.1 aCastro, M.A.0 tNutrition and cancer.g2007, v. 59, no. 1 p.14-20x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355807013650683Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/29  aOther US 7aarticle03877naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001500198245013500213300001400348500001500362520145900377650002001836650001701856650003301873650000801906650001601914650002001930650001601950650002301966650002601989650002302015650002402038650001402062650004802076650001402124650003002138650002302168650005902191650001102250650006002261650004502321650005402366650001502420650000902435650005802444650001702502650001402519650005902533653002502592653002102617653003602638653000902674653002002683653002202703700001602725700001702741700001802758700001702776700002102793700001202814700001802826700001502844773007102859852000902930856008502939930003303024945002503057946001303082655001203095IND4394103420221119045912.0070814s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439410342DNAL7 a175719652pmid7 a10.1080/016355807013080342doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDewell, A.10aRelationship of Dietary Protein and Soy Isoflavones to Serum IGF-1 and IGF Binding Proteins in the Prostate Cancer Lifestyle Trial  ap. 35-42.  a2019-12-04  aHigh levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer, whereas increased levels of some of its binding proteins (IGFBPs) seem to be protective. High intakes of dietary protein, especially animal and soy protein, appear to increase IGF-1. However, soy isoflavones have demonstrated anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects both in vitro and in vivo. We evaluated dietary intakes of total protein and soy isoflavones in relation to the IGF axis in prostate cancer patients making comprehensive lifestyle changes including a very low-fat vegan diet supplemented with soy protein (58 g/day). After one year, intervention group patients reported significantly higher intakes of dietary protein and soy isoflavones compared to usual-care controls (P < 0.001). IGF-1 increased significantly in both groups, whereas IGFBP-1 rose in the experimental group only (P < 0.01). Increases in vegetable protein over one year were associated with increases in IGFBP-1 among intervention group patients (P < 0.05). These results suggest that dietary protein and soy isoflavones, in the context of comprehensive lifestyle changes, may not significantly alter IGF-1. However, given the recent literature indicating that high intake of protein rich in essential amino acids (animal or soy protein) may increase IGF-1, it may be prudent for men with early stage prostate cancer not to exceed dietary protein recommendations. 3anutrient intake 3alow fat diet 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3amen 3aisoflavones 3avegetarian diet 3asoy protein 3adisease prevention 3aessential amino acids 3acell proliferation 3aprostatic neoplasms 3alifestyle 3ainsulin-like growth factor binding proteins 3aapoptosis 3aanticarcinogenic activity 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixmetabolism 2aIsoflavonesxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aProstatic Neoplasmsxbloodxepidemiologyxmetabolism. 2aRisk Factors 2aSoy Foods 2aSoybean Proteinsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 0aplant source protein 0asoybean products 0aProstate Cancer Lifestyle Trial 0adiet 0adietary protein 0avery low fat diet1 aWeidner, G.1 aSumner, M.D.1 aBarnard, R.J.1 aMarlin, R.O.1 aDaubenmier, J.J.1 aChi, C.1 aCarroll, P.R.1 aOrnish, D.0 tNutrition and cancer.g2007, v. 58, no. 1 p.35-42x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355807013080343Available from publisher's Web site  a20080227b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/23  aOther US 7aarticle03376naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001400215245014100229300001400370520136300384650000901747650001801756650001301774650001501787650002301802650001201825650001701837650001601854650002101870650003201891650001101923650001801934650005801952650001202010650002802022650001502050650003202065650002102097650003702118650003202155650002602187650004502213650000902258650002602267650002402293650000902317650002602326653001802352653001902370700001902389700001402408700001502422700001702437773007102454852000902525856008502534930003302619945002502652946001302677655001202690IND4394103620221119045955.0070814s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439410362DNAL7 a175719672pmid7 a10.1080/016355807013081332doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMiura, D.10aHydroxymatairesinol and Its Mammalian Metabolite Enterolactone Reduce the Growth and Metastasis of Subcutaneous AH109A Hepatomas in Rats  ap. 49-59.  aBoth epidemiological and experimental evidence is accumulating to show that a lignan-rich diet may reduce the risk of human breast cancer. Possible anti-cancer effects of dietary lignans on hepatomas or hepatoma cells have not been the topic of earlier studies. In the present study, we examined the effect of 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) and its mammalian metabolite, enterolactone (ENL), on AH109A hepatoma cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. HMR and ENL inhibited the proliferation and invasion of AH109A hepatoma cells in vitro. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of hepatoma cell proliferation was lower for ENL (10 μM) than HMR (> 200 μM). Likewise, IC50 of hepatoma cell invasion was lower for ENL (9 μM) than HMR (144 μM). ENL suppressed hepatoma cell proliferation by accumulating cells in G1 phase and elongating doubling time of these cells, and by increasing the rate of apoptosis. Subsequently, we investigated in vivo the effect of dietary HMR and ENL on growth and metastasis of AH109A hepatomas in rats. Both of these compounds reduced the growth and metastasis of solid AH109A hepatomas in rats. These in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that HMR has inhibitory activities on tumor growth and metastasis in the hepatoma-bearing rats, and that this anti-tumor effect is mediated at least partially by ENL, a metabolite of HMR. 3arats 3aanimal models 3ahepatoma 3ametastasis 3acell proliferation 3alignans 3amatairesinol 3ametabolites 3ain vitro studies 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3adosage 3adose response 2a4-Butyrolactonexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCell Cycle 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aLignansxpharmacology 2aLiver Neoplasms, Experimentalxpathology 2aMale 2aNeoplasm Invasiveness 2aNeoplasm Metastasis 2aRats 2aTumor Cells, Cultured 0aenterolactone 0ahepatoma cells1 aSaarinen, N.M.1 aMiura, Y.1 aSantti, R.1 aYagasaki, K.0 tNutrition and cancer.g2007, v. 58, no. 1 p.49-59x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355807013081333Available from publisher's Web site  a20080227b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/23  aOther US 7aarticle02981naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001700211245010900228300001800337520152800355650002001883650002501903650002501928650002001953650002301973650002501996650002702021650001602048650002302064650001202087650001702099650002602116650001602142700001502158700001502173700001602188700001802204700001702222773007502239852000902314856008102323930003302404945002502437946001302462655001202475IND4375753520221119050030.0051104e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437575352DNAL7 a189433572pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-95-12712doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCastoria, R.10aEffect of the biocontrol yeast Rhodotorula glutinis strain LS11 on patulin accumulation in stored apples  ap. 1271-1278.  aContamination of apples (Malus domestica) and derived juices with fungicide residues and patulin produced by Penicillium expansum are major issues of food safety. Biocontrol agents represent an alternative or supplement to chemicals for disease control. Our data show that these microbes could also contribute to actively decreasing patulin accumulation in apples. Three biocontrol agents, Rhodotorula glutinis LS11, Cryptococcus laurentii LS28, and Aureobasidium pullulans LS30, were examined for their in vitro growth in the presence of patulin and for their capability to decrease mycotoxin recovery from the medium. Strain LS11 yielded the highest growth rates and the greatest decrease of toxin recoveries. Further, it caused the appearance of two major spots on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates, suggesting possible metabolization of the mycotoxin. In vivo, i.e., in the low percentage of LS11-pretreated apples infected by P. expansum, patulin accumulation was significantly lower than in nontreated infected fruits. Yeast cells survived and increased in infected apples and, in a model system emulating decaying apple, resulted in accelerated breakdown of patulin and the production of the same TLC spots as those detected in vitro. These data suggest that biocontrol yeast cells surviving in decaying apples could metabolize patulin and/or negatively affect its accumulation or synthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the effect of a biocontrol agent on patulin accumulation in vivo. 3aMalus domestica 3apostharvest diseases 3aPenicillium expansum 3adisease control 3abiological control 3aRhodotorula glutinis 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aapple juice 3afood contamination 3apatulin 3abiosynthesis 3aquantitative analysis 3acell growth1 aMorena, V.1 aCaputo, L.1 aPanfili, G.1 aDe Curtis, F.1 aDe Cicco, V.0 tPhytopathology.g2005 Nov., v. 95, no. 11 p.1271-1278x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-95-12713Available from publisher's Web site  a20080229b20080301c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/04/12  aOther US 7aarticle02246naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001600170245012300186300001600309500002400325520108000349650001701429650000901446650002901455650001101484650001001495650002301505650000901528650001201537650002801549650002101577650002201598650000901620700002201629773010901651852000901760856009101769655001201860IND4458535920221119045708.0110602s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445853592DNAL7 a211203752pmid7 a10.1590/S1519-566X20100005000042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMillas, Paz10aRate of soil egestion by larvae of Hylamorpha elegans (Burm.) and Phytoloema hermanni Germ.

In this study we evaluated the potential of H. elegans and P. herrmanni to ingest soil by estimating the rate of soil egestion. In the laboratory, the rate of soil egestion was determined from gut content and gut transit time of 3rd-instar larvae feeding on soil without roots. The soil egestion rate was 14-21 mg g-1 d-1 for H. elegans and 11-16 mg g-1 d-1 for P. herrmanni. The gut transit time (time of soil passage from mouth to anus) was 2-3 d for both species and the gut content was 41 ± 2 mg g-1 for H. elegans and 32 ± 2 mg g-1 for P. herrmanni. The quantitative importance of feeding activity on soil depends upon the population density of larvae in the field, which ranges from 1 to 25 larvae m-2, but in severe outbreaks can reach 300 larvae m-2. High population densities could result in soil egestion rates reaching 20 kg d-1 ha-1 for P. herrmanni and 30 kg d-1 ha-1 for H. elegans. 3aScarabaeidae 3aanus 3agastrointestinal transit 3alarvae 3amouth 3apopulation density 3asoil 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxphysiology. 2aFeeding Behavior 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aSoil1 aCarrillo, Roberto0 tNeotropical entomology.g2010 , v. 39, no. 5 p.697-702dEntomological Society of Brazilx1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20100005000043Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04074naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001800198245013100216300001400347520173700361650001102098650002302109650002502132650002302157650001702180650002402197650001302221650002202234650000902256650002602265650001502291650003102306650003502337650001402372650001902386650002602405650001202431650005202443650002802495650003602523650002902559650003702588650002902625650002802654650002902682650003002711650002002741650004902761650005002810650003902860650002202899650000902921650002102930650004702951650002502998653001603023653001403039700002003053700001903073773007103092852000903163856008503172930003303257945002503290946001303315655001203328IND4394105420221119045548.0070814s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439410542DNAL7 a175168662pmid7 a10.1080/016355807012683372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSpronck, J.C.10aNiacin Deficiency Alters p53 Expression and Impairs Etoposide-Induced Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis in Rat Bone Marrow Cells  ap. 88-99.  aOne focus of chemoprevention research is the interaction of nutrients with specific molecular targets associated with the maintenance of genomic stability. This study tested the impact of dietary niacin status on bone marrow NAD+ and poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) levels, p53 expression, and etoposide (ETO)-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. After 3 wk on niacin-deficient (ND), pair-fed niacin-replete (PF), or nicotinic acid--supplemented (4 g/kg diet) (NA) diets, Long-Evans rats were gavaged with ETO (25 mg/kg) or vehicle. ND and NA diets caused a 72% decrease and a 240% increase in bone marrow NAD+, respectively. Basal and ETO-induced pADPr levels differed dramatically among ND, PF, and NA diets (undetectable, 42 and 216 fmol/million cells, respectively; basal and undetectable, 119 and 484 fmol/million cells, respectively, following ETO). ND diet alone caused overexpression of two distinct isoforms of p53. Levels of p53 in PF and NA marrow increased in response to ETO treatment, but this did not occur in ND bone marrow. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction of regular and alternative spliced variants of p53 mRNA revealed that niacin deficiency actually decreased both forms of p53 message, implicating protein stability in the accumulation of p53 in ND marrow. ETO-induced apoptosis (TUNEL) was suppressed during niacin deficiency and enhanced by supplementation. G1 arrest was also impaired in ND bone marrow relative to PF and NA. Despite a poor G1 arrest, p21waf1 was overexpressed in the ND bone marrow and dramatically induced following ETO treatment. In conclusion, dietary niacin deficiency causes changes in NAD+ and pADPr metabolism, alters p53 expression, and impairs cellular responses to DNA damage. 3aniacin 3avitamin metabolism 3avitamin deficiencies 3anutritional status 3arisk factors 3avitamin supplements 3aproteins 3abone marrow cells 3arats 3aanimal disease models 3acell cycle 3agene expression regulation 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3aapoptosis 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aantineoplastic agents 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxpharmacology 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aBone Marrow Cellsxdrug effects 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aDNA Damagexdrug effects 2aEtoposidexpharmacology 2aGenes, p53xdrug effects 2aIn Situ Nick-End Labeling 2aNADxmetabolism 2aNiacinxadministration & dosagexdeficiency. 2aPoly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribosexmetabolism 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRandom Allocation 2aRats 2aRats, Long-Evans 2aVitamin B Complexxadministration & dosage 2aVitamin B Deficiency 0ap53 protein 0aetoposide1 aNickerson, J.L.1 aKirkland, J.B.0 tNutrition and cancer.g2007, v. 57, no. 1 p.88-99x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355807012683373Available from publisher's Web site  a20070824b20070902c00000000  aINDdYLPe2007/08/24  aOther US 7aarticle02889naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002100141245015500162300001800317520178900335650002302124650001902147650001702166650001902183650002502202650001402227651001602241700002002257700001602277700002002293773009002313852000902403856008102412939003302493946001302526655001202539IND9205902620221119050207.0920923e199208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920590262DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/85.4.13472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrench, N.M.

All factors were measured on cotton averaging 171.4 cm in height at three canopy levels (from terminal): upper, 0 cm; middle, 45.7 cm; lower, 76.2 cm. Mortality, of aphids in the upper canopy level (89%) was higher than middle (66%) and lower (57%) levels. Spray coverage, measured as mean percentage area of water-sensitive cards covered by spots, decreased at each lower canopy level as did mean total number of spots per square centimeter. Chlorpyrifos alone generally had a higher proportion of spots per square centimeter in the middle and lower canopy levels relative to the upper level, compared with the adjuvant combinations. No differences in spot diameter frequency distributions were detected among treatments within a canopy level or within a treatment among canopy levels. Initial mean chlorpyrifos deposits on cotton leaf surfaces were highest at the upper canopy level (678 ng/cm2) and decreased by approximately 50% at each descending canopy level. Rate of disappearance of chlorpyrifos from cotton leaf surfaces was significantly reduced at the middle and lower canopy levels compared with the upper level. Adjuvants did not significantly affect chlorpyrifos efficacy, deposition characteristics, or rate of disappearance of chlorpyrifos. Canopy level was important for all three measured criteria. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aAphis gossypii 3achlorpyrifos 3ainsect control 3ainsecticide residues 3aadjuvants 3aMississippi1 aRamaswamy, S.B.1 aSmith, D.B.1 aParoonagian, D.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1992 Aug., v. 85, no. 4 p.1347-1355x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/85.4.13473Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01909naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245011300157300001800270520084100288650002001129650002401149650001101173650002401184650001901208650001401227650001501241650001701256650002001273651001201293700001601305773009001321852000901411856008101420939003301501946001301534655001201547IND9205901320221119050046.0920923e199208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920590132DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/85.4.12352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGould, W.P.10aHot-water immersion quarantine treatment for guavas infested with Caribbean fruit fly (Diptera: Tephritidae)  ap. 1235-1239.  aHot-water immersion was tested as a potential commodity treatment for guavas infested with third instars of the Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa (Loew).

  1 aGill, C.I.R.10aEffect of Fecal Water on an In Vitro Model of Colonic Mucosal Barrier Function  ap. 59-65.  aFecal water (FW) has been shown to exert, in cultured cells, cytotoxic and genotoxic effects that have implications for colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. We have investigated a further biological activity of FW, namely, the ability to affect gap junctions in CACO2 cell monolayers as an index of mucosal barrier function, which is known to be disrupted in cancer. FW samples from healthy, free-living, European subjects that were divided into two broad age groups, adult (40 ± 9.7 yr; n = 53) and elderly (76 ± 7.5 yr; n = 55) were tested for effects on gap junction using the transepithelial resistance (TER) assay. Overall, treatment of CACO2 cells with FW samples from adults increased TER (+ 4%), whereas FW from elderly subjects decreased TER (- 5%); the difference between the two groups was significant (P < 0.05). We also measured several components of FW potentially associated with modulation of TER, namely, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and ammonia. SCFAs (propionic, acetic, and n-butyric) were significantly lower in the elderly population (- 30%, - 35%, and - 21%, respectively, all P £ 0.01).

No immediate detrimental effects were observed on sound carambolas after fumigation; however, shelf life at room temperatures was reduced by 24-30%. Methyl bromide residues in cararnbolas fumigated with 40 g/m3 for 2 h and stored at 23 +/- 1 degree C were not detected (< 10 ppb) after 48 h. After 48 h of storage at 4.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C, fumigated carambolas had residues of 0.83 +/- 0.09 ppm. Methyl bromide fumigation of carambolas with 40 g/m3 for 2 h at 23 +/- 1 degree C could be a viable quarantine treatment of carambolas infested with the Caribbean fruit fly if the fruit fly mortality and carambola shelf life observed in this study were not objectionable. 3aAverrhoa carambola 3aAnastrepha suspensa 3afumigation 3amethyl bromide 3aquarantine 3aimport policies 3aFlorida 3aCalifornia1 aKing, J.R.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1992 Aug., v. 85, no. 4 p.1231-1234x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/85.4.12313Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03007naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001800141245009100159300001800250520193700268650002002205650001302225650001602238650002702254650002002281650001302301650001702314651001102331653001402342700001502356700001602371700002002387773009002407852000902497856008102506939003302587946001302620655001202633IND9205902220221119045828.0920923e199208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920590222DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/85.4.13072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChouinard, G.10aBorder-row sprays for control of the plum curculio in apple orchards: behavioral study  ap. 1307-1317.  aIn spring 1987, 215 (65)Zn-labeled adult plum curculios, Conotrachelus nenuphar (Herbst), were released, just after the emerged from overwintering, at a single site located at the southern edge of a woodlot bordering an unsprayed apple orchard in southern Quebec. At petal fall, between the second and third day of release, a border-row spray of insecticide was applied to the two perimeter rows of apple trees in front of the release site. Dispersal of the population was compared with another group of 254 curculios released simultaneously in the center of the 1.7-ha orchard. In 1988 and 1989, the border-row spray was applied to the entire orchard perimeter. Plum curculio damage at harvest was assessed and compared with that found in a nearby unsprayed apple orchard. Labeling had no significant effect on field mortality and behavior. Insects released at the edge of the woodlot moved toward the orchard. Mortality was three times higher for insects dispersing through the sprayed rows than for those dispersing in the center of the orchard. Among insects that were recaptured in the orchard and at its edge, 83% were found either dead under the sprayed trees (59%) or alive along the outside edge of the sprayed rows (24%). The remaining curculios (17%) were found alive within the orchard. Plum curculio damage at harvest decreased from 1987 (52%) to 1989 (2.4%), whereas in a nearby unsprayed apple orchard, it averaged 70% (minimum 43%, maximum 88%). A single petal fall border spray was moderately effective in protecting fruit, but the combination of a pink spray and a petal fall border spray provided economically acceptable control. Reinfestation after the petal fall spray appeared to be the main cause of plum curculio damage at harvest. Toads, Bufo americanus americanus Holbrook, were found with high levels of (65)Zn. Ways to improve the efficiency of plum curculio control by border-row spraying are discussed. 3aMalus domestica 3aorchards 3acrop damage 3aConotrachelus nenuphar 3aazinphos-methyl 3aspraying 3aedge effects 3aQuebec 0adispersal1 aHill, S.B.1 aVincent, C.1 aBarthakur, N.N.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1992 Aug., v. 85, no. 4 p.1307-1317x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/85.4.13073Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03218naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160100002200177245007400199300001800273520159800291650002801889650002201917650002501939650002401964650002701988650002602015650002602041650002402067650002102091650002302112650002502135650002502160650002502185650002802210650003002238650001902268650001502287650002302302700001602325700001802341700001702359700001702376700001502393700002002408773007502428852000902503856008102512930003302593945002502626946001302651655001202664IND4373869620221119045717.0050901e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437386962DNAL7 a189433082pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-95-10982doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRademaker, J.L.W.12aA comprehensive species to strain taxonomic framework for Xanthomonas  ap. 1098-1111.  aA comprehensive classification framework was developed that refines the current Xanthomonas classification scheme and provides a detailed assessment of Xanthomonas diversity at the species, subspecies, pathovar, and subpathovar levels. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers targeting the conserved repetitive sequences BOX, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC), and repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) (rep-PCR) was used to generate genomic fingerprints of 339 Xanthomonas strains comprising 80 pathovars, 20 DNA homology groups, and a Stenotrophomonas maltophilia reference strain. Computer-assisted pattern analysis of the rep-PCR profiles permitted the clustering of strains into distinct groups, which correspond directly to the 20 DNA-DNA homology groups (genospecies) previously identified. Group 9 strains (X. axonopodis) were an exception and did not cluster together into a coherent group but comprised six subgroups. Over 160 strains not previously characterized by DNA-DNA hybridization analysis, or not previously classified, were assigned to specific genospecies based on the classification framework developed. The rep-PCR delineated subspecific groups within X. hortorum, X. arboricola, X. axonopodis, X. oryzae, X. campestris, and X. translucens. Numerous taxonomic issues with regard to the diversity, similarity, redundancy, or misnaming were resolved. This classification framework will enable the rapid identification and classification of new, novel, or unknown Xanthomonas strains that are pathogenic or are otherwise associated with plants. 3aXanthomonas albilineans 3aXanthomonas bromi 3aXanthomonas cassavae 3aXanthomonas codiaei 3aXanthomonas cucurbitae 3aXanthomonas fragariae 3aXanthomonas hyacinthi 3aXanthomonas melonis 3aXanthomonas pisi 3aXanthomonas populi 3aXanthomonas sacchari 3aXanthomonas theicola 3aXanthomonas vasicola 3aXanthomonas vesicatoria 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aclassification 3apathotypes 3astrain differences1 aLouws, F.J.1 aSchultz, M.H.1 aRossbach, U.1 aVauterin, L.1 aSwings, J.1 aBruijn, F.J. de0 tPhytopathology.g2005 Sept., v. 95, no. 9 p.1098-1111x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-95-10983Available from publisher's Web site  a20051017b20051102c00000000  aINDdMKSe2005/09/17  aOther US 7aarticle02244naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001800141245013400159300001800293520115700311650002001468650002701488650001901515650003101534650001901565650001401584650002901598653001401627653001101641700001601652773009001668852000901758856008101767939003301848946001301881655001201894IND9205900920221119045639.0920923e199208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920590092DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/85.4.12132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnard, D.R.10aGrowth and survival of house flies (Diptera: Muscidae) in response to selected physical and chemical properties of poultry manure  ap. 1213-1217.  aResponses of house fly, Musca domestica L., to variations in the physical and chemical properties of poultry manure were measured by rearing flies at different densities (0.2, 0.4, or 1.0 g manure per larva) in one of three manure types (M1, M2, M3) collected from laying hens fed different amounts of nitrogen (N), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), and sodium (Na). Manure type significantly influenced larval survival, pupal mass, the numbers of emerging adult flies, and the survival of females through the first quartile of adult life but did not affect fecundity or natality. When the effects of manure type were averaged across larval density, type M2 (average 78% H2O, 1.31% N, 2.04% Ca, 0.48% P, 0.54% potassium [K]; pH 6.5) conferred optimum survival, pupal mass, and emergence responses; type M3 (83% H2O, 1.07% N, 1.20% Ca, 0.33% P, 0.40% K; pH 6.6) conferred poorest responses. House fly responses to type M1 (average: 80% H2O, 1.32% N, 0.95% Ca, 0.55% P, 0.53% K; pH 6.32) were intermediate to those for M2 and M3. Larval survival correlated with phosphorus levels in the manure and adult emergence was correlated with manure moisture content. 3aMusca domestica 3abiological development 3ainsect control 3aphysicochemical properties 3apoultry manure 3amortality 3aanimal manure management 0aresponses 0agrowth1 aHarms, R.H.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1992 Aug., v. 85, no. 4 p.1213-1217x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/85.4.12133Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01714naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001900141245011400160300001800274520066600292650001300958650002000971650002600991650001101017650001401028650001401042650001901056650002901075700001501104700001901119773009001138852000901228856008101237939003301318946001301351655001201364IND9205899020221119045727.0920923e199208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920589902DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/85.4.10992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandler, L.D.10aRH-5992, A new insect growth regulator active against corn earworm and fall armyworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 1099-1103.  aLaboratory bioassays conclusively demonstrated the toxic effects of the insect growth regulator (IGR) RH-5992 against 1- and 7-d-old larvae of the corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), and fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.

The forestry sector, like others in the primary industries, is characterised by relatively low levels of workforce qualifications compared with community-wide averages. We review nationally-consistent data on degree completions at postgraduate research and undergraduate levels, and course completions at vocational levels, in 'forestry' across Australia, and discuss the results in the context of the current workforce at these levels in the Australian forestry sector. Comparative data for postgraduate research and undergraduate completions were available for the years 1994 and 2005-2007, and the years 2001, 2004 and 2007, respectively. The number of research higher degree completions classified as 'forestry' in the period 2005-2007 was around 20 annually, more or less equally divided between PhD and Masters by research; this was substantially more than completions in 1994. Undergraduate pass degree completions declined by more than 50%, to a total of about 30 annually, over the seven-year period studied (2001-2007). In contrast, honours degree completions increased by about the same proportion, but from a very low base, to around eight annually. Data for total course completions in vocational education and training (VET) 'forestry' programs were available for the fouryear period 2004-2007. Total completions over this period were around 2000, but declined by nearly 50% between 2004 and 2007. These data underestimate participation in the VET sector and predate the establishment of ForestWorks as the sector’s Industry Skills Council. We conducted a simple workforce planning analysis based on available estimates of the workforce employed in the forestry sector and assumed career durations. On this basis, the level of supply of higher-degree research graduates in forestry-at around 20 in 2007-would seem to be of the right order, although our analysis does not account for the high level of specialisation which characterises both completions and workforce needs. In contrast, the current and projected numbers of undergraduate forestry completions, currently at 19 and projected to decline to 10 by 2013, are well below workforce replacement levels. The decline in undergraduate forestry completions is being offset to an extent by increased numbers of professional Masters graduates in forestry, at around 25 annually, but the combined number of expected undergraduate and professional Masters completions remains less than is required for sustaining the professional workforce at existing levels. The comparatively low rates of completion of vocational-level qualifications suggest that the vocational-level workforce engaged in forest growing and management, in forest operations and in primary processing will remain less formally-qualified than both the primary industry sector and the community more generally. These results emphasize the need for the forestry sector to continue to focus on, and invest in, the education and training needs of its workforce, at all levels. 3aforestry 3aforests 3aindustry 3alabor force 3aplanning 3avocational education 3aAustralia1 aKanowski, P.J.1 aBull, L.M.0 tAustralian forestry.g2010 Dec., v. 73, no. 4 p.227-233x0004-91587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00049158.2010.106763333Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02782naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245006300122300001400185500012300199520162900322650001001951650001101961650001301972650001401985650002301999650001402022650001102036650001002047650001002057650001402067650001102081650002302092650001402115650001602129650001002145651001002155700001702165773013102182856005002313852000902363655001202372IND4491233620221119045753.0141110e20140720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449123362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yan10aIntroduction of application of Chinese wild grapes species  ap. 49-56.  aPaper presented at the X International Conference on Grapevine Breeding and Genetic, held August 1-5, 2010, Geneva, NY  aChina is one of the major centers of origin of Vitis species. To date, more than 38 species and varieties have been reported to originate in China among 70 known species. In the past 20 years, researchers have focused on resistance to main fungal diseases of Vitis species native to China. The results indicate that there are differences in resistance to the diseases among these species and clones. However, the Chinese wild species V. pseudoreticulata ‘Baihe-35-1’ holds higher resistance to disease traits than the other wild species. Chinese Vitis species have many advantages over V. vinifera such as possessing many resistant genes to fungal diseases as well as good flavor. Species V. davidii, V. quinquangularis and V. amurensis have better economic traits than other species and are used as wine materials directly in southeast, southwest and northeast China; Moreover, they also easily hybridize with V. vinifera. Thus, it is possible to transfer fungal disease-resistant genes into V. vinifera through crossing for developing new disease-resistant grape varieties. At present, we are interested in studying how Chinese wild grapes sense fungal diseases stress using the Chinese wild V. pseudoreticulata accession 'Baihe-35-1'. The goals are to identify key components that can potentially be engineered for improvement of European grapes that encounter pathogen stresses. In the future, our goal aims to understand the host defense mechanism and identify key genes in resistant Chinese wild Vitis germplasm to provide valuable information and foundational resources for breeding of highly resistant cultivars. 3aVitis 3aclones 3acrossing 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3aeconomics 3aflavor 3afungi 3agenes 3agermplasm 3agrapes 3aindigenous species 3apathogens 3aresearchers 3awines 3aChina1 aWang, Yuejin0 tActa horticulturae.g, , no. 1046 p.49-56dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1046/1046_4.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001600150245003600166300001600202500002400218520135000242650001701592650001101609650001701620650001501637650001601652650001101668650001201679650001301691650001301704650002501717650001601742650000901758651001501767700001601782773007701798852000901875856009001884655001201974IND4458534920221119050020.0110602s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445853492DNAL7 a10.1080/00049158.2010.106763322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStone, Hugh10aSustainable pole supply project  ap. 220-226.  aIncludes references  aOver one million square kilometres of regional Queensland has its electricity needs serviced by one corporation, Ergon Energy. This corporation is facing a critical shortage in the future supply of hardwood power poles, with demand expected to increase from 13 000 to 25 000 p.a. over the next 15 years. This is unlikely to be met by traditional suppliers. With over 900 000 poles in the network, of which about 94% are hardwood, the shortfall will commence as early as 2010. Hardwood is the preferred pole type due to its economic advantages and its superior electrical insulation properties. It is safe and reliable. The Sustainable Pole Supply Project has been initiated to ensure that Ergon Energy has a reliable and economic future supply of poles. To achieve this, the corporation seeks to acquire native forests and to establish plantations for poles. These forests will be located in diverse geographic areas to minimise risk and will be selectively harvested to provide a renewable supply of hardwood power poles while preserving ecosystems and maintaining habitats. Additionally, the benefits of carbon capture and biodiversity conservation can offset other activities of the corporation in meeting its sustainability objectives. This paper discusses the risks and benefits to Ergon Energy and the community of undertaking the project. 3abiodiversity 3acarbon 3acorporations 3aecosystems 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ahardwood 3ainsulating materials 3aplantations 3arisk 3aQueensland1 aWood, David0 tAustralian forestry.g2010 Dec., v. 73, no. 4 p.220-226x0004-91587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00049158.2010.106763323Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02553naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001600140245012100156300001600277520142400293650001301717650002301730650002501753650001901778650001001797650001301807650001801820650002301838650001901861650001701880650001301897651001701910700001701927773008801944852000902032856008002041939003302121946001302154655001202167IND9204824620221119050030.0920730e199206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920482462DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/85.3.9672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLance, D.R.10aField tests of a semiochemical-based toxic bait for suppression of corn rootworm beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)  ap. 967-973.  aA semiochemical-based toxic bait for adult Diabrotica virgifera virgifera Leconte and D. barberi Smith and Lawrence was broadcast over three plots (1-3 ha) of maize, Zea mays L. The bait contained all insecticide (0.3% carbaryl), a feeding stimulant (cucurbitacin), and several nonpheromonal volatile attractants (totaling 0.5% of the formulation) in a dry, bran-based carrier. Bait was applied at 7-14 kg/ha (20-40 g [AI] carbaryl/ha). Relative to paired plots that were not treated with bait, numbers of D. v. virgifera and D. barberi counted on maize plants were reduced 77-85% and 55-92%, respectively, 48 h after bait applications. Likewise, relative numbers of D. v. virgifera and D. barberi captured on unbaited yellow sticky traps declined 58-91% and 67-88%, respectively, after applications of bait. Numbers of dead beetles on the ground 24 or 48 h after applications were roughly comparable to reductions in numbers of live beetles counted on plants. Activity of the bait was short-lived in the field, and populations of Diabrotica beetles in treated plots generally returned to near pretreatment levels within 1-2 wk after applications of bait. Although formulations must be improved to enhance activity and longevity, results of this study indicate that semiochemical-based baits for Diabrotica beetles are a potential tool for greatly reducing the amount of insecticide applied in maize production systems. 3aZea mays 3aDiabrotica barberi 3aDiabrotica virgifera 3ainsect control 3abaits 3acarbaryl 3acucurbitacins 3ainsect attractants 3asemiochemicals 3asticky traps 3atoxicity 3aSouth Dakota1 aSutter, G.R.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1992 June, v. 85, no. 3 p.967-973x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/85.3.9673Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03322naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245013000166300001600296500002400312520173800336650002502074650001602099650001202115650001802127650002502145650001202170650001502182650001702197650002102214650000902235650002402244650001002268650001002278650001402288650001102302650002102313650001102334650002302345650001502368650001802383650001102401650002802412650001302440650002102453650002602474650001002500650001302510650001502523650001402538700001602552773007902568852000902647856008802656655001202744IND4458534120221119045658.0110602s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445853412DNAL7 a10.3109/13880209.2010.5269482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdemola, I.O.10aOvicidal and larvicidal activity of Cassia alata leaf acetone extract and fractions on Haemonchus contortus: In vitro studies  ap. 539-544.  aIncludes references  aContext: The failure of modern anthelmintics to control nematode parasites of sheep and goats is a reality on many farms in the tropical/subtropical regions of the world. This necessitates chemotherapeutic control alternatives and plant secondary metabolite with activity is one of those potential solutions. Objective: This study was design to evaluate the efficacy of solvent: solvent fractions of Cassia alata Gelenggang Besar (Leguminosae) leaf acetone extract against Heamonchus contortus Rudolphi (Trichostrongylidae). Materials and methods: C. alata leaf was extracted with 70% acetone and fractions were obtained by solvent: solvent group separation procedures. The acetone extract and the fractions were tested by egg hatch assay (EHA) and larval development and viability assay to assess relative bioactivity against H. contortus eggs and larvae. Results: The extracts inhibited egg hatchability and killed infective larvae of H. contortus in a concentration-dependent manner. The best-fit LC50 values were 0.562, 0.243, 0.490, 0.314, and 0.119 mg/mL for the acetone extract, chloroform, hexane, butanol and 35% water in methanol fractions, respectively, when tested against nematode eggs. The best-fit LC50 values were 0.191, 0.505, 1.444, 0.306, and 0.040 mg/mL for acetone extract, chloroform, hexane, butanol and 35% water in methanol fractions, respectively, when tested against larvae. The 35% water in methanol fraction was the most active against the larvae and eggs of H. contortus demonstrating the lowest LC50 values Discussion and conclusion: This study demonstrates that the leaf extracts of C. alata have anthelmintic activity; therefore it could find application in the control of helminths in livestock. 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aSenna alata 3aacetone 3aanthelmintics 3abioactive properties 3abutanol 3achloroform 3adrug therapy 3aegg hatchability 3aeggs 3aexperimental design 3afarms 3agoats 3ahelminths 3ahexane 3ain vitro studies 3alarvae 3alarval development 3alarvicides 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3alethal concentration 50 3amethanol 3anematode control 3asecondary metabolites 3asheep 3asolvents 3asubtropics 3aviability1 aEloff, J.N.0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2011 May, v. 49, no. 5 p.539-544x1388-02097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/13880209.2010.5269483Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03645naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165072001700182072001700199100001700216245009400233300001600327500001500343520132200358650001901680650002101699650001801720650002401738650001001762650002901772650003501801650002201836650002001858650001501878650002201893650003601915650001501951650001401966650002001980650002102000650005202021650002802073650005702101650003202158650001502190650002102205650003702226650001102263650006702274650005702341650001102398650005102409650005202460650002802512650004102540653001802581700001602599700001502615700001702630700002502647773007302672852000902745856008602754930003302840945002502873946001302898655001202911IND4389161320221119045744.0070319s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438916132DNAL7 a174748652pmid7 a10.1207/s15327914nc5602_102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLe Corre, L.10aDifferential expression of genes induced by resveratrol in human breast cancer cell lines  ap. 193-203.  a2019-12-04  aThe phytoalexin, trans-resveratrol (RES), is a polyphenolic compound found in plants and fruits that seems to have a wide spectrum of biological activities. It has been found to possess cancer chemopreventive effects by inhibiting diverse cellular events associated with tumor initiation, promotion, and progression. RES is also a phytoestrogen, which binds to and activates estrogen receptors (ERs) that regulate the transcription of estrogen-responsive target genes. We used two human breast tumor cell lines (MCF7 and MBA-MB-231) and one fibrocystic breast cell line (MCF10a) to examine whether RES altered mRNA expression of genes that are involved in biological pathway frequently altered during carcinogenesis. Two GEarray systems were used to screen the differentially expressed genes between RES-treated cells and control cells. The differentially expressed genes were analyzed further by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Here, we demonstrate that RES regulates mRNA expression of several genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, metastasis, cell-cell adhesion, and ER signaling pathway. This effect of RES on the gene expression appears in correlation with chemoprevention activities of RES described previously. RES is also found to be more active in ER+ than ER- cells. 3ahuman diseases 3ahuman cell lines 3amessenger RNA 3agene overexpression 3awomen 3anutritional intervention 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3ahormone receptors 3achemoprevention 3ametastasis 3aplant-based foods 3achemical constituents of plants 3acell cycle 3aapoptosis 3aplant estrogens 3abreast neoplasms 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxpharmacology 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aBreast Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxgeneticsxpathology. 2aCell Adhesionxdrug effects 2aCell Cycle 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aFibrocystic Breast Diseasexdrug therapyxgeneticsxpathology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplasticxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aReceptors, Estrogenxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aStilbenesxpharmacology 2aTranscription, Geneticxdrug effects 0afruits (food)1 aChalabi, N.1 aDelort, L.1 aBignon, Y.J.1 aBernard-Gallon, D.J.0 tNutrition and cancer.g2006, v. 56, no. 2 p.193-203x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327914nc5602_103Available from publisher's Web site  a20071002b20071102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/10/02  aOther US 7aarticle01833naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100004300141245012600184300001800310500001500328520085200343650001801195650001401213650002101227653003201248653002501280773009001305852000901395856008101404939003301485946001301518655001201531IND9207451520221119045614.0921209e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920745152DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/85.5.16822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShapiro, M.

Mortality rates were also affected by several brighteners (Intrawite CF, Phorwite AR, Leucophor BS, Leucophor BSB, Tinopal LPW), and NPV-exposed insects died more quickly than those exposed to standard NPV + H2O. 3aBaculoviridae 3amortality 3aLymantria dispar 0aradiation protection agents 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus0 tJournal of economic entomology.g1992 Oct., v. 85, no. 5 p.1682-1686x0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/85.5.16823Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03456naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001600211245011100227300001600338520192300354650001502277650001702292650002302309650001902332650002002351650002702371650001802398650001402416650002102430650001202451650002202463650001602485650001602501650001102517650003302528650002102561653002102582653003102603700001502634700001402649700001802663773007202681852000902753856008102762930003302843945002502876946001302901655001202914IND4378700420221119045844.0060313e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437870042DNAL7 a189444462pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-96-03082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSmith, D.A.10aClimatic constraints to the potential of Microsphaeropsis amaranthi as a bioherbicide for common waterhemp  ap. 308-312.  aThe fungal plant pathogen Microsphaeropsis amaranthi is a candidate bioherbicide for the control of weedy Amaranthus species since it grows and sporulates readily in culture, is a pathogen of a number of important weed species, and is host-restricted to the family Amaranthaceae. This study was designed to determine the optimum and limiting environmental conditions for the efficacy of foliar applications of M. amaranthi for the control of common waterhemp. The greatest disease severity and the greatest plant biomass reductions were found when a prolonged leaf wetness period of greater than or equal to 12 h at 18 to 24 degrees C was provided after application. Disease severity and plant biomass reductions were greater when plants were treated at an earlier stage of development. Disease severity and impact were limited when shorter leaf wetness periods were provided, with negligible disease observed on plants provided with less than or equal to 6 h leaf wetness. When common waterhemp seedlings were sprayed in the field weekly through the summer of 2004 with conidial suspensions of M. amaranthi, only 7 of 14 applications resulted in disease and only 3 applications resulted in more than slight disease flecks. Moderate levels of disease were observed when applications had been made on days with moderate temperatures and leaf wetness duration in excess of 12 h following application. We confirm the pathogenicity of M. amaranthi against common waterhemp and demonstrate that the unformulated pathogen can cause disease in the field. Nonetheless, the weather conditions of the Midwestern United States, where common waterhemp control would be desired, are infrequently conducive to infection. The continued candidacy of M. amaranthi as a bioherbicide for the control of common waterhemp in the Midwestern United States will require that its efficacy under suboptimal environmental conditions be improved. 3aAmaranthus 3aweed control 3abiological control 3amycoherbicides 3aDeuteromycotina 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apathogenicity 3ainfection 3aclimatic factors 3aconidia 3aspore germination 3atemperature 3acell growth 3aleaves 3awet environmental conditions 3ainoculum density 0aAmaranthus rudis 0aMicrosphaeropsis amaranthi1 aDoll, D.A.1 aSingh, D.1 aHallett, S.G.0 tPhytopathology.g2006 Mar., v. 96, no. 3 p.308-312x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-96-03083Available from publisher's Web site  a20060508b20060607c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/04/03  aOther US 7aarticle02380naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001500194245009400209300001600303500001500319520119700334650002701531650002201558650002101580650002101601650002701622653001401649700002401663700001901687700001501706700001601721773007201737852000901809856008101818930003301899945002501932946001301957655001201970IND4378699320221119045748.0060313e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437869932DNAL7 a189444432pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-96-02802doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGiraud, T.10aImportance of the life cycle in sympatric host race formation and speciation of pathogens  ap. 280-287.  a2019-12-04  aNumerous morphological species of pathogenic fungi have been shown to actually encompass several genetically isolated lineages, often specialized on different hosts and, thus, constituting host races or sibling species. In this article, we explore theoretically the importance of some aspects of the life cycle on the conditions of sympatric divergence of host races, particularly in fungal plant pathogens. Because the life cycles classically modeled by theoreticians of sympatric speciation correspond to those of free-living animals, sympatric divergence of host races requires the evolution of active assortative mating or of active host preference if mating takes place on the hosts. With some particular life cycles with restricted dispersal between selection on the host and mating, we show that divergence can occur in sympatry and lead to host race formation, or even speciation, by a mere process of specialization, with strong divergent adaptive selection. Neither active assortative mating nor active habitat choice is required in these cases, and this may explain why the phylogenetic species concept seems more appropriate than the biological species concept in these organisms. 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3anatural selection 3ahost specificity 3ahost preferences 3alife cycle (organisms) 0aevolution1 aVillareal, L.M.M.A.1 aAusterlitz, F.1 aLe Gac, M.1 aLavigne, C.0 tPhytopathology.g2006 Mar., v. 96, no. 3 p.280-287x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-96-02803Available from publisher's Web site  a20060508b20060607c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/04/03  aOther US 7aarticle01431naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006700124300001800191500001500209520048900224650002600713650001200739650001100751650002200762650003600784650002700820650001500847651001400862653002300876700001300899700001500912700001500927773007400942852000901016939003301025946001101058655001201069IND9206298420221119045806.0921014e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920629842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajak, W.10aThree nitropropanoyl esters of glucose from Indigofera linnaei  ap. 2393-2395.  a2019-12-04  aThree 3-nitropropanoyl esters of D-glucose were isolated from Indigofera linnaei, the known 1,2,6-tri-O-(3-nitropropanoyl)-beta-D-glucopyranose (karakin) and 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-(3-nitropropanoyl)-alpha-D-glucopyranose, and the apparently previously undescribed 3,4,6-tri-O-(3-nitropropanoyl)-alpha-D-glucopyranose.

  1 aChoi, E.J.10aHesperetin induced G1-phase cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells: involvement of CDK4 and p21  ap. 115-119.  aThis study was to investigate the effects of hesperetin on cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest and explored the mechanism for these effects in breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells. Hesperetin significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner after treatment for 48 and 72 h and resulted in significant cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. In the G1-phase related proteins, hesperetin downregulates the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclins and upregulates p21Cip1 and p27(Kip1) in cells treated with hesperetin for 48 h and 72 h. After 72 h treatment, these phenomenons were more pronounced. Hesperetin treatment at high concentration for 72 h resulted in a decrease in CDK2 and CDK4 together with cyclin D. In addition, hesperetin increases the binding of CDK4 with p21(Cip1) but not p27(Kip1) or p57K(ip2). Taken together, our data suggest for the first time that the regulation of CDK4 and p21(Cip1) may participate in the anticancer activity pathway of hesperetin in MCF-7 cells. 3ahumans 3abreast neoplasms 3acell lines 3ain vitro studies 3adisease models 3acell proliferation 3acell cycle 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aflavanones 3adose response 3adosage 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3agene expression regulation 3aprotein synthesis 3acyclins 3atemporal variation 3aprotein binding 3abiochemical pathways 3amechanism of action 2aBreast Neoplasmsxmetabolismxprevention & control. 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCyclin-Dependent Kinase 4xmetabolism 2aCyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21xmetabolism 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aG1 Phasexdrug effects 2aHesperidinxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aTime Factors 0ahesperetin0 tNutrition and cancer.g2007, v. 59, no. 1 p.115-119x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355807014190303Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/29  aOther US 7aarticle02899naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001800194245014100212300001600353500001500369520132300384650003001707650001401737650004001751650002501791650002201816650003301838650002301871650001801894650001401912651001001926653001301936653001801949700001501967700001501982700001801997700001802015700001802033700001502051700002202066700002002088700001602108773007202124852000902196856008102205930003302286945002502319946001302344655001202357IND4378700920221119045653.0060313e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437870092DNAL7 a189444472pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-96-03132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Although the use of cultivars with low susceptibility may be one of the most appropriate methods of disease control, little information is available from inoculation assays, and cultivar susceptibility assessments have been limited to few cultivars. We have evaluated the effects of pathogen virulence, plant age, the dose/response relationship, and the induction of secondary tumors in olive inoculation assays. Most P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi strains evaluated were highly virulent to olive plants, but interactions between cultivars and strains were found. The severity of the disease in a given cultivar was strongly dependent of the pathogen dose applied at the wound sites. Secondary tumors developed in noninoculated wounds following inoculation at another position on the stem, suggesting the migration of the pathogen within olive plants. Proportion and weight of primary knots and the presence of secondary knots were evaluated in 29 olive cultivars inoculated with two pathogen strains at two inoculum doses, allowing us to rate most of the cultivars as having either high, medium, or low susceptibility to olive knot disease. None of the cultivars were immune to the disease. 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3acultivars 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi 3agermplasm evaluation 3agenetic variation 3abacterial diseases of plants 3adisease resistance 3aOlea europaea 3avirulence 3aSpain 0asymptoms 0apathogenicity1 aGarcia, A.1 aFerrer, A.1 aBertolini, E.1 aQuesada, J.M.1 aSalcedo, C.I.1 aPiquer, J.1 aPerez-Panades, J.1 aCarbonell, E.A.1 aRio, C. del0 tPhytopathology.g2006 Mar., v. 96, no. 3 p.313-319x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-96-03133Available from publisher's Web site  a20060508b20060607c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/04/03  aOther US 7aarticle02826naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002100150245009400171300001600265500002400281520137700305650002201682650001201704650001401716650001401730650003101744650002001775650001301795650001501808650001101823650001501834650002201849650003501871650001001906650000901916650001601925650002001941650001001961651001301971700002001984700001502004700001602019700001502035700002002050700001602070700001702086700001702103773007702120852000902197856009002206655001202296IND4458540320221119045929.0110603s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445854032DNAL7 a10.1080/00049158.2010.106763372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoutherton, S.G.10aAssociation of allelic variation in xylem genes with wood properties in Eucalyptus nitens  ap. 259-264.  aIncludes references  aWe used association studies to identify allelic variation in genes that influence wood fibre development in Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden). Genes selected for analysis were differentially expressed in wood with contrasting properties such as cellulose and lignin content, pulp yield and microfibril angle (MFA). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified by sequencing the candidate genes in a number of unrelated individuals. Selected SNPs were genotyped across 420 unrelated E. nitens trees from central Victorian populations and growing in a provenance trial at Meunna in north-western Tasmania. Significantly associated SNPs were genotyped across two other populations in northern Tasmania in order to validate associated SNPs. We have compiled a database of phenotypic information relating particularly to wood fibre properties for each individual in the association and validation populations. Associations between SNPs and wood properties were identified by comparing trait means in different SNP genotype classes. Several significantly associated SNPs identified in the Meunna population were validated in the other populations. The direction of the allele effect was reversed for two SNPs that were associated with kraft pulp yield.

Strain Kh5 was grown in yeast nitrogen base (YNB) plus glucose (G medium) or YNB plus cell walls of B. cinerea (B medium). Thirty-five primer pairs were used in AFLP amplifications, resulting in a total of more than 2,450 bands derived from the mRNA of strain Kh5 grown in B medium. Eighty-six bands (3.5%) corresponded to genes upregulated in B medium compared with G medium. Of these 86 bands, 28 were selected, cloned, sequenced, and subjected to real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to confirm their differential expression. An appropriate housekeeping gene, G2, was selected and used to normalize the results of RT-PCR. Eleven genes presented an increased gene expression in the presence of B. cinerea cell walls (expression ratio > 1). Statistical analysis showed a significant increase for 5 of these 11 genes. The overexpressed genes show homologies to yeast genes with various functions, including beta-glucosidase, transmembrane transport, citrate synthase, and external amino acid sensing and transport. Some of these functions could be related to cell wall metabolism and potentially involved in mycoparasitic properties. 3aapples 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3acomplementary DNA 3aBotrytis cinerea 3apostharvest diseases 3aWickerhamomyces anomalus 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3adisease control 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3agene amplification 3agenetic variation 3apathotypes 3aPichia 3abiological control 0amolecular sequence data 0aHansenula anomala1 aJijakli, M.H.0 tPhytopathology.g2006 Jan., v. 96, no. 1 p.80-86x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-96-00803Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/03/30  aOther US 7aarticle01996naa a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100001600132245001700148300001600165300003000181500001500211520054600226650002800772650002100800650002400821650003200845650002500877650004700902650002500949650004200974650001101016650002201027650002901049650002401078650003901102650002501141650002401166653001901190653002101209653002101230653001301251711006301264773011401327852000901441939003301450945000801483946001101491655001201502991584917340742620221119045959.0800905e197812  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800021312DNAL7 a7337642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBloom, S.R.10aGut hormones  ap. 259-271.  ap. 259-271. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aThe nature of the gut endocrine system and two techniques used to measure hormone concentrations in circulation and localize the cell producing the hormone are briefly described.

The objective of this study was to isolate fungi from eggs of R. reniformis and select potential biocontrol agents for R. reniformis on cotton. We focused on the fungus Pochonia chlamydosporia because it suppresses root-knot and cyst nematodes and because preliminary data indicated that it was present in Arkansas cotton fields. Soil samples were collected from six cotton fields in Jefferson County, Arkansas. A total of 117 isolates of the nematophagous fungus P. chlamydosporia were obtained. In an in vitro test, 105 of the 117 isolates parasitized fewer than 15% of R. reniformis eggs, but 12 isolates parasitized between 16 and 35% of the eggs. These 12 isolates produced from 6.8 x 10(4) to 6.9 x 10(5) chlamydospores per gram of medium in vitro, and chlamydospore production was similar on rice grain and corn grain media. In two greenhouse experiments, a single application of isolate 37 (5,000 chlamydospores per gram of soil) significantly reduced the numbers of R. reniformis on cotton roots and in soil. The three isolates (37, 26, and 14) that parasitized the most eggs in vitro were also the most effective in suppressing numbers of R. reniformis and in increasing cotton growth in the greenhouse. 3acotton 3aRotylenchulus reniformis 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aMetacordyceps 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 3apathogenicity 3achlamydospores 3anematode control 3ainoculum 3abiological control 3aArkansas 0aPochonia chlamydosporia 0aDiheterospora1 aRiggs, R.D.1 aCrippen, D.0 tPhytopathology.g2005 Aug., v. 95, no. 8 p.890-893x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-95-08903Available from publisher's Web site  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDdMKSe2005/08/10  aOther US 7aarticle02035naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001900170245012900189300001600318500002400334520059800358650002500956650001600981650001200997650001401009650001101023650001001034650001101044650001501055650001001070650001301080650001201093650002901105650001101134650002501145650000901170650001301179651001101192651001301203651001101216700002101227700002201248700002401270700002601294773010901320852000901429856009101438655001201529IND4458537120221119045954.0110602s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445853712DNAL7 a211203942pmid7 a10.1590/S1519-566X20100005000232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedri, Isis M.10aTicks (Acari: Ixodidae) from yellow armadillo, Euphractus sexcinctus (Cingulata: Dasypodidae), in Brazil's Pantanal wetlands  ap. 823-825.  aIncludes references  aTick species parasitizing yellow armadillo, Euphractus sexcinctus, were recorded from October 2006 to October 2007 in Pantanal.

The prevalence of A. cajennense was 55%, the mean intensity was 2.7 ± 0.5 (SE) (n = 17) and the mean abundance was 1.5 ± 0.4 (n = 31). 3aAmblyomma cajennense 3aDasypodidae 3afemales 3aimmatures 3alarvae 3amales 3anymphs 3aparasitism 3aticks 3awetlands 2aAnimals 2aArmadillosxparasitology 2aFemale 2aIxodidaexphysiology 2aMale 2aWetlands 3aBrazil 3aPantanal 0aBrazil1 aMartins, Joao R.1 aDoyle, Rovaina L.1 aMourão, Guilherme.1 aMarinho Filho, Jader.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2010 , v. 39, no. 5 p.823-825dEntomological Society of Brazilx1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20100005000233Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02725naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194072001700211100001700228245008400245300001800329500001500347520104200362650001301404650001401417650001501431650001701446650003301463650002001496650001801516650001801534650002701552650001901579650002001598650002201618650002101640650001701661650004201678650004301720653001301763653002301776700001701799700001801816700001401834700001701848700001801865700001601883700001301899773007501912852000901987856008101996930003302077946001302110655001202123IND4375337520221119050031.0051020e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437533752DNAL7 a189434742pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-95-12092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In pot tests, the effect of a foliar application of VMA or VAA at 100 microgram/ml lasted for 64 days. Plants sprayed with VMA or VAA accumulated salicylic acid and had elevated expression of the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) marker genes P4 (PR-1), Tag (PR-2), and NP24 (PR-5). Foliar spray of VMA also controlled late blight and powdery mildew of tomato. The disease control by VMA and VAA lasted up to 64 days after treatment, was broad spectrum, and induced the expression of PR genes, all essential indicators of SAR, suggesting that VMA and VAA are plant activators. The foliar application of plant activators is a novel control method for soilborne diseases and may provide an economically feasible alternative to soil fumigants such as methyl bromide. 3atomatoes 3acultivars 3asoil fungi 3abiosynthesis 3asystemic acquired resistance 3adisease control 3apathogenicity 3aFusarium wilt 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3asalicylic acid 3asoil fumigation 3agenetic variation 3aapplication rate 3avalidamycins 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0asymptoms 0ainduced resistance1 aShirouzu, K.1 aNakashita, H.1 aLee, H.Y.1 aMotoyama, T.1 aYamaguchi, I.1 aTeraoka, T.1 aArie, T.0 tPhytopathology.g2005 Oct., v. 95, no. 10 p.1209-1216x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-95-12093Available from publisher's Web site  a20070927b20071002c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02270naa a2200541 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245006200152300001600214300003000230520068500260650002300945650001200968650001300980650000900993650002001002650002501022650001201047650002701059650002401086650001101110650002501121650001101146650002701157650002601184650001401210650002301224650003601247650003501283650001401318650002201332650002601354650000901380653002701389700001801416700001701434711011001451773009401561852000901655939003301664945000801697946001101705655001201716991584913470742620221119045621.0831114e198306  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830031192DNAL7 a63510782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, C.J.10aHormonal modulation of mineral metabolism in reproduction  ap. 169-180.  ap. 169-180. ill., charts.  aMechanisms whereby mothers effect appropriate alternations in calcium (Ca) fluxes to respond to increased Ca needs during pregnancy and lactation are outlined, and factors (hormonal and otherwise) that contribute to these processes are identified.

WNK4 regulates diverse ion transporters in the kidney, and dysregulation of renal transporters is considered the main cause of the WNK4 mutation-associated hypertension. Another determinant of hypertension is vascular tone that is regulated by Ca²⁺-dependent blood vessel constriction. However, the role of WNK4 in vasoconstriction as part of its function to regulate blood pressure is not known. Here, we report that WNK4 is a unique modulator of blood pressure by restricting Ca²⁺ influx via the transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3) channel in the vasculature. Loss of WNK4 markedly augmented TRPC3-mediated Ca²⁺ influx in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in response to α-adrenoreceptor stimulation, which is the pathological hallmark of hypertension in resistance arteries. Notably, WNK4 depletion induced hypertrophic cell growth in VSMCs and increased vasoconstriction in small mesenteric arteries via TRPC3-mediated Ca²⁺ influx. In addition, WNK4 mutants harboring the Q562E PHAII-causing or the D318A kinase-inactive mutation failed to mediate TRPC3 inhibition. These results define a previously undescribed function of WNK4 and reveal a unique therapeutic target to control blood pressure in WNK4-related hypertension.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood pressure 3acalcium 3acell growth 3ahumans 3ahypertension 3akidneys 3amesenteric arteries 3amutants 3amutation 3amyocytes 3asmooth muscle 3atransporters 3avasoconstriction1 aKim, Joo Young1 aChoi, Soo-Kyoung1 aLee, Young Ho.1 aZeng, Weizhong1 aKim, Kyung-Hwan.1 aMuallem, Shmuel1 aLee, Min Goo0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 28, v. 108, no. 26 p.10750-10755dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11042711083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110701  aOther US 7aarticle02577naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100002000146245009800166300001800264500002400282520149300306650001701799650001601816650002301832650002201855650002101877700001801898700002601916773013001942852000902072856007702081930003302158945002502191946001102216655001202227IND4419331920140725000000.0090417e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441933192DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.35792doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aCortés, Sandra10aChemical affinities between the major volatile compounds present in a grape pomace distillate  ap. 1221-1226.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: The distillation of vinification by-products to obtain alcoholic drinks is potentially an important source of income for the producing countries and avoids the environmental problem of waste management. Traditional technologies of distillation involve an important cost in terms of time and staff. Nowadays, companies install new distillation equipment, with high capacity and equipped with rectification columns, which is an important advance. Nevertheless, few studieshave been published concerning their correct management. In this study, the major volatile compounds were determined by gas chromatography in 61 samples of grape pomace distillate, corresponding to the fractions collected during seven complete distillation cycles.RESULTS: With a high degree of significance, the concentrations of 1,1-diethoxyethane, propanol, hexanoate and ethyl acetate present positive correlations with the ethanol. However, those of benzyl alcohol, 2-phenylethanol, furfurol, lactate, ethyl mirystate and diethyl succinate, were negative, which indicates that both groups of compounds were vented in the fractions of major or minor alcoholic degree, respectively. In addition, knowledge of the relationships between the volatile compounds contributes to improved management of an industrial distillation unit.CONCLUSION: The correlations established between the concentrations of the different volatile compounds indicate their physico-chemical affinities or their biochemical origin. 3agrape pomace 3adistillates 3avolatile compounds 3adistilled spirits 3afood composition1 aGil, M.

Although most environmental explanations for cooperative breeding emphasize the mean fitness gains of living socially, the fittest individuals are not always those that produce on average the highest number of offspring. At times, variance in fecundity can influence fitness as much as mean fecundity, particularly in small populations like those of cooperative breeders. Cooperative breeding behavior could therefore be a risk-averse strategy to maximize fitness by reducing environmentally induced fecundity variance. Such a within-generation bet-hedging hypothesis for social evolution predicts that (i) variance in reproductive success should be related to environmental variation, (ii) variance in reproductive success should be related to the potential for cooperation in a group, and (iii) the potential for cooperation should be related to environmental variation. Using data from a 10-y study of cooperatively breeding superb starlings (Lamprotornis superbus) living in a temporally and spatially variable savanna ecosystem, I found that variance in reproductive success declined with increasing environmental quality (temporal variation), increasing territory quality (spatial variation), and increasing group size (potential for cooperation), which is itself related to environmental variation. To understand the adaptive value of cooperative breeding behavior in variable environments, researchers must consider both mean and environmentally induced variance in fecundity. Determining how spatiotemporal environmental variation drives risk-averse strategies may provide insights into the evolution of complex social behavior.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSturnidae 3aalloparental behavior 3abreeding 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental quality 3aevolution 3afecundity 3agroup size 3aprogeny 3areproductive success 3arisk 3asavannas 3asocial behavior 3atemporal variation 3avariance0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 28, v. 108, no.

  1 aKaufmann, Y.10aEffect of glutamine on gut glutathione fractional release in the implanted tumor model  ap. 199-206.  a2019-12-04  aCancer and its treatments cause a marked depletion of glutamine (GLN). However, dietary GLN can restore this loss and improve the outcomes of the treatments. The reasons behind this need to be investigated. GLN is suggested to involve in glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Fast-growing tumors alter gut GLN metabolism, but the effect of tumor growth on gut GSH release remains unknown. We hypothesized that gut GSH release would decrease in the tumor-bearing host and this downregulation would be antagonized by supplemental GLN. Female Fisher-344 rats were randomized to the groups: GLN + TUMOR, Freamine (FA) + TUMOR, GLN + SHAM, and FA + SHAM. The rats were implanted with MTF-7 mammary tumors as tumor-bearing groups, whereas the rats were sham operated as control groups. The rats were pair fed chow, gavaged with 1 g/kg/day GLN or an isonitrogenous FA. Tumor growth, blood and gut mucosa GLN, glutamate, and/or GSH were measured. The gut extractions, defined as the difference of concentrations across the gut, were calculated. Supplemental GLN enhanced the gut GLN uptake and GSH release with tumor growth and significantly increased blood and gut mucosa GLN and/or GSH concentrations. Our results demonstrate the important antioxidant role of GLN and thus may have significant implications in nutritional immune modulation in cancer patients. 3adisease models 3aglutathione 3adisease course 3ablood chemistry 3aglutamine 3aimmunomodulators 3abiochemical pathways 3aintestinal absorption 3aanimal models 3aintestinal mucosa 3auptake mechanisms 3arats 3aamino acid metabolism 3abreast neoplasms 2aAmino Acidsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aElectrolytes 2aFemale 2aGlucose 2aGlutaminexadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aGlutathionexbiosynthesis 2aIntestinesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMammary Neoplasms, Experimentalxmetabolism 2aNutritional Status 2aParenteral Nutrition Solutions 2aRandom Allocation 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F344 2aSolutions 0aneoplasms1 aKlimberg, V.S.0 tNutrition and cancer.g2007, v. 59, no. 2 p.199-206x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355807014396323Available from publisher's Web site  a20080325b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/02/20  aOther US 7aarticle02641naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002700110245009700137300001400234500002400248520138000272650002101652650001301673650001201686650001501698650003101713650001001744650002601754650002001780650004301800650002901843650001801872650002001890650001001910650000901920650001701929650001001946700001901956700002201975700002101997700002102018700001702039773013002056852000902186655001202195IND4458543320110604000000.0110603s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445854332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStephenson, Patrick G.12aA transcriptomic approach to identify genes associated with wood density in Picea sitchensis  ap. 82-96.  aIncludes references  aThe demand for trees for industrial application is growing steadily and not expected to plateau for at least two decades; consequently, the supply of wood must increase to meet this need. One method for increasing yield without compromising land requirements is to modify wood density. The current study uses a transcriptomic approach to identify the genes associated with wood density that are likely to be of value in Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) breeding programmes. Following extensive wood density analysis from a Sitka field grown clonal trial, three detailed microarray studies were conducted to compare the transcriptome of cambium and xylem tissue from contrasting density clonal lines. Twenty-five genes exhibited differential expression, with up to 50-fold differences in expression observed, in at least two of the three microarray experiments, and this was verified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Identified genes included those involved in cell wall synthesis, transcriptional regulation and plant pathogen defence functional categories. A wide range of processes influence wood density, but this study has identified potential regulators in these pathways. Future studies can now use this information to understand natural variation in wood density, and manipulate the expression of these genes to improve timber quality and yield. 3aPicea sitchensis 3abreeding 3acambium 3acell walls 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3aplant pathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3atrees 3awood 3awood density 3axylem1 aHarris, Nicole1 aCottrell, Joan E.1 aRalph, Steven G.1 aBohlmann, Jöerg1 aTaylor, Gail0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2011 June, v. 26, no. 11 p.82-96dAlmqvist & Wiksell Periodical Cox0282-75817nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001500184245012100199300002000320506007600340520150300416506003701919650001601956650002101972650001901993650001602012650001202028650002102040650001902061650000902080650001302089650001902102650001402121650001402135650001502149650003602164650001502200700001602215700001902231773017502250852000902425856008302434930003302517946001302550655001202563IND4395871920221207073540.0071007e20071002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439587192DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07067281042doi7 aPMC20004102pmcid7 a178903192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Yixue10aIκB kinase α kinase activity is required for self-renewal of ErbB2/Her2-transformed mammary tumor-initiating cells  ap. 15852-15857.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNF-κB is constitutively active in many solid tumors, including breast cancer. However, the role of NF-κB in breast carcinogenesis is unknown. IkkαAA/AA "knockin" mice in which activation of IκB kinase α (IKKα) is prevented by replacement of activation loop serines with alanines exhibit delayed mammary gland growth during pregnancy, because IKKα activity is required for cyclin D1 induction and proliferation of lobuloalveolar epithelial cells. Given the role of cyclin D1 in breast and mammary cancer, we examined involvement of IKKα in mammary carcinogenesis induced by oncogenes or a chemical carcinogen, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). The IkkαAA mutation retarded tumor development in response to either 7,12-dimethylbenzaanthracene or the MMTV-c-neu (ErbB2/Her2) transgene but had no effect on MMTV-v-Ha-ras-induced cancer, although both oncogenes rely on cyclin D1. Strikingly, primary IkkαAA/AA/MMTV-c-neu carcinoma cells exhibited diminished self-renewal capacity, resulting in the inability to establish secondary tumors. IkkαAA/AA/MMTV-c-neu carcinoma cells underwent premature senescence when cultured under conditions used for propagation of mammary gland stem cells. Thus, IKKα is not only a regulator of mammary epithelial proliferation, but is also an important contributor to ErbB2-induced oncogenesis, providing signals that maintain mammary tumor-initiating cells. IKKα may represent a novel and specific target for treatment of ErbB2-positive breast cancer.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanthracenes 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinogens 3acyclins 3aepithelial cells 3amammary glands 3amice 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3aoncogenes 3apregnancy 3astem cells 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atransgenes1 aLuo, Jun-li1 aKarin, Michael0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Oct. 2, v. 104, no. 40 p.15852-15857dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07067281043Available from publisher's Web site  a20071007b20071102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02498naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245006000185300001600245500002400261520109400285650002401379650001901403650001301422650001901435650001601454650001501470650001201485650001901497650002801516650003501544650002401579650005501603650003701658650003101695650001301726650001101739650002001750650003101770650001601801773012901817852000901946856008501955655001202040IND4429013020221119045827.0091120s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442901302DNAL7 a197109942pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-009-9849-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukherjee, Irani10aEffect of Organic Amendments on Degradation of Atrazine  ap. 832-835.  aIncludes references  aPesticide contamination of soil and ground water at or near the agricultural fields is a major problem world wide. The ability of several amendments like rice straw, manure, saw dust and charcoal were used to stimulate the degradation of atrazine in soil. Field soil fortified with pesticide at two concentration levels were amended separately with rice straw, farm yard manure, saw dust and charcoal at rates of 2.5% (w/w) and maintained at field capacity moisture regime and kept at ambient temperature 25 ± 5°C. The results indicate 89.5% degradation of atrazine in farm yard manure during 60-day period followed by rice straw, saw dust charcoal and recording 87.2% and 83.8%, 67.7%, respectively, as compared to unamended treatment where 63.3% degradation was observed. The FYM was found to be most effective in soil and enhances the degradation as compared to the other amendments. Although addition of organic manures has been an integral part of sustainable agriculture practices; the present findings give a new dimension of it's utilization for removal of persistent pesticides. 3aambient temperature 3aanimal manures 3aatrazine 3afield capacity 3agroundwater 3arice straw 3asawdust 3asoil pollution 3asustainable agriculture 2aAtrazinexanalysisxchemistry. 2aCharcoalxchemistry 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediationxmethods 2aHerbicidesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aManure 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxchemistry 2aTemperature0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2009 Dec., v. 83, no. 6 p.832-835dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-009-9849-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01984naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245007600182300001600258500002400274520073500298650001401033650001601047650002101063650002201084650003701106650002501143650002201168650002201190650005501212650004101267650005901308700002001367773012901387852000901516856008501525655001201610IND4429013220221119045953.0091120s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442901322DNAL7 a197603402pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-009-9857-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanabe, Akiko10aImpact of N,N-Dimethylformamide from Domestic Effluents on River Waters  ap. 841-845.  aIncludes references  aThe impacts of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) from domestic effluents on rivers were evaluated.

It has been suggested that resistance is associated with loss of the infection court as stomata are converted to lenticels, but the time of onset, cultivar variation, and seasonal variation in ontogenic resistance has remained uncertain, as has the comparative susceptibility of stem tissue within the fruit cluster. In New York, we inoculated clusters of V. vinifera cvs. Chardonnay and Riesling and V. labrusca cvs. Concord and Niagara at stages from prebloom until 5 to 6 weeks postbloom. Berries were infected and supported profuse sporulation until 2 weeks postbloom, and pedicel tissue remained susceptible until 4 weeks postbloom. Although berries on later-inoculated clusters failed to support sporulation, discoloration and necrosis of berry tissues was often noted, and necrosis of the pedicel within such clusters often led to further discoloration, shriveling, reduced size, or loss of berries. When the epidermis of discolored berries that initially failed to support sporulation was cut, the pathogen emerged and sporulated through incisions, indicating that lack of sporulation on older symptomatic berries was due to infection at an early stage of berry development followed by conversion of functional stomata to lenticels during latency. We repeated the study on Chardonnay and Riesling vines in South Australia and found that the period of berry and rachis susceptibility was greatly increased. The protracted susceptibility of the host was related to the increased duration and phenological heterogeneity of bloom and berry development in the warmer climate of South Australia. The time of onset and subsequent expression of ontogenic resistance to P. viticola may thus be modified by climate and should be weighed in transposing results from one climatic area to another. Our results can be used to refine forecast models for grapevine downy mildew to account for changes in berry and rachis susceptibility, and to focus fungicide application schedules upon the most critical periods for protection of fruit. 3aPlasmopara viticola 3acultivars 3agrapes 3astems 3adowny mildew 3agenetic variation 3aontogeny 3apathogenicity 3aseasonal variation 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3aVitis vinifera 3aclimatic factors 3aNew York 0asymptoms 0afruits (plant anatomy)1 aGadoury, D.M.1 aWilcox, W.F.1 aMagarey, P.A.1 aSeem, R.C.0 tPhytopathology.g2005 Dec., v. 95, no. 12 p.1445-1452x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-95-14453Available from publisher's Web site  a20060413b20060529c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/04/13  aOther US 7aarticle02884naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001500184245012000199300002000319506007600339520118600415506003701601650001501638650002301653650001201676650001401688650002101702650001501723650003001738650001101768650003301779650004201812650000901854650001301863650004901876650002801925650001701953650002301970650002601993650002202019700002402041773017502065852000902240856008302249930003302332946001302365655001202378IND4395871820221207073515.0071007e20071002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439587182DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07057491042doi7 aPMC20004022pmcid7 a178953822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Liyin10aEstradiol-17β regulates mouse uterine epithelial cell proliferation through insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling  ap. 15847-15851.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEstradiol-17β (E₂) causes cell proliferation in the uterine epithelium of mice and humans by signaling through its transcription factor receptor α (ERα). In this work we show that this signaling is mediated by the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) expressed in the epithelium, whose activation leads to the stimulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway leading to cyclin D1 nuclear accumulation and engagement with the canonical cell cycle machinery. This cyclin D1 nuclear accumulation results from the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activity caused by an inhibitory phosphorylation by protein kinase B. Once the IGF1 pathway is activated, inhibition of ER signaling demonstrates that it is independent of ER. Inhibition of GSK3β in the absence of E₂ is sufficient to induce uterine epithelial cell proliferation, and GSK3β is epistatic to IGF1 signaling, indicating a linear pathway from E₂ to cyclin D1. Exposure to E₂ is the major risk factor for endometrial cancer, suggesting that downstream activation of this IGF1-mediated pathway by mutation could be causal in the progression to ER-independent tumors.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3acyclins 3aepistasis 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3aglycogen synthase kinases 3ahumans 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3ainsulin-like growth factor I receptor 3amice 3amutation 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3aprotein phosphorylation 3arisk factors 3atau-protein kinase 3atranscription factors 3auterine neoplasms1 aPollard, Jeffrey W.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Oct. 2, v. 104, no. 40 p.15847-15851dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07057491043Available from publisher's Web site  a20071007b20071102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02998naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245012400206300002000330506007600350520129500426506003701721650001501758650001001773650001901783650002101802650000901823650001701832650001201849650002001861650003001881650001201911650001501923650002601938700001901964700002201983700001702005700002002022700002002042700002102062700002102083700001902104700003102123773017602154852000902330856008302339939003302422946001302455655001202468IND4459535520221207073531.0110701e20110628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445953552DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10186871082doi7 aPMC31278892pmcid7 a216702952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZujovic, Violetta10aBoundary cap cells are peripheral nervous system stem cells that can be redirected into central nervous system lineages  ap. 10714-10719.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBoundary cap cells (BC), which express the transcription factor Krox20, participate in the formation of the boundary between the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. To study BC stemness, we developed a method to purify and amplify BC in vitro from Krox20Cre/⁺, R26RYFP/⁺ mouse embryos. We show that BC progeny are EGF/FGF2-responsive, form spheres, and express neural crest markers. Upon growth factor withdrawal, BC progeny gave rise to multiple neural crest and CNS lineages. Transplanted into the developing murine forebrain, they successfully survived, migrated, and integrated within the host environment. Surprisingly, BC progeny generated exclusively CNS cells, including neurons, astrocytes, and myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. In vitro experiments indicated that a sequential combination of ventralizing morphogens and glial growth factors was necessary to reprogram BC into oligodendrocytes. Thus, BC progeny are endowed with differentiation plasticity beyond the peripheral nervous system. The demonstration that CNS developmental cues can reprogram neural crest-derived stem cells into CNS derivatives suggests that BC could serve as a source of cell type-specific lineages, including oligodendrocytes, for cell-based therapies to treat CNS disorders.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aastrocytes 3abrain 3agrowth factors 3ain vitro studies 3amice 3aneural crest 3aneurons 3aoligodendroglia 3aperipheral nervous system 3aprogeny 3astem cells 3atranscription factors1 aThibaud, Julie1 aBachelin, Corinne1 aVidal, Marie1 aDeboux, Cyrille1 aCoulpier, Fanny1 aStadler, Nicolas1 aCharnay, Patrick1 aTopilko, Piotr1 aBaron-Van Evercooren, Anne0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 28, v. 108, no. 26 p.10714-10719dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10186871083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110701  aOther US 7aarticle02497naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245004800207300002000255506007600275520137700351506003701728650001301765650001201778650001401790650001101804650002001815773018601835852000902021856008302030939003302113946001302146655001202159IND4459538820221207073532.0110701e20110628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445953882DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11002911082doi7 aPMC31318152pmcid7 a216904052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheney, Dorothy L.10aExtent and limits of cooperation in animals  ap. 10902-10909.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIndividuals in many animal species are strongly motivated to form close social bonds and to attend to the social interactions of others. Some animals may also recognize other individuals' intentions and simple mental states. Such curiosity appears to be adaptive, because it enables observers to learn about others' status and relationships and to anticipate future events without direct participation. However, many questions remain unresolved. In particular, it remains unclear whether animals keep track of favors given and received when interacting with others, and whether they rely on memory of past cooperative acts when anticipating future ones. Primates appear to possess many of the cognitive abilities required for human-like contingent cooperation. However, most investigations of captive primates have indicated that cooperation is seldom contingency-based, and that interactions are not influenced by inequity aversion or sensitivity to cheaters. In contrast, several experiments with nonprimates have found that animals can take into account recent interactions when supporting others, suggesting that the apparent rarity of contingent cooperation in primates may not stem from cognitive constraints. Instead, individuals may tolerate short-term inequities in favors given and received because most cooperation occurs among long-term reciprocating partners.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPrimates 3aanimals 3acognition 3amemory 3asocial cohesion0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 28, v. 108, no.

Karst.) and naturally regenerated birch (Betula pendula Roth and B. pubescens Ehrh.) in southern Sweden, the proportion of birch was reduced in 0.1-ha plots at pre-commercial thinning to 0%, 20% or 50% of the total stem number (2000-2500 stems ha-1 after the thinning). The growth of both species was surveyed 4 and 10 years later. No significant between-treatment differences were observed on either occasion in total yield or in spruce diameter (apart from a more negative skewness of the diameter distribution of Norway spruce in the mixture with 50% birch compared to pure spruce). Birch retained its initial advantage in dominant height (of about 2 m) throughout the 10-year measurement period; hence, height growth rates of Norway spruce and birch were very similar. After three, four and 10 growing seasons, whipping damage to Norway spruce caused by birch was registered in the 20% and 50% birch mixtures, in which the proportions of damaged spruces were found to be similar, with 17% and 15% of damaged trees at the last inventory, respectively. In addition, simulations of the stands' development from the time of the last measurement until final felling at a total age of 66 years indicated that growth, yield and net present value decrease with increasing birch proportion, but if the proportion of birch removed in subsequent thinnings is increased, the between-treatment differences are reduced. 3aBetula pendula 3aPicea abies 3afelling 3agrowing season 3ainventories 3astems 3atrees 3awhipping 3aSweden1 aAgestam, Eric1 aEkö, Per Magnus1 aLindén, Magnus.0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2011 June, v. 26, no. 11 p.36-45dAlmqvist & Wiksell Periodical Cox0282-75817nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001400184245005800198300002000256506007600276520107200352506003701424650001901461650002201480650001301502650002601515650001101541650000901552650001201561650001501573700001901588700002701607700001701634773017501651852000901826856008301835930003301918946001301951655001201964IND4395871720221207072838.0071007e20071002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439587172DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07026971042doi7 aPMC20003852pmcid7 a178981792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ming10aProinsulin maturation, misfolding, and proteotoxicity  ap. 15841-15846.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs a tool to explore proinsulin (PI) trafficking, a human PI cDNA has been constructed with GFP fused within the C peptide. In regulated secretory cells containing appropriate prohormone convertases, the hProCpepGFP construct undergoes endoproteolytic processing to CpepGFP and native human insulin, which are specifically detected and cosecreted in parallel with endogenous insulin. Expression of C(A7)Y mutant PI results in autosomal dominant diabetes in Akita mice. We directly identify the misfolded PI in Akita islets and also show that C(A7)Y mutant PI, either in the context of the hProCpepGFP chimera or not, engages directly in protein complexes with nonmutant PI, impairing the trafficking and recovery of nonmutant PI. This trapping mechanism decreases insulin production in β cells. Thereafter we observe a loss of β cell viability. The data imply that PI misfolding leading to impaired endoplasmic reticulum exit of nonmutant PI may be a key early step in a chain reaction of β cell dysfunction and demise leading to onset and progression of diabetes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell viability 3acomplementary DNA 3adiabetes 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3ahumans 3amice 3amutants 3aproinsulin1 aHodish, Israel1 aRhodes, Christopher J.1 aArvan, Peter0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Oct. 2, v. 104, no. 40 p.15841-15846dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07026971043Available from publisher's Web site  a20071007b20071102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03805naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157072000900175100001600184245010600200300001600306500002400322500001500346520196000361650001602321650001202337650001002349650001802359650002102377650003702398650001202435650001702447650001802464650002402482650000902506650000902515650001602524650001202540650001202552650001202564650002402576650001102600650003302611650001802644650000902662650002402671650000902695650002402704650003502728650002802763653002202791653002702813700002002840700001402860773010702874852000902981856009602990930003303086945002503119946001103144655001203155IND4414325920221119045849.0090102e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441432592DNAL7 a188453312pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.08.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2001 aAbdalla, H.14aThe ability of freeze-dried bull spermatozoa to induce calcium oscillations and resumption of meiosis  ap. 543-552.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective was to investigate the ability of freeze-dried (FD) bull spermatozoa to induce calcium oscillations in mouse oocytes and meiosis resumption in in vitro-matured bovine oocytes after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Bull spermatozoa were freeze-dried and stored for 1 y at +25, +4, or -196°C. In the first experiment, rehydrated sperm heads were microinseminated into hybrid mouse oocytes loaded with fluo-3/AM, and the kinetics of intracellular calcium concentration was monitored for 1h. Repetitive increases of intracellular calcium concentration were recorded in the majority of injected oocytes, with exception of a few oocytes injected with FD sperm heads stored at +4°C (11%) and +25°C (8%) that exhibited a single increase or no response (non-oscillated). The proportion of oocytes that oscillated with high frequency (>=10spikes/h) was higher in the non-dried control group (79%; P <0.05) than in the FD groups (58, 55, and 54% for storage at -196, +4, and +25°C, respectively). In the second experiment, control and FD spermatozoa were microinseminated into in vitro-matured, denuded bovine oocytes. The oocytes were fixed and stained 12h after ICSI. A higher proportion of bovine oocytes injected with control spermatozoa (70%; P <0.05) resumed meiosis than those injected with +25, +4 and -196°C stored FD spermatozoa (53, 48, and 57%, respectively). The proportion of ICSI oocytes that developed to the pronuclear stage (complete activation) was higher in the control group (64%; P <0.05) than those in all the FD groups (34, 27, and 28% for storage at -196, +4, and +25°C, respectively). Thus, the ability of bull spermatozoa to induce frequent intracellular calcium spikes in mouse oocytes was impaired by the process of freeze-drying, without differences among storage at +25, +4 or -196°C, probably resulting in a lower proportion of bovine oocytes that resumed meiosis and/or developed to the pronuclear stage. 3arehydration 3ahybrids 3abulls 3afreeze drying 3acryopreservation 3aintracytoplasmic sperm injection 3acalcium 3acell culture 3aion transport 3astorage temperature 3amice 3acows 3aspermatozoa 3ameiosis 3aoocytes 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCattle 2aCryopreservationxveterinary 2aFreeze Drying 2aMale 2aMeiosisxphysiology 2aMice 2aOocytesxphysiology 2aSemen Preservationxveterinary 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology 0aoocyte activation 0ain vitro fertilization1 aHirabayashi, M.1 aHochi, S.0 tTheriogenology.g2009 Feb., v. 71, no. 3 p.543-552dButterworth-Heinemann; [New York]x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.08.0213Available from publisher's Web site  a20110622b20110701c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03518naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014700170300001600317520229600333592002802629596005302657650002302710650000902733650000902742650001202751650001702763650001702780650001802797650000902815653001502824653002302839653001602862700001502878700001802893700001902911773009502930856008603025852000903111655001203120IND60688561920200616000000.0200429e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068856192DNAL7 a10.1080/08927936.2016.11527642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBranson, Sandy10aExamining Differences between Homebound Older Adult Pet Owners and Non-pet Owners in Depression, Systemic Inflammation, and Executive Function  ap. 323-334.  aHomebound older adults are prone to depression, which is linked to systemic inflammation that promotes executive function decline. A companion animal may reduce the negative biobehavioral processes asso- ciated with depression, inflammation, and reduced executive function in homebound older adults. The primary aim of this study was to examine dif- ferences between homebound older adult pet owners and non-pet owners in depression, salivary C-reactive protein (CRP), and executive function. The secondary aim was to determine if the level of attachment to pets was as- sociated with depression, salivary CRP, and executive function. The study was cross-sectional and investigated homebound older adult pet owners and non-pet owners (n = 88) using psychometrically reliable and valid instru- ments (Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form and CLOX 1). Salivary CRP was assessed with immunoassay. Level of attachment to pets was measured using a Likert scale (0–10). Mean age for the total sample was 75 years (SD = 9). Forty-eight (55%) participants owned pets (56% dogs, 25% cats, 4% other pets, 15% both cats and dogs). Pet owners reported a high level of attachment to pets (Median = 10). Pet owners had significantly higher ex- ecutive function than non-pet owners (t = –2.07; p = 0.04) but there were no significant differences in executive function between cat owners and dog owners (t = 1.53; p = 0.14). Pet owners and non-pet owners were similar in depression (t = –1.80, p = 0.08) and salivary CRP levels (t = 0.27, p = 0.79). Level of attachment to pets was significantly and positively correlated with executive function (r = 0.30; p = 0.04) but was not significantly correlated with depression (r = 0.04, p = 0.77) or salivary CRP (r = –0.04, p = 0.80). Compared with non-pet owners, pet owners had better executive function but similar depression and salivary CRP levels. Reasons for these findings are unclear. Significant positive correlation be- tween pet attachment and executive function suggests further investigation in this area. Future studies with larger samples and a longitudinal design are needed to investigate the biobehavioral changes over time in relation to pet ownership, level of attachment to pets, and executive func- tion in homebound older adults.  aPublisher supplied data  cUTHealth School of Nursing Dean's Research Award 3aC-reactive protein 3acats 3adogs 3aelderly 3aimmunoassays 3ainflammation 3apet ownership 3apets 0adepression 0aexecutive function 0aolder adult1 aBoss, Lisa1 aCron, Stanley1 aKang, Duck-Hee0 tAnthrozoös.g2016 May 3, v. 29, no. 2 p.323-334dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08927936.2016.11527643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013900166300001800305500001500323520122700338592002801565650002201593650002201615650001701637650003501654650003301689650003701722650002201759650001601781650001901797650001701816650001501833653001801848700001401866700001901880700001301899773010601912856008102018852000902099655001202108IND60120575020221122174324.0150208e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012057502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-013-7573-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Jianchao10aSynthesis of 3D micro- and nano-hierarchical structure InVO4 porous microspheres with improved visible-light photocatalytic activities  ap. 7574-7580.  a2019-12-04  aThree-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structure InVO₄porous microspheres were fabricated by a hydrothermal method with the assistance of cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB). X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, adsorption analyzer, diffuse refection spectroscopy, UV–Vis spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy were adopted to analyze the structure–property relationship of samples, and the formation mechanism was also discussed. The results show that the concentration of CTAB solution has important influence on the grain size, crystal structure, and morphology of as-synthesized InVO₄samples, thus affecting the optical property and photocatalytic activity. When the concentration of CTAB solution is 1 wt%, we can obtain perfect 3D hierarchical porous microspheres. Such microspheres with diameter size about 2–5 μm are assembled by numerous nanocrystals, and exhibit an enhanced photocatalytic activity in the degradation of Rhodamine B under visible light irradiation. Moreover, Oswald ripening and self-assembly aggregation are presumed to play an important role in the formation of these 3D hierarchical structure InVO₄porous microspheres.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystal structure 3ananocrystals 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aphotoluminescence 3airradiation 3aphotocatalysts 3aspectroscopy 3aadsorption 0aphotocatalyst1 aYang, Hui1 aShen, Qianhong1 aFeng, Yu0 tJournal of materials science.g2013 Nov., v. 48, no. 21 p.7574-7580dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-013-7573-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011100168300001600279520133900295536023701634592002801871596005901899596005901958596008502017650001302102650001402115650001902129650001602148650002102164653001902185653001502204653001102219653001102230653002802241653001102269700001902280700001502299700001602314700001702330700001802347700001602365700001702381700001502398700001702413773013102430856008502561852000902646655001202655IND60595670620221116172418.0180605e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059567062DNAL7 a10.1080/17538947.2017.13205932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Xingwen12aA web-based land surface remote sensing products validation system (LAPVAS): application to albedo product  ap. 308-328.  aQuantitative remote sensing product (QRSP) validation is a complex process to assess the accuracy and uncertainty independently using reference data with multiple land cover types and long-time series. A web-based system named as LAnd surface remote sensing Product VAlidation system (LAPVAS) is described in this paper, which is used to implement the QRSPs validation process automatically. The LAPAVS has two subsystems, the Validation Databases Subsystem and the Accuracy Evaluation Subsystem. Three functions have been implemented by the two subsystems for a comprehensive QRSP validation: (1) a standardized processing of reference data and storage of these data in validation databases; (2) a consistent and comprehensive validation procedure to assess the QRSPs’ accuracy and uncertainty; and (3) a visual process customization tool with which the users can register new validation data, host new reference data, and readjust the validation workflows for the QRSP accuracy assessment. In LAPVAS, more than 100 GB of reference data warehoused in validation databases for 13 types of QRSPs’ validation. One of the key QRSPs, land surface albedo, is selected as an example to illustrate the application of LAPVAS. It is demonstrated that the LAPVAS has a good performance in the land surface remote sensing product validation.  aThis work was jointly supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671363]; National Basic Research Program of China [2013CB733401]; National High Technology Research and Development Program of China: [2013AA12A301].  aPublisher supplied data  a41671363cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2013CB733401cNational Basic Research Program of China  a2013AA12A301cNational High Technology Research and Development Program of China 3aInternet 3adatabases 3aremote sensing 3auncertainty 3avegetation types 0aRemote sensing 0avalidation 0asystem 0aLAPVAS 0auncertainty information 0aalbedo1 aWen, Jianguang1 aTang, Yong1 aMa, Mingguo1 aYou, Dongqin1 aDou, Baocheng1 aWu, Xiaodan1 aChu, Xiaobo,1 aXiao, Qing1 aLiu, Qinghuo0 tInternational journal of digital earth.g2018 Mar. 4, v. 11, no. 3 p.308-328dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12290x1753-89557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2017.13205933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007000169300001800239500001100257520130800268592002801576650002101604650001601625650002401641650001601665650002001681650000901701650001701710650001601727700005901743773011201802856008201914852000901996655001202005IND60747547220221120062602.0210814e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074754722DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-021-02613-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardoza, Evieann10aC Group-Mediated Antibiotic Stress Mimics the Cold Shock Response  ap. 3372-3380.  aReview  aA temperature downshift results in stabilized secondary structure formation in mRNA that halts translation to which Escherichia coli responds by synthesizing a set of proteins termed as cold shock proteins (Csps). To cope with the sudden temperature drop, gene expression patterns are reprogrammed to induce Csps at the cost of other proteins. Out of the nine homologous proteins in the CspA family, CspA, CspB, CspG, and CspI have major roles in protecting the cell under a cold shock. Additionally, a subset of Csps has conferred the organism an ability to adapt to various stresses along the lines of nutrient deprivation, oxidative, heat, acid, and antibiotic stresses. Stressors like C group translational inhibitors stall the translational apparatus and produce a response similar to that observed under a temperature downshift. Conditions set by the antibiotic therefore elicit a cold shock response and induce the major Csps, thereby pointing out to a common mechanism existing between the two. In the current review, we briefly describe the induction of E. coli Csps under an antibiotic stress acquired from data published previously and help establish the role of Csps in protecting the cell against the inducing agents and as a participant in the organisms’ complex stress response network.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotics 3acold shock response 3acold stress 3agene expression 3aheat 3amicrobiology 3atemperature1 aSingh, Harinder1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9373-83860 tCurrent microbiology.g2021 Sept., v. 78, no. 9 p.3372-3380dSpringer USwJournal:jnl10978x0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-021-02613-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245012700171300001100298520195500309592002802264650002402292650002802316650002302344650002402367650001202391650001602403650002702419650001902446650002102465650001102486650001302497650001602510650001902526650000902545650001002554650001502564650001902579650001502598650001802613650001302631700002202644700002102666700002302687700006502710773011102775856008302886852000902969655001202978IND60724705420221116202056.0220502e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072470542DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-04573-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGruntmeir, Jeff M.10aDetection of heartworm antigen without cross-reactivity to helminths and protozoa following heat treatment of canine serum  ap. 71.  aBACKGROUND: Detection of Dirofilaria immitis, or heartworm, through antigen in sera is the primary means of diagnosing infections in dogs. In recent years, the practice of heat-treating serum prior to antigen testing has demonstrated improved detection of heartworm infection. While the practice of heat-treating serum has resulted in earlier detection and improved sensitivity for heartworm infections, it has been suggested that heat treatment may cause cross reactivity with A. reconditum and intestinal helminth infections of dogs. No studies have assessed the potential cross-reactivity of these parasites with heartworm tests before and after heat treatment using blood products and an appropriate gold standard reference. METHODS: Canine sera (n=163) was used to evaluate a heartworm antigen-ELISA (DiroCHEK®) and potential cross-reactivity with common parasitic infections. The heartworm status and additional parasite infections were confirmed by necropsy and adult helminth species verified morphologically or by PCR, and feces evaluated by centrifugal fecal flotation. RESULTS: Intestinal parasites were confirmed in 140 of the dogs by necropsy, and 130 by fecal flotation. Acanthocheilonema reconditum microfilariae were confirmed in 22 dogs. Prevalence of heartworm infection confirmed by necropsy was 35.6% (58/163). In the 105 dogs without heartworms, specificity remained unchanged at 100% both before and after heat treatment despite confirmed infections with A. reconditum, Ancylostoma caninum, Ancylostoma brasiliense, Trichuris vulpis, Toxocara canis, Dipylidium caninum, Spirometra mansonoides, Macracanthorynchus ingens, Cystoisospora sp., Giardia sp., and Sarcocystis sp. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the use of heat treatment improves sensitivity of heartworm tests and is unlikely to cause false positive antigen results due to Acanthocheilonema reconditum, intestinal helminths, and protozoal parasites in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAncylostoma caninum 3aDipetalonema reconditum 3aDipylidium caninum 3aDirofilaria immitis 3aGiardia 3aSarcocystis 3aSpirometra mansonoides 3aToxocara canis 3aTrichuris vulpis 3aadults 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3across reaction 3adogs 3afeces 3aheartworms 3aheat treatment 3aintestines 3amicrofilariae 3anecropsy1 aThompson, Nina M.1 aLong, Maureen T.1 aBlagburn, Byron L.1 aWalden, Heather D.

An appropriate approach integrating climate change scenarios at local scales is essential for producing detailed risk models to support cyclone mitigation measures. This study developed a simple cyclone risk-modelling approach under present and future climate change scenarios using geospatial techniques at local scales, and tested using a case study in Sarankhola Upazila from coastal Bangladesh. Linear storm-surge models were developed up to 100-year return periods. A local sea level rise scenario of 0.34 m for the year 2050 was integrated with surge models to assess the climate change impact. The resultant storm-surge models were used in the risk-modelling procedures. The developed risk models successfully identified the spatial extent and levels of risk that match with actual extent and levels within an acceptable limit of deviation. The result showed that cyclone risk areas increased with the increase of return period. The study also revealed that climate change scenario intensified the cyclone risk area by 5–10% in every return period. The findings indicate this approach has the potential to model cyclone risk in other similar coastal environments for developing mitigation plans and strategies.  aThis study was supported by the International Postgraduate Research Scholarship (IPRS) and the University of Queensland (UQ), Australia.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Queensland (UQ), Australia  cInternational Postgraduate Research Scholarship 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3ahurricanes 3amodels 3arisk 3asea level 3aBangladesh 0aTropical cyclone 0ageospatial techniques 0ahazard 0arisk 0aclimate change1 aPhinn, Stuart1 aRoelfsema, Chris1 aChilds, Iraphne0 tInternational journal of digital earth.g2018 Mar. 4, v. 11, no. 3 p.246-263dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12290x1753-89557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2017.13205953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01922naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010700168300001600275520075800291592002801049650001201077650001201089650002901101650001401130650002201144650001301166650002001179650001001199650001301209650002001222700001901242700001901261700002601280700001901306700001701325700001901342773009401361856004801455852000901503655001201512IND4482066820221121161441.0120418e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448206682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-012-0065-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilveira, J.

Cowpea plants were exposed to a mild NaCl concentration (50 mM) in order to restrict growth and N-demand. After 21 d, pretreated plants and control plants were supplied with 0, 5 and 10 mM of Ca(NO3)2 for 3 d in absence of NaCl. Salt pretreated plants showed a great limitation in acquisition of NO3 −, indicated by decline in the nitrate uptake rate, NO3 − accumulation, nitrate reductase activity and protein content. The restriction of NO3 − utilization was positively associated with increased glutamine synthetase activity and glutamine accumulation, especially in roots.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acowpeas 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aglutamine 3anitrate reductase 3anitrates 3aprotein content 3aroots 3asalinity 3asodium chloride1 aMelo, A.

If the activity of these pumps is reduced, it results in less NO3− and Cd2+ being transported into the vacuoles, which contributes to better nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and lower Cd2+ tolerance in plants. The physiological mechanisms that regulate the balance between NUE and Cd2+ tolerance remain unknown. In our study, two Brassica napus genotypes with differential NUEs, xiangyou 15 and 814, and Atclca-2 mutant and AtCAX4 over-expression line (AtCAX4-OE) of Arabidopsis thaliana, were used to investigate Cd2+ stress responses. We found that the Brassica napus genotype, with higher NUE, was more sensitive to Cd2+ stress. The AtCAX4-OE mutant, with higher Cd2+ vacuolar sequestration capacity (VSC), limited NO3− sequestration into root vacuoles and promoted NUE. Atclca-2 mutants, with decreased NO3− VSC, enhanced Cd2+ sequestration into root vacuoles and conferred greater Cd2+ tolerance than the WT. This may be due to the competition between Cd2+ andNO3− in the vacuoles for the energy provided by V-ATPase and V-PPase. Regulating the balance between Cd2+ and NO3− vacuolar accumulation by inhibiting the activity of CLCa transporter and increasing the activity of CAX4 transporter will simultaneously enhance both the NUE and Cd2+ tolerance of Brassica napus, essential for improving its Cd2+ phytoremediation potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBrassica napus 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3acadmium 3aenergy 3agene overexpression 3agenotype 3ametal tolerance 3amutants 3anitrates 3anutrient use efficiency 3aphytoremediation 3aproton pump 3astress response 3atonoplast 3avacuoles 0aProton pumps 0aHeavy metal tolerance 0aNitrate assimilation 0aVacuolar sequestration capacity (VSC) 0aNitrogen use efficiency1 aJian, Shao-Fen1 aSong, Hai-Xing1 aGuan, Chun-Yun1 aLepo, Joe Eugene1 aIsmail, Abdelbagi M.1 aZhang, Zhenhua,0 tPlant science.g2019 July, v. 284 p.57-66dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2019.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245007600174300001600250520192800266592002802194650001902222650000902241650001302250650000902263650001702272650000902289650000902298651001902307653001402326653001402340700002402354700002302378773009702401856008602498852000902584655001202593IND60688562020200616000000.0200429e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068856202DNAL7 a10.1080/08927936.2016.11813592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuldoon, Janine C.10aExploring Children’s Perspectives on the Welfare Needs of Pet Animals  ap. 357-375.  aChildren are increasingly viewed as important recipients of educational interventions to improve animal welfare, yet research examining their perspectives is lacking, particularly within the UK. Helping children to care appropriately for animals depends, not least, on an ability to understand the needs of different species and correctly identify cues given by the animal that indicate its welfare state. This study began to explore: (a) children’s perceptions of welfare needs, focusing on four common pet animals; (b) influences on the development of knowledge; (c) beliefs about whether or not (all) animals are sentient, and (d) their confidence in identifying when their own pets are in need. Fourteen focus groups were carried out with 53 children aged 7 to 13 years. Findings highlighted an affirmative response that animals have feelings (dogs especially), albeit with doubts about this applying universally. There was wide variation in children’s knowledge of welfare needs, even among owners of the animal in question. Conversely, some children lacked confidence in spite of the extensive knowledge they had developed through direct experience. An important finding was a perceived difficulty in identifying the needs of particular species or specific types of need in their own pets. Fitting well with a recent emphasis on “positive welfare,” children felt that many animals need demonstrative love and attention, especially cats and dogs. While there is clearly scope for educating children about common needs and cues that indicate animals’ welfare state, other areas pose a greater challenge. Emotional connection seems important in the development of extensive knowledge and concern for welfare. Accordingly, animals that do not possess the kind of behavioral repertoire that is easy to interpret or allows for a perceived sense of reciprocity are possibly at risk of negative welfare experiences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3acats 3achildren 3adogs 3afocus groups 3apets 3arisk 3aUnited Kingdom 0aknowledge 0asentience1 aWilliams, Joanne M.1 aLawrence, Alistair0 tAnthrozoös.g2016 Sept. 1, v. 29, no. 3 p.357-375dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08927936.2016.11813593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008600167300001600253520124800269536028201517592002801799596008801827596004001915650000901955650002001964650001601984650001502000650002502015650001502040650002502055651001002080653001302090653002702103653000802130700001502138700002102153700001702174700001502191773013102206856008502337852000902422655001202431IND60595670820221116172710.0180605e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059567082DNAL7 a10.1080/17538947.2017.13221512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Zheyuan10aMonitoring of ground deformation in Liulin district, China using InSAR approaches  ap. 264-283.  aCoalbed methane (CBM) exploration generally refers to a technique that extracts natural gas from coal beds. The development of CBM in Liulin, China, has experienced a significantly growth period during the past two decades. Previous research mainly focused on the coal geological background or CBM technique itself, while time series InSAR (TS-InSAR) technique was conducted in this work to study the potential land deformation induced by CBM extraction from 2003 to 2011. In total, 21 ALOS-1 PALSAR images (acquired from 22 December 2006 to 2 January 2011) and 14 ENVISAT ASAR scenes (captured between 29 October 2003 and 7 November 2007) were used. The TS-InSAR outcome revealed that the annual deformation rates were ranging from 15 to −40 mm yr⁻¹ over the study region. Then the time series deformation evolutions were analysed over 8 CBM sites (No. 4 coal seam) out of 20, and the subsidence rates between 1.9 and −6.5 mm yr⁻¹ were derived. In addition, the average subsidence rate and standard deviation among these eight measurements were −3.0 and 2.6 mm yr⁻¹ respectively, suggesting that these CBM extraction sites were quite stable and no obvious subsidence had been observed during this eight-year period.  aThis research was supported under Australian Research Council’s Discovery funding scheme [project number DP130101694] and JAXA PI investigation project 1419 – Automated interferometric analysis of L-band SAR satellite data for operational earthquake and volcano monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data  aDP130101694cAustralian Research Council’sdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000923  a1419cJAXA PI investigation project 3acoal 3acoalbed methane 3adeformation 3amonitoring 3astatistical analysis 3asubsidence 3atime series analysis 3aChina 0aTS-InSAR 0asubsidence measurement 0aCBM1 aGe, Linlin1 aNg, Alex Hay-Man1 aLi, Xiaojing1 aLi, Liyuan0 tInternational journal of digital earth.g2018 Mar. 4, v. 11, no. 3 p.264-283dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12290x1753-89557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2017.13221513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002100165245017500186300001600361500001500377520142500392592002801817650002601845650001101871650001401882650001001896650001301906650001301919650001101932650001201943650002301955650001301978650001101991650001302002650001402015650003502029650001202064650003002076650003802106650001302144650005202157650003602209650002102245650002202266650001002288653005002298653001602348653001002364653001802374653001302392653001402405653001502419653004002434653001602474700002402490700002102514700002502535700002202560773013202582852000902714856008302723655001202806IND4408905020221121055953.0181012e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440890502DNAL7 a183194342pmid7 a10.1177/1040638708020002102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKay, Jerome T.12aA real-time polymerase chain reaction assay to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms at codon 171 in the prion gene for the genotyping of scrapie susceptibility in sheep  ap. 209-212.  a2019-12-04  aThe objective of this study was to report a reliable real-time polymerase chain reaction assay compatible with the Roche LightCycler 2.0 capable of genotyping sheep for scrapie susceptibility at codon 171. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the prion protein gene in sheep that may govern resistance to scrapie at codon 171 encode for lysine (K), histidine (H), glutamine (Q), and arginine (R). A modified proteinase K method for leukocytes or whole blood was used to isolate genomic DNA from sheep blood. Fluoresentric developed and optimized primers and probes for the codon 171 SNP assay. The assay was initially validated using 218 determinations from whole blood of known genotypes with 100% correct identity. The assay was further validated through a whole-blood check test provided annually by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory with a correct identification rate of 100%. From January 2005 to December 2006, 3,672 samples from blood were genotyped at codon 171. The genotypes were QR₁₇₁ (n = 1,838, 50.05%). RR₁₇₁ (n = 1,423, 38.75%), QQ₁₇₁ (n = 407, 11.08%), HR₁₇₁ (n = 2, 0.05%), and HQ₁₇₁ (n = 2, 0.05%). The combination of this simple extraction method and the novel Fluoresentric assay is very accurate, is capable of identifying all 4 SNPs at codon 171 in one reaction, and has proven to be a useful tool for producers in their selective breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiagnostic techniques 3alysine 3aglutamine 3asheep 3aarginine 3avalidity 3acodons 3ascrapie 3adisease resistance 3agenotype 3aprions 3aaccuracy 3ahistidine 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAnimals 2aDNAxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenotype 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aPrionsxgenetics 2aScrapiexgenetics 2aSheep 0afluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) 0amethodology 0agenes 0aFluoresentric 0ascrapie. 0aCodon 171 0agenotyping 0areal-time polymerase chain reaction 0anew methods1 aBrigner, Tiffany A.1 aCaplin, Brian E.1 aMcCurdy, Kimberly S.1 aForde, Richard L.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 20, no. 2 p.209-212dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638708020002103Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02745naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007400172300001600246520134500262592002801607650001201635650002301647650002201670650001301692650001501705650001501720650001101735650001901746650001201765650002101777650001101798650001001809650001301819650001601832650001301848651001301861653001801874653002201892653001201914653001301926653001301939653001601952653001101968653003001979700002002009773010202029856008702131852000902218655001202227IND60537834120221122204043.0190405e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053783412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSirén, Anders,12aA spatial bioeconomic model of the harvest of wild plants and animals  ap. 201-210.  aThe intensity of harvest of wild plants and animals often varies with the distance from human settlements, processing facilities, markets, and transportation routes such as roads and rivers, resulting in marked spatial gradients in the abundance of such resources. Spatial modeling of the harvest of wild species has therefore emerged as an important research approach. The literature on such modeling is, however, fragmented between different resource types, and empirical validation of the models is often weak or absent. This paper presents a model that is intended to have validity for a wide variety of wild plant and animal resources. It combines a logistic model of resource growth with an economic model assuming that costs associated with harvest consist of three components, namely transport, search, and handling, and a one-dimensional spatial structure where resource harvesters are based at a “central place” surrounded by infinite extensions of habitat for the harvested resource. Model outcomes show that the spatial distribution of harvest heavily depends on the carrying capacity and the catchability coefficient, i.e. the ease of finding and harvesting a resource unit. An empirical study of wildlife hunting and palm leaf harvest in indigenous villages in Ecuadorian Amazonia confirmed the validity of model outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abioeconomic models 3acarrying capacity 3ahabitats 3aharvesters 3aharvesting 3aleaves 3alogit analysis 3amarkets 3amodel validation 3arivers 3aroads 3avillages 3awild plants 3awildlife 3aAmazonia 0aSpatial model 0aBioeconomic model 0aHunting 0aBushmeat 0aWildlife 0aPalm leaves 0aThatch 0aPholidostachys synanthera1 aParvinen, Kalle0 tEcological economics.g2015 Aug., v. 116 p.201-210dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02136naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010600169300001800275520116000293592002801453650001401481650002401495650001601519650001801535650000901553700002001562700002401582700002001606773010601626856008101732852000901813655001201822IND60120575420221122174317.0150208e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012057542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-013-7577-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFortino, Stefania10aFEM simulation of the hygro-thermal behaviour of wood under surface densification at high temperature  ap. 7603-7612.  aSurface densification of solid wood increases the density on the surface, when compressed by single side heated press. A recent experimental study has pointed out the influence of the process parameters on the development of the density profiles in the modified samples. Numerical modelling can help to optimize the experimental work which is often time consuming and laborious due to the large amount of experiments required to check the influence of the pressing parameters. In the present work, a FEM simulation of the hygro-thermal behaviour of wood under surface densification is proposed by using a three-dimensional hygro-thermal model based on earlier literature approaches. The model is implemented in a user subroutine of the FEM code Abaqus starting from the definition of a weak form of the governing hygro-thermal equations of the problem. The numerical profiles of moisture content and temperature during the wood densification process are simulated for some wood specimens tested in a previous study. Conclusions are given on the relationship between these profiles and the experimental density profiles due to different process parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amathematical models 3atemperature 3awater content 3awood1 aGenoese, Andrea1 aGenoese, Alessandra1 aRautkari, Lauri0 tJournal of materials science.g2013 Nov., v. 48, no. 21 p.7603-7612dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-013-7577-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012000160500001400280520102200294592002801316650005201344650002101396650002001417650002301437650001401460650001401474650001301488650001601501650001701517650002401534650001201558700002801570700002801598773012101626856007301747852000901820655001201829IND60724600120221118073349.0210122e20210113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072460012DNAL7 a10.3390/v130101062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsgrò, Camilla 10aSystematic Search for SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Inhibitors for Drug Repurposing: Ethacrynic Acid as a Potential Drug  aNAL-light  aIn 2019 an outbreak occurred which resulted in a global pandemic. The causative agent has been identified in a virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family, similar to the agent of SARS, referred to as SARS-CoV-2. This epidemic spread rapidly globally with high morbidity and mortality. Although vaccine development is at a very advanced stage, there are currently no truly effective antiviral drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study we present systematic and integrative antiviral drug repurposing effort aimed at identifying, among the drugs already authorized for clinical use, some active inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The most important result of this analysis is the demonstration that ethacrynic acid, a powerful diuretic, is revealed to be an effective inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Even with all the necessary cautions, given the particular nature of this drug, these data can be the starting point for the development of an effective therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantiviral agents 3aethacrynic acid 3aetiological agents 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apandemic 3aproteinases 3atherapeutics 3avaccine development 3aviruses1 aSardanelli, Anna  Maria1 aPalese, Luigi  Leonardo0 tViruses.g2021 Jan. 13, v. 13, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130101063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245014600178300001400324520124100338592002801579650002201607650001501629650001201644650001901656650001601675650002201691650001501713650001301728651001201741653002201753653003401775653003201809653002901841653002201870653001201892700002601904700002701930773010001957856008702057852000902144655001202153IND60537834220221122201642.0190405e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053783422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatorre Tomás, Sara,14aThe commodification of nature and socio-environmental resistance in Ecuador: An inventory of accumulation by dispossession cases, 1980–2013  ap. 58-69.  aThis article aims to advance understanding of the relationship between social metabolism, the commodification of nature, local regime changes, and patterns of resistance to accumulation by environmental dispossession during the most recent phase of global capitalism. Ecuador is a resource-rich periphery country that has moved after 2007 from a neoliberal to a post-neoliberal policy regime. By analyzing 64 socio-environmental resistance cases in the period 1980–2013, we focus on the continuities and changes in the relationship between environmental dispossession and resistance under the two regimes. We find that while resistance to agri-food projects has diminished, having enjoyed some success under during the post-neoliberal regime, resistance to infrastructure and mineral extraction projects has remained steady, with the impacts from environmental dispossession remaining much like those observed before 2007. At the same time, major social investments financed through natural resource extraction and export, combined with the introduction of constraints on the media and public assembly, have created a political climate in which the resistance observed during the neo-liberal period is now a socially deviant behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabnormal behavior 3acapitalism 3aexports 3ainfrastructure 3ainventories 3aissues and policy 3ametabolism 3apolitics 3aEcuador 0aSocial metabolism 0aCommodity frontiers of nature 0aEnvironmental dispossession 0aEnvironmental resistance 0aPolitical ecology 0aEcuador1 aFarrell, Katharine N.1 aMartínez Alier, Juan,0 tEcological economics.g2015 Aug., v. 116 p.58-69dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245017200175520155900347592002801906650001801934650001401952650001801966650001101984650001101995650002302006650001002029650001602039650001602055650001002071651001702081700002002098700003202118773012602150856008402276852000902360655001202369IND60703068920221120143237.0200719e20200311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070306892DNAL7 a10.3390/horticulturae60100182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAipperspach, Andrew 10aUtilizing Pruning and Leaf Removal to Optimize Ripening of <i>Vitis riparia</i>-Based ‘Frontenac Gris’ and ‘Marquette’ Wine Grapes in the Northern Great Plains  aExperiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of three pruning levels (20, 30 and 40 nodes per vine) and three fruit-zone leaf removal levels (0%, 50%, and 100%) on the yield and fruit quality of Frontenac gris and Marquette wine grapes in a northern production region. The study was conducted at three North Dakota vineyards located near Buffalo, Clifford, and Wahpeton, North Dakota, in 2011 and 2012. Increasing the number of buds retained increased yields and reduced pruning weights in both cultivars. Frontenac gris and Marquette yields were greatest when vines had 50% of the fruit-zone leaves removed due to heavier clusters, suggesting that the 100% fruit-zone leaf removal level was too severe. Individual berries in clusters were also heavier when vines were pruned to retain 40 buds. Frontenac gris fruit quality was similar both years and was not influenced by pruning or leaf removal levels. Marquette fruit total soluble solids content was greater in 2012 due to the warmer and longer growing season. Marquette fruit titratable acidity was lower when 100% of the fruit-zone leaves were removed. These results suggest that for the two cold-hardy hybrid wine grapes used in this study, greater bud retention levels should be investigated. Results also warrant further research into cultivar adaptiveness to northern Great Plains conditions. With further research, it is anticipated that wine grape cultivars and management practices will be identified to produce acceptable yields and fruit quality for commercial wine grape production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis riparia 3acultivars 3afruit quality 3afruits 3aleaves 3atitratable acidity 3avines 3aviticulture 3awine grapes 3awines 3aNorth Dakota1 aHammond, James 1 aHatterman-Valenti, Harlene 0 tHorticulturae.g2020 Mar. 11, v. 6, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae60100183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245017500166300001600341520118000357592002801537596005901565596005901624596005901683596007501742650002301817650001201840650002601852650001801878650002101896650002101917650001501938650001401953650000901967650001901976650001501995651001002010700001302020700001402033700001602047700001902063700001602082700005702098773014402155856008302299852000902382655001202391IND60786475820221120161727.0220803e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078647582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-022-03519-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSi, Shaocheng10aResponses of Labile Organic Carbon and Extractable Cadmium Fractions in an Agricultural Soil Following Long-Term Repeated Application of Pig Manure and Effective Microbes  ap. 304-309.  aLong-term pig manure addition has been widely applied in red soil to improve soil fertility. However, the influence of combined utilization of pig manure and effective microbes (EM) on soil organic carbon (SOC) and Cd are not well understood. This study conducted a 23-year (1996–2019) long-term fertilization field trial to investigate the changes of different fractions of SOC and Cd under chemical fertilization (CF), pig manure (PM), and pig manure with effective microbes (PM + EM) treatments in an agricultural soil of Jiangxi Province, South China. The results showed that the pig manure addition significantly enhanced the contents of SOC and Cd in the soils compared with the CF treatments. Furthermore, with the increment of SOC, the PM + EM treatment significantly increased the contents of soil microbial biomass carbon, dissolved organic carbon and easily oxidizable carbon compared with the pig manure application alone. Meanwhile, compared with the CF treatments, the EM addition significantly enhanced the exchangeable and oxidizable fractions of Cd, thus the potential Cd environment risk due to pig manure application should be carefully assessed.  aPublisher supplied data  a41991330cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41701263cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a42007022cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFE0106400cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aagricultural soils 3acadmium 3afield experimentation 3alabile carbon 3amanure spreading 3amicrobial carbon 3apig manure 3apollution 3arisk 3asoil fertility 3atoxicology 3aChina1 aLi, Yuan1 aDu, Zhen,1 aWu, Yucheng1 aFu, Chuancheng1 aYang, Shuai1 aLuo, Yongming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2131-43430 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2022 Aug., v. 109, no. 2 p.304-309dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-022-03519-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03856naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245008100177300001800258520254000276592002802816650001602844650002402860650001502884650001702899650001502916650001202931650002102943650001102964650001602975650002202991650001403013650001503027650001103042650001003053650001603063651001603079700002603095700003503121700002203156700002003178700001503198773010903213856005503322852000903377655001203386IND50067131120221119074417.0130615e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006713112DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01100.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBUCKLEY, YVONNE M.10aSlowing down a pine invasion despite uncertainty in demography and dispersal  ap. 1020-1030.  a1 Management decisions regarding invasive plants often have to be made quickly and in the face of fragmentary knowledge of their population dynamics. However, recommendations are commonly made on the basis of only a restricted set of parameters. Without addressing uncertainty and variability in model parameters we risk ineffective management, resulting in wasted resources and an escalating problem if early chances to control spread are missed. 2 Using available data for Pinus nigra in ungrazed and grazed grassland and shrubland in New Zealand, we parameterized a stage‐structured spread model to calculate invasion wave speed, population growth rate and their sensitivities and elasticities to population parameters. Uncertainty distributions of parameters were used with the model to generate confidence intervals (CI) about the model predictions. 3 Ungrazed grassland environments were most vulnerable to invasion and the highest elasticities and sensitivities of invasion speed were to long‐distance dispersal parameters. However, there was overlap between the elasticity and sensitivity CI on juvenile survival, seedling establishment and long‐distance dispersal parameters, indicating overlap in their effects on invasion speed. 4 While elasticity of invasion speed to long‐distance dispersal was highest in shrubland environments, there was overlap with the CI of elasticity to juvenile survival. In shrubland invasion speed was most sensitive to the probability of establishment, especially when establishment was low. In the grazed environment elasticity and sensitivity of invasion speed to the severity of grazing were consistently highest. Management recommendations based on elasticities and sensitivities depend on the vulnerability of the habitat. 5 Synthesis and applications. Despite considerable uncertainty in demography and dispersal, robust management recommendations emerged from the model. Proportional or absolute reductions in long‐distance dispersal, juvenile survival and seedling establishment parameters have the potential to reduce wave speed substantially. Plantations of wind‐dispersed invasive conifers should not be sited on exposed sites vulnerable to long‐distance dispersal events, and trees in these sites should be removed. Invasion speed can also be reduced by removing seedlings, establishing competitive shrubs and grazing. Incorporating uncertainty into the modelling process increases our confidence in the wide applicability of the management strategies recommended here.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus nigra 3aconfidence interval 3ademography 3aelasticities 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3ainvasive species 3amodels 3aplantations 3apopulation growth 3aseedlings 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3atrees 3auncertainty 3aNew Zealand1 aBROCKERHOFF, ECKEHARD1 aLanger, E.

Pathogens are transmitted by mosquitoes feeding on the blood of an infected host and then feeding on a new host. Monitoring mosquito host-choice behaviour can help in many aspects of vector-borne disease control. Currently, it is possible to determine the host species and an individual human host from the blood meal of a mosquito by using genotyping to match the blood profile of local inhabitants. Epidemiological models generally assume that mosquito biting behaviour is random; however, numerous studies have shown that certain characteristics, e.g. genetic makeup and skin microbiota, make some individuals more attractive to mosquitoes than others. Analysing blood meals and illuminating host-choice behaviour will help re-evaluate and optimise disease transmission models. METHODS: We describe a new blood meal assay that identifies the sex of the person that a mosquito has bitten. The amelogenin locus (AMEL), a sex marker located on both X and Y chromosomes, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction in DNA extracted from blood-fed Aedes aegypti and Anopheles coluzzii. RESULTS: AMEL could be successfully amplified up to 24 h after a blood meal in 100% of An. coluzzii and 96.6% of Ae. aegypti, revealing the sex of humans that were fed on by individual mosquitoes. CONCLUSIONS: The method described here, developed using mosquitoes fed on volunteers, can be applied to field-caught mosquitoes to determine the host species and the biological sex of human hosts on which they have blood fed. Two important vector species were tested successfully in our laboratory experiments, demonstrating the potential of this technique to improve epidemiological models of vector-borne diseases. This viable and low-cost approach has the capacity to improve our understanding of vector-borne disease transmission, specifically gender differences in exposure and attractiveness to mosquitoes. The data gathered from field studies using our method can be used to shape new transmission models and aid in the implementation of more effective and targeted vector control strategies by enabling a better understanding of the drivers of vector-host interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aDNA 3ablood 3ablood meal 3adisease control 3adisease transmission 3agenotyping 3ahosts 3ahumans 3aloci 3amicroorganisms 3apolymerase chain reaction 3avector control1 aBouvaine, Sophie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0788-32431 aGibson, Gabriella1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3127-80271 aDyer, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2348-78701 aGuest, Jennifer1 aYoung, Stephen1 aHopkins, Richard J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4935-58250 tParasites & vectors.g2021 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.75-75dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04577-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006800152245011700220520111900337592002801456650001601484650001101500650002001511650002101531650001701552653003001569653002201599653003101621653002101652653003101673700007101704700002801775773009801803856008701901852000901988655001201997IND60782128320221120081847.0220824e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078212832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1194502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArnaoutakis, Georgios E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6977-152X10aDynamic modeling of combined concentrating solar tower and parabolic trough for increased day-to-day performance  aConcentrating solar power is an important technological option to gradually increase the share of energy produced by renewable energy sources. Central power towers and parabolic trough collectors, are currently the most mature technologies globally installed. While the former technology requires less land area to produce the same power output, the latter operates at lower temperatures thereby requiring less demanding materials. In this paper, we investigate by dynamic modeling the potential of both technologies in the same plant configuration. We find more stable day-to-day annual power profile for a configuration of a 29 MWe tower and 25 MWe of north–south oriented parabolic trough collectors compared to single technology plants. This results in a higher maximum capacity factor of 18% at 925 W/m2 direct normal irradiance and discounted payback of 9 years at a cost of electricity of 248 Euro/MWh compared to a standalone plant based on parabolic trough technology. In this way, the advantages of both concentrating technologies can be utilized and aid towards wider utilization of solar energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3alight intensity 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 0aConcentrating solar power 0aSolar power tower 0aParabolic trough collector 0aDynamic modeling 0aTechno-economic assessment1 aKatsaprakakis, Dimitris Al.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3874-66281 aChristakis, Dimitris G.0 tApplied energy.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 323 p.119450-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1194503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010600172300001300278520163500291592002801926650001201954650001501966650001501981650001101996650001102007650001002018650001902028653000902047653000702056653000902063653000702072653000902079653000602088653000902094653000902103653000702112653000902119653002002128653002102148653001302169653001802182653002202200773008702222856008502309852000902394655001202403IND60584929220221119215430.0180905e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058492922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fooweb.2017.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLane, Patricia A.12aA review of the trophic cascade concept using the lens of loop analysis: “The truth is the whole”  ap. 1-11.  aTrophic cascades have been assigned an exaggerated even mythic status by some ecologists, but they are only one type of pathway in a complicated food web. The human mind is drawn to patterns like the proverbial ‘moth to the flame’. The distinctive checkerboard pattern of alternating +−+−+ changes in populations on adjacent trophic levels in a trophic cascade is no exception. Unfortunately, this pattern has been too frequently equated with unrealistic ecological significance. Loop analysis, a qualitative network methodology, analyses all pathways and feedbacks in a food web simultaneously and it identifies many aspects of food web structure and function like trophic cascades, distinguishes operating from non-operating pathways, and predicts changes in standing crops and their correlation patterns. In this paper, the trophic relationships of food chains are expanded systematically into food web models that help illustrate some of the earliest claims about trophic cascades and their role in food webs. Several current definitions are contrasted to the loop analysis results. A more precise definition for a ‘top-down’ trophic cascade is proposed as well as the term ‘trophic escalade’ for particular types of ‘bottom-up’ trophic pathways that are also consistent with loop analysis. Suggestions for identifying trophic cascades are provided. Loop analysis, as an observing lens, provides an improved perspective on the role of trophic cascades. As Hegel claimed, “The truth is the whole”, and it cannot be found in an isolated part, in fact, the process of isolation precludes this possibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aecologists 3afood chain 3ahumans 3amodels 3amoths 3atrophic levels 0aATCH 0aEH 0aW(s) 0aWH 0aP(s) 0aA 0aI(s) 0aC(s) 0aDC 0aE(s) 0aTrophic cascade 0aTrophic escalade 0aFood web 0aLoop analysis 0aKeystone predator0 tFood webs.g2017 Dec., v. 13 p.1-11dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23213x2352-24967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fooweb.2017.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245011200177300001400289520084600303592002801149650001701177650002201194650001701216650001001233650001301243650001201256650002701268650001701295650000701312650003301319650001301352653001601365653001001381653000701391653001901398653003301417700003501450773009801485856008701583852000901670655001201679IND60629960020221121031501.0190402e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062996002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.1582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParra-Campos, Amanda10aNatural pigment extraction optimization from coffee exocarp and its use as a natural dye in French meringue  ap. 59-66.  aThis study aimed to optimize the pigment extraction process for coffee exocarp and to evaluate its coloring effect on French meringue.

In the United States, the surfclam stock area spans approximately 5° latitude in the northwest Atlantic. In recent years, surfclams at the southern end of this area have undergone changes in abundance, distribution, and growth, all likely due to increasing ocean temperature. To determine whether the periodicity or timing of annulus formation has also changed, shells from live surfclams were collected during every month of the year from three regions spanning 4° latitude: southern New England (northernmost), New Jersey (middle), and the Delmarva Peninsula (southernmost). Edge analysis and marginal increment analysis indicated a single annulus was formed each year in each region and by all age groups, verifying surfclams can still be aged reliably throughout the managed area. Some regional or agespecific variations were also noted. The model-derived peak times of annulus formation were mid-December for southern New England, late November for New Jersey, and early December for Delmarva. The youngest clams in New Jersey and Delmarva formed annuli about a month earlier than the older age classes. Shell lengths at age, estimated from chondrophore heights and fit to a von Bertalanffy growth model, indicated a latitudinal gradient in growth and asymptotic size. Surfclams grew slowest and to the smallest size in Delmarva [k = 0.217 (0.002 SE), L∞ = 153.0 (0.45 SE)] and fastest and to the largest size in southern New England [k = 0.298 (0.002 SE), L∞ = 162.0 (0.35 SE)]. Historic von Bertalanffy growth parameters, some unpublished, are also reviewed. There is some evidence of a decrease in k and L∞ since 1980, particularly in the New Jersey and Delmarva regions where fishing has been historically concentrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpisula solidissima 3aage structure 3aclams 3agrowth models 3alatitude 3aperiodicity 3awater temperature 3aNew England region 3aNew Jersey 3aNorthwest Atlantic 0aSpisula solidissima 0aannulus formation 0aage validation 0avon Bertalanffy model 0ageographic comparisons1 aMcbride, Richard S.1 aEmery, Sarah J.1 aRobillard, Eric0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2016 Dec., v. 35, no. 4 p.729-737dNational Shellfisheries AssociationwJournal:15036x0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.035.04023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245009900180520135500279592002801634650002501662650002001687650001401707650001501721650001101736650001501747653002001762653002201782653003101804653002401835653002601859700002701885700003301912700003401945700002101979700003102000700002902031700003202060700002702092773012202119856008102241852000902322655001202331IND60713042420221119030015.0220103e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071304242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1102302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Araújo, Fábio Fernandes10aGastrointestinal bioaccessibility and bioactivity of phenolic compounds from araçá-boi fruit  aIn this study, we evaluated for the first time the bioaccessibility and bioactivity of phenolic compounds present in fractions of araçá-boi submitted to the in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. For this, were determined the content of phenolics and total flavonoids, antioxidant capacity, as well as heatmap analysis to evaluate the relative intensity of the phenolic compounds identified by ESI-LTQ-XL-MS/MS, before and after digestive process. It was observed that the seed had the highest amount of total phenolic compounds, and that this content was reduced after digestion, mainly in the intestinal phase (-22.0%), while the flavonoid content increased in the edible fraction (92.8%). From the ESI-LTQXL-MS/MS analysis, it was possible to identify 9 flavonoids and 8 phenolic acids in the edible fraction, while in the seed 10 flavonoids and 7 phenolic acids were identified. Heatmap analysis demonstrated that after intestinal digestion, phenolic acids reduced and flavonoids increased their relative intensity, suggesting that these compounds increased their content after this process. The seed showed the highest antioxidant capacity and in general this potential increased after digestion. Thus, the bioaccessibility and bioactivity of the phenolic compounds of araçá-boi can be influenced by the fraction and digestive phase evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abioavailability 3adigestion 3aflavonoids 3afruits 3aintestines 0aAmazonian fruit 0aEugenia stipitata 0aGastrointestinal digestion 0aBioactive compounds 0aAntioxidant potential1 ade Paulo Farias, David1 aNeri-Numa, Iramaia Angélica1 aDias-Audibert, Flávia Luísa1 aDelafiori, Jeany1 ade Souza, Florisvaldo Gama1 aCatharino, Rodrigo Ramos1 ado Sacramento, Celio Kersul1 aPastore, Glaucia Maria0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Jan., v. 135 p.110230-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1102303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012300172300001400295520154100309592002801850650001501878650001501893650001501908650001101923650001401934653001101948653000701959653000701966653001101973653000701984653000801991653000701999653002002006653002102026653002102047653001802068653002202086653001202108773008802120856008502208852000902293655001202302IND60584929320221119215544.0180905e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058492932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fooweb.2017.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLane, Patricia A.10aAssumptions about trophic cascades: The inevitable collision between reductionist simplicity and ecological complexity  ap. 12-26.  aThe assumptions ecologists make both influence and constrain their conclusions. Too often these assumptions are not explored or validated rigorously enough. The purpose of this paper is to critically review seven trophic cascade assumptions frequently used in the current literature and to identify whether their conclusions are compatible with results from loop analysis. Assumptions center upon food web conceptualization, food chain to food web extrapolations, constancy of food webs, role of driving forces or parameter inputs, top-down versus bottom-up phenomena, associated dichotomies, and the notion of food web control by keystone predators and parameter inputs. Data-fitted marine loop models involving about 500 species show how complex, biologically-reasonable food webs are qualitatively different from food chains as well as simple intuitive food webs. Both supporting and opposing views of other authors are contrasted in regard to loop analysis results. This review concludes that the roles of trophic cascades are sometimes afforded an exaggerated importance using over-simplified reductionist logic especially in marine pelagic food webs. It would be useful if these seven assumptions could be similarly analysed using other modelling methodologies to determine a more realistic role for trophic cascades and to facilitate consensus among ecologists. It would also be worthwhile to construct data-fitted loop models for more types of ecosystems. Regardless, biological reality should not be sacrificed for convenience.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecologists 3aecosystems 3afood chain 3amodels 3apredators 0aES (s) 0aKP 0aLA 0aPI (s) 0aTC 0aTCC 0aTE 0aTrophic cascade 0aTrophic escalade 0aMarine food webs 0aLoop analysis 0aKeystone predator 0aControl0 tFood webs.g2017 Dec., v. 13 p.12-26dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23213x2352-24967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fooweb.2017.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001600162245013800178300001800316520136800334592002801702650001301730650001501743650001601758650001401774650001701788650001801805650001001823650001701833650002101850650002201871650002401893650001201917650002101929650002301950650002601973650001101999650003802010650005702048650002802105650003102133700001702164700001602181773009902197856007702296852000902373655001202382IND60083414720221120171340.0141101e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008341472DNAL7 a228184742pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2012-54202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlley, M.L.10aShort communication: Evaluation of serum immunoglobulin G concentrations using an automated turbidimetric immunoassay in dairy calves  ap. 4596-4599.  aThe absorption of maternal antibodies associated with colostrum feeding is critical to the health of calves. Multiple assays have been described to assess serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations in calves. However, none are ideal for routine use on farms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of a new commercially available immunoassay and portable analyzer for measuring serum IgG concentrations in dairy calves. Serum from 100 Holstein calves that had received colostrum was collected for this study. Immunoglobulin G concentrations were run on each calf using both the rapid immunoassay method and radial immunodiffusion assay. Serum IgG concentrations in calves from this study ranged from 460 to 3,640mg/dL (mean ± SD: 1,515±71) as measured by radial immunodiffusion and 402 to 3,586mg/dL (mean 1,473±70) as measured by the immunoassay. Based on regression analysis, the automated results closely paralleled those obtained by radial immunodiffusion with a coefficient of determination value of 0.98. Based on the results of this study, the immunoassay technique using the portable analyzer represents a reliable method that can be run within 15min and provide an accurate serum IgG level. Although the cost is not insignificant, this assay could be easily implemented on a dairy farm to help monitor transfer of passive immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aabsorption 3ablood serum 3acolostrum 3adairy calves 3adairy farming 3afarms 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amaternal immunity 3aregression analysis 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aCattleximmunology 2aColostrumximmunology 2aFemale 2aImmunization, Passivexveterinary 2aImmunoassayxinstrumentationxstandardsxveterinary. 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aReproducibility of Results1 aHaines, D.M.1 aSmith, G.W.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Aug., v. 95, no. 8 p.4596-4599dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-54203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245011400162300001600276520129100292592002801583650001101611650002901622650001301651650001201664650001001676650001401686650001401700650002301714650001201737650002301749651001801772653002101790653002501811653002901836653001601865700001801881700002001899700002101919700002401940773013901964856007602103852000902179655001202188IND60594693320221116171656.0180522e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059469332DNAL7 a10.2983/035.035.04032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVázquez, Nuria10aMass Mortalities Affecting Populations of the Yellow Clam Amarilladesma mactroides Along Its Geographic Range  ap. 739-745.  aThe yellow clam Amarilladesma mactroides (Deshayes, 1854) is considered a vulnerable species since the mid-1990s. Populations have experienced mass mortalities throughout their entire range of distribution (23–41°S) along exposed sandy beaches of Atlantic South America. Detrimental anthropogenic impacts have further contributed to failure of populations to make a recovery. To determine the factors involved in these events, density prior to a mortality event was calculated and live yellow clams encompassingmost of its geographic range distribution were analyzed histologically to describe parasites and pathologies. Moreover, moribund specimens were analyzed by molecular techniques to test for the presence of the virus OsHV-1. A mortality event was recorded after a maximum density of 127 clams/m² was attained. No clear pattern was found between the prevalence and intensity of infection and localities, mortality events, or sampling season. Although OsHV-1 was not observed in any of the yellow clams tested, the possibility that another viral agent was implicated cannot be ruled out. The presence of bacteria of the genus Vibrio in combination with stress caused by a relatively high population density is suggested as the likely cause of these episodic mass mortalities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio 3aanthropogenic activities 3abacteria 3abeaches 3aclams 3amortality 3aparasites 3apopulation density 3aviruses 3avulnerable species 3aSouth America 0amass mortalities 0aviral susceptibility 0aAmarilladesma mactroides 0apathologies1 aFiori, Sandra1 aArzul, Isabelle1 aCarcedo, Cecilia1 aCremonte, Florencia0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2016 Dec., v. 35, no. 4 p.739-745dNational Shellfisheries AssociationwJournal:15036x0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.035.04033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010100166300001600267520147800283592002801761650001501789650001301804650002401817650001301841650001101854650001301865650001101878650001501889650001701904650001601921653002001937653002801957653001201985653001501997700001602012700001702028700001902045773012502064856008302189852000902272655001202281IND60609474120221120035815.0190628e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060947412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.07.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaomei10a4-Vinylpyridine-modified post-cross-linked resins and their adsorption of phenol and Rhodamine B  ap. 394-403.  aHerein 4-vinylpyridine (4-VP) was employed as the functional monomer to copolymerize with divinylbenzene using 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) as the porogen, and a series of 4-vinylpyridine-modified post-cross-linked resins was fabricated. The effect of 4-VP and DCE percentage on the porosity, polarity, and adsorption was investigated in detail. The results indicate that the porosity and nitrogen (N) content of the as-prepared resins can be easily regulated by changing the 4-VP and DCE percentage. Specifically, HPDN-10%-300% with 10 wt% 4-VP and 300 wt% DCE has the highest specific surface area (SBET) and pore volume (Vtotal), while HPDN-10%-100% with 100 wt% DCE has the greatest micropore area (Smicro) and micropore volume (Vmicro). Furthermore, the equilibrium adsorption experiments of the resins exhibit that the adsorption of phenol on HPDN-10%-100% is the most efficient by reason of its greatest Smicro and Vmicro, whereas HPDN-10%-300% owns the largest equilibrium capacity to Rhodamine B (RB) because of its highest SBET, Vtotal, and broad pore size distribution (PSD). The kinetic adsorption reveal that HPDN-10%-100% needs the least time to reach equilibrium for the adsorption of phenol while the adsorption of RB on HPDN-10%-300% is the fastest. The temperature is disadvantageous for the adsorption and the isosteric enthalpy at zero fractional loading is predicted to be −40.39 and −56.38 kJ/mol for phenol and RB on the resins, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aenthalpy 3aethylene dichloride 3anitrogen 3aphenol 3aporosity 3aresins 3arhodamines 3asurface area 3atemperature 0a4-Vinylpyridine 0aPost-cross-linked resin 0aPorogen 0aAdsorption1 aZhang, Ting1 aWang, Xiaoyi1 aHuang, Jianhan0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 531 p.394-403dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.07.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245011000160300001600270520160000286592002801886650002601914650001301940650001901953650001101972650001601983650001701999650001102016650001202027650002502039650001302064650001002077650001102087650001202098650001002110650001302120650001802133650002502151650001802176650001502194650001302209651002302222651003202245651001802277653002102295653002402316653002602340653001202366653002202378653001202400653002602412700002302438773012302461856007402584852000902658655001202667IND60131552820221118225303.0151127e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013155282DNAL7 a10.1676/13-114.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAldinger, Kyle R.10aReproductive success and habitat characteristics of Golden-winged Warblers in high-elevation pasturelands  ap. 279-287.  aThe Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) is one of the most rapidly declining vertebrate species in the Appalachian Mountains. It is the subject of extensive range-wide research and conservation action. However, little is known about this species' breeding ecology in high-elevation pasturelands, a breeding habitat with conservation potential considering the U.S. Natural Resource Conservation Service's Working Lands for Wildlife program targeting private lands in the Appalachian Mountains. We located 100 nests of Golden-winged Warblers in pastures in and around the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia during 2008–2012. Daily nest survival rate (mean ± SE = 0.962 ± 0.006), clutch size (4.5 ± 0.1), and number of young fledged per nest attempt (2.0 ± 0.2) and successful nest (4.0 ± 0.1) fell within the range of values reported in other parts of the species' range and were not significantly affected by year or the presence/absence of cattle grazing. Classification tree analysis revealed that nests were in denser vegetation (≥52%) and closer to forest edges (<36.0 m) and shrubs (<7.0 cm) than random locations within the male's territory. Successful nests had significantly more woody cover (≥9%) within 1 m than failed nests. Our results suggest that cattle grazing at 1.2–2.4 ha of forage/animal unit with periodic mowing can create and maintain these characteristics without interfering with the nesting of Golden-winged Warblers. High-elevation pasturelands may provide a refuge for remaining populations of Golden-winged Warblers in this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVermivora chrysoptera 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3acattle 3aclutch size 3aedge effects 3aforage 3agrazing 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3amales 3amowing 3anesting 3anests 3apastures 3aprivate lands 3areproductive success 3asurvival rate 3avegetation 3awildlife 3aAppalachian region 3aMonongahela National Forest 3aWest Virginia 0abreeding habitat 0aclassification tree 0aGolden-winged Warbler 0agrazing 0ahabitat selection 0apasture 0aVermivora chrysoptera1 aWood, Petra Bohall0 tWilson journal of ornithology.g2014 June, v. 126, no. 2 p.279-287dThe Wilson Ornithological Societyx1559-44917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F13-114.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011600164300001600280520099600296592002801292650001201320650001601332650001801348650002201366650001601388650001601404650001901420650001501439650000701454650001901461650001901480650002101499653003101520653002801551653002201579653001601601653003101617700001401648700002901662700001801691773012501709856008301834852000901917655001201926IND60609474220221120035724.0190628e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060947422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.07.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Hongmei10aTime-dependent synthesis of BiO2−x/Bi composites with efficient visible-light induced photocatalytic activity  ap. 311-319.  aA series of BiO2−x/Bi nanocomposites were prepared via a time-dependent aqueous method, with the induction of lactic acid.

This probabilistic forecasting model, which uses diffuse irradiance measurements and cloud cover information as exogenous feature inputs, adaptively provides arbitrary PDF forecasts for different weather conditions. The proposed models have been quantitatively evaluated using data from different locations characterized by different climates (continental, coastal, and island). The performance of the forecasts is quantified using metrics such as Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP), Prediction Interval Normalized Averaged Width (PINAW), Brier Skill Score (BSS), and the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), and other standard error metrics. A persistence ensemble probabilistic forecasting model and a Gaussian probabilistic forecasting model are employed to benchmark the performance of the proposed kNN ensemble model. The results show that the proposed model significantly outperform both reference models in terms of all evaluation metrics for all locations when the forecast horizon is greater than 5-min. In addition, the proposed model shows superior performance in predicting DNI ramps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acloud cover 3alight intensity 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprobability 3aprobability distribution 3arenewable energy sources 0aSolar forecasting 0ak Nearest neighbor 0aProbabilistic forecast 0aDirect Normal Irradiance 0aEnsemble predictions1 aCoimbra, Carlos F.M.0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Feb., v. 101 p.526-536dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245014500155300001600300500002000316520124200336592002801578596010301606596004101709650001401750650001301764650002201777650002301799650002201822650000901844650001101853650001101864650001301875651001701888700001701905700001801922700002101940700001401961773012201975856007402097852000902171655001202180IND60786968120221119091258.0220807e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078696812DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.131582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGračan, R.10aFeeding ecology and trophic segregation of two sympatric mesopredatory sharks in the heavily exploited coastal ecosystem of the Adriatic Sea  ap. 167-184.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe ecological roles and trophic interactions of two commercially important mesopredatory shark species, Squalus acanthias and Mustelus punctulatus that co‐occur on the continental shelf of the north‐central Adriatic Sea were investigated. Both shark species are dietary specialists, with a significant dietary overlap recorded only during the spring season. They showed different patterns of feeding as they grew: S. acanthias extended its trophic niche with an increase in size, while M. punctulatus developed a more specialized diet. These two sharks partition food resources and reduce niche overlap by foraging at different trophic levels. Mustelus punctulatus is a crustacean feeder, specialized in foraging on scavenging malacostracans frequently found along trawl tracks or on discards in the Adriatic fishing zone. Conversely, S. acanthias prefers small pelagic fishes, which are commercially exploited and in decline. The different foraging strategies adopted by these two species suggest that they should be managed separately. Dietary specialization, direct competition with humans for prey and their higher intrinsic vulnerability make S. acanthias particularly susceptible to the effects of anthropogenic perturbations.  aPublisher supplied data  a119‐1193080‐3171 and 183‐1193080‐0831cMinistry of Science, Education and Sport of Croatia  aP1‐0386cSlovenian Research Agency 3aCrustacea 3aMustelus 3aSqualus acanthias 3acoastal ecosystems 3acontinental shelf 3adiet 3asharks 3aspring 3asympatry 3aAdriatic Sea1 aZavodnik, D.1 aKrstinić, P.1 aDragičević, B.1 aLazar, B.0 tJournal of fish biology.g2017 Jan., v. 90, no. 1 p.167-184dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:13582x0022-11127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.131583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245011100169300002000280500001900300520158100319592002801900650001701928650002001945650001201965650001301977650001301990650001202003650001702015650002302032650001302055650001602068650001402084700001902098700006002117773013802177856008002315852000902395655001202404IND60741767720221120050103.0210618e20210604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074176772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c030312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJharimune, Suprita10aSolvent-Dependent Impact of Spectator Anions on the Thermodynamics of Cation Exchange in CdSe Nanocrystals  ap. 12792-12801.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCation exchange reactions in nanoparticles are widely used to synthesize nanostructures that cannot be synthesized via direct colloidal synthesis approaches. Cation exchange in chalcogenide nanocrystals has been utilized to produce a massive library of derivative nanostructures. Understanding the thermodynamic feasibility of these reactions is often based on qualitative considerations (i.e., Pearson’s acid–base theory). In our previous publication [Jharimune, S.; Nano Lett.2018, 18 (11), 6795−6803], we demonstrated isothermal titration (ITC) is a robust method to quantify the thermodynamics of cation-exchange reactions in nanocrystals and examined the influence of nanocrystal diameter, identity of capping ligands, and temperature. We extend the use of ITC to study the influence of anions accompanying the foreign cation, solvents, and foreign cation identity on the thermodynamics of cation-exchange reaction in CdSe nanocrystals. Results indicate a strong correlation between the identity of the anion and the apparent enthalpy of the reaction, whereby harder anions favor the cation exchange reaction of CdSe with Ag⁺ salts in acetonitrile. When an identical exchange is conducted in a harder solvent, water, the strong impact of anions on the thermodynamics of cation exchange disappears. We examined the exchange of CdSe nanocrystals with Cu²⁺ that has a comparable hardness to the parent cation (Cd²⁺). This study probes the impact and interplay of solvent and accompanying anion with exchanging cation on energetics in cation-exchange reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3acation exchange 3acations 3aenthalpy 3ahardness 3aligands 3ananocrystals 3aphysical chemistry 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atitration1 aSathe, Ajay A.1 aRioux, Robert M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6019-00320 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 June 04, v. 125, no. 23 p.12792-12801dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c030313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012800154300002000282520138900302592002801691650002301719650002201742650003701764650002201801650001701823650000901840650001801849650001901867650001901886650001501905650003301920650003701953650001901990700001502009700001702024700001702041700001802058700001302076773012302089856007402212852000902286655001202295IND60667576720221119222423.0190919e20150527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066757672DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra06394a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Yi10aIon exchange synthesis of an all tungsten based Z-scheme photocatalytic system with highly enhanced photocatalytic activity  ap. 46897-46903.  aThe first example of an all tungsten based Z-scheme photocatalyst (composed of WO₃·0.33H₂O and PbWO₄) has been synthesized via an ion exchange method. The composites exhibit much higher photocatalytic activities than those of individual hydrated tungsten trioxide and lead tungstate. The apparent photodegradation rate constants of RhB over the composites are more than 6 to 8 times higher than those of the two monomer components. After 30 min, the RhB can be removed almost completely by the composite, while only 30% RhB and 35% RhB can be, respectively, eliminated for the two single components. In addition, the composite photocatalyst displays excellent activity in the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO). The relationship between the two monomer components has been investigated using XRD, Raman, XPS, SEM, and TEM measurements. The hydrated tungsten trioxide is formed on the surface of lead tungstate via a complex process that includes ion exchange and crystal structure rearrangement. Ion exchange occurs at the end of the (110) facet of lead tungstate. The results of photocatalytic mechanism and photodeposition Pt experiments indicate that the excellent photocatalytic activity of the composite photocatalyst is due to the advantage of its Z-scheme configuration. This study suggests that highly effective Z-scheme photocatalysts can be built by ion exchange.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acrystal structure 3aion exchange 3alead 3amethyl orange 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atungsten oxide1 aChen, Gang1 aYu, Yaoguang1 aSun, Jingxue1 aZhou, Yansong1 aHe, Fang0 tRSC advances.g2015 May 27, v. 5, no. 58 p.46897-46903dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra06394a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245006800158300001600226520184400242592002802086650001902114650003002133650001002163650001202173650001002185650001102195650001102206650001602217650001302233651000902246653001602255653002402271653000902295653001902304653001702323773012302340856007402463852000902537655001202546IND60131553320221118225214.0151127e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013155332DNAL7 a10.1676/13-140.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSordahl, Tex A.10aDistribution of color-morphs of the Eastern Screech-Owl in Iowa  ap. 321-332.  aThe distinct rufous and gray color-morphs of the Eastern Screech-Owl (Megascops asio) have long intrigued ornithologists. Eastern Screech-Owls range across the eastern half of the United States, where the morph ratio varies from >70% rufous birds in the center of the range to <30% rufous at the periphery. Although the adaptive significance of polymorphism is, in general, poorly understood, careful mapping of the morph-frequency and determination of ratio clines is a first step toward understanding this phenomenon. In this paper, I examine the distribution of Eastern Screech-Owl color-morphs in Iowa, which lies in the northwestern part of the species' range. I collected 519 records of Iowa screech-owls from museum curators, wildlife rehabilitators, bird-banders, and bird watchers. For all records combined, 41.0% were rufous morphs, 55.7% were gray morphs, and 3.3% were intermediates. For all birds of known sex, 44.7% (21/47) of males and 57.6% (34/59) of females were rufous; the difference was not statistically significant, but the results are consistent with a trend in other studies suggesting that females are more likely than males to be rufous. The percentage of rufous screech-owls increased clinally from west to east across Iowa, but did not change from north to south. Because annual precipitation exhibits a longitudinal pattern in Iowa and annual temperature exhibits a latitudinal pattern, this suggests that the morph ratio pattern in Iowa is influenced more by precipitation than by temperature. Based on records dating 1880–2003, the percentage of rufous birds decreased from the early to later decades of the 20th century. The range-wide distribution of morph ratio clines fits a model where rufous morphs are better-adapted at the center of the range but gray morphs are selected for toward the periphery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMegascops asio 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abirds 3afemales 3amales 3amodels 3amorphs 3atemperature 3awildlife 3aIowa 0acolor morph 0aEastern Screech-Owl 0aIowa 0aMegascops asio 0apolymorphism0 tWilson journal of ornithology.g2014 June, v. 126, no. 2 p.321-332dThe Wilson Ornithological Societyx1559-44917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F13-140.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245006700165520089100232592002801123650001701151650001901168650002101187650002101208650000901229650003201238650002001270650002301290650001101313650001601324650001101340650002601351650002201377650001301399650002101412653001901433653000901452653001001461653001401471653001701485700001801502700001801520700001501538700001801553700001401571700001701585700001601602700005201618773010001670856008701770852000901857655001201866IND60696279320221120090757.0200614e20201030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069627932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1271212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yang10aDetoxification of aflatoxin B1 in corn by chlorine dioxide gas  aChlorine dioxide (ClO₂) gas was utilized for detoxifying aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) in corn for the first time. Four degradation compounds were identified by LC–MS as C₁₇H₁₃O₈, C₁₇H₁₅O₁₀, C₁₆H₁₅O₁₀, and C₁₅H₁₁O₈. Structurally, the biological activity of ClO₂-treated AFB₁ was removed due to the disappearance of C8-C9 double bond in the furan ring and the modification of cyclopentanone and methoxy after ClO₂ treatment. The cell viability assay on human embryo hepatocytes confirmed little toxicity of the degradation products. The degradation efficiency of AFB₁ on corn peaked near 90.0% under the optimized conditions and reached 79.6% for low initial contamination of AFB₁ at 5–20 μg/kg. Accordingly, ClO₂ has the potential to be developed into an effective, efficient, and economic approach to detoxify AFB₁ in grains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxin B1 3acell viability 3achemical bonding 3achlorine dioxide 3acorn 3adetoxification (processing) 3aembryo (animal) 3afood contamination 3afurans 3ahepatocytes 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3atoxicity 3aviability assays 0aDetoxification 0aClO2 0aLC-MS 0aMechanism 0aCytotoxicity1 aShi, Jianyang1 aXie, Bingying1 aHe, Yutong1 aQin, Yongping1 aWang, Dan1 aShi, Haichun1 aKe, Yongpei1 aSun, Qun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4372-88650 tFood chemistry.g2020 Oct. 30, v. 328 p.127121-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1271213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008400166300001600250520088200266592002801148650001101176650001901187650002401206650001301230650001901243650001901262650001501281650001501296650001701311653001001328653001501338653001201353653001801365700001201383700001701395700005201412773012501464856008301589852000901672655001201681IND60609474720221120035722.0190628e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060947472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.07.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhendong10aPhosphorus-doped cerium vanadate nanorods with enhanced photocatalytic activity  ap. 618-627.  aCeVO4-based photocatalysts have been actively studied, but to the best of our knowledge, P-doped CeVO4 with enhanced photocatalytic activity has not been reported. Herein, novel P-doped CeVO4 nanorods were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. The doped P exists as PO4 tetrahedron which replaces VO4 tetrahedron. The crystal size, specific surface area, and light absorption ability of CeVO4 were tuned after doping CeVO4 by P. In particular, the separation and transmission efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs were improved due to the internal electric field caused by the large charge density around PO4 tetrahedron. This conclusion was also confirmed by DFT calculations. The photocatalytic activities of different samples were tested via photodegradation of aqueous organic pollutants, and a feasible mechanism of photocatalytic reaction was proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acerium 3aelectric field 3ahot water treatment 3ananorods 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3apollutants 3asurface area 0aCeVO4 0aPhosphorus 0aNanorod 0aPhotocatalyst1 aSun, Ke1 aWei, Mingzhi1 aMa, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2391-49430 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 531 p.618-627dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.07.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245012000154300001600274500002000290520133000310592002801640596008501668650001401753650001501767650001001782650000901792650002401801650001201825650002001837650002001857650002601877700001801903700001501921700001601936773012201952856007402074852000902148655001202157IND60786968320221119091130.0220807e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078696832DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.131702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, C.

All of the NSPCs expressed brain lipid‐binding protein, dopamine‐ and cAMP‐regulated neuronal phosphoprotein 32 (DARPP‐32), oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2, paired box 6 and sex determining region Y‐box 2. The intensity and localisation of these proteins, however, varied among the different NSPCs. Despite being intermediate cells, NSPCs can be divided into radial glial cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) and neuroblasts by expressing the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), OPC marker A2B5 and neuronal markers, including acetyl‐tubulin, βIII‐tubulin, microtubule‐associated protein 2 and neurofilament protein. Nevertheless, astrocytes were polymorphic and were the most dominant cells in the NSPC cultures. By using Matrigel, radial glia exhibiting a long GFAP⁺ or DARPP‐32⁺ fibre and neurons exhibiting a significant acetyl‐tubulin⁺ process were obtained. The results confirmed that NSPCs obtained from A. rivulatus brains can proliferate and differentiate into neurons in vitro. Clonal culture can be useful for further studying the distinct NSPCs.  aPublisher supplied data  aNSC 99‐2313‐B‐390‐001cNational Science Council of the Republic of China 3aAequidens 3aastrocytes 3abrain 3afish 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aneurons 3aoligodendroglia 3aphosphoproteins 3atranscription factors1 aChen, Marcia,1 aNan, F.

As the main mechanism of many cytostatic drugs is based on their cytotoxic activity, there is potential for the toxicity of hellebore to be used in anticancer therapy. This study tested the geno- and cytotoxic effects of extracts of three hellebore taxa (H elleborus odorus , H elleborus multifidus and H elleborus hercegovinus) on meristemic onion (Allium cepa L.) cells and human lymphocytes. Treatments with Helleborus extracts induced cytotoxic and cytostatic effects in meristemic onion cells as well as in cultivated cytokinesis-blocked human lymphocytes. Cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay indicated that treatments with hellebore extracts induce genotoxic effects in human lymphocytes, and that the significant mechanism of their antiproliferative activity is apoptosis induction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aHelleborus 3aapoptosis 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3agenotoxicity 3ahumans 3alymphocytes 3aonions 3atherapeutics 3atraditional medicine 0acytotoxic activity 0agenotoxic activity 0acytostatic activity 0aHelleborus 0amitotic index 0anuclear division index1 aHaverić, Anja1 aHaverić, Sanin1 aMaksimović, Milka1 aParić, Adisa0 tNatural product research.g2014 June 18, v. 28, no. 12 p.883-887dTaylor & Francisx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2014.8891353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03756naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245017800211300001600389520210400405592002802509650002502537650001202562650001302574650001102587650001602598650001402614650000902628650002002637650001402657650002102671650003402692650002702726650001102753650001402764650001402778650002102792653002902813653002602842653003002868653002102898653001202919653002902931700002102960700002102981700002003002773011903022856008803141852000903229655001203238IND60649457920221116222848.0200509e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064945792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.4502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yingying,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8975-948010aRemoval of pharmaceutical compounds, artificial sweeteners, and perfluoroalkyl substances from water using a passive treatment system containing zero-valent iron and biochar  ap. 165-177.  aEmerging contaminants are widely detected and persistent in environmental waters. Advanced oxidation processes are among the most effective methods for removing emerging contaminants from water; however, high energy consumption greatly increases the operating costs and limits large-scale applications. In this study, a passive treatment system consisting of four columns packed with mixtures of silica sand, zero-valent iron (ZVI), biochar (BC), and a mixture of (ZVI + BC) were evaluated for simultaneous removal of eight pharmaceuticals, four artificial sweeteners, and two perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) from water. Overall, the passive treatment system was more effective for removing target pharmaceuticals (almost complete removal) than artificial sweeteners and PFASs (partial removal). Columns ZVI, BC, and (ZVI + BC) exhibited similarly effective removal (>97%) of target pharmaceuticals, including carbamazepine, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and naproxen, from ~9 to <0.25 μg L⁻¹; pharmaceuticals were more rapidly removed by Columns ZVI and (ZVI + BC) than Column BC, except for ibuprofen. Column ZVI was more effective for removing artificial sweeteners acesulfame-K and sucralose than Columns BC and (ZVI + BC); however, BC exhibited relatively greater removal of saccharin than ZVI and (ZVI + BC). Acesulfame-K and saccharin (~110 μg L⁻¹) were partially removed in the treatment columns. Cyclamate was not removed in any of the columns. However, >76% of input sucralose (~110 μg L⁻¹) was removed in the three treatment columns. Reactive medium BC alone was more effective for removing target PFASs than ZVI and (ZVI + BC). Input perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (~45 μg L⁻¹) was partially removed in the columns containing BC but not ZVI alone. Between 10 and 80% of input perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (24 ̶ 90 μg L⁻¹) was removed in Column ZVI; greater removals (57 ̶ 99%) were observed in Columns BC and (ZVI + BC).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacesulfame potassium 3abiochar 3acaffeine 3aenergy 3agemfibrozil 3aibuprofen 3airon 3aoperating costs 3aoxidation 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3aquartz 3asaccharin 3asucralose 3asulfamethoxazole 0aPharmaceutical compounds 0aArtificial sweeteners 0aPerfluoroalkyl substances 0aZero-valent iron 0aBiochar 0aPassive treatment system1 aBlowes, David W.1 aPtacek, Carol J.1 aGroza, Laura G.0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 691 p.165-177dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.4503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245012200208300001600330520140000346592002801746650001701774650002001791650001101811650003001822650001901852650001601871650003301887650002501920650001301945650002101958650002101979650001702000650002002017651001202037653002402049653002102073653003602094653003302130653001902163700001702182700001702199773009702216856008502313852000902398655001202407IND60581251820221119222318.0180831e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058125182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2016.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkinyele, D.O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8158-192110aLife cycle impact assessment of photovoltaic power generation from crystalline silicon-based solar modules in Nigeria  ap. 537-549.  aThis paper evaluates the life cycle impact (LCI) of a 1.5 kW solar photovoltaic (PV) system. The LCI is examined in terms of the life cycle emission rate (LCER), global warming potential (GWP), cumulative energy demand (CED), energy payback time (EPT) and net energy ratio (NER), using six different locations - one from each of Nigeria's six geo-political zones as case studies. With a performance ratio of 80%, lifetime of 20–30 years, module efficiency of 15.4%, solar irradiation of 1493–2223 kWh/m²/yr, LCER of 37.3–72.2 g CO2/kWh and CED of 3800–8700 MJ eq., the GWP, EPT and NER values of 1907–5819 kg CO2-eq., 0.83–2.3 years and 7.08–36.17, respectively, are obtained. The significance of these results is that the lowest GWP and EPT, i.e. 1907 kg CO2-eq. and 0.83 years, are obtained for the location with the highest solar irradiation, while the highest values, i.e. 5819 kg CO2-eq. and 2.3 years, are obtained for the location with the lowest irradiation. Furthermore, the highest NER is obtained for the location with the highest irradiation while the lowest value has been obtained for the location having the lowest irradiation.

A relatively larger-surface area carbon nitride consisting of thin nanosheets is synthesized, firstly adopting melamine (M), cyanuric acid (C), urea (U) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the starting materials to form the supramolecular carbon nitride MCU(DMSO)-C3N4. Physical, chemical, and optical properties of the resulting samples were characterized. The photocatalytic performance of the MCU(DMSO)-C3N4 was evaluated under visible light irradiation using rhodamine B (RhB), tetracycline hydrochloride (TC), and ciprofloxacin (CIP) as target pollutants. Results showed that MCU-C3N4 exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity than pure g-C3N4, and when M, C, and U in DMSO with certain molar ratio (1:1:1) exhibited the highest activity. The larger surface area with more active reaction sites, increased bandgap with stronger REDOX ability, and higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs contributed to higher photocatalytic activity. The photo-degradation is dominant by the active species (h+ and O2−) and converted product (OH). This exploration of MCU(DMSO)-C3N4 may open a window to the design of low-cost and highly efficient photocatalysis degradation systems for various wastewater treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nitride 3aciprofloxacin 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3airradiation 3amechanism of action 3amelamine 3ananosheets 3aoptical properties 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3apollutants 3aremediation 3arhodamines 3asuperoxide anion 3asurface area 3atetracycline 3aurea 3awastewater treatment 0aMetal-free 0aDimethyl sulfoxide 0aPhotocatalysis 0aWastewater treatments 0aCharge separation1 aHuang, Jinhui1 aZeng, Guangming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4230-76471 aCheng, Wenjian1 aYu, Hanbo1 aKu, Yenlin,1 aShi, Lixiu1 aYi, Kaixin0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 531 p.433-443dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.07.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001600158245010100174300001600275500001500291520133500306592002801641650002501669650001601694650001501710650001101725650001101736650002401747650001001771650002701781650002001808650001401828650003701842650003801879650006101917650003901978650001802017650003302035650002902068650002202097650002402119650002802143650005602171650005702227650003102284650003302315650001402348653002002362700001202382700001602394700001502410700001902425700001902444700001702463773009102480856007302571852000902644655001202653IND50089984120221120073204.0150206e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008998412DNAL7 a246841682pmid7 a10.1111/nph.127762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Fangwei14aThe TOR signaling pathway regulates vegetative development and virulence in Fusarium graminearum  ap. 219-232.  a2019-12-05  aThe target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway plays critical roles in controlling cell growth in a variety of eukaryotes. However, the contribution of this pathway in regulating virulence of plant pathogenic fungi is unknown. We identified and characterized nine genes encoding components of the TOR pathway in Fusarium graminearum. Biological, genetic and biochemical functions of each component were investigated. The FgFkbp12‐rapamycin complex binds to the FgTor kinase. The type 2A phosphatases FgPp2A, FgSit4 and FgPpg1 were found to interact with FgTap42, a downstream component of FgTor. Among these, we determined that FgPp2A is likely to be essential for F. graminearum survival, and FgSit4 and FgPpg1 play important roles in cell wall integrity by positively regulating the phosphorylation of FgMgv1, a key MAP kinase in the cell wall integrity pathway. In addition, the FgPpg1 interacting protein, FgTip41, is involved in regulating mycelial growth and virulence. Notably, FgTip41 does not interact with FgTap42 but with FgPpg1, suggesting the existence of FgTap42:FgPpg1:FgTip41 heterotrimer in F. graminearum, a complex not observed in the yeast model. Collectively, we defined a genetic regulatory framework that elucidates how the TOR pathway regulates virulence and vegetative development in F. graminearum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium graminearum 3acell growth 3acell walls 3ayeasts 3amodels 3asignal transduction 3agenes 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aphosphorylation 3avirulence 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 2aDrug Resistance, Fungalxgenetics 2aFusariumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 2aSequence Deletion 2aSignal Transduction 2aSirolimusxpharmacology 2aTOR Serine-Threonine Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTacrolimus Binding Protein 1Axgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTrichothecenesxmetabolism 2aTwo-Hybrid System Techniques 2aVirulence 0aGibberella zeae1 aGu, Qin1 aYun, Yingzi1 aYin, Yanni1 aXu, Jin‐Rong1 aShim, Won‐Bo1 aMa, Zhonghua0 tnew phytologist.g2014 July, v. 203, no. 1 p.219-232dAcademic Press.x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.127763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245013000160300001600290520114400306592002801450650002201478650001101500650001501511650002501526653001101551653002201562653001501584653002701599653002301626700001501649700002801664773013901692856007601831852000901907655001201916IND60594694120221116171646.0180522e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059469412DNAL7 a10.2983/035.035.04112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, Olivia10aComparison of Two External Tagging Methods Used for the Identification of Individual Adult Pacific Oysters, Crassostrea gigas  ap. 837-840.  aTagging methods used in bivalve research can be broadly categorized into two groups: internal and external. External tagging methods are more commonly used; however, the legibility of external tags tends to decline over time, and tag recovery rates are often low due to the abrasion or biofouling of shells, particularly during long-term studies. The aim of the current study was to compare two external identification methods placed on or in the shells of adult Crassostrea gigas: (1) a plasticlaminated glue-on tag and (2) novel use of a t-bar anchor tag inserted into the upper shell, to determine the optimal methodology to use in longitudinal studies of greater than 1-y duration. Over a 15-mo period, 100% of glue-on numbered tags were lost or became overgrown and could not be read, whereas 91.5% of t-bar anchor tags were retained and remained legible. The results of this study suggest that t-bar anchor tags are a better choice for long-term longitudinal studies of adult C. gigas in temperate marine conditions than plastic-laminated labels glued to the exterior of the shell. These findings may be applicable to other bivalves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aadults 3abiofouling 3alongitudinal studies 0aoyster 0aCrassostrea gigas 0at-bar tags 0aglue-on laminated tags 0alongitudinal study1 aHick, Paul1 aWhittington, Richard J.0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2016 Dec., v. 35, no. 4 p.837-840dNational Shellfisheries AssociationwJournal:15036x0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.035.04113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03874naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245006500167300001600232520249600248592002802744650001502772650000802787650001802795650001402813650002002827650001902847650001702866650001602883650001502899650002202914650002202936650002002958650001902978651001002997653002703007653002303034653002203057653001803079653004103097653001003138700002503148700002003173773010503193856008503298852000903383655001203392IND60611488820221120035121.0201118e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061148882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2018.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Ruiqiao12aA review on health cost accounting of air pollution in China  ap. 279-294.  aOver the last three decades, rapid industrialization in China has generated an unprecedentedly high level of air pollution and associated health problems. Given that China accounts for one-fifth of the world population and suffers from severe air pollution, a comprehensive review of the indicators accounting for the health costs in relation to air pollution will benefit evidence-based and health-related environmental policy-making. This paper reviews the conventional static and the new dynamic approach adopted for air pollution-related health cost accounting in China and analyzes the difference between the two in estimating GDP loss. The advantages of adopting the dynamic approach for health cost accounting in China, with conditions guaranteeing its optimal performance are highlighted. Guidelines on how one can identify an appropriate approach for health cost accounting in China are put forward. Further, we outline and compare the globally-applicable and China-specific indicators adopted by different accounting methodologies, with their pros and cons being discussed. A comprehensive account of the available databases and methodologies for health cost accounting in China are outlined. Future directions to guide health cost accounting in China are provided.Our work provides valuable insights into future health cost accounting research in China. Our study has strengthen the view that the dynamic approach is comparatively more preferred than the static approach for health cost accounting in China, if more data is available to train the dynamic models and improve the robustness of the parameters employed. In addition, future dynamic model should address the socio-economic impacts, including benefits or losses of air pollution polices, to provide a more robust policy picture. Our work has laid the key principles and guidelines for selecting proper econometric approaches and parameters. We have also identified a proper estimation method for the Value of Life in China, and proposed the integration of engineering approaches, such as the use of deep learning and big data analysis for health cost accounting at the fine-grained level (city-district or sub-regional level). Our work has also identified the gap for more accurate health cost accounting at the fine-grained level in China, which will subsequently affect the quality of health-related air pollution policy decision-making at such levels, and the health-related quality of life of the citizens in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccounting 3aair 3aair pollution 3adatabases 3adecision making 3adynamic models 3aeconometrics 3aengineering 3aguidelines 3aindustrialization 3aissues and policy 3aquality of life 3asocioeconomics 3aChina 0aHealth cost accounting 0aDynamic accounting 0aStatic accounting 0aAir pollution 0aSub-regional and city-district-level 0aChina1 aLam, Jacqueline C.K.1 aLi, Victor O.K.0 tEnvironment international.g2018 Nov., v. 120 p.279-294dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2018.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001100162245019800173300001800371520181200389592002802201650001302229650001902242650001002261650001702271650002002288650001302308650001102321650001502332650003502347650001102382650001202393650001802405650002102423650001102444650002002455650001102475650001302486650000902499650002002508650003602528650003402564650003102598650002302629700001902652700001102671700002202682700001702704700001502721773009902736856007702835852000902912655001202921IND60083415420221120154937.0141101e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008341542DNAL7 a228184802pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2012-53792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, G.10aComparison of genomic predictions using medium-density (∼54,000) and high-density (∼777,000) single nucleotide polymorphism marker panels in Nordic Holstein and Red Dairy Cattle populations  ap. 4657-4665.  aThis study investigated genomic prediction using medium-density (∼54,000; 54K) and high-density marker panels (∼777,000; 777K), based on data from Nordic Holstein and Red Dairy Cattle (RDC). The Holstein data comprised 4,539 progeny-tested bulls, and the RDC data 4,403 progeny-tested bulls. The data were divided into reference data and test data using October 1, 2001, as a cut-off date (birth date of the bulls). This resulted in about 25% genotyped bulls in the Holstein test data and 20% in the RDC test data. For each breed, 3 data sets of markers were used to predict breeding values: (1) 54K data set with missing genotypes, (2) 54K data set where missing genotypes were imputed, and (3) imputed high-density (HD) marker data set created by imputing the 54K data to the HD data based on 557 bulls genotyped using a 777K single nucleotide polymorphism chip in Holstein, and 706 bulls in RDC. Based on the 3 marker data sets, direct genomic breeding values (DGV) for protein, fertility, and udder health were predicted using a genomic BLUP model (GBLUP) and a Bayesian mixture model with 2 normal distributions. Reliability of DGV was measured as squared correlations between deregressed proofs (DRP) and DGV corrected for reliability of DRP. Unbiasedness was assessed by regression of DRP on DGV, based on the bulls in the test data sets. Averaged over the 3 traits, reliability of DGV based on the HD markers was 0.5% higher than that based on the 54K data in Holstein, and 1.0% higher than that in RDC. In addition, the HD markers led to an improvement of unbiasedness of DGV. The Bayesian mixture model led to 0.5% higher reliability than the GBLUP model in Holstein, but not in RDC. Imputing missing genotypes in the 54K marker data did not improve genomic predictions for most of the traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3abreeding value 3abulls 3adairy cattle 3adata collection 3agenotype 3amodels 3aprediction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3audders 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aCattlexgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenome 2aGenotype 2aMale 2aModels, Genetic 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSelection, Genetic1 aBrøndum, R.F.1 aMa, P.1 aGuldbrandtsen, B.1 aAamand, G.P.1 aLund, M.S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Aug., v. 95, no. 8 p.4657-4665dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-53793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245017700169520123700346592002801583650001501611650001201626650002101638650002201659650001801681650002101699650001001720650001301730650001301743650001101756650001801767650001901785650001001804650001401814650001101828650002101839650001501860653001601875653002801891653003301919653001501952700002301967773012201990856008102112852000902193655001202202IND60713043220221119030038.0211030e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071304322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1102382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaisuk, Phannipha10aRecovery of γ-oryzanol from rice bran oil soapstock derived calcium soap: Consideration of Hansen solubility parameters and preferential extractability in various solvents  aThis study aimed to develop an effective procedure for the recovery of γ-oryzanol through calcium (Ca)-induced precipitation of rice bran oil soapstock (RBOS), a by-product of the RBO industry. The most suitable pretreatment condition was found to be saponification with sodium hydroxide at 2× the saponification value, 90 °C for 40 min, providing 100% and 63.5% conversion of triglycerides and free fatty acids, respectively, and a 79.4% γ-oryzanol yield. Addition of calcium chloride (CaCl₂) solution at 0.3 g CaCl₂:1 g of sodium soap (Na-FA) effectively induced the precipitation of γ-oryzanol-containing calcium soap (Ca-FA). Based on experimental solubility measurements, theoretical Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs), and a preferential extractability study, the most suitable extraction solvents were suggested to be ethyl acetate and furfural. Ethyl acetate gave a γ-oryzanol selective extractability and recovery of 55.4% and 59.3%, respectively, whilst those for furfural were 55.3% and 62.8%, respectively. In addition to obtaining a high γ-oryzanol yield in a relatively simple and energy efficient process, Ca-FA residue, a high price animal feed supplement, was also obtained by this proposed process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3aenergy efficiency 3aethyl acetate 3afeed supplements 3afeeds 3afurfural 3aindustry 3aprices 3arice bran oil 3asaponification 3asoaps 3asoapstock 3asodium 3asodium hydroxide 3asolubility 0aγ-Oryzanol 0aRice bran oil soapstock 0aHansen solubility parameters 0aExtraction1 aShotipruk, Artiwan0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Dec., v. 134 p.110238-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1102383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04534naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245017800209520232900387592002802716650001602744650002702760650001902787650001102806650002102817650001902838650002002857650001902877650001902896650000902915650002602924650001502950650002402965653001002989653001002999653000703009653000703016653000803023653000703031653000903038653000903047653001303056653000903069653000803078653000903086653000703095653001003102653000803112653000803120653001103128653001503139653002703154653002703181653002803208653002903236653002803265700001903293700001903312700002203331700006003353700001503413700001903428700001903447700002003466700002203486700001703508700001803525773012703543856008503670852000903755655001203764IND60746589620221118233915.0210904e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074658962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2021.1103062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Hecke, Lore1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8393-385510aRepeated intra-articular administration of equine allogeneic peripheral blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells does not induce a cellular and humoral immune response in horses  aThe use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for the treatment of equine joint disease is widely investigated because of their regenerative and immunomodulatory potential. Allogeneic MSCs provide a promising alternative to autologous MSCs, since the former are immediately available and enable a thorough donor screening. However, questions have been raised concerning the immunogenic potential of allogeneic MSCs, especially after repeated administration.Current retrospective study assessed the cellular and humoral immunogenicity of ten jumping and dressage horses with naturally occurring degenerative joint disease which were treated 3 times intra-articularly with a 1 mL stem cell suspension containing 1.4–2.5 million chondrogenic induced equine allogeneic peripheral blood-derived MSCs (ciMSCs) combined with 1 mL equine allogeneic plasma. Stem cells from 2 donor horses were used. Horses were clinically evaluated for joint effusion, presence of pain to palpation and skin surface temperature at the local injection site, joint range of motion, occurrence of adverse events and the presence of ectopic tissue. The cellular immune response was analyzed using a modified mixed lymphocyte reaction and the humoral immune response was investigated using a flow cytometric crossmatch assay by which the presence of alloantibodies against the ciMSCs was evaluated. Presence of anti-bovine serum albumin antibodies was detected via ELISA.Clinical evaluation of the horses revealed no serious adverse effects or suspected adverse drug reactions and no ectopic tissue formation at the local injection site or in other areas of the body. Generally, repeated administration led to a decrease of horses with joint effusion of the affected joint. Pain to palpation, skin surface temperature and joint range of motion did not increase or even decreased after treatment administration.Allogeneic ciMSCs did not induce a cellular immune response and no alloantibodies were detected in the recipients’ serum, regardless the presence of BSA antibodies in 70 % of the horses.Repeated intra-articular injections with allogeneic equine ciMSCs did not elicit clinically relevant adverse events. Furthermore, current study indicates the absence of a cellular or a humoral immune response following repeated intra-articular injections.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acell-mediated immunity 3aflow cytometry 3ahorses 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmunogenicity 3aimmunopathology 3ainjection site 3aosteoarthritis 3apain 3aretrospective studies 3astem cells 3asurface temperature 0a7-AAD 0aAB/AM 0aAT 0aBM 0aBSA 0aCD 0aCFSE 0aConA 0aciMSC(s) 0aEDTA 0aFBS 0aHBSS 0aPB 0aPBMCs 0aMHC 0aMLR 0aMSC(s) 0aAllogeneic 0aMesenchymal stem cells 0aChondrogenic induction 0aRepeated administration 0aCellular immune response 0aHumoral immune response1 aMagri, Carmelo1 aDuchateau, Luc1 aBeerts, Charlotte1 aGeburek, Florian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3161-90551 aSuls, Marc1 aDa Dalt, Laura1 aPatruno, Marco1 aSaunders, Jimmy1 aBroeckx, Sarah Y.1 aDepuydt, Eva1 aSpaas, Jan H.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2021 Sept., v. 239 p.110306-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2021.1103063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013500160300002000295520131800315592002801633650002401661650002001685650001601705650001301721650002101734650001901755650001101774650001301785650001601798650003201814700001401846700001501860700001601875700001601891773012401907856007402031852000902105655001202114IND60667577420221119222608.0190919e20150608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066757742DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra06409k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Miaoming10aSuperior shape memory properties and microstructure evolution of poly(ether-b-amide12) elastomer enhanced by poly(ε-caprolactone)  ap. 50628-50637.  aIn this work, the superior shape memory properties and microstructure evolution of poly(ether-b-amide12) (PEBA) enhanced by poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) were investigated. The PEBA/PCL blends were prepared by the methods of solution mixing and compression molding. The representative phase-separated morphologies were observed by optical microscopy (OM). The recovery stress and shape memory properties of the samples were determined by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). It was found that high loadings of PCL (up to 35 wt%) only marginally worsened the recovery properties of the blends. However, the values of maximum recovery stresses increased greatly with PCL content in spite of deformation temperature, indicating an enhancement effect of PCL on the recovery stress of polymer blends. Moreover, in situ wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) investigation revealed the microstructure evolution during the shape memory process. It was notable that during the stretching process, the strain-induced crystallization of soft segments (PTMO) of PEBA shifted to lower strain due to the existence of the PCL phase. The present results provided a reference that the recovery stress could be greatly increased by adding another polymer to the shape memory polymer, which is vital to application in the biomedical field.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompression molding 3acrystallization 3adeformation 3alactones 3alight microscopy 3amicrostructure 3amixing 3apolymers 3atemperature 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aDong, Xia1 aWang, Lili1 aGao, Yunyun1 aWang, Dujin0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 08, v. 5, no. 62 p.50628-50637dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra06409k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03807naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245013300167300001600300520197900316592002802295650001302323650001302336650001202349650002702361650001202388650001102400650001302411650001102424650001102435650001402446650003002460650001302490650000902503650001002512650001402522650001502536650001402551650001102565650001502576650001402591650001902605650001502624650001302639650001302652650000902665651001002674651001002684651001502694653001902709653001802728653002102746653002602767653003302793700001702826700001902843700001802862700002002880700001702900773011902917856008803036852000903124655001203133IND60649458420221116222925.0200217e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064945842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.4552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Ting10aAtmospheric deposition and contamination of trace elements in snowpacks of mountain glaciers in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau  ap. 754-764.  aTo investigate the large-scale trace element deposition and anthropogenic pollution in mountain glaciers of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) and its surrounding regions, we analyzed Al and 13 trace elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, V, and Zn) in glacier snowpacks collected at the Yuzhufeng, Laohugou No.12, and Qiyi glaciers (YG, LG12, and QG, respectively) in the northeastern TP as well as in the Miaoergou Glacier (MG) in the eastern Tianshan Mountains in June 2017. The concentrations and enrichment factors (EFs) of most trace elements (e.g., As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Sb) showed that the largest value appeared in the MG, followed by LG12, and the lowest value appeared in the QG, thereby implying a decreasing influence of anthropogenic emissions on these elements from the west (MG) to the east (QG). The YG inversely exhibited high concentrations but low EFs for As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Pb, and Sb. Compared to the surrounding regions of the southern and western TP (e.g., NamCo, Mt. Everest, and Pamirs), Japan, and Kathmandu, the trace element concentrations were relatively higher at the YG and MG but relatively lower at the LG12 and QG. The spatial distribution characteristics of trace elements (e.g., Pb and Sb) exhibited a gradually decreasing concentration from west to east in the Tianshan Mountains, and from south to north in the TP, implying two potential transport routes of atmospheric pollutants from Central and South Asia to the northeastern TP. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) backward trajectory model and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations/Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIPSO/CALIOP) data reflected that these trace elements in the MG, LG12, and QG predominately originated from the western and surrounding areas, whereas in the YG they were mainly derived from a local source and South Asia through long-distance transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3aatmospheric deposition 3acadmium 3acesium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aemissions 3afate and transport models 3aglaciers 3alead 3alidar 3amanganese 3amolybdenum 3amountains 3anickel 3apollutants 3apollution 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asnowpack 3avanadium 3azinc 3aChina 3aJapan 3aSouth Asia 0aTrace elements 0aContamination 0aGlacier snowpack 0aAnthropogenic sources 0aNortheastern Tibetan plateau1 aDong, Zhiwen1 aKang, Shichang1 aZong, Chunlei1 aRostami, Masoud1 aShao, Yaping0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 689 p.754-764dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.4553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03540naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245015100204520180000355592002802155650001502183650001502198650001302213650001102226650001002237650001002247650001302257650001702270650001302287650002202300650001002322650002902332650001502361651001002376653001102386653002702397653003602424653001302460653003202473700001602505700001402521700001902535700001502554700001802569700001602587700002102603700001602624700001202640700001602652700001502668700001602683700005302699773010402752856008502856852000902941655001202950IND60782692020221116222121.0221004e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078269202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1138112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1587-404810aInvestigation of exposure biomarkers in human plasma following differing levels of tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines and nicotine in cigarette smoke  aTobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNAs) are strong carcinogens widely found in tobacco products, environmental tobacco smoke, lake, and wastewater. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of cigarette smoke with different yields of TSNAs (NNK, NNN, NAT, NAB) and nicotine on the levels of biomarkers of exposure in smokers’ plasma. Three hundred healthy volunteers were recruited comprising 60 smokers of each of 3 mg, 8 mg and 10 mg ISO tar yield cigarettes and 60 smokers who smoked 10 mg, 8 mg, and 3 mg for 14 days sequentially and 60 non-smokers. All study participants were male, aged from 21 to 45 years old, and were recruited from a same unit in Hebei, China. We measured the levels of NNAL, NAT, NNN, NAB and cotinine in plasma from 240 smokers and 60 non-smokers using a novel method established by online two-dimensional solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that NNAL, NAT, NNN, NAB and cotinine in the plasma of smokers smoking cigarette with low TSNAs and nicotine were lower than that with high TSNAs and nicotine. When smokers switched from higher to lower TSNA yields of cigarettes, their plasma NNAL, NAT, NNN, NAB levels significantly decreased. The plasma concentrations of NNAL were significantly correlated with those of cotinine, NNN, NAT and NAB for smokers (p < 0.001). Similarly, the plasma concentrations of cotinine were significantly correlated with those of NNN, NAT and NAB for smokers (p < 0.001). The plasma NNAL, NAT, NNN, NAB and cotinine levels for smokers were significantly higher than those for non-smokers. These findings suggested that the total NNAL, NNN, NAT, NAB and cotinine in plasma were valid and reliable biomarkers for human exposure to TSNAs and nicotine.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acigarettes 3acotinine 3ahumans 3alakes 3amales 3anicotine 3anitrosamines 3aresearch 3asecond hand smoke 3asmoke 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awastewater 3aChina 0aPlasma 0aBiomarkers of exposure 0aTobacco-specific N-Nitrosamines 0aCotinine 0aEnvironmental tobacco smoke1 aLiu, Xingyu1 aShi, Bing1 aYang, Zhendong1 aLuo, Yanbo1 aXu, Tongguang1 aLiu, Deshui1 aJiang, Chengyong1 aDu, Guorong1 aLu, Nan1 aZhang, Chen1 aMa, Yanjun1 aBai, Ruoshi1 aZhou, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7197-15040 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Nov., v. 214 p.113811-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1138113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002300158245013000181300001600311520144900327592002801776650002001804650001901824650001101843650001301854650001201867650001001879650001301889650001701902650000901919650001401928650001501942650002401957650002801981650001502009650002802024650002302052650001302075650002002088650002502108650001302133650003502146650002002181650001402201650002702215650003902242650002802281650002202309700002102331700001702352700002102369700002202390700002202412700002002434700002602454773009102480856007302571852000902644655001202653IND50089984620221118145606.0150206e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008998462DNAL7 a246843192pmid7 a10.1111/nph.127862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorge, Timothy S.10aUnderstanding the genetic control and physiological traits associated with rhizosheath production by barley (Hordeum vulgare)  ap. 195-205.  aThere is an urgent need for simple rapid screens of root traits that improve the acquisition of nutrients and water. Temperate cereals produce rhizosheaths of variable weight, a trait first noted on desert species sampled by Tansley over 100 yr ago. This trait is almost certainly important in tolerance to abiotic stress. Here, we screened association genetics populations of barley for rhizosheath weight and derived quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and candidate genes. We assessed whether rhizosheath weight was correlated with plant performance and phosphate uptake under combined drought and phosphorus deficiency. Rhizosheath weight was investigated in relation to root hair length, and under both laboratory and field conditions. Our data demonstrated that rhizosheath weight was correlated with phosphate uptake under dry conditions and that the differences in rhizosheath weight between genotypes were maintained in the field. Rhizosheath weight also varied significantly within barley populations, was correlated with root hair length and was associated with a genetic locus (QTL) on chromosome 2H. Putative candidate genes were identified. Rhizosheath weight is easy and rapid to measure, and is associated with relatively high heritability. The breeding of cereal genotypes for beneficial rhizosheath characteristics is achievable and could contribute to agricultural sustainability in nutrient‐ and water‐stressed environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aabiotic stress 3abarley 3abreeding 3adrought 3agenes 3agenotype 3aheritability 3aloci 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3apopulation genetics 3aquantitative trait loci 3aroot hairs 3asustainable agriculture 2aChromosome Mapping 2aDroughts 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenotype 2aHordeumxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aModels, Genetic 2aPhenotype 2aPhosphorusxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aWaterxphysiology1 aBrown, Lawrie K.1 aRamsay, Luke1 aWhite, Philip J.1 aNewton, Adrian C.1 aBengough, A.

The effectiveness of monitoring techniques for stock assessment varies with sea conditions. In dynamic marine environments with high turbidity, such as those found in estuaries, mangroves, coastal straits, fjords, and bays, traditional assessment methods include the use of destructive techniques such as trawling. Hydroacoustic sampling techniques overcome such restrictions, equipment such as echosounders have commonly been used for biodiversity assessments including fish community structure, biomass, behaviour, and dynamics studies. However, hydroacoustic methods have been shown to be less reliable for species identification.The high frequency Adaptive Resolution Imaging Sonar (ARIS) is widely used for underwater object detection and imaging. Our study investigated the suitability of ARIS 3000 for the species identification of North-East Atlantic marine species using experimental aquarium studies, field surveys and multi investigator assessments. Aquaria results showed that 82 % of species were detected by observers, of which five were identified correctly identified consistently. The remaining four species were identified correctly <67 % of the time. During field surveys, a 150 % higher confidence in identification was given to more morphologically distinct groups such as elasmobranchs.Whilst our results highlight the suitability of the ARIS for accurate and repeatable identification of some of the model species used in this study, we have also shown that factors such as size and morphological traits limit the accuracy of identification for all species. We suggest that monitoring techniques combine the use of ARIS sonars alongside other sampling tools for assessing motile faunal communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3afauna 3afish communities 3ahydroacoustics 3amarine fish 3aresearch 3asonar 3aspecies identification 3aturbidity 0aAcoustic cameras 0aARIS 3000 0aEnvironmental management 0aFish identification 0aBiodiversity assessments1 aGriffin, Ross A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5430-55021 aUnsworth, Richard K.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0036-97240 tFisheries research.g2021 Nov., v. 243 p.106092-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2021.1060923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245009900206300002000305500001900325520148100344592002801825650002201853650002201875650002401897650001501921650002801936650002101964650001401985650001301999650002402012650002302036650001902059700002302078700001802101700001902119700001902138700001702157700002702174700001702201700002402218773013802242856008002380852000902460655001202469IND60741768620221120170610.0210618e20210609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074176862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c033262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, Kazu-hiro,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1085-409610aElectrochemical, Thermal, and Structural Features of BaF₂–SnF₂ Fluoride-Ion Electrolytes  ap. 12568-12577.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFluoride-ion-conducting compounds are key materials for solid electrolytes in all-solid-state fluoride shuttle batteries (FSBs) and widely regarded as promising rechargeable batteries. However, their ionic conductivities are still insufficient to allow room-temperature operation. Particularly, the transportation of F ions through solid-state ionic devices is yet to be fully understood. We studied the electrochemical, thermal, and structural features of BaF₂–SnF₂ solid electrolytes by means of AC impedance, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction experiments. The substitution of Ba by Sn atoms increased the electrical conductivity of BaF₂–SnF₂ to 10⁷–10⁹ times that of BaF₂; particularly, (BaF₂)₀.₄₇(SnF₂)₀.₅₃ exhibited the highest electrical conductivity (σ = 4.1 × 10–³ S/cm at room temperature) with the lowest activation energy (Eₐ = 17.9 kJ/mol). Structural analysis revealed that (BaF₂)₀.₄₇(SnF₂)₀.₅₃ consists of a tetragonal structure (T-phase) and residual amounts of the cubic structure (C-phase). The T-phase could be refined on the basis of a [−SnSnMMSnSn−]-layered structure (M = BaₓSn₁–ₓ) with three nonequivalent fluorine sites: F1, F2, and F3. The anisotropic displacement of F3 was more pronounced toward F1; thus, the “–F1–F3–F1–” zigzag network between the M and Sn layers plays a key role in two-dimensional fast F-ion diffusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivation energy 3aambient temperature 3aanisotropy 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3afluorides 3afluorine 3aneutron diffraction 3aphysical chemistry 3atransportation1 aMineshige, Atsushi1 aEmoto, Takuro1 aSugiura, Maiko1 aSaito, Takashi1 aNamba, Kaoru1 aŌtomo, T.q(Toshiya),1 aAbe, Takeshi1 aFukunaga, Toshiharu0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 June 09, v. 125, no. 23 p.12568-12577dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c033263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245009600163500001900259520115600278592002801434650001601462650001101478650002101489650002201510651001001532653002601542653002701568653003001595653002301625653002401648653002801672700001501700700001401715700001201729700001301741773009001754856008501844852000901929655001201938IND60696280220221119124007.0201104e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069628022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1178022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Long10aImpact of different improvement measures on the thermal performance of ultra-thin envelopes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs a type of ultra-thin material, the general application value of tent is found in Southwest China after an earthquake, but the relevant improvement measures and in-depth studies are relatively less in this area. Therefore, according to the analysis of the thermal equilibrium model, three different comparative experiments using active and passive methods, PV driven ventilation, PCM and Retroreflective material, were selected to improve the indoor environment. Furthermore, the PCM combined with night ventilation was also considered in order to explore the integrated approach for improving the thermal environment of the tent. The field test and analysis of PCM were carried out throughout the year, and the application of PCM with ultrathin envelope is comprehensively analyzed. A simulation model of a tent was set up and validated by the test results. The simulation results showed that the energy saving rate is phase change material > ventilation > retro-reflective material. Through the simulation of buildings using phase change materials in five cities, it was found that the energy saving ratio is the best in Kunming at around 80%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aearthquakes 3aenergy 3aphase transition 3asimulation models 3aChina 0aPhase change material 0aPV powered Ventilation 0aRetro-reflective material 0aUltrathin envelope 0aThermal environment 0aEnergy saving potential1 aZhang, Wei1 aWang, Wei1 aGao, Bo1 aChen, Mo0 tEnergy.g2020 July 15, v. 203 p.117802-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1178023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03642naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013100170300001600301520182800317592002802145650002302173650001302196650001202209650002002221650002102241650002602262650003702288650001302325650001902338650001302357650000902370650001402379650001802393650001602411650002102427650001802448650002802466650001402494650002102508650001902529650001102548650002102559650001802580650003702598650001502635651001302650653002002663653001402683653001102697653003502708653001302743653001502756700001602771700002202787700001502809773008602824856008502910852000902995655001203004IND60629961320221120142829.0190403e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062996132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2019.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArenas-Lago, D.10aIs nanoremediation an effective tool to reduce the bioavailable As, Pb and Sb contents in mine soils from Iberian Pyrite Belt?  ap. 362-371.  aSão Domingos mine is one of the most important abandoned mines in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) (SE, Portugal), which has large amounts of waste deposited in tailings. Weathering causes sulphide oxidation, acid mine drainage, leaching of high levels of potentially hazardous elements (PHEs) and, consequently, environmental degradation in surrounding areas.The use of nanoparticles (NPs) to recover contaminated soils from IPB can be an effective tool compared to the use of traditional amendments, due to small size, high specific surface and reactivity of NPs. The combination of nanoremediation techniques, together with the current phytoremediation techniques carried out in the IPB, could improve the immobilisation and decrease the availability of PHEs in these soils.In this research was assessed whether the use of hydroxyapatite (HANPs), hematite (HMNPs) and maghemite (MNPs) nanoparticles are effective for recovery degraded soils. Extractable contents of As, Pb and Sb were determined in soils treated (with NPs) and non-treated. Three different extractants based on CaCl2 (0.01 M), low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOA - 10 mM) and ultrapure water (UPW) were used. Extractable contents of Pb, As and Sb in the soil samples treated with NPs decreased; and HANPs were those that most bioavailable Pb retained. In addition, the NPs were characterised in shape, size and elemental composition before and after being applied to the soil samples using High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (HR-TEM/EDS). After treatment, the NPs associated to As, Pb and Sb were identified in the mine soils. The great decrease of PHEs bioavailability was possible due to the association of PHEs with the NPs, which reduce considerably the mobility of PHEs in mine soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3abioavailability 3acalcium chloride 3aelemental composition 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahematite 3ahydroxyapatite 3aleaching 3alead 3amaghemite 3amine tailings 3amined soils 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3aorganic acids and salts 3aoxidation 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3apyrite 3asoil degradation 3asoil sampling 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aweathering 3aPortugal 0aNanoremediation 0aPollution 0aMining 0aPotentially hazardous elements 0aMobility 0aHR-TEM/EDS1 aAbreu, M.M.1 aAndrade Couce, L.1 aVega, F.A.0 tCatena.g2019 May, v. 176 p.362-371dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.01.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009000175500001900265520149400284592002801778650003401806650001901840650001701859650001901876650001501895650001801910653001501928653002001943653001701963653002201980653001902002773009002021856008502111852000902196655001202205IND60696280320221119124013.0201104e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069628032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1178072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuld Moussa, Mohamed10aExperimental and numerical performances analysis of a small three blades wind turbine  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe current paper investigates the evolution of the power coefficient of a horizontal axis 3-blades wind turbine with respect of the tip speed ratio. The latter combines the effects respectively of the wind speed and the turbine rotation speed. Indeed, out-door experimental measurements and computational fluid dynamics based models are carried out in order to predict the power coefficient in a wind speed range of [2,6]m.s−1. Generated electrical power is then deduced from the measured current and voltage accounting for losses through cables and inverters efficiency. Regarding the modeling work, the shear stress transport turbulence model is implemented in association with the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes equations and their unsteady version through two different three dimensional computational fluid dynamics methods. According to both the experiment and numerical results, a maximum power coefficient of 0.24 is reached at a tip speed ratio of about 5.39. In addition, numerical results show that the turbulence intensity dramatically increases with respect of the tip speed ratio. Accordingly, the induced pressure discontinuities through the turbine rotor are more influenced by the rotation speed than the tip speed ratio. Moreover, emperical and numerical models of the evolution of the power coefficient with respect of the tip speed ratio are respectively confronted with the experimental results showing a good agreement with an estimated maximum error of about 5%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectric power 3ashear stress 3aturbulent flow 3awind speed 3awind turbines 0ak-ω Model 0aTip speed ratio 0aWind turbine 0aPower coefficient 0aRANS equations0 tEnergy.g2020 July 15, v. 203 p.117807-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1178073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014100168300001400309520124900323592002801572650001901600650001301619650002201632650001501654650001001669650001001679650001201689650001601701650001301717650001301730650001301743650001501756650001401771650001701785650001401802650001901816650001101835650001301846650001501859650002201874650001201896650001501908650001901923650001301942650001401955651001101969653001901980653003701999653001902036653001202055653001302067700002702080700002402107773009502131856008402226852000902310655001202319IND60584930820221119213651.0200517e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058493082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cliser.2017.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDwire, K.

The effects of climate change on these special habitats may be especially profound, due to altered snowpack and hydrologic regimes predicted to occur in the near future. The functionality of many riparian areas is currently compromised by water diversions and livestock grazing, which reduces their resilience to additional stresses that a warmer climate may bring. Areas associated with springs and small streams will probably experience near-term changes, and some riparian areas and wetlands may decrease in size over time. A warmer climate and reduced soil moisture could lead to a transition from riparian hardwood species to more drought tolerant conifers and shrubs. Increased frequency and spatial extent of wildfire spreading from upland forests could also affect riparian species composition. The specific effects of climate change will vary, depending on local hydrology (especially groundwater), topography, streamside microclimates, and current conditions and land use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aconifers 3adrought tolerance 3aecosystems 3afauna 3aflora 3agrazing 3agroundwater 3ahabitats 3ahardwood 3aland use 3alandscapes 3alivestock 3amicroclimate 3amountains 3ariparian areas 3ashrubs 3asnowpack 3asoil water 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 3atopography 3aupland forests 3awetlands 3awildfires 3aOregon 0aClimate change 0aGroundwater-dependent ecosystems 0aRiparian areas 0aSprings 0aWetlands1 aMellmann-Brown, Sabine1 aGurrieri, Joseph T.0 tClimate services.g2018 Apr., v. 10 p.44-52dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23241x2405-88077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cliser.2017.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008500167300001400252520186100266592002802127650002602155650002402181650002302205650001402228650001502242650001402257650000902271650001902280650001102299650001902310650001402329650001902343650000902362650002402371650001202395650001902407651001002426653002602436653002002462653001902482653001902501700001502520700001202535700001602547700001402563700001602577773008502593856008502678852000902763655001202772IND60629961420221120122657.0190403e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062996142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2019.01.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Miaoying10aKINEROS2-based simulation of total nitrogen loss on slopes under rainfall events  ap. 13-21.  aSoil, water and nutrient losses are major causes of environmental pollution, with runoff accompanied by nutrient transport and sediment loss. The existing runoff and erosion models focus on estimating the total amount of pollutants in the long term. There are few studies on the process of nutrient transport during individual rainfall events, and there are still some shortcomings in the mathematical models that describe the nutrient transport process on slopes with consideration of both the dissolved and adsorbed solute in the runoff. In this study, a mathematical model was constructed for describing the nutrient transport process during individual rainfall events by combining a dissolved solute transport model and an adsorbed solute transport model. After adding the nutrient model to the runoff and erosion model KINEROS2, the runoff, sediment yield, and total nitrogen loss on slopes during individual rainfall events were simulated, and the simulation results were verified using a field experiment with different rainfall intensities and different slope lengths. The results showed that the behaviour of the total nitrogen loss was consistent with the runoff and the sediment yield. The values all first increased and then gradually stabilized, and the time to reach steady state was shortened with the increase in rainfall intensity. The runoff and sediment yield simulated by KINEROS2 were consistent with the measured data, indicating that KINEROS2 could successfully simulate the processes of runoff and erosion in runoff plots (NSE > 0.22; R2 > 0.35). Likewise, the amount of total nitrogen loss at different time points was simulated well (NSE > 0.36; R2 > 0.54). Therefore, KINEROS2 shows potential for simulating nutrients and has good applicability on the runoff plot scale in the arid and semi-arid regions of China.  aPublisher supplied data 3afield experimentation 3amathematical models 3anutrient transport 3anutrients 3apollutants 3apollution 3arain 3arain intensity 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asediments 3asemiarid zones 3asoil 3asoil erosion models 3asolutes 3atotal nitrogen 3aChina 0aNutrient loss process 0aRainfall events 0aKINEROS2 model 0aTotal nitrogen1 aHan, Yuguo1 aXu, Lei1 aWang, Xiuru1 aAo, Chang1 aPang, Danbo0 tCatena.g2019 June, v. 177 p.13-21dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.01.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01445naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245004800166300001300214500001100227520048000238592002800718650002000746650001500766650001800781650001400799650002400813650001500837650001200852651001100864700003000875773011900905856007401024852000901098655001201107IND60786969320221119091411.0220807e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078696932DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.131862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLozano‐Vilano, M.

Firstly, vegetable (lettuce and potato) and soil samples were collected and arsenic concentrations measured to characterize the arsenic uptake in the selected crops. Secondly, a probabilistic exposure assessment was conducted to estimate the average daily intake (ADIveg), which was then evaluated against toxicological reference values by the calculation of hazard quotients (HQs) and cancer risks (CRs). The results show that elevated arsenic concentrations in residential garden soils are mirrored by elevated concentrations in vegetables, and that consumption of these vegetables alone may result in an unacceptable cancer risk; the calculated reasonable maximum exposure, for example, corresponded to a cancer incidence 20 times higher than the stated tolerance limit. However, the characterization of risk depends to a great extent on which toxicological reference value is used for comparison, as well as how the exposure is determined. Based on the assumptions made in the present study, the threshold levels for chronic non-carcinogenic or acute effects were not exceeded, but the cancer risks indicated highlight the need for further exposure studies, as dietary intake involves more than just homegrown vegetables and total exposure is a function of more than just one exposure pathway. In addition, glassworks sites – and contaminated sites in general – contain multiple contaminants, affecting the final and total risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3aneoplasms 3anormal values 3arisk characterization 3aarsenic 3ahome gardens 3alettuce 3aaverage daily intake 3aacute effects 3apotatoes 3asoil sampling 3aexposure pathways 3avegetable consumption 3ahorticultural soils 0aCancer risk 0aProbabilistic exposure assessment 0aHQ 0aRME 0aRfD 0aCTE 0aSF 0aBioconcentration factor 0aCDF 0aHazard quotient 0aADI 0aHealth risk assessment 0aBCF 0aArsenic 0aCR 0aHomegrown vegetables 0acrops1 aGunnarsson, Sara J.1 aHogmalm, K.

The data gathered on the sandbar consists of three mangrove species and one mangrove associate species, with one non-mangrove species, and were divided into three communities. In terms of the age distribution of the S. caseolaris–Aegiceras corniculatum community, the tree-phase densities for both species are lower than those exhibited by younger phases. In its succession, the seedlings of S. caseolaris and A. corniculatum are primarily recruited at the mean tide level (MWL) in the early stages. Then, A. corniculatum expands to the lower tide zone primarily on mud flat bare land. For both species, full irradiance on the bare land in the low tide zone below MWL is crucial for growth, but S. caseolaris, which propagates by releasing small seeds, can barely survive in the low tide zone because its seeds are easily flushed away. In contrast, A. corniculatum, which propagates using crypto-viviparous seedlings, has a higher survival rate in the low tide zone. As a result, the LH of seedlings of A. corniculatum distribution is significantly lower than that of the distribution of S. caseolaris trees (p < 0.05). It is important to provide appropriate environmental conditions for forest restoration in order to promote succession. The findings from the current study on population dynamics related to LH and tidal conditions are expected to be applied to platforms for S. caseolaris stands and mangrove restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSonneratia caseolaris 3aestuaries 3aforest restoration 3alandscapes 3alight intensity 3apopulation dynamics 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3asurvival rate 3aVietnam1 aTakahashi, Kazuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5770-74191 aNguyen, Hien Huu1 aNguyen, Ha Thi Thuy1 aNguyen, Thanh Thi Trang1 aMatsunami, Shirou0 tLandscape and ecological engineering.g2021 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.1-9dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl4237780x1860-18717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11355-020-00431-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02016naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245008500160300002000245520097300265592002801238650001501266650001301281650001101294650001901305650001601324700005701340700005501397773017301452856008001625852000901705655001201714IND60601949720221116180923.0180709e20171227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060194972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b039912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Tao10aLQG Benchmark Based Performance Assessment of IMC-PID Temperature Control System  ap. 15102-15111.  aThis paper focuses on the control system performance in industrial control processes and evaluates the controller performance using the assessment criterion based on linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG). The LQG performance benchmark curve is determined by the numerical calculation method, which avoids the calculation of the complex interaction matrix. This method depends on the model-based steady-state optimization technique and combines the LQG benchmark and the performance assessment of the control system. The control performance of the process system under different control strategies is described by establishing a series of the steady-state optimization problems. Compared with existing assessment algorithms, our method provides a simpler and more effective method to evaluate the performance of IMC-PID control system for both model match and model mismatch cases. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified by the experiments on a heating furnace.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3afurnaces 3amodels 3aprocess design 3atemperature1 aZhang, Ridong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4184-39551 aGao, Furong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5900-13530 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Dec. 27, v. 56, no. 51 p.15102-15111dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.7b039913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245004200168300001800210520123600228592002801464650001001492650001401502650002401516650001401540650002101554650002301575650003101598650001201629650002101641700002501662773011501687856008101802852000901883655001201892IND60120571720221122224637.0150208e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012057172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-012-1223-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFusco, Salvatore10aBrain response to calorie restriction  ap. 3157-3170.  aCalorie restriction extends longevity and delays ageing in model organisms and mammals, opposing the onset and progression of an array of age-related diseases. These beneficial effects also extend to the maintenance of brain cognitive functions at later age and to the prevention, at least in rodents, of brain senescence and associated neurodegenerative disorders. In recent years, the molecular mechanisms underlying brain response to calorie restriction have begun to be elucidated, revealing the unanticipated role of a number of key nutrient sensors and nutrient-triggered signaling cascades in the translation of metabolic cues into cellular and molecular events that ultimately lead to increased cell resistance to stress, enhanced synaptic plasticity, and improved cognitive performance. Of note, the brain’s role in CR also includes the activation of nutrient-sensitive hypothalamic circuitries and the implementation of neuroendocrine responses that impact the entire organism. The present review addresses emerging molecular themes in brain response to dietary restriction, and the implications of this knowledge for the understanding and the prevention of brain disorders associated with ageing and metabolic disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acognition 3adietary restriction 3alongevity 3alow calorie diet 3ametabolic diseases 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3arodents 3astress tolerance1 aPani, Giovambattista0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2013 Sept., v. 70, no. 17 p.3157-3170dSpringer-Verlagx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-012-1223-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245003400166300001400200520105600214592002801270650001401298650001801312650001101330650002001341650001501361650001501376650002001391650001401411653001101425653001501436653001301451700002301464700003001487700001801517700002001535773013501555856008001690852000901770655001201779IND60747544420221120093907.0210814e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074754442DNAL7 a10.1556/446.14.2018.s1.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemmer, Balázs10aSonicated membrane separation  ap. 89-99.  aMembrane separation processes are currently proven technologies in many areas. The main limitation of these processes is the accumulation of matter at the membrane surface which leads to two phenomena: concentration polarization and membrane fouling. According to the publications of numerous authors permeate flux could be increased by sonication. Our work focuses on separation of real broth by sonicated ultrafiltration. The broth was originated from hydrolysis of grounded corn-cob by xylanase enzyme. The filtration was carried out in a laboratory batch stirred cell with a sonication rod sonicator. In our work the effect of the stirring, the intensity of sonication and the membrane-transducer distance was studied on the efficiency of the ultrafiltration and on the quality of separated enzymes. Results reveal that xylanase enzyme can be effectively separated from real fermentation broth by ultrafiltration and enzymes keep their activity after the process. Enzyme activity tests show that low energy sonication is not harmful to the enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn cobs 3aculture media 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrolysis 3asonication 3aultrafiltration 3axylanases 0aenzyme 0aultrasound 0axylanase1 aKertész, Szabolcs1 aKeszthelyi-Szabó, Gábor1 aÖzel, Kerime1 aHodúr, Cecilia0 tProgress in agricultural engineering sciences.g2018 July, v. 14, no. s1 p.89-99dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:2221x1787-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/446.14.2018.s1.93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245006800211300001600279520164700295592002801942650001501970650002801985650002302013650001202036650001902048650001602067650001302083650001502096650000702111650002002118650002002138650001502158650002002173650001902193650002002212650001102232650001602243650001302259651001002272653001202282653002502294653002102319653001502340653001502355653000902370700005502379700001702434700001602451700001902467700001802486700001802504700001302522773010202535856008702637852000902724655001202733IND60545761220221119121354.0170719e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054576122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastracani, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8802-961410aBiochar–macrofauna interplay: Searching for new bioindicators  ap. 449-456.  aBiochar incorporation in agricultural soils has been proposed as a climate change mitigation strategy and has proved to substantially increase crop productivity via physical, chemical and biological mechanisms. The changes induced in soil properties are known to have a direct impact on soil ecosystem with consequences for soil biota community that, in turn, can influence biochar aging in soil. Despite several studies investigated in the interplay between biochar and soil microbiology, there is a clear lack of information on groups that live in the most superficial ground layers: soil meso and macro fauna. These groups are of great importance if we consider that biochar application should ideally be located in the soil's surface layer (0–30cm). Our study is the first attempt to investigate the interactions between biochar soil amendments and aboveground soil macro-meso fauna in a field crop. This was made setting-up a randomized-block experiment on a processing tomato crop in northern Italy, using three different biochar types and periodically monitoring soil parameters and fauna abundances along the crop growing cycle in summer 2013. Results show that the impact of biochar application on soil fauna as a whole is small when compared to that of agricultural management, suggesting that this amendment does not have short-term ecological interferences. Nevertheless, ants exhibited variations in abundances and distribution connected to properties of amended soils such as temperature, pH and humidity, proving that they can be effectively used as a target group in the study of interactions between biochar and soil biota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3aagricultural management 3aagricultural soils 3abiochar 3aclimate change 3afield crops 3ahumidity 3amonitoring 3apH 3asoil amendments 3asoil ecosystems 3asoil fauna 3asoil properties 3asoil treatment 3asoil weathering 3asummer 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3aItaly 0aBiochar 0aCarbon sequestration 0aField experiment 0aSoil fauna 0aArthropods 0aAnts1 aMaienza, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8424-76221 aGrasso, D.A.1 aGenesio, L.1 aMalcevschi, A.1 aMiglietta, F.1 aVaccari, F.P.1 aMori, A.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 536 p.449-456dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245010200212300001100314506007600325520174600401592002802147506003702175650001102212650001902223650001402242650001202256650001402268650001002282650000902292700001702301700002402318773010602342856008102448852000902529655001202538IND60572695720221207110827.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057269572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-017-1430-32doi7 aPMC53258332pmcid7 a282360752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchuster, Andrea C.10aRepeatability and consistency of individual behaviour in juvenile and adult Eurasian harvest mice  ap. 10.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aKnowledge on animal personality has provided new insights into evolutionary biology and animal ecology, as behavioural types have been shown to affect fitness. Animal personality is characterized by repeatable and consistent between-individual behavioural differences throughout time and across different situations. Behavioural repeatability within life history stages and consistency between life history stages should be checked for the independence of sex and age, as recent data have shown that males and females in some species may differ in the repeatability of behavioural traits, as well as in their consistency. We measured the repeatability and consistency of three behavioural and one cognitive traits in juvenile and adult Eurasian harvest mice (Micromys minutus). We found that exploration, activity and boldness were repeatable in juveniles and adults. Spatial recognition measured in a Y Maze was only repeatable in adult mice. Exploration, activity and boldness were consistent before and after maturation, as well as before and after first sexual contact. Data on spatial recognition provided little evidence for consistency. Further, we found some evidence for a litter effect on behaviours by comparing different linear mixed models. We concluded that harvest mice express animal personality traits as behaviours were repeatable across sexes and consistent across life history stages. The tested cognitive trait showed low repeatability and was less consistent across life history stages. Given the rising interest in individual variation in cognitive performance, and in its relationship to animal personality, we suggest that it is important to gather more data on the repeatability and consistency of cognitive traits.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aanimal ecology 3acognition 3afemales 3ajuveniles 3amales 3amice1 aCarl, Teresa1 aFoerster, Katharina0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2017 Apr., v. 104, no. 3-4 p.10-10dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-017-1430-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008800174300001600262520202100278592002802299650001802327650001102345650001502356650002702371650001102398650001202409650001202421650001502433650001202448650001802460650001102478650001502489650001202504650001402516650002502530650000902555650001702564700001802581773008902599856008502688852000902773655001202782IND60111845920221119075633.0150812e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011184592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaynor, Kaitlyn M.10aAntipredator and social monitoring functions of vigilance behaviour in blue monkeys  ap. 531-537.  aVigilance behaviour is often viewed as a predation avoidance strategy, but animals also use visual monitoring to detect conspecific threats. Studies of social vigilance often consider how group size or nearby conspecifics influence vigilance levels. Less is known about how more specific social variables, such as relative rank and kinship of a subject’s neighbours, affect vigilance of wild animals along with predation risk. To evaluate alternative functional hypotheses for vigilance behaviour, including predator detection and both extra- and within-group conspecific monitoring, we investigated how predation risk and social factors account for variation in vigilance in wild blue monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis, which show strong aggressive competition between groups and mild aggression within them. Studying 18 adult females in two groups, we measured time spent vigilant in 90s focal samples, recording the subject's activity, microhabitat conditions and identity of neighbours. We used data on dominance ranks and kinship to assess subject-specific social context for each sample. We compared generalized linear mixed models corresponding to each hypothesized function of vigilance, relating variation in vigilance to factors associated with a particular function. The best model related vigilance to predictor variables of all three functions, including recency of an antipredator event, height in canopy, position in forest (edge/interior), recency of an intergroup encounter, number of nearby kin, subject rank and presence of high-ranking neighbours. Overall, most variation in vigilance related to predation risk and between-group competition, while within-group social factors had smaller effects. The range of predictors suggests that vigilance behaviour serves multiple functions, including predator detection and both extragroup and intragroup conspecific monitoring. Species with different social systems might be expected to show different balances of factors that influence vigilance behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCercopithecus 3aadults 3aaggression 3aantipredatory behavior 3acanopy 3afemales 3aforests 3agroup size 3akinship 3amicrohabitats 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amonkeys 3apredation 3apsychosocial factors 3arisk 3awild animals1 aCords, Marina0 tAnimal behaviour.g2012 Sept., v. 84, no. 3 p.531-537dElsevier Ltdx0003-34727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04046naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013000171300001600301520247500317592002802792650001802820650001302838650001602851650001202867650001402879650002302893650002202916650002302938650001402961650002202975650002502997650003003022650001903052650002103071650001803092650002603110650001803136650002503154650001503179650001103194650002503205650001403230700002103244700002503265700002403290700002403314773012103338856004803459852000903507655001203516IND50062478820221122183648.0130322e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006247882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-012-0478-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavery, Nicholas P.10aLife cycle assessment of sponge nickel produced by gas atomisation for use in industrial hydrogenation catalysis applications  ap. 362-376.  aPURPOSE: This paper presents a cradle-to-grave comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of new gas atomised (GA) sponge nickel catalysts and evaluates their performance against the current cast and crush standard currently used in the industrial hydrogenation of butyraldehyde to butanol. METHODS: A comparative LCA has been made, accounting for the energy used and emissions throughout the entire life cycle of sponge nickel catalysts—ranging from the upstream production of materials (mainly aluminium and nickel), to the manufacturing, to the operation and finally to the recycling and disposal. The LCA was performed following ISO14040 principles where possible, and subsequently implemented in the software package GaBi 4.3. The CML2001 impact assessment methodology was used, with primary focus on comparing catalysts for equivalent greenhouse gasses generated over their lifetime and their relative global warming potential and secondary focus on acidification potential. This is justified as the lifetime is dominated by energy use in the operational phase, and acidification is dominated by the production of nickel for which existing ISO14040 collected data has been used. A sensitivity analysis was used to provide a number of scenarios and overall environmental performances of the various sponge nickels considered when compared to the existing industrial standard. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: It was found that the energy and emissions during the operation phase associated with a given catalyst significantly outweigh the primary production, manufacturing and recycling. Primary production of the nickel (and to a lesser extent molybdenum when used as a dopant) also has a significant environmental impact in terms of acidification potential, but this is offset by operational energy savings over the catalysts’ estimated lifetime and end of life recyclability. Finally, the impact of activity improvement and lifetime duration of sponge nickel catalysts was determined as both total life cycle energy for operational use and as a total life cycle global warming potential. CONCLUSIONS: From this assessment, the newly developed, higher activity spongy nickel catalysts produced by gas atomisation could have a significantly lower environmental impact than the current industry standard cast and crush method. Given the potential environmental benefits of such catalysts, applications in other processes that require a catalyst should also be investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aaluminum 3aatomization 3abutanol 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acomputer software 3aecosystem services 3aemissions 3aenergy accounting 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrogenation 3alife cycle assessment 3amanufacturing 3amaterials life cycle 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3aprimary productivity 3arecycling1 aJarvis, David J.1 aBrown, Stephen G.

However, the use of CVM is limited by its inherent methodological weaknesses. A critical concern is the existence of a large proportion of survey respondents providing zero willingness-to-pay (WTP) and that these responses are not amenable to economic theory — known as ‘protest’ responses. Censoring protest responses from further treatment is a common practice, which warrants reconsideration in light of our CVM survey results. The survey involved 800 residents requested to state their WTP for preserving the culturally significant stonewall trees in urban Hong Kong. About 28% of respondents returned a zero WTP. For all respondents the strength of protest beliefs was assessed, and the relationship between protest beliefs and WTP were examined. Our analysis produced contradictory results: some protest items varied negatively with WTP as expected, but other items increased with it. Respondents' stated positive WTP harbored latent protest beliefs which are related to non-economic preference. The findings stand at odds with the assumptions underlying the censoring treatment and raise questions about the validity of WTP estimates. These methodological implications should be taken into account in using CVM.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontingent valuation 3aeconomic theory 3aplanning 3asurveys 3atrees 3awillingness to pay 3aChina 0aContingent Valuation Method 0aProtest response 0aWillingness to pay 0aEnvironmental valuation 0aUrban trees 0aHong Kong1 aJim, C.Y.0 tEcological economics.g2015 June, v. 114 p.58-66dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03651naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245017400161300001100335500001900346520174900365592002802114596008902142596007302231596007302304596007502377650002402452650002102476650002202497650002302519650002202542650001702564650003202581650002002613650002202633650001302655651001002668651001702678700005502695700001502750700001602765700001402781700001502795700001402810700001602824700001702840700001702857700001402874773012902888856008303017852000903100655001203109IND60724703220221116202249.0210209e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072470322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-020-03188-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xi10aGenetic diversity analysis of intraspecific hybridization between Plumbago auriculata and Plumbago auriculata f. alba based on horticultural traits and molecular markers  ap. 31.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPlumbago auriculata Lam. is an ornamental plant native to South Africa and widely cultivated in China, but the cultivated plants are dominated by a single variety. The development of new varieties is of great commercial interest, and genetic diversity is the foundation of breeding programs. In this study, 85 progenies were obtained by crosses between Plumbago auriculata and Plumbago auriculata f. alba. The genetic diversity of these hybrids was evaluated using horticultural traits and ISSR and SRAP markers. Of the 25 horticultural traits evaluated, the largest variation was found in the beginning of the blooming period, and sepal length was the least variable trait. Correlation analysis showed that the wider the plant, the greater the number of inflorescences and the earlier the flowering. Seven factors explained 65.171% of the total variance; the first factor was leaf morphology, and the second factor was flower morphology. The genetic diversity of the 85 progenies was analyzed using seven pairs of SRAP primers and eight ISSR primers. The average number of effective alleles for 85 hybrids was 1.638, and the average Shannon index value was 0.507. The Nei genetic similarity coefficient indicated that the similarity between WLBS and WSBL was the highest, while that between BLWS and BSWL was the lowest. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that the main variation was within populations. Cluster analysis based on horticultural traits and molecular markers divided all progenies into seven and five groups, respectively, and there were obvious differences between the two clusters. In this study, we created intermediate materials for future breeding, taking the first step in the cross-breeding of P. auriculata.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0600105cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China  a2018JY0211cDepartment of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province  a2017N20008cDepartment of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province  a2016NYZ20038cDepartment of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province 3aPlumbago auriculata 3acluster analysis 3aflower morphology 3agenetic similarity 3agenetic variation 3ahorticulture 3aintraspecific hybridization 3aleaf morphology 3aornamental plants 3avariance 3aChina 3aSouth Africa1 aGao, Suping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4609-99881 aShen, Ping1 aLiu, Yingqi1 aLei, Ting1 aShi, Lisha1 aLi, Wenji1 aLi, Yurong,1 aYu, Xiaofang1 aYang, Lijuan1 aLi, Jiani0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2021 Feb., v. 43, no. 2 p.31-31dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl33879x0137-58817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-020-03188-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
